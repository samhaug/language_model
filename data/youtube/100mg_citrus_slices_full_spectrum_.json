{"dEMkzxg4y6c": "hi guys welcome back to my channel today are very fast recipe because I just realised the citrus so it's an orange and a lemon I tried them and I think she would say caramelized I hope it's the same kind of decoration I used in my lemon brownies and a few people asked me to show you how I made it and it's super easy super fast and everybody can do it and once you make one lemon and one orange will last a long time as long as you keep it away from humidity so it's perfect to decorate a cake dessert whatever or even just even like this it's so good and and when you bake it it makes your house smell amazing so I'm just gonna show you how I made it and I'll see you soon with the next recipe and one last thing as always if you like the video please leave a comment and I like this subscribe to my channel thank you guys for watching and enjoy bye we start making a simple syrup with a cup of water and a cup of sugar from now on I'm gonna write either cups or grams ingredients in the Box down below so everybody can follow my recipes so saying you put the water and the sugar in a pot and let it boil for a couple of minutes and then you turn it off in the meantime I'm gonna slice one orange and one lemon I'm gonna use a mandolin because it's much easier but you can do it with a knife I'm gonna choose a thickness which is 4 and 1/2 centimeters which in inches is 3/16 of inch I think but you obviously consider here in the video I'm gonna slice the lemon and orange the thickness that I choose I think it's perfect because it's not too thick but once you bake a is gonna be the perfect thickness you'll see it cuz once it's dry its gonna shrink a little bit once you cut all the orange and lemon I'm going to take a pan with parchment paper and take the syrup back they still warm it doesn't have to be cold and I'm gonna deep us laughs at a time and just put it on the pan as you see here in the video it's a very easy thing you don't have to be perfect doing it you just have to dip it and put on the paper I just do that for so I don't get burned because the syrup is still warm once you dipped all the slices you put it in the oven 349 which is 150 Celsius for 45 minutes after the 35 minutes you just turn the oven off and you have to keep the slices to dry for at least three hours I usually do it at night and in the morning they're ready and that's the result they're very good you just have to keep them in a container away from you humidity and they will stay hard and dry and they're so good even just to eat like this so you can decorate cakes or deserve whatever you want I hope you liked this recipe and I'll see you very soon with a new video bye", "vwe66-QleyE": "in the market for an exfoliant that it is us brightening anti dull skin as it is hydrating and nourishing and repairing stay tuned because I have the exfoliant for you hi I'm so excited I had been working to get a new product out to y'all and it's called the CBD botanicals CBE botanicals I just said my initials wrong and it is called get glowing exfoliating gel and this is such a clever product I it's very clean the ingredient deck is super clean it's a mix of five different fruit acids that help exfoliate but they also help brighten in their anti acne and they help keep things clear and the skin moving and give the skin any luminosity but that's only part of what this does this also has a CBD cannabinoids what they called the entourage of CBD which is the healthy part of the pot plant right of cannabis so it's basically cannabinoids and turpentine inflammatory and anti-aging effect and I did not expect that from this formula and was working with a gals and she's she's just such a clever formulator and so it's it's not you really don't feel much tingle from it it feels very cooling and it's the cutest little application so it comes in a little jar like this you're going to get a fan brush with it so you can apply it in a fancy way and you're going to push it push the lid which i think is super cool and it comes out just like that so you're going to take the fan brush take that up and I'm going to put this on my now you want to do the typhoon skin clean dry skin you can do this one of two ways and remember to get those little lines that form between our boobs all right so this is going to start to dry down you can use this in one of two ways you can just let this dry down for about five minutes and then put on your sculpt 'la products and like for example the cavi and i can show you this in a second it will bubble over this and it will penetrate after this I really thought it was a wonderful way of keeping the skin nice and exfoliated without disturbing any of that poly lactic acid or any of the Scala facial filling ingredient that we want to keep in the skin or there's another way you can you can either leave this on and leave those lovely terpenes and cannabinoids which are highly anti-inflammatory and you you always hear we could do more together than we can do alone right so it's the same thing with botanicals and when they have this entourage effect of the cannabinoids and the terpenes which are both highly anti-inflammatory but we are stronger together in this botanical product it's just so anti-inflammatory and usually you'll get an exfoliant that's like in a pad or something and it's just kind of just an exfoliant you know like glycolic acid pad or something this is the best of both worlds so you can leave it on the skin you can get all those benefits from the CBD oils and you can also be exfoliating the whole time it's on but in a gentle way and the longer you use it the more it will break down the cornea sides and the dead cells and the clearer and clearer you look and for me where I notice that the most is where I have like a sort of crepey skin down here on my hands and I'm just really loving this formula as I get older I'm moving towards more natural ingredient decks and I've tried to do that in the last I don't know 10 years or so so the two ways you can use it as you leave it on or you can put it on clean dry skin for 15 minutes and then you splash it off pat your skin dry and put the rest of your products on so it can be used either way I prefer to leave it on so it's excellent for exfoliating it's excellent for blemished skin it's excellent for hyperpigmentation so that blend blueberry and sugarcane and maple sugar and citrus and orange fruit extract they tend to be very brightening and so I love when they blend those acids those fruit acids together because they tend to be sort of sleeper brighteners you know and I just I just love what they do for the skin but if I look at this ingredient duck it's super simple it's well it's complex and simple it's it's beautiful in its simplicity but there's power in this formula and you know me you know I love products that tend to be gentle giant so if you think of like in any of the neo Genesis products they are they seem so simple and then you start using them and you see their power and you're like wow and there's no burning there's no you know tearing away at the face it's it's all good stuff as they go through this ingredient deck it's just beautiful so we start out with a neuro Leandro's Hydra saw so that gives it a lovely light light rose scent it's got some aqua and aloe aloe vera in it glycerin and then we start with the fruit acid so we got the sugarcane extract sugar maple orange lemon vaccinium myrrh tillis fruit extract CBD entourage oil and it doesn't have any THC you're not going to get high from putting this on it's just the best of what CBD has to offer and it's taken me a while to sort of jump on the CBD train but I hear such good things from taking the oils inside the body you know that they're anti-inflammatory that it only makes sense that it would be like that on the skin and as I've used these products and tinkered with them this specific blend tends to be as exfoliating it as it is nourishing and anti-inflammatory to the skin which I love because I feel like all all exfoliants should act this way should be this gentle and this nourishing to the skin because you know why do you want to walk around red and irritated from too much exfoliation you want exfoliation but you also want it to be tempered with just beautiful anti-inflammatory elements that are going to bring down any inflammation and let you get that fresh glowing skin without having to pay for it you know is it just look beautiful now you do need to use a sunscreen when you're wearing this make sure you're using your sunscreen I've got the repair son cushion any sense when you like it belong as that's 30 in a bug you start exfoliating when you start using retinols you need to be using some sort of a sunscreen on a daily basis otherwise you will get spots and if you already have spots that will make them worse if you do all this work to brighten them and don't use sunscreen so it's kind of like dieting all day and eating Oreo cookies at night it just doesn't work that's the sunscreen after that we've got the entourage oil we've got the terpenes as a preservative she's got 100% organic black carrot powder which is really cool Tass 'i'm sorbet and sodium benzoate which are both more on the natural side if you study natural skincare or more the cleaner skincare they tend to use those preservatives than some of the other older harsher preservatives so it's a very clean deck I am loving the product itself I love putting it on hard to work areas like well of course the face but the little wrinkles should get down here between the breasts the wrinkles on the hands I love putting it there now remember sunscreen on your hands afterwards but it does such a great job on the hands and really getting up underneath that dead keratinized layer and it's just beautiful so this is dried down now I'm gonna put on some of the cabby I'm gonna do okay I'm gonna do about three just driving around keep it a little whirl so as you can see it's starting to bubble up and you just rub it in you can either put on some of your mist if you feel like you need more moisture you can put on the Scola promoter cell repair cream or a neo Genesis moisturizer or whatever moisturizer you use you can put that on top of that so beautiful product beautiful product with scope look beautiful product without scope 'la just a good all-around exfoliant it's a brightener it's an anti acne it's an anti-aging product it's just a lovely lovely exfoliant and I hope you love it as much as I do thanks for watching", "Yhz9T6JKVaw": "[Music] to slice these lemons up I use a mandolin to get them all the same size and it's so much quicker than shopping okay so this looks pretty good-sized I've got the thick slicer on my mandolin now so we'll roll with it I just leave the seeds in if I heard anyone so just be so be careful with these not to chop your fingers once it gets to about halfway I put this spring on back you play how quick it is to chop up a lemon using a mandolin those one [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'll see how I go it with me and the moist chopped up some more and such a quick job that took no time at all okay so I am going to set up my dehydrator now I'm going to actually put it outside in an outdoor kitchen because I don't want to take up my beach space inside if I don't have to my one's actually quite quiet but I know some dehydrators are really loud so you could put that outside or in a spare room if you wanted to so I have kept the ends of the lemons gonna pop these in a jar of vinegar and make my own cleaning products that's really good like general purpose for the kitchen or we're about keep watching and I will show you how to make that shortly really easy non-toxic cleaning product and works really really well all right so let's go set up the dehydrator so the reason I love this dehydrator is that it is all individual trays and you can as they're ready so you can have picker slices on the top and put your finished lettuce on the bottom and just lift them up and pull them out and they're ready [Music] so I've brought the dehydrator back inside because it's pretty much done now there's a few in there that are not quite ready so I'm going to take out all the ones that are ready and leave the other ones in for a little bit longer you can tell that they're ready when take a tray up so they are ready when they're no longer sticky in here there's a few that are still not quite ready they're still a bit sticky and the reason I do that is that it means they won't go mouldy in the jar because there's no moisture left in them to cool down completely and then I will pop them in a jar so these ones are already and these ones to see it a little bit longer so I'll pop them back in they do under a little bit darker they I think I just did them at a higher temperature and they really smell caramelized they taste delicious this batch here is about a year old and they're still perfectly fine like they look good they smell good and they taste good so I'm going to keep these ones and put them on top of the jar so they get used first and put them in here and I've got another two jars because I'm going to give some to my neighbor because she gave me these lemons offer a limited area which you can see out my window Aldous fell off the tray onto the ground and she just looked at my front door so I'm gonna give them back to her in the form of dehydrated limits don't try and like stick them in there mister teach a little bit strategically because they can take up a little spice and use jaws with a little bit more of an opening so you can some of the limit yeah they look so nice and so even better and a glass of gin and tonic [Music] not sure healthy the Sounders but it's not very loud but I would happily have this in my kitchen and not be bothered about it but because I've got the outdoor kitchen I just use that frees up the bench space as well to make the cleaning product I've got the ends of the lemon so we just chopped up and I'm going to put them in a jar and I'm going to add some white vinegar and some distilled water which would really have just boiled the jug and I'm going to put that cool water in here so I'll probably do about half and half it's quite a big jar and then I'm going to top it up just to cover the lemons with the water okay so I'm just sticking one of my reps in here just to weigh it down so that they're all underwater if you have a smaller jar you could fill it right to the top and then that would work as well because there wouldn't be any oxygen in here so now I'm just going to leave this for about one to two weeks and then by then the vinegar smell will completely gone and it will just smell just like the citrus spray and wipe but completely chemical free I will just dilute it a little bit more with water and put it in a spray bottle and use it to clean my  so I thought I would answer a few questions I asked my Instagram page to see if anyone wanted to know anything about dehydrating lemons or citrus so answer them now if I haven't already in the video questions was how to stop them going mouldy which is why I try and dehydrate them as much as I can when there's still a little bit sticky still got some moisture in them and you put them in a jar they may get moldy so it's just best to dehydrate them as much as you can and until they're not sticky anymore what do you use these for so my main thing I use these for is for hot teas I just put some boiling water and a couple of these and sometimes I'll add in other things like maybe some fresh mint some lemongrass Simmon balm is really good yeah hot teas especially in the winter because Ike into such a cold person and I like to have a hot drink all day just make hands get really cold and I just can't function so it was only so many cups of coffee up in heaven a day while a little bit crazy so yeah I just have hot water and the limit either fresh lemon or if I don't have fresh lemon new this and the other thing I do is in summer I use in sparkling water just normal water and ice I'm not very good at drinking water so by putting a little bit of this and it just add some flavor and it looks pretty so I'm more inclined to drink it cocktails gin and tonic anything with vodka these are great but they look really impressive too if you've got this coming over just chuck a few of these in the glass and it looks amazing mulled wine I usually can wonderful mild wide-eyed little jar things that I take camping we go camping all the time and we often put on a big pot off mulled wine by the fire so these are amazing in that the other thing that I am uses for is baking I had made the most amazing like lemon slice and use these as a decoration and on top of cakes lemon layer cake is another favorite of mine and I'll put some of these on this decoration on top they taste quite sour still a little bit chewy the kind of Kulemin lollies when they dehydrate it so just break them up into like little wedges and then pop them all over the cake for decoration so they're completely edible and they add a nice little sour crunchy chewy element to it so you can use these in cooking as well so in any soups or you know it's slow cooker and things like that that do you want to add a little bit of lemon zest E flavor they do no bit weird with new we have rehydrated though they're like quite sake and totally edible but just not I just don't think that Pleasant so I would use them as I would use a bay leaf put it in for flavor and in at and take it out before serving it I mean if you're doing slow cook stuff they probably always break down anyway so you may not see them in their hole but if you do I'd probably take them out I mean there are other ways that you can use these dehydrated lemons for non eating purposes people use them as decorations Christmas trees hanging things and aesthetically nice in the bath okay and the other question I got was can I make these if I don't have a dehydrator and yes you definitely can I used to make these before I go to dehydrator and you just use the oven put it on a low temperature like 50 to 60 degrees Celsius and I do crack the oven just a little bit when I'm first starting them off because they're a lot of moisture coming out of them so I just let that escape or if you've got an oven that has that sort of extracting feature that would be good the only thing is using the oven is that they don't take quite a while so I mean even in the dehydrator they take like eight hours so having the oven on for eight hours is completely after new but you would obviously need to be home to make sure that it was safe but yeah just think that using a dehydrator is much more efficient if you don't have a dehydrator there's probably so many people that have them sitting in their cupboard and hardly ever use them so just ask around ask your family and friends put a post out there on Facebook or whatever and see if anyone has one that you can borrow for the weekend that way you can just you know how long oh we can get a whole bunch of stuff preserved and give them a little drawback as a thank-you I mean as well you could also do some dried I don't see why they wouldn't work if you made some friends with mesh and just make sure the bugs could get to them and yeah use some power I'm sure that that would work too how do you store them and how long do they last so I just store them in a jar in my pantry and because I have dehydrated them enough that they aren't there isn't any moisture in here they have just lasted I mean I've had them up to a year and a half and they've been completely fine the only thing I have you do have to watch out for is like the pantry moths because they can just get into literally anything and they'll get into here so yeah other than like the pantry moths I have never had any issues with these but mine don't last you know a year and a half was the first batch that I did because I didn't really know how to use them but now that I use them and a lot more things they didn't even last that long and and with any gifts that I'm giving or trading plants and things like that I'll pop a jar pleasin so get one I don't know mine don't last that long these days but you could definitely push them awhile so got some questions I'm watching hydrator I use I have the bio Schiff Arizona six tray and I did a lot of research before I got my dehydrator because I knew it was something that I potentially wouldn't use very often so I wanted to make sure I got like the best one though no I would use as much as I could that was easy to use that was quiet I know those the round white ones can be really loud and kind of slow so they take a lot longer things to dehydrate and you also to get the bottom ones out you've got to take all the trays now whereas this one I love that you can just take one tray out of time and mix and match whatever ones is not dry enough you can put them back in so yeah I looked at what I've written really good reviews on it sort of seemed like the best one for me so then I just kept an eye out and I actually purchased that sitting hand on market place it was pretty much brand new hardly being I think they've been used twice and I got it for I can't remember how much I pay for it but it was not very much yeah I highly recommend that as well but you're borrowing it's one of those things that you just don't you're not gonna use all the time so sharing it with among friends use any type of citrus to make these grapefruits really go to blood oranges make amazing dehydrated slices limes would be awesome as well I have a whole bunch of citrus trees out the front which are still quite young so I'm excited for when they start to produce I can make a whole bunch more different flavors so I've still got a few lemons left which I am going to give preserved lemons are I haven't done that before so keep an eye out for my next video because that might be in their experiment so we'll see how that goes but yeah if there's any other ways that you use your dehydrated lemons I'd love to know leave me a comment below and if you found this video helpful please give it a like [Music] you", "QbGVuZBfaFs": "[Music] so now I'm preparing the orange slices for drying and I'm going to be using a mandolin slicer and I have it set to six slice so that I can get a slice that will stand up nicely in this soap once dried and even though I say thick slice it's still relatively thin you can use a sharp knife to do this as well and these are in slices once dried can be ground either using a food processor or using a mortar and pestle and the ground bits can actually be used in the soap itself as well as these circles can be used to decorate the top of the soup your even have to use full circles you could actually slice each circle in half depending on how large they are and just decorate the top of the stalk but me half a circle so there are multiple ways that you may be able to come up with to use these dried orange slices you could probably use them in other products as well apart from soups so it's a good thing to know how to do so if you come back in the next video you will get to find out more about the process of actually drying these are in slices thank you so now we are on to the drawing process or the orange slices and as you can see I have a baking sheet here which is flat and I've lined it with greaseproof paper so what I do is that I Pat each orange slice dry and I place it flat on the piece of crystal paper and I continue this process until the entire sheet is full i preheat the oven to 150 degrees centigrade or 300 degrees Fahrenheit and basically I place the orange slices in there on the tree on the middle shelf and I bake it for 30 minutes and that will dry out after 30 minutes I take the tray out and I turn each slice over I lower the temperature to a hundred degrees centigrade or 200 degrees Fahrenheit and I place the orange slices on the tray back into the oven and I dry it out at that temperature for a further two and a half hours so it takes quite a long time so all in all it takes three hours to dry the orange slices to a crisp so you just carry on drying and slice your slices and put them into your oven and you'll get a lot of the result at the end so here we have the end result of train or orange slices and they are pretty hard as you will see when I do the stop making video for the Orang so that I actually crushed some of them in a mortar and pestle to create a powder as well so they are quite hard and here you can see better you know how they look so I'm quite pleased with the result and it's quite easy to accomplish [Music] you [Music]", "sgs7TvGZTNk": "oh and my apron oh my goodness uh hey guys uh what's up well welcome to the kitchen this is my segment known as let's get baked get it because when you're in the kitchen you bake stuff [Music] hey guys what's up welcome back to the channel my name is steph how are we doing please let me know down in the comments and maybe i'll respond to yours like i said in the intro welcome back to let's give baby everyone's favorite cooking segment especially mine because cooking is fun anyway i wanted to try something new and let me start something new on my channel basically what i've noticed on tick tock is a lot of people will share cooking recipes and that is so fun like you can just be able to share whatever they want and i'm a mediocre chef i don't have my own recipes i don't know how to like make a lot of stuff but i i would say i enjoy it it's kind of a hobby anyway i was considering just in this video alone i was making maybe like four recipes that's a lot of work i don't know how i feel about that but then i was like i can make this into a series depending on how you guys feel about this so basically we're just we're gonna start off by making something fun that i've seen twice on my for you page which which guess what it involves i mean it's not like you saw it in the title of the video so so yummy um anyway basically we're making like a candy type thing which sounds really fun and yummy to snack on so we're gonna get started also it's not that complicated of a recipe i just have to cut it up into very slim slim slim slices and then i just i make like a caramelization syrup for them to chill in then they just cook for like 45 minutes and then boom you let them dry in the boom they're ready to snack on so uh let's get started also for anyone wondering this is the main dude that i saw the video from and where i will be getting my instructions of what i'm doing also this is his at what i need i honestly don't i just it's you want to see three ingredients for this lemon water and sugar i'm gonna get a cut also because i've never made this before and i do not want to waste food i will only be using two lemons all right we're gonna get a big old knife out for this also in the video he recommends to use organic lemons i recommend using organic i'm just gonna use the ones we have they're kind of soft but also our lemons naturally like that i haven't handled a lemon in a hot second oh double cheeked up on a thursday afternoon wow i'm gonna make sure to wash them very very thoroughly all right i just i just put them under water nothing too fancy so first i'm gonna cut up my lemons and then we will make our syrup also never made a syrup so hopefully i don't burn anything also you know how it's common for um restaurants to serve up lemon slices with like water because you know you like i i would like water with lemon one time like two years ago i think it was when um all my friends were like oh my goodness we have all this ex like extra lemon slices what if we just like ate it whole with the rind it's not as bad as you would think it is have i also been tempted to eat an entire lemon like an apple yes i have have i done that i think so very slim thin that's the word i'm actually thinking of slim but that also works and then we'll take out the seeds because i'm pretty sure you shouldn't eat lemon seeds oh this is gonna get complicated in a second oh right now i have only one two three four okay we'll call that good and then we'll cut up the second lemon that we have also actually like about three two to three months ago before one of my sisters left for college she really wanted me to make this so now i'm making it now so when she's here um i'll know if it's good or not so then i'll know if it's worth it to make it that was barely a slice wait do you see that okay we're gonna call that good we have one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven we're gonna take the seeds out mom thank you indy thank you for your contribution thank you thank you thank you dang these lemons have had so many seeds in them that's a chunky seed oh my goodness also what if this becomes more of a series at the very end of each episode i can rate how worth how like how worth it is to make it all right last one look at that it almost looks like ratatouille i'm just moving over to here so for this here it's like like same amount for each of the ingredients i forgot what the terminology you should save with that same part sugar as water i yeah okay we're just gonna do a cup of sugar and a cup of water you're gonna hope that that's like a good like an okay amount because like he doesn't specify in the video okay can you see me look at this wow i think that's a decent amount same part water and it has to dissolve i think that's i think that's good okay i'm gonna put the sugar away i know i have to mix this until it gets to a foil basically this is so fun army feels like i should have put less in but i think we're gonna be okay okay so it boils we put the lemon slices on and then it sippers for 45 minutes it's heating up y'all oh it's dissolving this is good oh my goodness also i can use i can put food coloring in where's our yellow we only got blue and green here excuse me okay so it's nice and bubbly i would say it's boiling so we're gonna add in our little lemon things okay that's all of them oh you really can't see that let me let me give you a close-up with my phone look at them so basically this just chills for 45 minutes i feel like it's gonna turn out good in the video it it just has to have them simmer so that's what we're gonna have them do is that it also to show you that i'm crazy take a slice of lemon here i'm gonna eat this whole ah scrumptious oh it's even like 20 minutes or fire breaks out one of the two i feel like a dad tending to his barbecue right now i'm just making sure that they're okay they're kind of looking kind of good they have like 30 minutes to go but like still um okay so these look done they kind of look like they're getting a bit crispy or burnt in a way so we're just we're gonna take them off and let them dry basically they cook for 40 minutes actually to see wow that is so crazy these look kind of really cool they also kind of smell really good look at that that's a that's kind of really good syrup i don't know how to describe that but it's it's really good cause it's just like this lemony syrup oh that's hot i should not do that i think they're ready look at them okay number one they're really sticky who's surprised i feel like they're gonna taste like lemon heads wow okay so fun fact i don't know if i made them wrong or i just don't like them personally but they're kind of oddly sweet and like oddly bitter at the same time they look fun i'll give them that but will i probably ever make this again no am i also glad that i didn't waste that much lemon yes so do i recommend that you make this no but it could be a really good decoration for like a cake so there's that it is edible well at least at least i tried something the kind they look like how they should look i'm kind of disappointed because they look like they would taste good also i don't know what i was expecting them to taste like it's lemon in a syrup well anyway we're gonna i'll probably make something savory next time so eddie turn it down for just a second right hey hey anyway thank you guys for watching this and hopefully you guys like the idea of this becoming a series and if you see anything on your for you page that you think i should make or you want to see me try to make you can dm me on my instagram or you can tag my tick tock in the comments so yeah i will see you guys next week with a brand new video here's our outro see you then bye every time [Music] they just don't taste good", "W-nq-xt3h-E": "[Music] hi my name is Charles Malky biologist and Plant expert with ivory organics where we grow cool plants and today we're going to be talking about citrus splitting orange splitting lemon splitting and even grapefruits splitting why what's happening and how do we prevent this from happening again and I'm working here on my Eureka lemon tree here in the garden it's only a year old I installed a lesson actually twelve months ago looks pretty good right wrong half the fruit on this I've split come and check this out if we take a look at this lemon over here looks good on this side but turn it around and take a look at that split in half at least half of that split and if we take a look at this fruit over here split and another one back here split so what's the first thing we gonna do we're gonna remove all the damaged fruit so we've got about five fruit that are left they haven't split and hopefully won't split and then we picked five that have in fact split take a look at all of these before I explain what's happening and what caused it and it's not the only fruit in my garden that have split there's a couple other examples I'll show you throughout but just before I started the video you may notice that I've been painting and cone and coating the side of the plan and I'm doing so organically using a product called ivory organic it's a let me bring the can over to you this is going to be the 2017 on label which

it's a non-toxic environmentally safe and organic product and it's now registered material for use in organic agriculture and what I'm doing is by coating the plant I'm actually offering the plant protection from sunburn as the Sun rises just behind you viewers and basically cast intense heat against this plant this side of the plant all day long we're talking about 10 to 12 hours of continuous sunlight against the plant and being that the plant hasn't created a canopy to shade the lower part of the plant we've now given it the protection so that it doesn't burn and suffer any damage and instead it can put its time energy and resources towards growing and creating more leaves and more branches and ultimately supporting more fruit so I've coded it one other thing I want to show over here is prune branch that I have over here and unfortunately I have a large brains to share with you but you can see that I pruned it over here and this is a wonderful entryway into the heartwood of the plant so by coding it over here with the ivory organics I'm able to protect it from any wood-boring insects that may attempt to penetrate and get into the center of the plant and hollow the center of the tree and now it's coated with an organic paint that also has oils which include let me share this with you which include castor oil cinnamon oil clove oil cedar wood oil garlic oil peppermint oil rosemary oil oil that are all basically infused and time released within the paint to basically offer a protection against not just sunburn and Sun scald in the winter but as well as insects and rodents from damaging the bark and ultimately compromising the health and the life of the tree let me show you a couple other examples within the garden as well follow me so this year behind me is a two year old also just like the first lemon a Eureka lemon and both of them are also semi dwarf so they should be growing anywhere from about eight to twelve feet is the average range height for these plants but take a look a difference this one here the rinks have really you know grown accustomed to its location the watering the feeding pattern and everything else let me show you a couple instances of damage here take a look at this take a look these clusters are fruit you can see that we're growing these very successfully but right in here a split lemon will remove that let me show you another as well take a look if you zoom in a little bit further behind the plant you can notice right in here another croc lemon and let's get that out as well and here we go two more split fruit so what's causing all the splitting and there's a lot of reasons and most research will say it's not just one reason that's the cause for the citrus split the first one is water and you can see over here I've got you know a very focused irrigation system that basically waters the roof all around the plant but as you can see what's happening is the water is watering only this side of the plant I sometimes have to go around the plant and improve the soil structure and everything else so that it floods better and more rapidly but sometimes the water and especially if there's also issues with moles and Gophers and you know and these underground rodents to dry battle at least a few times throughout the year so sometimes take the water from this zone and then divert it to somewhere away from the plant but so far you can see that the water is collecting nicely around this side of the plant but this entire part of the tree could be running dry and what will happen is the root system will end up becoming more concentrated on this side of the plant and not create a nice balanced and healthy lemon tree or whatever other type of citrus you may be growing a way to correct this is in addition to your sprinkling methods and try to watch it and ideally it'll be watering a nice circular area around the root ball of the plant and uniformly all around it but if this is not sufficient what I do in my garden is I'll visit my plants around its watering schedule and keep in mind a citrus need more water in the summer naturally and less water in the spring and full and the least amount of water in the winter hopefully the rainfall should suffice and citrus in general are considered drought tolerant plants meaning that the soil should run relatively dry between waterings as well when you do water water very deep and thoroughly and deep meaning make sure that when you water your water enough that you end up soaking the entire root bulb so in addition to running my sprinklers Woodall often do at least every other watering schedule time as I'll come with my hose you know water the plant to make sure that it's being watered in a balance method and here you can see I'm now watering the entire roof all around the plant will allow that to continue to run in the meantime let me explain what's happening with the water and what's causing this citrus to split one of the main reasons for citrus splitting is typically high hot summer days followed by warm gusts of wind that ultimately end up drawing the skin of the fruit and causing it to dehydrate when you go and water your plant on the second round following those hot and dry and windy days the water will get back into the fruit and then the skin won't be able to expand as fast as the water is filling up the inner part of the fruit causing the fruit to crack and break as this has over here so one train of thought and one reason that farmers have found that the citrus will split is hot summer days followed by wind and then adding water and one way to correct it cuz I don't want to just give you the reason without explaining how to correct that issue is if you know you're going to have those hot windy days is to water in advance of it and then followed by and make sure you water it very well before those hot and windy days and then make sure that you gradually water them mildly on the days following to correct any dehydration to the plant so that's one idea a second idea is again the influx of the waters and sugars into the fruit are coming in so fast and again the fruit isn't and the fruit Ryne the skin the peel are just not prepared to handle that type of growth that too causes the crack and the fruit to split so again it's the water it's the control of water one way to make sure that this doesn't happen is to you make sure that you regulate the water to the best of your ability to make sure that you're running things consistently most of these fruit in the garden and here we are at the end of December I tribute the splitting to a lot of rain we fortunately have had a lot of rain here in the month of December here in Los Angeles these plants have been keeping them regulated on a pretty good watering schedule throughout the year but it was just too much water and these fruits can handle it the more mature trees have the ones that are established and looking healthy and growing and and doing all the things that a mature tree should be doing but this one being a first-year citrus plant here on my garden just didn't have the strength nor the energy nor the root system to stabilize that influx of change so again attributed to watering other reasons could also be the soil nutrition so make sure that you're feeding your plants three times a year and I've done some videos to discuss the importance of organic fertilizers and different ways to fertilize your plant I'll put that link down below so you can reference that as well but the goal is to feed your plants every spring summer and fall with a granular fertilizer that will slow feed and release into the soil over the course of three months so you'll be able to feed them three times a year and you can also do some liquid feeds in between I discuss all those in another video so we've just discussed four factors that lead to fruit splitting the main one is water and as you can see here we're soaking the plants so I'm going to wrap this video so we can turn it off but the other major factor is our high heat and wind as well as soil nutrition and more likely than not it's a balance of all of these factors to create healthy plants that have deep roots and can stabilize any influx of any of those particular conditions I hope you found this video helpful and if so be sure to like it and most

Rosie's dessert spot going straight into it in this tutorial we are making candied lemon slices what you're gonna need some lemons and a slicer if you have a slice so you can use a really shop knife to create really thin slices on your lemons create as many as you need for your decorating project and then what I've done is I've combined equal parts of water and sugar in a frying pan you can do it in the regular saucepan I just used a fry pan because it's a lot wider and so I can spread out lemons a lot easier mix the two together until the sugar is completely dissolved this is basically just a sugar syrup what I've done is I've added in some gel food colour in yellow as well because I wanted my lemons to have a really bright yellow coloring this is fun because you could do this in any other color for example in purple and then use something like apple slices something nice and pale better to absorb the colour and you can make really fun colored candied slices with other fruits pop in your lemons once that mixture is coming to a simmer or to a boil and then when they're all in there what you can do is bring it down to a simmer and allow those to cook through for at least 35 to 45 minutes mine stayed on for about 45 minutes or so and you know they're gonna be ready when they look a little something like this so that totally transfer pretty much showy translucent the skin is pre translucent and then what you want to do is allow them to dry completely and I just put them onto a sheet of baking paper you can drive up a little bit in the oven as well on very very low temperature just to speed up the process and then use them to decorate your cakes as you like I have a cake linked in the eye above where I use these for decoration thanks for watching and if you haven't subscribed thank forget to do so we upload a new cake dickering video every Tuesday bye for now", "PsW_GT2MxTg": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] hi everyone and welcome to chef's travels [Music] today we are going to be making a dried fruit using a dehydrator so basically dehydrating fruit in a dehydrator we're going to be using citrus fruit oranges lemons limes we've even got some blood grapefruit as well which i'm going to be using which is a fantastic color why are we using a dehydrator could you use an oven yes you could use an oven but to be honest with you dehydrators are built for purpose they're built for the job and putting an oven on for 10 hours to dehydrate fruit is not very cost effective and won't do your electric bill any favors whatsoever so yeah dehydrating fruit in a food dehydrator is what we're going to be doing today [Music] there are links below if you want to purchase one of these dehydrators i'm using an electric dehydrator which i recently purchased you can purchase them on from the links below which is an affiliate link take you straight to amazon i do get a little commission it doesn't cost you any extra but i do get a little commission and it helps my channel and helps me make more videos useful videos for you like this one and it really is appreciated so if you do use one of the links thank you very much uh don't forget to like if you find this video useful um and i'll subscribe would be very kind as well helps my channel again and um at the end of this video i'm going to show you how you can store your dried dehydrated fruit and and keep it going longer there's a lot of reasons why we dehydrate fruit but one of the most popular reasons at the moment is they use them in cocktail bars for garnishing the cocktails and gins and i've also seen them used on christmas trees as decoration for making mulled wine all kinds of uh different uses for dehydrated fruit it is a method of preserving the fruit and making it last longer so if you've got an orange tree or a lemon tree in your garden and you you know want to preserve the fruit it's a fantastic way of preserving fruit and yeah so basically without any further ado let's get in the kitchen and get this show started so when it comes to dehydrating fruit uh basically there's like two categories i like to call it the citrus fruit category and like the um fleshy fruit category i say freshly fleshy which might say that we've got a few drinks fleshy fruit which is like your apples uh your pears your peaches uh pineapples bananas and the list goes on these fruit are normally dehydrated and it can be used as snacks and they're actually more edible and you can also use them for garnishes on desserts and all kinds of things i will be doing a video on those so if you click the bell next to the subscribe button you will automatically be notified when that video comes up and any future videos that i bring out um but today we are going to be doing uh a video on citrus fruits the likes of uh the blood grapefruit oranges and of course lemons and so to begin with we're going to start by slicing all the fruit [Music] so roughly about a quart about a quarter of an inch [Music] next thing we're going to do is take your dehydrator trays and place your sliced oranges on like so keep them apart a little bit don't have them bunched up too close together basically so you get an even airflow all around the fruit and this helps with the dehydrating process so the next thing we're going to do is take our fruit and put it in the dehydrator shelves slide in like that yeah so once you've got all your fruit in the dehydrator in its trays next thing you want to do is put the lid on close that down and put your settings on now i've automatically got this already set for 10 hours so next we're going to put the temperature on and that's going to go at 70 degrees centigrade so that's basically going to be that for 10 hours 70 degrees centigrade and press start and off she goes and yeah we'll keep watching it as we go through but basically it's going to be dehydrating for 10 hours and that should come out lovely [Music] [Music] and so with the magic of technology after 10 hours of dehydrating my fruit is now ready and as you can see look at that nice and dry and crispy as i say it depends how thin or thick you cut these will depend on how well they dry out if they're not quite dry enough then put them on for another few hours quite simple and let them dehydrate a little bit longer [Music] so after 10 hours of um dehydrating the fruit on 70 degrees what i'm going to do now is take it out and what we do to store it is put it in these kilner jars they seal up and they basically air tight and keep them nice and dry you can there's a link below if you want to get some of these killer jars from amazon it is an affiliate link um so yeah i do get a little commission on it it doesn't cost you any extra but it helps my channel and thank you very much so basically yes we're going to take the fruit and put it in the kilner jars and uh seal it up ready for use very simply take your fruit off the trays and in there go again these have been drying for 10 hours dehydrating for 10 hours you can use them for cocktails for desserts for your gins all kinds of things and they're very great they're great for garnishes decoration basically i wouldn't recommend eating them because they don't taste too good but as a garnish absolutely fantastic [Music] literally just stick them in the kilner jars seal them up and use them as and when you want don't make too many because where you keep opening the kilner jars up they can rehydrate a little bit and you don't really want that so just make what you need although if you do keep them sealed up they will last a long time i don't exactly know how long but they will last a long time as long as the moisture doesn't get to them they're absolutely fine and that's one of the beautiful things about dehydration it is a preservative if you're going traveling again you know they're light and easy to carry and yeah basically there you have it so basically put the lids on seal them up as best you can and there you have it dried fruit dehydrated fruit ready to use these trays are dishwasher friendly literally just stick them in the dishwasher and they come back up nice and clean and ready to use again so basically there you have it dehydrated fruit um light crispy and beautiful you can use easy as i say for cocktails garnishes gin garnishes you can actually use them on desserts there's garnish as well i don't recommend eating them because they don't actually taste that good but um yeah a lot of uses for them you can hang on your christmas tree if you want which i have actually seen being done so basically there you go dehydrated fruit using a dehydrator this is chef's travels thank you very much for watching and hopefully see you on the next mission [Music] you", "lkN_X7VxqRk": "hi there it's Tracy Kiernan from step by step painting dotnet and I'm going to show you how I painted these citrus slices so I'm working on a 12 inch by 16 inch canvas and what I'm doing is tracing these different sized circles on my canvas and using Tupperware plastic cups plastic bowls you can find various sized circles around your house and use those to trace onto your canvas this painting also has half circle shapes and to do the half circle it's really easy you would just trace half the circle use a straight edge or ruler to draw that straight line and then erase part of the circle that sort of extends back of that line so there's really no right or wrong way to trace these circles you would just kind of have fun and create a composition of circles it looks interesting when a few are going off the canvas it looks interesting when the half circles are kind of going in different directions definitely vary your size of the circles that's why I'm doing different sizes and just kind of play around with the composition this is a great painting for kids to kind of teach about how to balance a composition in a piece of artwork we also have overlapping going on we have a variety of sizes we have shapes that are going off the canvas so there's a lot of different elements going on here and the composition also works vertically for this so we can have the orientation of our painting going vertically or horizontally or whichever you decide this is a big flat brush that I'm using to brush off all the eraser marks it works perfectly for doing that so that we don't smear the pencil marks when you erase so I think I'm going to settle with this many fruits and I'm gonna start with the background of the painting now the background was done with bright aqua green and titanium white I'm gonna use the 3/4 inch flat brush and load it in the Aqua and a little bit of white that white is just to give it a little bit of a variety in color it's not exactly necessary but I wanted that aqua to be just a tad bit lighter than the pure form of it and I like having the white kind of streak in the background so it has some interesting colors in there I'm also using the 12 bright brush to kind of cut in around the shape this is kind of the challenge of this painting when doing the background because you have all these angled areas to get around but if you're using the smaller brush that's the 12th bright brush you can use that to outline the shape and then fill in the background area around it now the background of this painting is also flexible in the sense that you can change the color of it there's a lot of different color combos you can do you can do a black background you it you can do a background that is a different color from the citrus slices so any color that would kind of stand out from the colorful nature of the citrus slices you could even do like a hot pink color I think that would look really pretty but I love using aqua in a lot of my paintings so I chose the Aqua background and so that's what I'm doing I'm just kind of filling it in I'm making sure that all my strokes are going vertical I'm not changing the direction of the strokes I suppose that if your painting was a vertical painting you would have your strokes kind of go in that direction as well but since mine is going to be horizontal I'm having my strokes go vertical you could also have your strokes kind of contour in the shape so the direction of the strokes will kind of go in the direction of shape so there we go in all different directions and then another alternative would be to paint the entire background first and then draw the citrus slices and then paint all the shapes white first and then you would do the color so there's a different there's different ways you can go about doing this painting so I am going to actually go silent here for just a bit as I'm filling in the entire background it does take a little bit of time to do but just take your time and make sure you get all that canvas filled up [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you okay now would be a good time to paint the sides of the canvas so I'm doing the same color for the sides and I wasn't sure if I was going to have the color of the citrus slices extend on the sides as well but for now I'm just gonna paint it a solid aqua and white and then also you can add a little bit of water to your brush to kind of get the paints a flow a little bit faster on the sides especially right now the paint is almost gone on my palette so if I didn't want to add more paint to my palette I can just add a tiny bit of water to my brush and so that is what I'm doing painting the sides of our canvas for this next step you don't technically need to wait for this to dry but if you feel like the background is really super wet you may want to step back and wait just a little bit because the next step is going to be we're painting the insides of the shapes so I have a palette of some new colors here we have CAD orange hue primary yellow deep green permanent and titanium white these colors are listed in the tutorial I am using a number 4 round brush and what I'm doing is simply outlining the shape so I have the pencil drawing I'm outlining it using the round brush and the color so you gotta have to plan a little bit when you're doing this because okay so the large circle is going to be the grapefruit and that's got the orange rind to it but the smaller ones may be yellow or green or orange for an orange so you're gonna kind of have to play on that and so that's what I'm doing here I'm outlining the shape with the color and also I like to add a little bit of titanium white to it because it changes sort of the color the color of it it makes a little bit lighter and also because it creates more of an openness with the color so adding white to it makes it so it it will cover that background a little bit better and also notice that my stroke is a little bit thick it's definitely thicker than my pencil drawing so part of it is going to overlap that background so you can essentially that pencil is right there in the middle of that stroke but it doesn't have to be exactly in the middle if you want to paint it just on the inside of the circle you can or if you want to paint it on the outside of that circle you can so with my yellow my lemons definitely add a little bit of titanium white to your yellow because that'll create the opaqueness in the yellow the opaqueness is simply how you can see through the color or not yellows a very see-through color but adding white into the yellow will make it not so see-through and also adding white into that yellow makes that lemon look more of like a lemon color like lemon yellow okay so I am just going to continue to outline my circles this one in the lower left ended up turning into a grapefruit later on in the painting so it started out yellow and later on I decided it needed to be orange because it's a larger shape so you're gonna have to kind of play in on what you're doing and then also you could change your colors later on so if you decide that this lemon right here should be a lime wait for it to dry and just paint over at green later so it's not a big deal I am going to go silent here as I finish this step of painting all the outside parts of my fruit slices [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so we outlined all the outer parts of our fruits and now we're gonna work on the flesh part of the fruit that's the inside I am going to start with the grapefruit and this is a really pretty color this is actually called primary red it is a red that has a peak looking tone to it so it's a red that looks pink almost and I'm gonna also freshen up my titanium white or use the white that's already on my palate if it's still wet I'm gonna use a 12 brite brush and load it in the primary red and a little bit of white and when I paint I'm gonna use the full width of the stroke and it's gonna go sort of in a raid aisle direction I'm kind of like an asterisk direction starbursts so we got to think about where the center part of that circle is and or a wagon wheel that's a good way to describe it but the direction and each stroke is going to go in the direction of the circle so you're going to kind of I eyeball where that middle is and you're going to do your stroke starting from the edge of the circle and I'm stroking towards the middle now notice how I'm leaving sort of a white gap between the rind that's the outer part that part that we outlined between that and where the flesh is you don't technically have to leave that gap there if you make your stroke go and touch the orange that's fine I left that gap because it was kind of easier to not touch the orange and then I didn't have to go back and touch it up later but that's what I'm doing here super simple and you can see that white helps to create that sort of texture already with the flesh of the fruit so I'm going back in there and so they're just touching it up and making sure that's all filled in and that is the base layer of my fruit and I'm going to do this to all of my shapes I'm going to use my twelve bright use the color of it make it go in a wagon wheel direction going circular and filling it in with that color okay so what I'm doing here is I decided that I loved that grapefruit color so much that I needed another great for in my painting so that is why I'm changing this yellow one to an orange rind and that's what I mentioned earlier if you wanted to change the color of one of your fruits super easy you would just paint over it okay so I'm going to do the same thing I'm going to load it in the primary red and a little bit of white kind of estimate where that center of the circle is it might be kind of hard to estimate especially for the ones that are kind of going off the canvas but if you make a good guess then that should be fine and do the direction of your strokes going in a sort of wagon wheel direction going towards the center and then a couple coats of paint to cover it up okay so when you're switching to the next color rinse your brush off and I'm gonna do the orange one the orange one I decided you can see what I'm doing on my palette there I mixed orange with white and a little bit of yellow just to make it kind of a different color than the right because the rind is a solid orange color with a little bit of white by adding that little bit of yellow in there it changed the color of the orange to more of a yellow orange color and the same thing with the half circles you're still going to go in sort of the wagon wheel direction making the the direction of your strokes go in that direction only you got to think it's a half circle okay so for this one it was kind of a challenge because it's behind those lines so just do the best you can for the smaller ones if you feel more comfortable using your round brush you can grab your round brush and that'll get into the smaller areas of the circles so for the lemon color it's yellow with white so I mixed yellow and white together that makes that a really light lemon yellow color and same thing use the full width of your stroke to go in a wagon wheel direction and I'm not even leaving that much of a gap right there with the rind and that's okay keep in mind that we're gonna be painting that white sort of inner part of the fruit later with white paint so you don't have to really worry about it if it goes all the way to the edge of that fruit shape that is fine okay so that one it went all the way to the edge all right so this video is sped up a little bit so please press pause when you need to do not paint as fast as I am because I'm not painting this fast in real life it's the video speeding up for the limes I actually loaded my pallet with brilliant yellow green I love this color I use it in a lot of my paintings it's such a pretty bright cheerful green color but it's called brilliant yellow green and I'm using the round brush for this because it's a smaller shape and so but still kind of the same concept have your strokes go in that sort of wagon wheel direction from the middle going outwards sort of a starburst shape and you can see how it's a little bit easier to actually do this with the round brush with that brilliant yellow-green and I don't think I added any white in my brilliant yellow green because it was such a perfect lime color to use Hawaiian green so this one I actually tried to leave a little bit of a white gap between the the rind and the flesh of the fruit now that we have the base of our flesh color of the fruit painted in or going to paint the white part that's on underneath the rind of the fruits this is titanium white and the number four round brush and I am painting a white circle just next to on the inside part of the colored circle okay so that is what I'm doing there messed up right there it's the beauty of acrylics because you can just grab the other color and it paints right over it so you're going to do that to all of your fruit shapes but actually I'm going to show you here quickly how this is going to happen with the dividing of the fruit slices so I'm going to find the center part of the circle and paint a dot and I'm gonna divide it up like a pizza so I'm gonna paint my line kind of a really loose line I'm not really looking for perfection and having it be straight or anything and I'm just going to kind of divide it up now I could have the line go all the way across and I think I did that later on with my other fruits because I found it easier to do it that way but I'm just drawing lines and dividing my fruit up like a pizza and see how the lines kind of loose I know my hand is covering that right there but painting that the very tip of my brush has the paints and I'm holding it very loosely to create that thin sort of uneven line and then our triangular shapes are kind of rounded they're rounded at the base but they're also rounded at the corners the bottom corner of each of them so you would paint a curve on the corners of all of the fruit slices so it would be a curve on the inside part of both sides of each of the triangles and that makes the shape of the slice of the where you see the flesh of the fruit the bottom part of the triangles are curved so you're going to do that to all of your triangles if you need to skip this step because it's too difficult that's fine especially if you're working with kids if it's a little bit of a challenge for them you can always simplify and skip I know I'm so sorry my hand is covering right there but all I'm doing is a rounding the corners of each of my slices so round that curve around that corner and I'm going to round going to fix this line right here make it a little bit brighter around the curve round the curve all right and then I'll go back later and touch up the color of the grapefruits and I'm making that center circle just slightly bigger okay so we have the base of our fruit and it's starting to look a little bit more like a sliced piece of grapefruit so I am going to do this to all of my citrus slices I'm going to go on to the next grapefruit and do the exact same thing so outline the inner part of the circle and then estimate where your center is divide it up so this time I had my line go all the way across it was much easier doing it that way and then around the corners the base of the all the little corners and remember that we could always do touch-ups later if you accidentally paint over a part of the rind or make your whites too thick all right so I am going to go on and do all of the citrus slices in fact I found it easier to do this kind of one step at a time outlining all the inner parts of the circle next so that's what I'm doing to all my fruits and then when I'm done outlining the inner parts of the circle then I go and divide them all up [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you now I'm going to divide them all up like a pizza for the half ones and then at ones that are going off the canvas just sort of estimate where you think that Center is and then oh really important I don't think I even mentioned this so with the half slices the Ryan's you probably noticed already the color of the outside of the fruit does not go on the straight part of it so right here you divide it the kind of the same way but that dark green is not on that straight part saying with the orange that that orange outer part does not go on the straight part so I failed to mention that earlier so hopefully you followed that if you did it you can always paint back over it and so I'm going to round all of my the curves okay so it's kind of easy with the smaller ones you just kind of round it so that your triangular shape looks more like a teardrop shape and then we can like I said we're going to touch up the flesh color after this step so if you need to touch up your any part of the fruit so you would just rinse the white off your brush and load it in the color that you need to touch up with and you would go back in there and sort of make your triangle shape look more like a teardrop shape [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so when you're done dividing your food up and rounding your corners go back and add a second coat to your flesh color and you can really define those shapes it's got to look a lot like a teardrop shape but with a citrus not all of them are exactly the same there's they're unequal as far as size and maybe sort of shape goes so you don't have to worry about perfection here and the step after this we're but when we add the texture to it it's gonna make the fruit look really cool but for now we're just adding a second coat to all of the flesh colors making sure that everything is sort of defined and that white sort of outline is not taking over this is a painting that takes quite a bit of time more time than I realized but it's the type of painting where you just sort of Zen out and because the steps are really repetitive so you're not really thinking too hard about what you're doing you're just tuning out and painting I love this grapefruit color all it is is primary red it's such a pretty color you we're gonna do the texture next and you don't technically have to have your flesh colors dried for the texture this is a tiny spotter brush it's got the tiny bristles on it and I believe it's a 5-0 I know I listed exactly what it was in the tutorial but we're gonna freshen up our titanium white and we're gonna use this brush to paint the texture on the fruit slices the highlights of the fruit pouches or I'm not even sure what the technical term of that is but it is what gives the citrus I slice its juicy texture we're going to call it juicy texture so what I'm doing is painting these very very tiny lines they're all different lengths they're not all the same lengths in fact some are thicker in some are thinner some areas it's just kind of a dot or a blob other areas I'm adding a little bit of red in there why not to make the the little line a different color so I'm doing a variety of lines they're all going in that wagon wheel direction and they are sort of uneven loose lines they're not perfectly straight and they need to hold their brush lightly to create those thin lines and that's what's creating this texture so I love the look of the just doing the little dots so I did a lot of little dots in there too it gives it that extra juicy texture look and so it's actually just a really simple painting these little lines and it creates that really cool citrus texture that makes this painting look extra pretty and then since I have this really nice fine detail brush in my hand I'm actually using it to touch up the outer part the the white part of the shape and so you can do that as well so just keep adding these little texture lines to it I don't think you can do too much I actually if you did too much the whole thing would turn white so just kind of make enough to make it look like it's in got enough juicy texture to it and I'm also using this brush to sort of touch up the outer part of my rind especially since a lot of that backgrounds just kind of showing through it looks kind of dark so I can add the second coat in there using that really small brush and it really helps you control the line because the bristles are so small and I did linked to these brushes I found these brushes on Amazon and I really liked them because of the handle of the brush it has kind of a thicker handle in the area that you hold on to the brush so it allows you to use this brush with more control because of the way that the handle is shaped so I really like these I do list them where I found them on Amazon because I really like them it comes in a pack and it's got all these different sizes it's got a 10050 I think it's a - well you know what this one now that I looked at the tutorial it's actually this is a number two spot or brush so but sometimes in my opinion when you're using a spotter brush it doesn't really matter if you're if you're using the 5-0 or the ten zero or the two or the one or the zero they have all got small bristles and you're able to control this smaller stroke with it all right so I am just going to repeat what I did to each and every one of those slices again Zen moment takes a while but you just totally tune everything out because if a lot of repetitive steps super relaxing so with the lemon I actually loaded some of the primary yellow in there as well so if this is yellow and white just to give it that little color of variety you don't have to do that if you don't want to load in the color plus the white if you want to just do the texture with just white to simplify things you can do it that way [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you I love the way the texture looks on this lime and I actually added a little bit of dark green in there later on because it gave it a little bit of extra texture look to it but you just want to be careful with these really small slices that you're making your strokes really tiny especially just tiny little dots in there so they're not so big okay here is where I'm going to add just a little bit of the deep green permanent in there and that's that darker green the color of its of the rind the outer part so adding just that dark green in there gives it just a little bit of a more interesting variety look in the texture again you don't have to do that sometimes adding that extra color makes it a little bit more fun than just doing the same color over and over again and I really like how that dark green looks in there you just want to make sure that if you're if you are adding a color in there and then going on to the next fruit slice just make sure you rinse your brush dry it off to get all the extra color off of it you know the right side of my palate is kind of hiding but I'm using I'm adding a little bit of orange it and by texture for this one [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so now that we have all our texture done we're gonna add something fun to the background and we're gonna call these bubbles so I guess our fruit slices are in a big glass of water or something but these are little tiny dots using that I'm using the four round brush to do this but you can do this with that spotter brush if you want different variety of sizes with the circles so some are sort of thicker some are thinner they're all in clusters imagine if this was a big glass of carbonated water and all the fruit slices are just kind of floating or going to the bottom or just floating in the middle but you have the little bubbles coming up from the glass of water so that's kind of the impression I'm trying to create here although it's ups traps tracked it doesn't really have to be anything and it really adds a fun touch to the background and then some of the bubbles are over lapping some of the fruits there's a lot of overlapping in this painting a lot of we have texture we have overlapping we have composition this is actually a really good painting to do as if you're if you're an art teacher and you're teaching about the elements of art and principles of design there's a lot of things going on in this painting so you can just add as many dots as you want to many and it might be a little bit too busy but a lot of blue space still showing so it's not covering the entire painting okay and then I also decided that there needs to be another fruit in this painting so there's this blank area and at the time it was kind of bothering me and I felt like there should be another piece of fruit here although I still think it looks fine without that fruit there now that I look back at it but if you wanted to add more citrus slices somewhere in your painting it was really simple just trace your circle again paint it white and do the same steps again that you did to render your fruits and then this also shows you that you can paint the entire background first and do your white circles and then do the fruit so I was actually a little bit easier to do it this way doing the white and then rendering the fruit so this one became a lemon and so I painted the white and then I followed the steps for rendering the fruit this is the last step that I am doing in my citrus composition painting I hope that you found this tutorial helpful and that you enjoyed painting these citrus slices with me a fun summer tutorial to do a good one to do with the kids definitely can be simplified or it can be rendered even further if you wanted to make them super realistic but there's a lot of direction that you can go with this painting with color customization and like I said a lot of elements in this painting if you're teaching an art lesson to your kids but I hope that you enjoyed watching thanks for painting with me [Music] [Music]", "WE0vtv4f4Ic": "hello guys so today we show you how to make these realistic little lemon slices or citrus slices I know there's more types of citrus fruit than these three that I'm showing but you can just change up the color to match whatever type of citrus fruit you want to make as always there is a full list of materials that you will need to complete this project starting off with some watercolor paints I'm going to be mixing them into my Sitka Dakotan to create the colors that I want then you want to roll into a ball and I'm placing it on my resin piece and this is just going to help me flatten it down into an even circle next I'm taking an index card and you just want to cut out a small piece from it I'm wrapping this around the end of a round tool and this is just going to help me create the indent that I want in the paper make sure you squeeze down on the shape is secure and you should have a little teardrop shape they can make the texture with you also want to cut a slant on one side of it and this is just going to keep it from making unnecessary texture so with these slanted side down you want to go and start making little imprints in the center and you want to twist a piece as you make these inverts you just want to keep making these as you go and you can also look at a reference picture on a citrus slice to see how the pattern of these citrus goes don't worry too much about making it perfect and placing the imprint exactly where they need to be because we want this to look organic after that you want to go and cut into your little slice and you want to make 8 equal segments you could also do 6 but I'm choosing to do 8 after your segments are doesn't want to press all the pieces together again to stick them together and then you want to take a tool to just kind of round off the edges so here we're just trying to mimic a little segments in a citrus fruit and naturally they are found very browned and I'm just using a dotting tool as well as a rubber tool to completeness the next part is to make a hole so I'm taking a dotting tool and poke a small hole through it and I'm taking a larger tool to kind of smooth out the inside and make the hole a bit larger after that I'm taking different tools and just kind of rounding out these segments from the inside so that the little segments will have rounded edges on the inside and the outside as well so now I'm taking Sakata kun and mixing it with white paint and you want this to be a fake white paint and you want to roll up a strand and wrap it around the edge of your citrus slice you want to press it down so that it forms to the shape of these citrus slices and taking a toothbrush to Canada's texture the outside of the citrus rind and this is going to help secure this to the citrus fruit as well as a decimal texture now you want to let this dry overnight and as you can see has become a lot more transparent taking your wife's acrylic own again you want to go and pull this out very fast and this is going to leave you with very thin strands and so you want to make strands as soon as you can and then you want to take these strands and cut them and then leave on the side to dry a little and you want to keep repeating this process over and over this particular thing is a property of resin clay so I highly recommend that you use resin clay I'm taking some clear gloss glaze and just glazing a small section and then you want to go and add one of those small soak it up into strands that you made earlier in between the segments the glaze is going to act as a glue and you also want to seal it with another layer of glaze after the little segments have stuck on there so you just want to keep repeating this process and adding it in between all of these segments and lastly cut away any strands that are too long with our exacto blade Here I am adding a final layer of glaze to kind of seal everything in and now the little segments should look more defined and after that you want to take some paint that matches the flesh of your citrus fruit and you want to paint it on the outside of the Rhine you don't want to cover up all of the white portions but just the ones that are exposed to the outside so that gives it a natural look of how real citrus fruits are use small and fast strokes and make it look messy that way it will look more organic once you are done this is what your citrus lights is sure look like you can turn these into jewelry pieces or you can use and decorative pieces since we're on the topic of stitches fruits the other day I try to give my dog a slice of lemon to see how she would react to it as you can probably tell she wasn't very amused maybe the lemon just wasn't appealing enough and so that's the problem that I tried to solve and before someone really freaks out everything on the lemon is dog safe and is okay for dogs to eat and I did all my research beforehand to make sure that in the case that she does eat something off the lemon that she wouldn't get sick and you have reached the end of this video

going to show you how to make candied citrus slices that you can use to decorate your cakes and not only do they look really cool they also taste delicious these citrus slices turn out kind of like gummy candy and honestly I had a hard time not eating all of these before I was ready to decorate my cake [Music] oh right so this is just a very general method for candying citrus and so I'm going to be using a variety of different fruits the first thing you need to do is slice your citrus I find it easiest just to do this with a nice sharp knife you want to slice them about a quarter-inch thick I know it might be tempting to slice them a little thinner but if you go too thin they're more likely to fall apart during the cooking process and if there are any seeds just go ahead and pop those out with the tip of your knife if you're having trouble keeping your slices even a little trick is to actually rotate the fruit as you're cutting it that way you can keep a nice even the whole way around so again this method will work with any kind of citrus fruit I'm going to be using some lemons oranges some Satsuma mandarins and some blood oranges after everything is sliced the next step is actually to boil the citrus slices so this boiling is supposed to remove some of the bitterness and the Ryans before you go ahead and candy them I'm not actually sure about the science on that but when I save the cooking water it definitely had a bitter taste to it so I think it's a good idea to do this step you can cook all different types of fruit together but I did do my blood oranges in a separate pot because I didn't want them to discolor the rest of the fruit I ended up simmering these for about 10 to 15 minutes and that seemed to be enough time you just want the rinds to soften slightly but you don't want to overcook the fruit or they'll start to fall apart while your citrus slices are cooking in the water you can go ahead and start to mix up your simple syrup now I'm not going to give you an exact amount because it depends on the size and the shape of the pan that you're going to use I'm using a wide shallow pan so that I can do a bunch of slices at one time but you can use any size pan that you have you just have to have enough syrup that it's going to be deep enough to cover your slices so some people make a simple syrup which is just equal parts granulated sugar and water but I'm actually going to use two parts sugar - one part water and that's just gonna make the cooking process go a little bit faster because I won't have to boil off as much of the water so once you have your syrup all measured out you can just go ahead and set that over some medium heat and stir until the sugar dissolves after your simmered slices are tender you can go ahead and drain off the water then transfer your slices into the pan with the syrup it's better to cook these in a single layer so if you have a lot you'll need to do these in batches but basically all you need to do is simmer the slices in the sugar syrup until they've become completely tender and absorbed in the sugar so this could take anywhere from probably like 20 to 45 minutes and it really just depends on how much seer if you have what size your citrus slices are what size your pan is what kind of heat you're using so the best thing to do is just to use like a medium to low heat you don't want to boil it too hard and then just keep an eye on them you'll know that they're done cooking when they look nice and shiny and they sort of start to go transparent at this point you can transfer them to a wire rack to drain and cool you can also reuse the syrup several times but if it starts to reduce too much you might want to add a little bit more water lots of citrus slices sit out and dry overnight so that they can dry out completely then they're ready to use you can use them as they are or you can also coat them in a bit of granulated sugar so they don't stick together and as you can imagine there are so many different ways that you could use these to decorate a cake I'm just gonna cut a few slices into quarters and then I'm making a sort of mistake pattern on top of this cake [Music] thanks so much for watching and if you enjoyed this video please consider subscribing to my channel for more cake decorating tips and tutorials", "ceHPk2Ntejs": "[Music] hi guys welcome back to my channel and today will be another DIY video in this video I will show you how I made this amazing Capri from the citrus and from the rose petals so this was really easy really cool smells amazing if this is something you would like to know how to make it please continue watching okay so for this project you all need one orange one lemon a couple of rose flowers I have and a little bit of rosemary and also I used one paper towel so I squeezed kind of a little bit pressed on the paper towel to get the juice out before I place them on a cookie sheet so I put them all kind of grouped together and then I ran out of space so I moved them closer to each other so it's not a big deal you can do that and then on the other side of a sheet I put on my roses petals in there so then after you're done with cutting it in the thin slices as soon as you can I guess then you turn on your oven for 200 degrees Fahrenheit and you bake all of this for three hours but what I did every 30 minutes I said the timer for myself I went in and turn only the lemon and oranges on a different side so kind of flip them over so I did not touch the roses and I did not push the rosemary rosemary [Music] it's this how everything look and I think everything turned out pretty good you can see everything dry [Music] it's already smells pretty good but I like to add a little bit of essential oil and I have one that is a sweet orange which I just add a couple of drops on every piece and then I had some that is Rose's essential oil that says roses on it and I sprinkle over my petals as well it just gives it a little bit more scent since I wanted to make it as a gift or if I do it for myself I put it in like a bowl then it stays the smell stays for quite quite a while and I love how it smell the citrus potpourri and the roses makes an amazing smell together so I hope you guys can try it and see what I'm talking about but after I did all of that I used a little mason jar from Dollar Tree and it is a perfect for a gift if you make in the potpourri as a gift I put it all in there to show you how it can be look like it if you're making as a gift and then at the end I dumped it all in my little ball because I wasn't really making it for anybody I just made it for myself because I liked how it smelled so since well staying at home it's an amazing kind of refresh the room was the smell like that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] to make it a little bit more pretty I used the little bow I don't remember when I bought this but it looks like I think it's mangamma tree and it was around Christmas they have a bunch of those Pattullo bows so I took all the pieces off and then I used my hot glue and I glue it to the top so it kind of look more giftable it looks prettier already but I like to make a little attention to detail it's always fun so anyway that's what it looks like [Music] [Music] well that was all for today I hope you guys enjoyed the video as I showed you I'm this could be a gift when you put your potpourri inside of this little can and give it to somebody but since I made it to for myself I dumped it back in my little ball and oh my god it smells it smells amazing I wish I could transfer a smell to you because it smells like a citrus in the roses in the orange give this a tad like a tart smell I don't know it's just I have put it before on this video I put it in my little background and my kids keep it sexy and what this smells so good anyway so it's up to you if you want to make it for somebody this would be a cute little container from a Dollar Tree in the ball that's from the Dollar Tree as well that you don't need to do much that you can fill it up and give it to your friend to your loved ones or if you're making it for yourself as a kind of like enjoyable air freshener and I love potpourri then you could put it in there something like that I guess or different ways this is from Dollar Tree as well so I bought a couple because I like how they look like and I just I just loved it anyway that was all for today I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you want to my new people please don't forget to click subscribe and give this video a like and if you want my returning thank you so much for coming back love you guys very much and I'll see you next one real soon bye you", "0SuArG9saTk": "what is going on a broad and welcome to another very exciting episode right here on the Emma Gardner channel as you can see it's getting dark out and that's why we're doing a video inside today because I was going to have you out in the garden and before I knew it the Sun started setting because even now I'm not used to the Sun setting at like 4:30 it just it's so disorienting to me being outside in the garden all summer you get so used to the Sun setting out like 8:30 9 o'clock and you kind of take that sunlight for granted so that when you lose it it's like oh man weird my weird my day go and since my job is to create content it's kind of difficult to film when it's dark out so so we're gonna be inside today talking about how to properly prune up your citruses and this was brought about because all of you have been commenting and asking me how I keep my citrus is producing contained and healthy even as an indoor house plant and this has come up on our growing guides anytime we just feature these plants or even if we're just talking about our our coffee tree they see the citrus and they're like hey what about the citrus so it always kind of comes back to the citrus and I figured you know what let's make a video on it because I think it's really gonna help you all out because citrus are predominantly seen as a outdoor plant they're grown in warm weather climates that are typically seen as a like zone by zone 10 and below I'm not quite sure if you get a citrus in zone 9 but I imagine you probably could get some cold hardy citrus in zone 9 even but let's just say zone 9 to 13 so most of the United States and the rest of the world really is not able to grow citrus outside but we are really lucky to have some indoor friendly citruses these are citruses that are grafted onto root stocks that keep them fairly contained and allow us to grow in containers that we can then keep them inside as house plants which is really awesome because here in Michigan through her so far away from even close to zone 9 we're about 600 miles away so not even close to to where we could even come close to growing these outside now these do go outside in the summertime that's a nice little added bonus gets them out of the house frees up some space in the house but also gets them some much-needed sunlight and humidity and and warmth in the summertime but for about 3/4 of the year they find themselves in the house and so I want to go through how to properly prune them because there are quite a few steps that I'm going to break down with how to prune them so that they have the best health the best structure keep them the most contained that they can be because the first thing to note is that citruses can grow really big an untamed while citrus that's never been pruned or taken care of can be 3040 feet tall by 30 40 feet wide I mean these things are absolutely insane when you see them the branches on these things are just massive and they get so big and you can clearly see that we don't have that luxury in the house at least I don't I would love to have a glass house where I could put these and just let them kind of go crazy but we just don't and so we do have to take steps to keep them contained so the first step that we're going to do I'm going to bring you all in close and we're gonna talk about topping it's very very important to top your citruses I typically say any more than about four and a half five feet tall is as tall as I want them to get and the reason why is because in a container they have limited root space as well as limited soil and water so that the taller they get the more stressed they get one big problem I see so many people having is they say my citrus looks really healthy but it's not giving me any fruit how come and that's because the amount of energy nutrients and water that has to come up to the very top of the plant is so minimal because of the confinement that it's in just the really you know close quarters container that it's planted in then it generally does not have enough energy to set fruit up top if at all and so because there's so much energy being basically diluted throughout the plant in such a small container there's really not enough energy for you to get any fruit on the plant so that's usually why and so I'm gonna show you how I top my plant this Washington navel orange is in need of a is in need of a topping you'll notice that when it is in need of a topping it's very evident and that's because it starts to have what we call tip die back tip die back or otherwise known as flagging there's two terms both mean the same exact thing you can even see it outside two if you have root damage on your trees doesn't matter if it's ornamental or fruit or ornamental or fruiting tree you'll see what's called flagging and this can typically happen from route die off or like route stress once I start seeing this flagging as I'll show you that's where we want to come in and really regulate the height because it's clearly telling you hey I'm trying to grow like I naturally would but something's going on I don't know what it is but my roots are not and my roots are not giving me what I'm requiring and I'm gonna have to drop some foliage so that's kind of what it's telling you and I don't speak plant but I do know enough about plant language to tell you that's that's clearly a root problem there especially if the rest of the plant is healthy so alright let's check it out I'll show you how I taught my plant first and that's the biggest thing to to properly pruning your trees and then we'll get into some finer steps later alright so this plant here is like I said I mean this is here's my chin so this is about five and a half feet tall I mean this is a pretty tall citrus a little bit too tall for its own good and you'll notice here there's some flagging flagging is basically just the dying back of the branches and what you'll see is that the very tips of a lot of these are they look healthy they look healthy but the foliage is not getting bigger it's in fact getting smaller and you'll also notice that a lot of the new growth it's missing it's missing the leaves so I'm gonna clip this off anyway so I can show you cuz I can't get it closer off to the camera unfortunately but you'll notice see that all that foliage there those were actually young leaves that fell off that's the beginning signs of flagging and as they begin to fall off it looks more like this which is which is just the focus on that every one second hold on there you go okay so when you start to get the flagging it starts to if Steve it still stays green but then it drops all the leaves and does that in hopes that if it gets more water it'll push some more leaves out of these little side buds here and and sorry it's going out of focus there because it's such a small thing to focus on but it'll hopes in in hopes to keep it alive if you keep these buds alive and the branch green but eventually it just ends up dying and that's when it looks like this and so this is more severe stages of flagging so so much so much in the background and so little in the four grow there so so then this is the more advanced stages of flagging where it completely dies back and so this is this is definitely something we need to come back here all right what I typically do is I will go back about 25 to 30 percent so if this tree let's say this tree is about five and a half feet tall I'll take off about a foot and a half of that of that growth there I'll trim that back and then I'll come in here and I'll trim that back see how there's not a whole lot to show for it I mean all of that and there's just that little tuft of growth there I'll take that back and then I'll come in here and there's a lot of growth up here up top but there's also a lot of flagging so if I see any flagging on this I'm sure to keep cutting it back but since there's nothing further down here for it to this is the what this is the minor lemon that's already been proved so that's kind of defeating the purpose now you can see how a little foliage is on this now that tell if the Meyer lemons out of the way you can just see there's there's not a whole lot of foliage here so if I were to prune if I were to prune this branch off I really would not be left with anything so I'm gonna leave this branch here is this pretty I mean this is at about five feet tall but I'm just gonna come back here on a turn off a lot of this flagging in hopes to kind of reduce the stress load on this tree so the next thing you want to do is we actually want to prune off any growth that is no longer going to fruit and we can see that based on if it's fruited there before a lot of these areas here you'll see it's got some some flowers on it the flowers are a new fruiting zone that is an area that we want to keep because it's obviously fruiting there but any areas that have a lot of barky wood that are very old growth that's gonna be a zone where it's not really going to fruit again and you're pretty much going to get nothing from it so this is an this is an old zone of tree very very old wood I'd say it's probably three years old had this tree for a long time I'm gonna prune that off now you see this this here was just a lot of really barky old-growth it's not going to produce anything unless it produces on this tiny little bit of growth here so you have all of this dedicated to just this little tuft of foliage and so really what I'm getting at is you want to conserve foliage to kind of a biomass you know this is all biomass here and the foliage is the only thing sustaining all of this biomass so if you have a really bad proportion here like this is not a good proportion of biomass to foliage so this much foliage to this much biomass is really off-balance and it's all about balance that's really what it comes down to with growing citruses indoors is you've got to find that balance where you can say you know is this really worth keeping on this is another bad example ok this is super off balance one little leaf on this entire branch this is a whole branch it looks like one just giant leaf with a stem this is a whole branch there was leafing notes here and it was kind of it was flagging and then it was like I think I can hold it on and so it flagged most of these leaves off here and kept this one still a really bad proportion one leaf to a branch not worth keeping on just take that off so we've come in here and really are just kind of aggressively pruning out all of this stuff that's really not worth keeping because ultimately it's going to be a benefit to this tree in the end it's gonna push way more new growth when it realizes that it's healthy again and it's gonna be a little bit more proportionate to what it should have in terms of foliage now the next thing that I want to encourage you guys to do when it comes to pruning is pruning off fruit that is not going to ripen and here I have a prime example sadly I don't want to admit this but my very first Washington navel orange we thought would ripen up but it went through some drought and when it went through some drought it cracked it's split so this is our very first Washington navel orange and you know if I was crazy enough I would want to take a bite of this some every part of me wants to try it there is some juice in here I just don't know should I it is a fruit it does smell like an orange you know what so this was an example so this is not considered like a ripened fruit okay it's mostly ripe but it is orange I was leaving it on just for kicks and giggles but it was actually hurting the health of the tree because keeping fruit on too I'll taste this in a second I think I'm crazy enough to do that but oh so you when you have fruit like this or if it's got blossom end rot or if it's starting the mold or or or look like it's going to rot and fall off get it off the plant you know when in doubt cut it off because if it doesn't look like a really super healthy piece of fruit and it looks like there's something wrong with it it's only going to be doing your tree a disservice because the amount of energy it takes to put out fruit is incredible it puts out so much all right it takes so much energy to put out fruit that sometimes you can fruit itself to death and so if it's really not going to do the tree any good to actually or it's not gonna do you or the tree any good like a win-win situation get it off the tree because you're only going to be setting the tree back later so with that out of the way I do I just want to try this I've never had a homegrown Washington navel orange and it's my first one so I'm gonna slacked off all this bad stuff here we're gonna give this a shot and just kind of see what it tastes like actually that's surprising despite it being not quite right and considering that it's been split open and splayed out like that for about two months it's pretty impressive no is it the best orange I've ever had no but I did really want to taste it so I'm glad I did that I'm glad I was able to bring you all along for it so the first taste of a homegrown orange so we talked about topping it to a safe height we talked about reducing the flagging we talked about kind of pruning out the the disproportionate branches that might have too much biomass to foliage ratio and we also talked about pruning off some fruit I also want to talk about one more thing and that's that when you have a grafted tree now this is not the case on our tree here because we've stayed up on it but a lot of times people will have a graft point and the graft is where they took the root stock and attached it to to the to the actual Scion wood the Scion wood is what grows so this all here this all here was the Scion and the Scion is what is grafted to the root stock which determines how tall it is how much fruit it should give the disease resistance hardiness cold hardiness things like that and the problem is is if you're not careful that rootstock can sprout and what happens is then you're growing to essentially two trees in one you're growing a wild calamine and orange and you're growing a Washington navel orange and where that becomes a problem you might think lats names kind of cool the problem is is that the root stock it grows much faster it's much more Hardy and it'll take a lot more energy away from the tree that you're actually intending on growing and what it can do is it can actually kill this off if it notices that it's getting energy and growth from that from that the new growth that's coming from the root stock it'll basically say in a way well I don't need you anymore it'll kill this off I hope you guys enjoyed I hope you learned something new if you guys still have more questions make sure to post them in the comments box below if you're interested in learning how to grow these citruses make sure to check out our citrus growing guide I'll post links to that in the description box below as well and that's about all I got for you so as always remember to grow big or go home we'll see you all on the next episode bye", "GrnBma7cxtY": "everybody there farmer 73 here just want to do it update because everybody's asking me about how I get all of my citrus balloons I get tons of them and I get tons of fruit every year sure you guys seen a couple of my videos if you haven't you need to check them out this is a variegated eureka pink limit I got a lime that I just proved half to death but as you can see it's bouncing back already I got a bear slime over there you can see the fruit right there and all the buzz that's what I want to show you how lush and green everything is and all of the fruit buds look at that tons of everything you see pink all the bullets each and every one of those turn into fruit you guys know that here's some small fruit here and it's plenty there's plenty on every one of my trees here's a Washington navel orange it's just loaded with fruit it's loaded fruit blooms everywhere okay look at that Ponderosa lemon giant lemons fruit blooms everywhere ruby red grapefruit blooms fruit everywhere okay zoom in on that a little bit oh that's beautiful and the smell anybody that grow citrus knows the smell is just you can't duplicate this I haven't smelled a perfume that can even touch how this really smells okay I'm going to show you this is what I use coffee grounds I use chicken poo and it worked great it worked great but you know digging in chicken poop is not the coolest funnest thing to be doing for the last two years I've been using coffee grounds and ground-up eggshells and all I do is sprinkle out a little bit around in here it's easier I take a little handful I sprinkle somewhere that every every time I get eggshells I bake them ground them up just like that now take some of these coffee grains just like that nothing no no science to this then I just come in here scratch it in so I don't clump up on you okay I just told you my secret - super citrus because that's what we're getting here super citrus everywhere that is all I do everybody now water that in or I let it rain and of course I use I try my hardest to use rainwater this is the secret this is what I do you guys this is it is no I don't use any chemicals you guys know that I don't spray anything because I am a beekeeper and I can't afford to spray anything so this is it I'm going to show you guys exactly how I do it all right I'll be right back whoo that's that smell it's just insane look at that that's beautiful I'll be right back I'm sure you have them pull this off okay this is what I use I take my old eggshells here and in the morning have my morning coffee you know scramble me some eggs and here's coffee grains as you can see leftover coffee grains I stock them up all week and keep them in a container somewhere nothing special and with these with the eggs I just take a container just my main container here there's one something cheaper but first off I forgot to tell you I baked my eggshells I bake them for two reasons one I give them back to my chickens for protein to help them strengthen their you know feathers and so their shells come out a little stronger so they won't break so I want to bake them really good because once my chicken starts smelling the egg shell they'll start eating their own eggs so I bake them really good as you can see almost burn them but it works out good in the in the garden too so I dump those in here like that yes I'm making the nests doing this one here they're like most of us do and then I take I just take a uh anything grind them up i grind them down into almost a little fine powder and I'll show you what I do from there okay I just come behind and I sit here oh look at that is that not beautiful I come back I just water them in no rain in the forecast I don't give my citrus a lot of water each one like I said again scratch it in a little bit just to get it down in there so don't clump a couple of them got to pull weeds out here and there that's it you just rain not too long ago so I'm really just giving them a nice little drink just for the video other than that they don't really need much so that's all to it if you do that I can almost guarantee that you will have blooms like this because this is all I've been doing for the last two years and I kid you not it just works I mean I don't know another way to say it I wish I could this camera does this stuff no justice cuz you can't see this and I know when you guys take videos you think to yourself it's the camera just doesn't look as good as your eye you know when you're looking at this you you gotta just be here to see it but look at that Oh God just clusters of ruby red grapefruit everywhere Washington navel oranges everywhere Ponderosa lemons everywhere god that's a lot I'm gonna have to do a lot of fruit thinning a lot of variegated pink lemons here look at that now you do that you try this way and I can almost guarantee this is how it's gonna work out for you because you know and this one has fruit on it cuz this started fruity got a little scale on there that I can wipe off go for the water hose but this just started fruiting in the garage so this is the early bloomer here but it as you can see you got mature fruit tons of young birds tons of young fruit and a half scale so it's growing while it has scale usually scale makes everything just kind of grow funky till you get it off so I sprayed it off with some water water hose is the only way I get it off but that's all to it you guys that's all - and it's all grown in buckets as you can see so that's all I want to show you you know you got any questions please let me know because uh this is one of my true love's here my citrus shrew alright thanks for watching Leah farmer 73 and I am out", "jtO0Pa6tD8s": "[Music] alright guys what's going on so I'm in an undisclosed area I will say I'm in the Brooksville area and I came by here a couple of weeks ago and I feel like I owe you all this video I do a lot of kind of ragging on citrus it's just unfortunate because of the greening problem we have here in the state of Florida it's very tough to grow citrus [Music] greening is a disease that's starting to attack and kill citrus here in Florida and it's basically a psyllid it's a small bug and it starts boring into that leaf it'll you know stop that plant from being able to take up nutrients from the leaves and eventually ends up killing it there is no long-term cure now I always make this common citrus because because of disease because we can't grow it you know and I'm not an added citrus in general but it's something I'll point out you know we only have that problem with citrus now today because of the way we have managed citrus because of the way we've grown citrus here in Florida you know there's thousands of different trees that we could be growing and we only grew citrus in a monoculture one species you know in large large large plantings you know through 5060 percent of the state of Florida you know it's kind of like the main crop or the send the Sunshine State so you know of course nature found a way it was to be expected because of the way we've planted it this is why we do not plant citrus so you know down here at the bottom of the tree you'll see there's two tags on there and this tag is the ISD tag you can almost see it right here applied on eleven thirty seventeen so right here this is the Mauritius this is the variety of citrus so these trees get a tag that's called an ISD tag and that is D stands for a medic rope and soil drench and it's basically a poison that's been drenched on this root system in the tree I know the University of Florida is you know frantically rushing working to genetically modify citrus there's also some new rootstocks that are supposed to be greening resistant but I have talked about how citrus and the understory seems to do much better so came through here a couple weeks ago meet my buddy Matt with what's ripening we filled a couple of bags with some killer citrus that we found in this developed understory forest area so today I was out there unloading my camera gear there is some no trespassing signs that's why I don't want to stay right where this property's at local ranchers stopped me he said what are you doing I said you know I saw my camera I said I was documenting some of the citrus growing back in the woods here how it was uninfected he goes alright you as long as you're not poaching as long as you're not dumping go ahead back he must know the guy that owns the land so I kind of have permission to be back in here but I don't really want to talk about where it's at so we're pretty much in a water oak live oak maple magnolia mix species understory and there's literally hundreds of citrus trees back here I'm guessing most of these are seedlings most of these look really vibrant and healthy as you can see I mean the fruit is like ridiculous as you pull these things off the tree they almost open like I would call these easy peel tangerines like literally I'm gonna set the camera down here for a second and show you guys when you open them how easily you know this cap comes off here they're a little bit on the seedy side but I'll deal with the seeds to have unaffected citrus so I mean these trees just look incredibly healthy in this dappled light understory situation loaded in fruit I don't want to spend a lot of time back in here I have already seen some poison ivy I did already pick a tick off my leg very careful laughs of that kind of stuff when you're walking back in the woods but yeah I just wanted to show you guys this citrus I mean this does kind of uh I don't know if I would say don't give up on citrus or gives hope to citrus but there has been some citrus that has you know naturalized it has adapted in this understory situation to where it's thriving it's healthy it's beautiful so let me open this fruit up this is gonna be a quick video I don't want to spend a lot of time back here in the woods but I just wanted to show you guys some of these trees have been talking about I mean this is a decent size tangerine I would say also I mean who knows what this is to be honest with you I am far from a citrus expert because of the greening problems I don't spend a lot of time doing research on citrus I mean I grew up eating citrus as a kid you can see these big ones up here I mean really really nice-size fruits and I'm just in one little area I mean these trees are literally flooding this whole forest like I could come back here and probably pick ten thousand pounds of wild citrus so let me put this down I want to show you guys the fruit real quick hold tight all right guys so today it would have been one of those days it would have been really nice to have somebody out here helping me film I've got the gimbal down on the ground I'm kneeling down kind of in a place where I don't want to be kneeling down definitely gonna check myself when I get up but I just wanted to show you guys these tangerines like the whole thing opens up it was almost like room inside of there around the tangerine mmm incredibly sweet and a couple of seeds I don't look at seeds as a bad thing you know I think we've read things away from seeds where there's probably lots of good stuff going on here seeds having fruit with seeds is probably a little bit more normal probably more nutritious probably more of the way they have been naturalized and as you can see I mean look at the color so picking wild citrus in the woods for free all over this Brooksville kind of northern county area going all the way up to east the Spring Lake North the floral city I've seen this all over the central region of Florida this is not an uncommon thing that's why when the client tells me they want a citrus tree I tell them you know get it from Home Depot get it from Lowe's a it has a warranty B we plant it in the understory we put it underneath the oak trees if they have one on their property and we don't know what it is we don't know if it's a micro Raizel relationship between the citrus then the oak something having to do with that understory these trees seem to be much less affected guys I thought I was getting out of here and I ran into a tree that was like literally completely loaded down I got a bag here in probably five minutes filled with citrus as you can see I'm uh I'm dripping in it and little pro tip I figured out was you really want to use hand pruners when harvesting this citrus because of how soft the cap is like I talked about you're literally ripped every one of these casings open so hand pruners is a pro tip man I found you all a tree that's just like overly achieving probably one of the most loaded ones I saw out here camera was the hallway back out at the truck so I ran back out there to get it for you guys and actually picked another tick off while in the process so you gotta be really careful most of the kicks out here actually come from being on the higher brush so when you rub up against it it actually gets on your leg you know and that's when that will embed in you so when I get home I'll definitely be doing a deep check of my whole body I actually have a special key that I keep on my keychain now that's called the tick key and it's made for taking those ticks off fairly easily watching poison ivy here everywhere I'm walking and you all have to see this tree like I just did an Instagram story and something I'll point out if you guys don't follow me on Instagram and you want to stay more up-to-date with my regular day-to-day occurrences check out my Instagram check out my story so this one as you can see it's pretty loaded up top there I'm hoping you can see you know once again I am in a really dappled light situation here goes from Sun the whole Sun so I'm sure the the camera struggling a little bit but I do see that tree I wanted to bring you back guys and show you actually just filled my bag over here and I do kind of taste them before I fill the bag too so I picked the one that was extra sweet definitely still had some some seeds in it but no big deal I can juice these I can eat these fresh I mean you look at that there's you know 150 200 300 400 500 fruits you know just here in this little range of tree going all the way up in here and it's probably a couple of trees but I think what excites me the most about this guy's first of all its citrus very hard to grow here in Florida second of all nobody's watering these nobody's fertilizing these nobody's maintaining these these trees are thriving on neglect fruiting like no other and it's citrus well which is pretty unheard of here in Florida if anybody knows about our greening problem we have it's like the epidemic but I mean look at this food and not just regular food we're talking about free food nobody eats this stuff the animals eat it obviously most of it probably rots away and that's probably how we keep getting more trees more seedlings keep popping up but uh what about you guys have you ever seen one this loaded

love growing my own citrus trees I have about 16 that I grow in containers as well as one larger specimen that I grow in grounds like all living things they just want a flower fruit and reproduce the problem with growing them in our climate however is that they're not cold hardy and they require protection from freezing temperatures in the process they'll become a little bit stressed out they may drop some leaves and will also become more vulnerable to pests and disease issues welcome back to new garden road where I share my love of gardening with you in a way that I hope will inform inspire and elevate you like this video if you liked it and subscribe to get notified for more gardening action container-grown sister's trees have a limited root system and nutrients get depleted over time these factors can leave trees weakened and unable to produce fruit once the weather warms up this video documents my annual routine and offers seven tips for growing citrus trees in containers here's tip number one take them out of the greenhouse and get him some more sun exposure if you overwinter your citrus trees inside it's the same principle they're gonna need some more sunlight the time is now you want to get them out there and get them growing tip number two prune away any dead limbs and yellow leaves remove those guys and put them in your compost they're not really going to be serving the purpose of growing for your tree a lot of those dead limbs you can do the scratch test if you want to scratch on them with your fingernail if you don't see anything green then you know that's a dead limb use a nice sharp set of pruners clean set of pruners and make some good cuts on your citrus trees likewise if you've got some yellowing leaves on those trees they're not going to be doing what they need to for the tree and as you remove them you'll be encouraging your tree to produce some fresh shiny leaves yeah tip number three protect the pollinators by removing any flowers from trees that are less than two years old if you've got some newly acquired citrus trees from a local nursery you want to keep them from flowering for about two years this is going to protect the pollinators in the state of Texas all citrus trees are treated with neonicotinoids that's a systemic pesticide to protect citrus trees and nurseries from pests and diseases that can really take hold and prevent us from having citrus trees in our backyard garden so I know this could be hard to do for you but think about the bees think about how much adversity how they've had some decline whatever challenges they might be you're doing your part by being responsible it's the right thing to do y'all you want to protect the bees also just think about it those young trees don't really have a big root system they're not real mature oftentimes they're only producing fruit every other year so you really want to give them some time to get established in their container give them some time to grow up after about two years those systemic pesticides will have run their course and diminished that's going to present a lot less danger to bees and other pollinators and you're probably gonna start getting regular citrus fruit year after year here's tip number four inspect them closely for insect pests such as scale white fly and leaf miners get in there and take a good look use both hands get down on one knee look underneath the leaves look closely be thorough get to know these insects you may have to do some research and look up what they look like at different stages of life you're gonna see some different things on your citrus trees don't fly off the handle and remove stuff just because you see something make sure you know what it is put in some time and remove those insect pests if you can or treat as necessary a lot of times after the citrus trees have been over wintered inside or in a greenhouse due to lack of light white fly will come and take advantage they're one of the most common insect pests under citrus trees likewise scale are very common and they can be easy to spot once you train your eye leaf miners are more of a cosmetic issue but nonetheless this is a great time to inspect for them and remove any affected leaves tip number five take the time to remove any weeds you want to remove the mulch take a good look use the set of pruners if you need to and pull those out carefully throughout the course of the season birds are gonna come along and they're gonna plant some things of their own in your garden they're also gonna land on your citrus trees and do it so that's why you might get some various things growing either way you want to stay on top of it when you're growing citrus trees and containers you don't want to have any competition for nutrients down there last year I lost one of my Kishu man or it's due to an invasive weed that established itself inside the pot by the time I realized it after fully neglecting my citrus tree it was too late I lost all the fruit all the foliage fell off and my tree didn't recover alright tip number six y'all this is a big one you want to amend the soil in your container what's that mean you want to add some goodies I recommend using a slow-release organic high nitrogen fertilizer something like cottonseed meal that's what I'm gonna use today it's rated as a 721 and it works great it's slightly acidifying to the soil which is great for a container grown tree all that nitrogen is going to go to those evergreen leaves and like I said you want to prune out any of those yellow leaves this nitrogen is going to give them a nice steady supply of nutrients to grow some more you want to add some micronutrients as you water your citrus trees through the season you're gonna wash out all those nutrients you need to replenish them specifically I'm talking about products such as azomite and kelp meal I'm also using a product called dr. iron that's gonna give it a nice slow release source of iron with a little bit of sulfur that's really going to help those leaves green up and be strong add some dry molasses you're going to be feeding microorganisms and beneficials in that soil and you're going to be building it as well when you add dry ingredients you're adding organic matter and that builds the soil add some compost or worm castings a nice thin layer folks if you got a really fine textured compost that's great a lot of times I use the happy frog soil conditioner I really love that stuff otherwise I might recommend earthworm castings black gold I'm telling you what I love that stuff a nice spin layer maybe about a half an inch something like that that's really going to add a great deal of organic matter and biology for your container grown tree today I'm doing something different I'm adding humate humate is a really rich composted product it's a slow-release form of organic matter I like to add some dry humate to my raised garden beds as well as my container growing trees and plants every few years again it's one of those things that get washed out over time and by doing this you're really giving it a boost to get growing just remember you can amend that soil in your container growing citrus tree throughout the growing season probably about once a month it's up to you it depends on what your resources are and what the products you're using recommend but you definitely want to add some nitrogen and some micronutrients several times throughout the growing season here's tip number seven if your citrus tree needs some water make sure you give it a good slow drench then fill up your watering can with water add some liquid seaweed or kelp as well as a higher nitrogen fish fertilizer in this case I'm going to be using the holy Mack roll it's a three one one fertilizer that's really going to give them a quick boost of nitrogen that's going to help your tree put on a whole new set of leaves and set some fruit when you follow these seven tips for growing citrus trees in containers the result will be a more vigorous and healthy plant that will produce some of the most delicious citrus fruit that you've ever had there you go welcome back to new garden road and leaf miners and leaf give it some food gonna get it growing y'all [Music] I guess that's it check out some of these other awesome gardening videos on my channel like this playlist for growing your own citrus fruit you can grow your own food keep it organic you", "x62G-wf7YHM": "if your success three starts dropping blossoms you should go into an immediate panic mode and start watering excessively I'm just kidding so there are a few reasons why your blossoms or flowers in your citrus tree might be falling and I will go through all of them one by one so the first reason is if you didn't fertilize the trees prior to blossoming and I've never fertilized my tree because I only first whatever specialist with walking back there I always read whatever sub there is falling from the tree to sit there and decompose and I have loved it okay it's not useful this time I have a crack in my wheel shield and I have people changing the issue anyway so the first reason is if you don't fertilize your tree and if your so it's very depleted prior to blossom ink which for my area rizona that would be early March however I've never between in this house for five years I think I've never fertilized that tree and it does grow blossoms but that's okay I don't mind and I will explain why so you may want to check the soil and where your trees and see if it needs anything mine doesn't mean to need anything because I know it produces great oranges and great grapefruits behind the camera so another reason it's early frost however that's not my problem because the last frost date we had here was I believe February of 2015 so about two years ago so that's not a problem but it could be problem for people in California for it another reason could be over-watering or inconsistent watering and it's very easy to overwater and I did it a couple of times and one of the signs of all over watering because you can water it consistently but when it rains too much there is not much that you can do about it and I did stop the irrigation system back in I believe it was late December and but we got so much rain and there's nothing I can do about the way sign of too much water would be let me see here this one if you can see the leaves are yellow and that's not and they're dropping to there I can actually pick the one from just the ground this is all from too much rain that we got here way too much for Arizona I've been here for 20 years almost I've never seen rain like this and although we must those smell like heaven they smell really good so anyway another reason the blossoms are dropping is because the three the citrus tree they produce way too many blossoms that they need and usually only two percent of the blossoms become fruit so if you get two percent of the blossoms to turn into fruit you had a great year and I I think I do right about there so there is no way that these three okay and out that many oranges so don't go into a panic mode because they will grow you see this that's totally normal so you don't have to worry about that in the three has a lot of bees they're all done now but they were here in the morning so they were pollinating it another reason for the drops to fall is the inconsistent so the best thing to do is to have bleep system and also if you're growing to your citrus fruit tree indoors I can show you here but you have to have a sandy soil citrus tree they like them before and the sole here natural is sandy but if you buy from Home Depot whatever a hardware store or gardening store just regular potting stuff your threes not gonna thrive in it it has to be sandy and well-drained so in addition to blossom drop you can see fruit drop so when your tree starts to form fruit and the fruit is about anywhere from that peak to the size of a walnut it may start dropping because the fruit note the fruit the tree knows how much fruit can bury or carry I should say and so that shouldn't be reason to if you're doing everything else right that shouldn't be a reason to be concerned about it and also there are varieties of citrus tree that don't reduce every year so they may skip a year and not blossom at all that doesn't mean that your trees that don't get rid of it it will leave or produce next year but luckily this year I think I'm going to have way more oranges than I did last year last year I didn't have any I did get some grapefruit and the grapefruit trees blossoming as well which makes me very happy it started blossoming collator than the orange tree and I'm assuming it because I left some grace was there I didn't pick them until they were fully ripe but as soon as I pick the last grapefruit the tree started to form little button now it has pretty big buds that are ready to blossom and I hope you could be here to smell the tree because my raised bed garden is all the way on the other side of the house which is pretty far away I think it's like 50 feet and I can smell it there it smells like Shevin and if now I'm starting to see you see no worries that's all normal anyway mother forces now and if you have any questions please put them in the comment section below if you like my video give it a thumbs up and if this is your first time visiting my channel we subscribe for more videos like this one and I can't look at the Sun anymore by thank you", "mvnsVgtPbyE": "hi everyone my name is nia and today i'll be painting something fun and refreshing i'm going to paint citrus slices the technicalities are very simple and repetitive so it's really easy to replicate and you can have lots of fun with the colors on this one so let's just start by drawing out the citrus slice it's super easy i just start by drawing a circle and another circle either inside or outside of the first one that you drew to represent the rind and i'm going to use the circle in the inside to indicate the center so i can divide the spice into sections you can do straight horizontal lines all across but i tend to divide them separately because i like the slight unevenness of the sections that way then i just double up the lines on the sections then round the corners on all of the sides and the center then erase the unwanted lines and that's just then repeated in different sizes so you can create different citrus fruits you can try to repeat this however many times you want as practice or draw straight on your paper or sketchbook and create the composition that you want and figure out the types of citrus fruits you would like to include the first one that i'm going to paint is a calamansi slice and the colors that i'm going to use are yellow vermilion deep green and yellow ochre i'm going to be using my pencil colors for the whole painting because i want to use very bright colors to give a refreshing and happy feel to the painting so for this one i'm going to use yellow as my main color and add a bit of vermilion to create a deeper yellow you can also mix orange instead of vermilion but vermilion is the closest here so i'm just going to use that and i'm basically going to have two separate colors where i have the lighter yellow and something that is a bit more orangey and i'm going to take a bit of the orange mix to incorporate it into each of the sections but yellow is still my main color and i'm just going to alternate the color slightly and give it a bit more richness the way i'm painting this is that the small lines or the brush strokes that i'm creating are all following the same direction towards the center and meanwhile i'm also leaving out some white negative space so they can become highlights to give more of a juicy texture to the slice so for those of you who've never heard of calamansis it's abundant all across southeast asia in fact i have a calamansi tree in the backyard and they have such bright deep yellow and juicy interior with a deep green skin and it's very sour and refreshing to put in your drinks or as condiments you might have different fruits that is special in your country and it would be really fun to incorporate that in your painting as well so once i've painted all of the sections and the paint settles and dries i'm just adding additional layer to increase the vibrancy of the colors then i'm going to paint the skin which i'm going to use a mixture of deep green and yellow ogre then i'm also going to take a little bit of yellow to brighten the green slightly to paint the skin is very simple i'm first just going to outline the outside circle so there's a bit of space for the white rhine in between the flesh and the skin and i also like to alternate the colors with a bright yellow green as well as a deeper green where there's a higher ratio of deep green and the color mixture once i've placed the deeper green i use a clean damp brush to further smooth out the color so it blends nicely the next step is very subtle i use the lighter green to paint very small dots on the inside of the skin and also a little bit on the white of the rind to give it a bit of texture and it also makes the slice look less flat and i do this all around the circle as one of the final steps i like to use a clean damp brush to gently reactivate some of the colors which are already dry to slightly color the white rind and so it doesn't look too glaringly white in comparison to the rest of the slice but be very gentle while doing this and make sure that the colors are completely dry so you won't disturb it too much try a small section first to make sure that it's fine before doing this to the whole thing so you don't accidentally end up smudging the whole slice this is just a very quick step then to finish the slice off i used the yellows again to define some of the sections slightly next i'm going to paint grapefruits and the colors i'm going to use are red which is more similar to quin red vermillion naples yellow yellow and deep green i'm going to start by creating a pink color by mixing vermilion and naples yellow and the red to adjust the tone of the pink and because i want this one to be very light pink color i'm going to add a lot of water to lighten the pink for this as an additional dark color i just either use a thicker consistency or adjust the ratio between the vermilion and red with less naples yellow then i'm going to paint it the same way as i did before by directing the brush strokes to the center while leaving some white space but this time on a larger slice when i was making this what i had in mind wasn't exactly grapefruit but where i live we have something similar to grapefruit and i think internationally it's called pomelo and we usually have the pink version here and the pink color is very light and the skin is very light yellow with a touch of green tint so that's basically what i'm trying to create for this slice even though now thinking about it though i think the rind is supposed to be much thicker than this but i just really like the color combination [Music] do [Music] do [Music] next i'm going to paint the skin and for this i'm mixing in yellow with a bit of the previous light green mixture which has a bit of the yellow ocher and yellow to create a very light yellow with the tiniest muted green tint but if you would like to make it a bright yellow you can also do that depending on what you feel like painting then i'm just applying this all around the outer circle and of course all of you know that i always like to combine different hues so i took some of the pink mixture and add some to the yellow mix to create a bit of an orange tone and apply it to some parts of the skin then blending the colors and then after that i'm just going to create those tiny dots like before and reactivate some of the paint to add a light tint to the rind just like the previous slice then if any of the sections are a bit too smudged i just go over it again after the paint is mostly dry to refine some of those sections if you want more definition you have to wait for the paper to completely dry first so you get much more clean and crisp lines but i prefer it to be a little bit blurred in some areas which is why i'm painting on the additional layer while the paper is still a tiny bit damp or cold to the touch as for the next one i'm actually going to paint grapefruit but i'm just going to use the exact same colors as before but this time i'm making the interior a bit more of a darker pink so just as a reminder the colors that i used for the flesh is a mix of naples yellow vermilion with some quinn red to adjust the tone but for this one i used less naples yellow so there's less white pigment in the mix to make it a bit darker in tone and that's also how i'm going to adjust the darker tones that i alternate but later on [Music] and for the skin of the grapefruit i used the similar color to the flesh but i just add a bit of yellow to make the color a bit more of an orangey tone rather than pink or coral then i finish off using the exact same steps with the dots smudging to get the light tint then going over some of the sections again [Music] do [Music] foreign [Music] for the next fruit we're going to paint lemons of course this is probably the simplest one i'm going to use the obvious color which is lemon yellow yellow and vermilion or you can also swap vermilion for orange for the flesh i used mostly lemon yellow for that very bright yellow color but i also added a little bit of yellow for the alternative dark tone and i'm just going to continue on by painting this like the previous slice as you've noticed this is going to be a lot of repeated steps the steps are exactly the same with all of the other slices but i'm just playing with the different color combinations and that's why it's really important to pick the colors that you like or even create your own color combinations if you would like to it doesn't even have to be real and doesn't have to exist just have fun with it and when you paint something repetitively it's always good practice for your brush and water control anyway which is why i love painting this one because it's just so easy and it also counts as exercise and on top of that you also get to play with different color combinations [Music] for the skin of the lemon i'm going to use yellow as the main color and to make the yellow bit richer i also add a bit of a mixture between yellow and a touch of vermilion for the final edition or you can also change vermilion to orange to warm the yellow further [Music] next is the orange slice so never mind about what i said before about the lemon being the easiest one this is probably the easiest one as i'm only going to use two colors which are orange and yellow as the orange and this pencil set is quite dark i like to add the addition of yellow so i can play with the hue as well as the brightness of the color slightly and for the flesh i like to use both the yellow and orange and just alternate those colors to create a light fresh and juicy orange slice i don't think i've mentioned this before but i also like to make sure that the white in between each of the sections are nice and thin because i find that this makes the slice look extra juicy [Music] do [Music] do [Music] for this one at the bottom because the grapefruit is quite dark in color compared to the rest of the composition i wanted something light below the grapefruit so it doesn't look too heavy at the bottom in terms of the weight of the composition which is why i decided to repaint a lemon slice using the same color and techniques as the rest of the slices but of course it's up to you you can really create any other citrus slices that you would like to [Music] [Music] as for the last slice i want to create lime because the calamansi is looking a little bit lonely with the only green on the page and for this one i used three colors which are deep green lemon yellow and yellow ochre for the flesh of the lime i first create a muted light green by using a mixture of yellow ochre and deep green then i adjust the brightness by adding the lemon yellow to the mix it depends on how green you would like to make the lime so you can adjust the ratio to your personal taste [Music] for the skin of the lime i used the exact same mixture but adjusted the ratio so there's a bit more deep green so this color is not as bright as the color of the flesh [Music] do [Music] to finish everything off i've decided to add little dots in different sizes using the colors that i have left on my palette from the individual slice mixtures or you can also add things like leaves flowers or even juice droplets using the spare color mixtures to fill in the space and decorate the page lastly i've made very small dots to balance and bring the composition together and that's it for this painting this is the finished page of the citrus slices if you're still here thank you so much for watching till the end like usual all of the tools and my social media links will be in the description box i've also left the community contributions open for those of you who would like to add subtitles to this tutorial thank you so much for watching and i'll see you at the next one bye [Music] you", "J_xp05n-Qew": "hello and welcome my name is Caitlin this is Tinkerbell and this one is Miko and it is a winter which means for all your foodies out there that is citrus season so if you're making a lot of citrus salads and you have lots of extra peel lying around or if you have ate a few extra little bits of citrus I'm going to show you two ways how to super easily candy citrus so both candied citrus peel and candied citrus slices all you'll need is a bowl of citrus fruits I have lemon blood orange grapefruit and Cangelosi R but you can use any citrus you like and sugar so let's get started I'm going to be making both the candied slices and the candied rinds at the same time so if you want to do that too you will need two saucepans if you'd prefer a single recipe or you like it written down I will add the link to my blog with both of those recipes below so first off put a pot of water to boil we're going to blanch the rind and as we wait for that to boil we'll go ahead and make the simple syrup for the slices so here you're going to need three cups of sugar and three cups of water depending on how much or how little you're doing it's just one part sugar to one part water so however much you need go ahead and give that a mix put it on a medium to medium-high heat and wait for it to boil meanwhile go ahead and slice up your whole fruits taking off the ends that have lots of pith on them pith is that white stuff on the inside into really fine slices and once that simple syrup is boiling and your slices are finished we can start placing them in your saucepan now you can overlap your slices but we don't want to stack them on top of each other we need all of that sugar to be able to get in every single part of that citrus fruit and these are simple set your timer for 40 minutes and just let them go while those are simmering away we can start to get through rinds ready so you just want to cut the rind off whatever citrus you're using it is a totally okay to leave the piss on but you want to make sure that you can use a spoon to get any extra citrus actual fruit that is stuck to that rind then we go ahead and slice them up in super thin slices after all of that is chopped up your water should be boiling by now and so go ahead and put it in we're going to keep this in the boiling water for about 10 minutes this is called blanching we're just taking some of the bitterness out of those rinds before we add the sugar to them with your ten minutes up go ahead and use either a slotted spoon or one of these spiderweb ladles that I have here to take everything out and place it on a wire rack over a cookie chute just to let some of that water drain off gets it a little dry but we are putting them back into a liquid so it's not that big of a deal how dry they are once again we're adding simple syrup I used two cups of sugar and 2 cups of water here because I did quite a bit of peel and all of that rind pops back in to your pot stir it around and it will simmer for another about 10 minutes and just as those were going in my 40-minute timer went off and as you can see they are super translucent so I'm going to use my tongs to lie those slices flat out on that same cookie sheet letting lots of that sugar water drain off and giving them a little bit of time to dry off so they can get sticky and tacky before we put them in some sugar my rinds are ready to come out they go back on that same cookie sheet and after all of those are ready to go we wait about 30 minutes to an hour depending on how dry the climate is where you are it doesn't take much time in Colorado for some of that water to evaporate off while those are drying I popped a little funnel on a mason jar I'm going to save that simple syrup that is now citrus flavored and delicious it's a great thing to use instead of sugar and lemonade or cocktails absolutely delicious put that in a jar screw the lid on and you can keep it in the fridge for at least a couple weeks now that my slices my rinds are super tacky you can tell if they are attacking and sticky enough by putting your finger on them and it kind of sticks a little bit so I'm adding about half a cup of sugar into a bowl and we're going to coat both sides of those slices with that sugar and then the rind gets tossed around in there as well give these a couple minutes to set so some of that sugar soaks back into the rind and you are good to go these are sweet and tart great to eat by them own garnish drinks or add on top of a salad for a little hint of sweetness so sorry about the lighting right here I took away too long making lots of different batches mm-hmm oh this candy is citrus yeah I know I probably tastes like sugar but I'll put in a clip of the final product so you can see it a little better than over here but super delicious and let me know what your favorite citrus recipes are I'd love to see them in the comments below

hi sweet friends my name is Mary and welcome to Mary's nest this channel is all about living the simple life by cooking from scratch making home remedies and creating a cozy home using thrift store finds so if you're like me and you like living the simple life be sure to subscribe to my channel and don't forget to click on the little notification bell below that'll let you know every time I upload a new video now these citrus chips couldn't be easier to make and you have two options if you have an electric dehydrator you're all set and if you don't and you just want to do it in your oven you're all set too if you decide to do this on an electric dehydrator all you need is a dehydrator tray you won't need the extra silicone sheets just the plain dehydrator tray is perfect and if you decide to do this in an oven well you're gonna want to have is a baking sheet and then some kind of wrap some kind of rack that lifts up from the baking sheet just to allow for good air circulation now you all you'll want to do is just get some nice oranges that you've washed and are dried and we're going to want to slice them and 1/8 inch thick so it's pretty thin I'm not always perfect at it sometimes they lean to the quarter inch but just do the best job that you can to get them as thin as possible we'll get that part off and then all we're gonna do is just slice them as thin as we can and we're just going to keep going and then once we get ones that have nice bit of fruit in it we'll just put it right onto our dehydrator tray and if you're using a baking sheet you'll just hold that so when to full you'll just put that right on your baking sheet and if you want you can align your baking sheet with aluminum foil just to make cleanup easy now if you decide to you to do this in an electric dehydrator you're going to want to set the temperature at a hundred and twenty-five degrees Fahrenheit and it's going to take about eight to ten hours check on it at eight hours but it's probably going to take you know between eight to and ours and what you'll be looking for is these to be dry and hard and if you decide to do them in an oven you're going to want to set your oven at a hundred and seventy-five degrees and it's going to take four to six hours and every two hours you're going to want to take the trays out of the oven and rotate them and then put them back into your oven and as the same as I said with the electric dehydrator you're going to watch for them to be completely dried out and hard and here is a batch that I took out of my oven after six hours the ones of my dehydrator is still going and the nice thing about citrus chips is that not only do you get the benefit from the fruit you also get benefit from eating the rind which is rich in essential oils now once these are dry they're just delightful and they're very crispy see and they're perfect for serving maybe with a cottage cheese based type dip that maybe you sprinkle some cinnamon on or maybe sour cream that you add a little powdered sugar and a little lemon juice you know the ones the dips that sort of lean to like little slightly sweeter side these are perfect for that if you'd like to learn more about dehydrating be sure to subscribe to my channel and then click on this video over here where I show you how to dehydrate sourdough starter and more and I look forward to seeing you over there in my Texas Hill Country kitchen love and God bless mmm don't crunchy [Music]", "RXAGPDjKi7E": "wait okay okay hello everybody I am Sarah Cree with let's make art and we like to watercolor I think you like to watercolor out we we like we like okay anyway we are doing this sliced citrus today beautiful it's fresh vibrant I'm using my reference photo as you the reference photo that enter your kits I'm using that today it's fine we're fine we're painting it big size this is just for you to look at while we're paying it so you know what goes where this is the first project in a September box so that's great all good news we are using three colors today we have Tahoe blue dandelion yellow and magenta and you will notice that they now come in these wonderful bottles that just open and drop there childproof sorry it's fine okay great stop I'm really excited about this okay so I put the three colors on my palette and you guys can see my palette right now because I'm actually going to use this Center to mix like half of the colors that we have on this painting we're gonna mix and just to give you just a quick info about mixing primary colors are red yellow and blue you mix those colors to get purple and green and orange which is essentially what we're doing so if we're mixing out pink for red and that's great I'll lead you through the rest and we have four steps to this project so first step we're gonna put in our large citrus here so we have the big guys then we're gonna start putting in our medium citrus and then we have our small citrus oh wait maybe I should go through the steps one one large citrus here and here two medium cities I have paint all over me at all times listen I'm an artist okay one large citrus to medium citrus three can you guess small citrus smoke you got it all small citrus for the leaves no but what the one project where details is not our last step so I'm really excited to get this going the brushes I'm using our round 6 and around to our go-to brushes they're fabulous I'm gonna start with around 6 since we're starting large and usually when you're doing something like florals or kind of like a loose composition like this it's usually always a good idea to put your big items in first and then your medium and then your small and that way you fill up that whole area and it kind of grows together okay so I'm going to start with this first large citrus here which is orange so I'm going to grab a little bit of my yellow and pull it in the middle of my tray and then grab a little bit of the pink and mix that together till I get orange just a little it's just like a swoop if you want to grab more so you have extra to pull from you can and then just mixing colors so this is an orange I'm happy with if you're mixing and it's reading too pink grab some yellow if you're mixing and it's breeding too yellow grab a little bit more pink but be I was more timid with my pink because this magenta is a very strong color and it can easily overpower it and turn it into a different color okay so if you want a deeper orange you do a tiny bit more of the magenta so I'm gonna start with outlining the citrus and so it's a circle shape but I don't want you to stress about if it's like perfectly thick all the way around or if it's slightly lopsided it's so difficult to draw a perfect circle and that's not what this project is about so don't stress about that just draw a circle and the great thing about this is like citrus like depending on the angle that you're looking at it one side is gonna be a little bit thicker than other it's not going to be a perfect circle that kind of thing okay great let's get started so I'm going to do my circle I'm going to start on the upper part of my paper on the more on the right-hand side don't start right in the middle because that's gonna be harder composition wise for you so we're going to start I'm just going to make my circle here and you can see this is more of an oval shape I love it it's fine don't stress about this these circles being perfect exactly and then I'm just gonna drop in some paint along the edges here because I'm a gal who likes color variation I am I you know I live on the edge that's what I always say the green button is still on okay so I just finished my circle remember you are more than welcome to go back and maybe thicken it in some areas this side is thinner than this side on this orange so I'm gonna just thicken that up just a tiny bit if you like it thinner on one side that's fine don't think and end up then this is your painting after all okay now I'm going to do my citrus slices so with the slices the individual slices within the orange I'm going to leave a thin white space in between the edge and the slice itself so and I kind of just follow the safe of the circle here I'm leaving a thin white strip and then I'm gonna bring that to the middle of my paper so it looks like a pizza slice and then I'm gonna fill it in but I don't want to fill it in just totally even because with citrus it's wet so it glistens that's what all of these white marks are here so if you look at the lemon or orange or whatever you'll see that there's actually a lot of white marks in there from the moisture and the light reflecting off of that so we want to replicate that and so when I fill it in I'm going to kind of do these fill in these areas but I'm gonna leave little white chunks just like that and then always dropping a little touch of color here here great and then you just kind of repeat that step over and over till your citrus is filled and I'm leaving a thin white line in between my next slice rain in start to fill it in but leave some white spaces and the white spaces are random there's not like rhyme or reason to them you know you know they don't have to be on one side or anything it's kind of just filling them in and there might be an area like this kind of touched the outside of my rim here that's okay it's fine it happens the biggest thing is just not to stress about those little things and sometimes just for fun because we're wild here you can just drop in some yellow if you want and just get a different color variation so that's a drop of yellow that you can see but I feel like it almost brightens our orange a little bit too to have that other color in there we're just gonna make our way around fill it in leave some white spaces droppin some color and move on you can also see that my little wedges here they're not all the same size that's okay this is a very relaxing chill project it's more just the fun of it and if anything I think it gives your oranges a little bit more character gosh I love that yellow I dropped in there I look so good okay that's our first orange slice that's great now we're going to move on to our larger slice which I see as a grapefruit because it kind of is that pinky color so I'm just gonna grab some of this pink here this magenta and then I'm gonna add it's gonna be mostly magenta and I'm just going to take a touch of that orange and bring it in because grapefruits have that like light pink color but it's not like a purple pink it's like a yellow pink oh you know what I'm talking about and then I'm just like you know all about grapefruit and I'm just gonna go down it's gonna be kind of like angled on the bottom left hand side I'm gonna do my grapefruit over here and it's the same thing I'm just gonna do my circle look at that and then I'm just gonna drop in some color and then I'm going to start with my slices so I do an angled line to the middle that's a little bit deeper than the middle and then just start to fill it in and I'm going to widen this one a little bit because I made it but it seemed a little too narrow I like to have a nice wide top and it goes to a nice point so I'm just going to widen that up and the other thing that you can do within these citruses is some of them this is a dark wash which just means it has more paint than water and the next slice can be a light wash so I just rinsed my brush like I kind of just dipped it in water I didn't totally rinse it and I'm just gonna use that light pink to make the next one because we get this really nice soft paint going and you can drop in color if you want the dramatic center then we move on remember to leave these white parts and I know it's hard because when you start to fill it in you're going to get into a rhythm of how to fill it in and just kind of be aware of that because we want the white marks to not be in the same place for every single wedge so kind of it's it's really just being aware of it and being like okay I did some maybe I'll do some white marks in this next one in the center I'm going to leave some white spots there we go now this painting is definitely more illustrative illa illa billah' straight away that's it and that just means that we're not trying to make this look realistic we're not focusing so much on light and shadow and creating form this is just more of a basic interpretation of orange slices so it's more of an illustration and that's what I love hopefully you guys love it too I'm just dropping in some stronger magenta in some of these places because I am all about color variation that's what I always say great now we have our grapefruit isn't it pretty I love that color great job yeah I would say those are about two and a half inches to two and I'll give me give me an inch no it's fine yeah a couple inches now we're going to go to step two which is our medium citrus here and I'm gonna start with my lemons and for the lemons I'm just using yellow so I'm going to pull out some yellow move it to the side in some of the areas we're going to play with a little bit of green a little bit of orange and a little bit of green but for now I'm just gonna start with the yellow and so this one is just gonna be smaller just a little bit smaller we don't want it as tiny as our limes so I would say like an inch and a half right maybe maybe close to two inches but bigger than these and I'm gonna kind of go more underneath it but a little bit more to the left and I'm going to do my circle BAM then BAM I think that somebody else's catchphrase okay just drop in some color okay and then I'm going to start with my slices now since we're using one color yellow for this the thing I want you to keep in mind is really kind of play with the amount of water you have on your brush so I'm going to start with a strong colored wedge so I have lots of paint on my brush fill that in and then this next wedge I'm just going to I didn't pick up any more paint because I want it to be a lighter yellow but I dipped it in water to make it a lighter color and then maybe one more time let's see how light I can let's see how light I can go it's pretty light I'm gonna drop in a little bit of color and just keep on going all the way around I'm gonna do a big wedge over here and you can introduce a little bit of orange not too much because we don't want it confused with our actual orange slices just a little here and there Gorge was beautiful looking great and we're going to keep going I'm going to do another lemon and it's going to be in the bottom over here now remember I mean we don't have an outline for this so you guys are free handing this which is awesome first of all I'm giving you props because sometimes it's stressful to do that but the other thing you have to keep in mind is because we're not using an outline it's going to look slightly different this one is going to look slightly different than this one and that's just because the placement is not going to be exact but that doesn't mean your painting is wrong you know what it's so hard to draw a circle I'm not great at it which is why this project I'm like these are gonna be loose funky it's gonna be great so I'm gonna do another one over here it's gonna be a slightly lower than this grapefruit and just do your best oh that turned out a little bit bigger that's okay kind of I'm kind of my circle got funky so I'm just gonna adjust it in some areas there even in my reference photo that one looks a little wobbly but I like him put in some color I like walk with amendments give me all the wobbly lemons okay now I'm gonna start putting in my slices and drop in some color I'm going to do more kind of just at the tip here Allen do you have a do you have a citrus story you want to share so if you want that you feel like sharing that or maybe maybe not all the way around remember to leave those white spaces within the slices and in between the slices gorgeous so beautiful now we have one other medium size to do that's our orange I got to mix some more orange you know somebody kind of asked me I think it was actually one of the comments on YouTube like what do you do if you mix a color and then you run out of it and you have to keep using that color I just kind of mix as I go and there are gonna be slight differences but I'm just the type of person where I embrace those differences and I let it go if it really stresses you out that there's slightly different colors then I would encourage you to kind of mix a lot at the beginning in a separate area and that way you can just pull from that the whole time but honestly I think it's almost like the type of personality you are I am NOT a super organized person I'm very go with the flow type of person and so it's like I'll just mix more paint it's fine but always an art school I would have I would have fellow students who would just mix their palate beforehand and it was beautiful their palate was just gorgeous and totally organized and so much paint that that's all they need it for the whole painting and mine was not that way at all it was it really actually looked like this we're just all of these areas where I was just mixing all of these colors and it's not bad I don't think there's like a wrong girl listen I'm not saying that's wrong okay I think it's just the type of I don't know I don't want to say like person but maybe like personality you are who knows oh that's a good one I'm a Virgo you guys tell me what that means okay and then I'm just gonna start putting in my slices here so first I draw my pizza slice you can adjust it if it's too narrow then I fill it in tryin here have your edges be as straight as you can I'm actually going to move this to the side sometimes I move things around to help with my straight edges so I'm just gonna kind of like pull and then I get a straighter edge it's easier for me than trying to like completely work vertically and if that your sections you think are too like maybe that white section is too thick so I can just go in and redo that line make it thinner just like that maybe drop in some yellow this one kind of touched my rim there that's okay I feel like whatever happens even if your oranges get a little bit wonky I think it just kind of adds character to this illustration sometimes it's okay to be a bit wonky okay we put in our medium citrus you guys we did it that's step two we're halfway done pretty much okay so now step three we're putting in our small citrus I have one small little grapefruit up here grapefruits aren't small so I took some creative license there and then we did some limes and remember you don't have to follow this color exactly maybe you would rather have the orange down here and a yellow over there whatever this is you're painting okay I'm teaching you the way you did it but I'm giving you permission to do whatever you want okay so I'm just going to make us a little bit more grapefruit get this gorgeous peachy pink color magenta and a little bit of yellow or you can mix it in with like the orange that we already had going so this little guy's kind of up here in between these two and it's gonna be a small small perfect and then this is where you might actually want to switch to your round two just because it's a smaller brush so you have a just a little bit more control and we're going to fill in bring to our pizza slices and just kind of keep going around sometimes I like to just kind of go around and just kind of naturally let it because the more you paint without like picking up paint the lighter your color is going to get right because it's kind of running out and some I just like to let that go and then when it's when it's out I grab I grab another brush full you can drop in color here so some of these are really tiny so just try and focus and to get thin lines with your round two then soft lines you just are really light with your pressure almost barely touching that paint brush to the page there's our cute little grapefruit so cute you can also even do water droplet textures in here let's do that let's go crazy I'm going to do all my orange still cuz I can see that it's still wet if your painting is already dry like these down here are dry so if I put a water droplet on that it's not going to spread it's just gonna kind of like hang out there okay now I'm going to mix for my lime colors and this is I'm actually going to use my bigger brush to mix on my palette I'm just gonna grab some yellow put it over here by my blue and I'm just gonna grab a tiny bit of blue because we want it this to be a really light green the more blue you add to it the more darker green it's going to get so that's why we want it mostly yellow with a little bit of blue then I'm going to switch back to my round to pick up from that and start putting in my lime so I have three one two three so I'm gonna do this one over here and remember the outside rim of your citrus can be as thick or as thin as you want it I've been switching it up doing some thin doing some thick and we're doing our pizza slices now remember to still keep those white sections in those tiny little slices if you can I know that we're working really small here so if you end up covering some that's not a big deal just kind of keep it in mind okay we have another little lime over here I just added a little bit darker green because I am because I'm crazy you guys I'm wild that's when you laugh you're like okay cool yes yeah wait was he in the military cuz I feel like I've heard that and then I feel like I also heard that that wasn't true you guys tell me tell me if you know if you know about Bob Ross if you've read a biography what do you know oh also I was looking at our squirrel comments al and there are somebody worked at a shelter and squirrels do need rescuing she's told us do you remember for her Jill yeah you're like dis girl's name threat scream just like they do so thank you well I feel like if places like our like you know natural disasters are occurring they would die there's a hurricane around you don't want to just let the squirrels out the hurricane will suck him up right doesn't a hurricane just like things up as a hurricane much different from a tornado I thought a hurricane was like a tornado but water based listen let us know who's right here I was wrong about the rhombic okay I admit that that's from a previous tutorial some of you might know Joe's okay so now I have another lime to put in here now what I think I'm actually going to do no never mind I'm gonna put I'm gonna keep I'm gonna keep going with what I got going on here I'm gonna put a little in between a little bit lower over here do those well my center got way off over here that is a very wobbly off-center line it's all right it's just a lime it's not serious it's just a painting I'm going to drop in some yellow for fun for funsies you guys step three done check now we're just doing leaves leaves are fun leaves are fun because they're just super chill and you can really play with different color and watercolor textures within the leaves so it's a great time so I'm gonna go back to my round six to actually do these leaves and I'm gonna mix some more blue and I'm actually gonna have a few different greens going on so I'm gonna have this green here which is like a very bluish green and then I'm gonna grab some more yellow over here and get more of a true green going on here and then I'm going to leave this yellow over here for because some of my leaves are going to be maybe close to my lime and then also if you want you can even mix a little bit of this blue and a little bit of this magenta to get a purple and you can do some purple leaves if you want I'm gonna stay with in green though listen Oh a plum tree we're gonna start and to do to do my leaves I just I do them two ways I either outline them like so and then fill them in like that and don't forget to do a little droplets of water in this this is the fun part or you can just do it with one brushstroke a leaf now this is a little bit harder technique so you might want to practice on a scratch paper if you're not used to it buckle up folks this is hard sometimes for me it's hard I'm going to take my brush and I'm gonna do light pressure to get a soft point and then I press down to get the belly of my leaf and then I lighten it up and that's a leaf like that you do watercolor texture in there and sometimes even when I do that though I want to like reshape them so I'm like Ben you do leaves how you feel right doing leaves these are your leaves so we're just going to go around and start putting in leaves and I kind of just have them kind of just coming out from the citrus they're various sizes so kind of just fill it in as you go kind of here I'm gonna change up that green because it's right next to that lime so I'm going to introduce this more blue green over here and if you want your leaves to be a little bit darker to have like a brown color to it you can mix in some of that magenta and you're gonna get like a really desaturated green if that's too much mixing for you don't worry about it but just kind of play with these colors see what these colors can do see what things you can make so there's there's it mixed in with a little bit of the magenta see how it kind of has like a grayer color than that it's a cool color I like it so we're just gonna go crazy with our leaves I'm not so concerned putting in our citrus I started large and then worked small with my leave since they're kind of just going everywhere I'm not as concerned about like putting the big ones in first I'm kind of just going for it but a tip that I would like to recommend is I usually don't like it when there's too much of the same color in the same area like these three leaves are like all the same color right so I need to switch that up so I'm just going to add a little bit of this brighter green in between here and that way there's a color change in between and you can have some tiny little leaves if you want that one turned out bigger let's do a tiny one right here and you can also leave like centers in yours almost like a white just like that so it's almost acting as like a vein I'm going to drop in a little bit of blue here at the base here but just keep in mind that you can play with the pressure of your brushes to get [Music] just get those you know points and then that nice round edge and then back to a point also kind of play with the wash thickness so this is a light wash here I have a lot of water on my brush and a little bit of pain but it almost looks like a totally different color now just because it's a lighter wash so keep that in mind that you can you have that option to kind of lighten it up [Music] thinking of my plum tree that was a win if I had won it was that one that's a blue leaf I like that listen I'm almost done now okay yes nope I don't know this probably is gonna be a little bit different than the reference photo yours is going to be different from mine we love it we embrace those differences you kind of just go until it feels like it's full as you go you're gonna kind of see chunks and you're gonna see like blank areas that you're gonna be like man I should probably put a leaf there so you're the one that's kind of feeling out your painting as you go now like right here I'm like you know that's looking a little empty so I'm just going to put just a tiny little leaf right here and I'm using my round six for all of this you can drop in water color some water to get these really cool texture spots you see that see that out you really do so I'm keep that in mind to kind of drop in color or drop in water and you're gonna get different textures I call them like I mean I know this doesn't make sense I don't think it's a technical turn term but I call them like burns like watercolor burns I don't know when I like drop in like I would call that like a watercolor burn I don't know why that's just what I do in my head so that's what I'm calling it new name these kind of textures I'm calling them watercolor burns that's what it is I don't I don't have a word for that yet if you guys have an idea for a word let me know skaars yes no I don't like scars yeah no that's so gross scab comment with what you think it should be what are some other words I love that tell me I don't know listen I just like to paint if you want that strong see how some of these have like a really strong color that's just dropping in color while it's still wet oh look at that guy yeah and just kind of mix up your your value variation some of these are very dark in value and some of these are very light and value those are the ones that are just the light washes mix those up we don't want it to be an even value for all of our leaves because we want to just have it be a little bit more visually interesting and just drop in some color just like that okay I'm feeling pretty good about my leave placement I think there's one area on this right-hand side over here that's looking a little bare maybe a tiny little guy right here you guys we did it the end that was Step four leaves nailed it done so if you do this project which I absolutely hope you do share it with us we have a Facebook group let's make art together you can post it in there so everybody can see it or you can tag us our Instagram name is let's go make art so go ahead and tag a see what for all of them yes for all of them that's right let's go make art and and if you're new to watercolor and you're not really sure what to do watch the lives because the lives I do warmups I kind of take my time a little bit explaining more what's going on so feel free to take a look at that we're gonna do this live on Tuesday September 4 7:15 Central Standard Time we'll be doing this live come with questions hope to see you guys there thank you so much bye", "LFDaZo6FcEM": "I'm going to show you how I make candied citrus slices and of course you can use either lemons or oranges your favorite and you can have those with your tea so delicious and also decorate your desserts cakes cupcakes so there are many purposes you can use those for and we need to start by making the syrup for syrup we just simply need some sugar and virus and I usually do it in a shallow white pen so I can do a couple of this at any time simply add this together you need a quick mix bring it to a boil and simmer about three three to four minutes I'd say until it starts to kindly reduce so I'll set this aside and you want to slice your lemons or oranges pretty thin but not very thin so when they cook they don't become very fragile okay so when making the lemons remove the seeds of course and just slice them evenly and for the orange I want to do half of the slice because these are very large oranges I mean what one large orange so I'll I'll quickly slice this and show you how I make this and keep watching or stirring the syrup as well so it doesn't burn and in this case we don't need afraid of burning because it just started to just stir it once in a while so I'll quickly slice this and go from there so I've started to simmer and as soon as it comes to a boil reduce the heat to medium you don't want to make it a caramel so and you know if sugar and water starts to cook together on high heat they'll become it become a caramel so we don't want to make it at this time and simply immerse those lemons and later I'll do them oranges and I also added a couple of mandarins just for the color and variety and I'd say probably four to five minutes on each side you will cook four to five minutes and then place it on a rack to cool down and of course to dry out a couple of hours and then that simple as simple as that and then you can enjoy it although couple show you how it looks and we'll be done these are done and what you're looking for is something slightly the skin should be slightly translucent it means these are ready to come out and for the matter is I was trying all those first time they turn out to be very fragile and so I wouldn't really suggest to make those but it's up to it you can also make those as well okay so as always I will live detail a recipe on my blog at Helena comm you can check that out and one more thing you can do with these lemons and oranges you can dip them in chocolate but you shouldn't hamper the chocolate or you can simply get them in granulated sugar but be sure to leave this to dry out at least five to seven hours before before you do anything else because see I just dipped in sugar and it almost absorb that sugar because it is still kind of wet so that's it very simple easy and keep this in mind because I'm going to make a next video for them video one lemon cake so we're going to decorate the cake with these lemons let's sit thank you everyone for watching subscribe to my channel like the video and I'll see you very soon oh yeah Flemish", "rJiz1mNzK1s": "[Music] hi i'm erica from farmsteady and today we're going to make a fermented citrus hot sauce this hot sauce is bright citrusy and searingly hot and very very orange because why not for this recipe we use whole oranges peels and all so that you get a super citrus taste but don't worry we're going to take those up before we blend if you want to tone down the heat you can swap in another fruit forward pepper like fresno's or just use more bell pepper and fewer habaneros to try and balance that out but we like it hot and if you follow this channel you know we love adding fruit to hot sauces so definitely check out our other videos for hot sauces with pineapple mango peach and more we'll be making a half gallon batch using our farm study fermenter but if you need to scale the full recipe is in the description now let's get started and make this fermented citrus hot sauce for this recipe you'll need a bunch of habaneros two oranges one bell pepper sliced one onion slice that up one garlic clove slice that two and two and a half tablespoons of salt to make your brine use four cups of water and your salt [Music] now whisk that all together until the salt's dissolved there you go now let's prep those hot peppers we recommend gloves for this for these peppers this one's a scotch bonnet you want to just scoop out the seeds and get rid of that stem we like removing the seeds so that the finished hot sauce has a smoother consistency now repeat for all [Music] we're using a mix of habaneros and scotch bonnet peppers scotch bonnets often are labeled habanero at the grocery store and work great for this recipe for your oranges we use blood oranges this time you want to remove the ends and then carefully slice off the peels but reserve those we're going to use them later [Music] then slice the orange slicing your orange this way makes it super easy to spot and pop out those seeds so they don't go into your fermenter and this one is super cool and striped while we use blood oranges regular oranges work great now let's get everything into your [Music] fermenter now start layering peppers onions garlic some of those bell peppers that's gonna help bring down the heat and those oranges don't add any peels yet we're going to use those at the very top [Music] now just layer all of those in there there you go [Music] now we're going to use these peels as a barrier before the weight to keep anything from floating up and to really infuse this hot sauce with a ton of citrus flavor now add your fermentation weight and top with that brine [Music] perfect add your lid and airlock and ferment away after fermenting for two to three weeks your hot sauce is ready to blend the fermenter should be a little bit cloudy and you'll want to just discard those peels on the top and don't put them in the blender after your hot sauce is done fermenting you want to open it up remove that fermentation weight we use gloves for this too and then carefully take out all those peels you don't want to add those to the blender they've done their job there you go now let's get this into the blender we're going to just scoop up all the solids and put them in your blender [Music] we really embraced the orange color going into this with both the hot peppers the bell pepper and of course the oranges that we added so the finished sauce is going to be super pretty and orange the brine's kind of pretty too pour off one cup of the brine that's going to go into the blender [Music] and also one cup of white vinegar [Music] now blend away and you can absolutely blend this in batches if you're working with a smaller blender now let's get it into bottles and just use a funnel and fill this up after you've moved your hot sauce into bottles and jars you want to store them in the fridge and get started on your next batch your finished hot sauce is bright citrusy and this fantastic vibrant orange we love it pretty much on anything but especially seafood dishes so fish tacos crab cakes shrimp and grits this is our go-to pick for those we think you're gonna love it too for the full recipe and all our fermentation kits check out farmsteady.com and definitely subscribe to this channel and we'll keep the videos coming", "jSCerhlDCeI": "hey guys you a here so today is the day three of my three day series of arethe making where I am trying to find materials and plants in my own garden that I can incorporate in holiday wreaths so today wreath is going to be more of a traditional kind where I'm incorporating evergreen conifers that I have in my own garden but I was always looking for a theme for my wreath so the first one was kind of her earth tones the second one was red and silver and this one is going to be a blue wreath so I found three evergreens in my own backyard that have kind of like a blue tint to them so those are the ones that I'm going to be incorporating in this last wreath so I think Luke decided to join me in this blue themed breeze because he has beautiful blue eyes so he got a note you are so cute so as for the plants today I have Leyland cypress and Leyland cypress is a wonderful plant wonderful evergreen if you want a very fast hedge in your garden or some sort of a quick screen it grows really fast so you know how all plants have kind of good parts to them and not so good parts to them so Leyland cypress is kind of like one of those it is a beautiful plant beautiful structure takes snow load really well does not snap but it grows incredibly fast so you buy this cute plant that is six feet tall and you decide to create a hedge and then in few years you're out there with pruners non-stop chopping it down because it's just getting out of control but if you want to use Leyland cypress in a lot of your holiday decorations you don't mind it growing so fast so you can chop it down at the end of the season and use it in all kind of holiday decorations like Garland's or wreaths or even cover up part of your garden on the ground so that's why I actually planted a hedge of leyland cypresses at the back of our property it is not the best choice again because you constantly have to prune it but I use these all the time so they actually kind of can't even keep up with my demand but anyway it has beautiful blue tinge to it it is more on the green side but the underside is more of the blue and it is going to be my base for this wreath I am using a wire form today instead of a grapevine wreath because conifers have so much bulk in them you don't really need a grapevine wreath to start you only need a wire form my next plan is blue spruce and this is a columnar type because I've had this one for about 15 years and it's still quite small as it goes for spruces it's probably about 12 feet tall and 6 feet wide that's it it is truly beautiful blue color needles now a lot of times before I took my plant identification class I was confused between spruces and firs so I actually kind of learned this trick that furs are friendly so they don't have very pokey needles the needles are kind of soft and spruces are spiky so it's friendly fur spiky spruce and that's how you could tell the difference so you can just go around and touch the needles and if there are pokey that's a spruce so anyway these these are going to be my kind of elements in this wreath but this has just such a beautiful light blue color to it now the last one that I'm using I am NOT hundred percent sure of the variety but I'm pretty sure that's a Cypress and I'm almost 95% sure this is a baby blue sawara Cypress so it has these beautiful fine texture needles and also kind of a darker blue than the Spruce so it is a color in between the Leyland cypress and the blue spruce you all right so the main part is done and this is always the point where I just want to stop because it's looking so simple and beautiful maybe just a couple of pinecones and hanging up and that's it it also smells really good but what I'm going to do next actually I'm going to add some dried oranges and grapefruit and I've had some laying around in my kitchen I am NOT one of those people who would normally waste any food but the ones that I had in my fruit bowl were like not looking so hot so I slice them up and I dried them so there are a couple of ways you can dry citrus which is you can dry them on the radiator over a period of a week or a week and a half or you can dry them in the oven for about two hours at 200 degrees so kind of like a slow heat so they don't burn so I actually the ones that I have here are both I dried someone their radiator it probably took about a week we have very dry air in the house right now because of the heat so it actually I can't even tell the difference which ones I did in an oven and which ones I did in the radiator and just make sure that they're kind of hard and dry because you don't want them to get old moldy and messy on your wreath so what else I have here that I wanted to add to the cerise are these Rose of Sharon seed pods and they are you know kind of invasive in your garden so I constantly cut the seed pods so they don't spread all over the place I don't have the heart to cut the entire shrub because it is very pretty and Mike really loves it but I'm on the seed heads all the time I cut them all the time so and they are really actually pretty this is the first time I've using them in decorations and they're already dried so I don't have to do anything so I'm just going to add them to the wreath and also I'm going to add some cinnamon sticks they smell amazing so it's going to be kind of like a culinary wreath in the end but also I think the fragrance from the spruce and all these evergreens and also the citrus and the cinnamon [Music] alright guys so the third wreath is done and I really like how this turned out I know this one is more traditional than the other two but I think it's also unique in its own way so I hope you enjoyed this three day series and the whole point of it was to show you some plants that you can use from your own garden to use in winter decorations and if you don't have those plants maybe thinking about planting them next spring or this spring coming springy whatever but what I wanted to say I actually asked my mom and dad and Mike which wreaths they liked the most and it was not surprising but everybody said the different thing so my mom really liked all of them of course my dad hated the first one the grass wreath but he really liked the second one with euonymus and the berries Michael really likes this one so let me know in the comments section below which one was your favorite and why anyway thank you so much guys and I really enjoyed this was a lot of fun let me know if you have any questions I'll see you next video thanks you", "EgiG_UFSUAI": "today is all about tried orange slices you'll need a chopping board a metal rack some gelatine oranges lemons if you like and a very sharp knife very carefully slice through your oranges try and get as thin as you can but just be careful not to chop your fingers off in the process you at this point place your slices between two tea towels and swish out some of the juice I actually forgot to do that when I was filming in some of my pieces I like to insert cloves it just gives a really pretty effect so with a cocktail stick you can pierce some holes into the skin or the oranges and then it's easier to pop in the closed you I leave most of my slices plain but I also like to jazz things up a little bit by adding gelatine powder to some of the slices this gives a really pretty shiny effect when they're baked and hardened so just sprinkle a generous amount onto both sides of the slices and this will become really sticky when they're being baked so be very prepared for that you once that's done you can place all your pieces onto the metal rack if you don't have a metal rack or don't want to use your metal rack you can use parchment paper instead I just prefer to use the metal rack you can use lemons and grapefruits and other citrus fruits they all look really lovely if you can cross pips leave them in because it does adds to the beauty of the slices you once that's all sliced then put them between a tea towel and just squish out some of the juice and then this way it will dry out a little bit quicker so these are going to dry out a bit quicker than my orange slices you pop them into the oven at 100 degrees centigrade or gas mark quarter leave for about an hour remove them and turn them over you'll find the ones which are plain turn over much easier and the ones that were coated in the gelatine powder may stick a little bit but you know don't worry about it it adds a beautiful effect when it's finished so just unstick it pop it back into the oven for another half an hour and just keep checking it and turning them over every now and again if the slices are super sticky then just use the spatula or a knife to price it off and turn it around you once you're happy with them remove from the oven and place onto a drying rack they will still feel slightly damp especially the ones which had the gelatine on them they'll still be a bit sticky but as they dry out it will become very crispy and very shiny you over the days and weeks your orange slices will darken and if you're anything like me and keep them for years they will darken even more like the ones at the top of this photo thank you very much for watching this video I hope you've enjoyed it and happy crafting", "X2Qow3bRfx8": "today we're going to make some dehydrated citrus fruits in the oven these are great for adding two waters and teas to give them a bit of extra flavor and you don't need to keep them in the fridge so you can keep them in your desk drawer you can take them on hikes and have some lovely flavored water whenever you want it so to start out pre-heat your oven to the lowest setting it'll go on for a lot of people that's going to be around 100 C so I'm setting mine to about the same even though mine does go lower so I'm going to do an orange and a lemon and to start out and cutting the ends off of the orange and the lemon because we don't want those and then you want to try and slice them very very thinly just in you slicing the quicker they're going to dehydrate and if they're too sick then it's probably just not going to work at all even though they look nicer as kind of whole round slices you know if you get one set had just like half a slice they break off before you get a full slice those will still work just as well you can still do hide rate those they just don't look quite as pretty so once I've got all my orange and lemon slices I'm laying them out on a baking sheet and make sure they're in a single layer you don't want any overlapping between them if they overlap then they're not going to like dehydrate evenly then pop them in the middle of the oven shut the door and leave them for about an hour after now I'd get them out and see how they're doing and flip them all over then pop them back in the oven for another hour then get them out of the oven again and see how they're doing give them a flip if you're going to put them back in and if not if they're dehydrated you can transfer them over to something to cool down on dilemmas take less time than the oranges so if you're doing oranges and lemons together then you'll probably want to get the lemons out before you do the oranges and if you have any thicker slices you might find that some of your slices are fully dehydrated and some of them are so you might want to get a few of them out to call and put the ones that aren't ready back in for a bit longer and you'll know when they're ready because they will be dry to the touch and a bit crispy you can see that some of mine are a bit overdone so they've kind of gone past dehydrated and gone little bit more into cooked you you want to avoid that happening I got a little bit distracted while I was making them and didn't check them often enough so I ended up with a few that still need a little bit longer so I'm popping those back in for a while but that's pretty much it now you have some lovely dehydrated fruit to make some nice fruity water and fruity teas and fruity cocktails and all kinds of delicious things so I hope you like them guys and I will see you next time bye", "XkMKJCvJKBk": "[Music] the usual produce section will carry fresh navel oranges eureka lemons mexican limes tangerines mandarins and grapefruits [Music] varieties such as lemons and limes are even some of the most common fruits used to spice up our food citrus is just not widely popular for its taste it is essential for a modern diet due to its high abundance of nutrients such as vitamin c potassium folate vitamin b6 riboflavin calcium and dietary fiber there is no denying citrus is one of the most important crops in the world this exceptional fruit has woven itself into the majority of everyone's daily life approximately 130 million tons of citrus fruits are produced in one year alone across 140 countries due to this high importance it is critical that we understand how our modern citrus came to be and where it originates this documentary will discuss just that taking a look into its fascinating and mysterious evolutionary past [Music] there are hundreds of varieties brought forth across the ages since their cultivation in ancient times thousands of years of citrus agriculture has created a huge diversity in the number of coltogens many different such as varieties are complex mixtures that make them very difficult to classify their phylogeny or evolutionary history for example the lemon is not an ancestral species of citrus it is certain thousands of years ago someone intentionally or accidentally crossed different types of citrus together if you look at the genome of the lemon you will find three separate ancestral species the citron pomelo and the mandarin as you can imagine the jumbled mess of citrus hybridization has puzzled botanists for centuries in recent years extraordinary studies looking into the citrus genome have been opening up information into citrus evolution that have provided a solid look into its past origins and dispersal for the first time there has been an identification of 10 pure ancestral true citrus species seven of them from asia which include citrons pamelas mandarins micrantha incandensis kumquats manchinensis which is a type of mandarin and three from australia the australian desert lime the australian round lime and the australian finger lime this particular genome study is currently the most comprehensive phylogenetic study into citrus this information can change in the future when more studies are conducted it is clear that all of these progenitor species are in the same genus genus is a taxonomic category that ranks above species but below families for example our genus is homo but our species is sapient different species can share genus such as our closely related ancestors hamonian tolensis and homo erectus it was once believed that fortunella urema citrus and microcitrus represented their own genuses but it is now clear all ten species belong to the genus citrus i will still refer to them with their original genus names just think of them as subgenuses now traditionally the genus citrus has been divided into two genres citrus and papita furthermore the subgenus of citrus also called citrus has been split into three main progenitor species pomelos citrons and mandarins since their evolutionary ties are closer the hybridization and introgressions of these three wild citrus species make up the vast majority of commercial citrus species today before we get much further into the video i would like to take some time and give a brief description of each of the native species of citrus besides perhaps the mandarin and the kumquat these progenitor species are little known and obscure to most western cultures the pomelo or as a scientifically named citrus maxima has the largest fruit of any citrus the fruits are oblate or spheroid and have a thick peel if wild the seeds are large and wrinkled the leaves are very big and oval with a blunt point at the tip and have a broadly rounded base the petiole which refers to this smaller leaf on the same petal is broadly winged and more or less chordate chordate refers it to being heart-shaped citrus maxima is found in southeastern asia south china and the east indian archipelago today in the wild in america this fruit can be found in farmer's markets or usually in asian grocery stores the palatability of this fruit has likely changed drastically since its cultivation thousands of years ago although similar to the grapefruit most commercially important pamelas are much less bitter pimelos have both acidic and acidic-less variants so the taste of this fruit varies greatly depending on the variety they can be bitter acidic or sweet [Music] do the citron or citrus medica was one of the first citrus species to be introduced into the mediterranean basin after alexander the great's conquest into persia it's one of the earliest confirmed cultivated species of citrus [Music] the citron is even depicted on the walls of a botanical garden at the karnak temple in egypt dating back to approximately 3500 years ago during the reign of thud moses iii it was likely first cultivated in india perhaps thousands of years before this the sichuan today plays an important role in buddhism and judaism the fingered variant of the citron called buddha's hand is used as an offering at buddhist temples [Music] the etrog variation of the citron is used during the week-long celebration of sukkot in prairie rituals the sichon resembles a lemon but has a far thicker rind and contains very little juice the leaves are smooth and they are either bluntly pointed or rounded at the tips the petioles are short wingless or narrowly margined the fruits are of a medium size to a very large size the shape of them varies from oblong oval and fingered they can have a smooth or bumpy surface citrons are found growing in the wild in india bhutan bangladesh myanmar and china [Music] the mandarin or citrus retaculata is a progenitor species most western cultures are more familiar with a tangerine is essentially a variation of the mandarin most commercial mandarins are not purely mandarins and are introgressed with pomelos from 10 to 30 percent genetically there are only a few confirmed pure mandarin species the two species i will mention in this video are citrus watakilada tachibana and sanchu chakat sunshu shakat is found in the wild in assam china and japan it has an intensely acidic taste and it is slightly depressed globo sin shape the petioles of this mandarin are nearly wingless citrus retuccilata a variation in tachibana was once thought to be its own species but genetic testing has revealed the tachibana is too closely related to mandarins and is rather a subspecies of mandarins it is widespread from taiwan to the main island of japan this subspecies is considered a wild type it has persisted since prehistoric times tachibanas are highly resistant to the cold and even snow the petioles are not winged citrus manchinensis appears morphologically similar to the mandarin but it is genetically distinct from atakilata it is its own true species of citrus it is native to the mountain forest in mangshan hunan province citrus micrantha is little known outside of citrus enthusiasts a micrantha cross with a citron is what gives us the mexican lime micrantha is cultivated on a small scale as a hairwash product in the southern philippine islands it's in the subgenus papita group and grows naturally in the wild on the islands of cebu and behold the fruits are obviate to oblong and are relatively small the winged petioles are very large and pronounced almost the same size as the main leaf citrus incongenensis is another papita that is likely only known by citrus enthusiasts it is relatively rare in cultivation it has small mandarin-like fruit and have leaves that feature a broad petiole and resemble the leaves of the yuzu and the kaffir lime in appearance the fruit has a fragrant but rugged rind and may be oval spherical or flattened in shape ripening to yellow or orange the fruit is both bitter and sour it is native to southwestern and west central china this species is known for being extremely hearty and able to grow in relatively cold environments the citrus of gina fortunella or commonly just known as the kumquat is the last of the asian progenitor species in this list this species of citrus consists of small edible fruits the entire fruit can be eaten along with the peel and rind the leaves are unifoliate with a distinctive silver coloration on their underside fortunella blooms a month or two later than other species of citrus fortuna lehenzi still grows commonly in a wild state along the nanlee mountains in south china the kumquat can withstand frost down to 14 degrees fahrenheit or negative 10 celsius without injury which is pretty unusual for a citrus [Music] plant that ends the introduction to the seven ancestral pure species found in asia now we will discuss the species found in new guinea australia new caledonia and the surrounding islands i will start from the three remaining species from the study that found 10 pure native species the australian finger lime round lime and the desert lime i will also be adding two more subgenera clemenia and oxenthera which are also clustered with the australian limes these species all belong to the subgenuses euremocitrus microcitrus clemenia and oxenthera urimo citrus or the australian desert lime is distinctly interesting since it is the only citrus species that has high zero phytic adaptations zero phytic meaning species adapted to living in conditions with little water this species is from southeastern queensland and australia and commonly grows as a small tree or a large shrub this citrus resembles trees found in the southwest american desert the leaves are grayish green very thick and oblong in shape extremely different from other citrus species the fruits are albavoid or subglobus depending on the strain they are relatively small thin skinned and pleasantly acidic there is only one species of urimah citrus uremos citrus glauca this is one of the three ancestral species from australia described in the original list the next sub-genus is microcitrus which contains six species this group is semi-xerophytic and can endure long periods of droughts the two species i will discuss from the subgenus are micro citrus australasica or the finger lime and micro citrus australis which were in the original ten ancestral species list australasica or the finger lime is a thorny shrub or small tree of lowland rainforest in the coastal border region of queensland and new south wales in australia in recent years it has become a commercial crop and the fruit comes in colors from deep pink to blue green the fruit is filled with juice vesicles and is sometimes dubbed as citrus caviar the leaves are only about half an inch long as the australian fingerline matures it becomes very dense with branches and is extremely thorny micro citrus australis or the australian round lime is a spherical or a slightly pear-shaped citrus fruit with thick green or yellow skin they grow in queensland australia and can grow to a height of 30 to 60 feet tall making them the largest native citrus tree the fruit is said to have an exceptional flavor and is grown commercially similarly to the finger lime the leaves are relatively small we have already gone over the three australian lime species of the original 10 list but i will be adding two more subgenuses oxenthera and clemonia these two subgenera also likely represent original citrus species relatively untouched by man's cultivation they are close relatives of the australian limes and likely share a common ancestor there are little photos of these species so i could not find any footage of them but they are still worth discussing i will also add one more close relative of the citrus ponceros trifoliata oxen thera and clemonia are phylogenetically in the same clade as the australian limes oxen thera comprises of six species endemic to new caledonia sometimes referred to as false oranges the leaves on oxenthera neocaledonica are above and a petiole is present the fruit is oblong and resembles that of the sweet orange on the surface [Music] clemenia originally was considered to be a citrus hybrid but genetic testing has proven it is its own species one of the few citrus plants it will hybridize with is the kumquat chlamydia has a unique appearance the fruit is tangerine sized and has a short narrow petiole they are described as sweet and lemony in flavor it is a highly tropical plant and can only be grown in green houses in the united states it is found in papua new guinea and surrounding islands where it is enjoyed by the locals ponce trifoliata exist outside the citrus genus however it likely was a result of an admixture of an ancient citrus hybrid with an unknown parrot its chloroplast phylogeny is nested inside the clade that contains pomelos mandarins and micrantha it likely has one parent from inside the citrus genus and another which is an outsider it was once believed ponceris was a monotypic clade however another species poncerius polyandra was discovered in 1984. poncerous leaves are trifoliate oval in shape and are evergreen the branches are densely clustered and thorny the fruits ripen in late fall they are around slightly smaller than a mandarin and are extremely bitter you may recognize ponceris if you have ever seen sucker growth growing from your citrus tree it is extremely popular as a rootstock variety due to its high cold tolerance and hardiness most citrus only grows above zone 9 but poncerius can grow in zone 6. many of its hybrids are also used as rootstocks as well the genus poncerius is native both to northern and southern china korea and japan it is sometimes referred to as the chinese bitter orange japanese bitter orange and the hearty orange that concludes the short descriptions of the ancestral or pure species of citrus it is a lot to take in at once but hopefully we'll provide more context as we delve further into the fascinating story of citrus evolution these descriptions established that true citrus species extend through a broad area in the wild from india southeast asia china melanesia and australia however where did the citrus genus originate geographically and diversify into the species we know today over the past few centuries this has long been debated one hypothesis from 2009 theorized that citrus originated in australia and migrated northward toward southeast asia another theory in 1967 listed papua new guinea as the ancestral home of citrus a theory proposed by tanaka in 1959 suggested that citrus originated in the eastern himalayas as a large number of important species of citrus can be found here today based on the evidence tanaka's theory prevails over the latter the eastern himalayas are comprised of northern india myanmar and western une which have a plethora of citrus species and varieties that can be found living in non-cultivated areas true species such as wall pamelas citrons sunshu chakat indian wild mandarins and incongenensis populate these regions hybridized species are also found in the wild in this area such as sour oranges lemons kefir limes yuzu's sweet oranges and mexican limes it is highly remarkable that all of these citrus species are living in such a close proximity and density the presence of this high diversity of citrus found in this region strongly supports that this area was the center of citrus evolution one important aspect to note is that only two of the seven asian continental true species of citrus are not found in this area micrantha and the kumquat the evidence for tanaka's theory continues to pile up with genetic testing and fossil samples now we will take a journey back in time to further explore the eastern himalayas as the origin of citrus [Music] it's the late maya snepak approximately seven to eight million years in the past the world is a very different place but it is becoming slowly more familiar to us the last common ancestor of gorillas chimpanzees and humans climbs through the rainforest of africa another great ape oriopithicus swings through the dense rainforest of italy and giant thunderbirds ruled the australian and south american continents the story of citrus takes us to asia we are deep in the dense tropics of the eastern himalayas in what will be the bang my formation in what is now the yunnan province in south china a leaf simply falls to the ground and undergoes the process of fossilization however it is no ordinary leaf and it will help solve the centralis-long polemic argument for particular fruit our species has cultivated for thousands of years it is a leaf belonging to citrus lynx and insists possibly the crown of all still living such a species today the leaf characteristics on the extinct species link zangensis resembles extant species it combines several features of citrus maxima or pomelos and species in the papita group such as inconginensis there is a general agreement in the scientific community that the continental asian citrus species today emerged during the late miocene around seven to eight million years ago this is supported by molecular dating the ancestor of all citrus species today rapidly radiated from a single species into the seven present in asia today during this time the discovery of lynx and gensis matches up perfectly with this theory as well with the idea that citrus originated in the eastern himalayas in regions such as yunnan assam and northern myanmar it is definite evidence that citrus grew as a native plant in late maya scene yunnan the radiation during the late miocene six to eight million years ago is thought to be responsible for all seven of the pure native asian citrus species today according to genome studies this radiation occurred rapidly the late miocene was a time of massive climatic changes on a global scale and has been described as forging our modern world the earth was cooling down from a period of being much warmer globally than how it is today at the thermal maximum in the maya scene epoch 15 million years ago rainforests span all the way to europe and south africa in the late maya scene six to eight million years ago theater started cooling and ocean temperatures were becoming more comparable to how they are today seasonality was also on their eyes and their range of the rainforest decreased this cooling trend caused an erectification in the interior of the continents which resulted in drier vegetation and a decline of tropical rainforest citrus still carries the phenotypes and adaptations of this climate shift to drier conditions today citrus on the surface shows all the characteristics of a tropical understory bush with lush foliage high chlorophyll content and a shallow root system however there are many phenotypic adaptations such as still carries to deal with long periods of water stress a relic from its rapid radiation phase the characteristics such as waxy leaves and fruits which prevent water loss independent juice sex low photosynthetic rates low transpiration rates and slow growth patterns are some of these adaptations these adaptations are likely why cultivated citrus is able to grow in such a wide array of climates today a tropical shrub that grows well in mediterranean and arid climates [Music] the global trend was also very local in southeast asia the diversification of citrus coincides with a period of drastic uplift in the tibetan plateau and a phase of monsoon weakening 10 million years ago the climate of the southern himalayas was heavily controlled by the intense indian summer monsoon that brought heavy rainfall when it suddenly started going through a weakening phase eight million years ago this drastically altered the climate making it drier with only seasonal heavy rains this not only was a factor in citrus diversification but was also responsible for rapid radiations and many types of organisms the changing climate replaced the paleo flora replacing tropical trees with grasses the unique levels of different precipitation levels in the southeastern tibetan plateau made it a hot spot for rapid radiations of all the different plant lineages for example it is believed rhododendrons diversified in this area as well at the same time as citrus there are many hot spots similar to this occurring across the world in the late maya scene from the center of origin in what is now assam tunan china citrus primarily spread in two directions south and east however citrons are the exception which are believed to have spread westward before spreading east not surprisingly the himalayas blocked the spread to the north the pomelo is believed to have taken a southern route into the tropical monsoonal lands of the indo-chinese peninsula and surrounding islands the fapita micrantha is believed to have taken the same route except ending up in the islands of the philippines phylogenetic evidence also supports an idea that citrons pomelos and micrantha make up a different clade from one composed of mandarins kumquats and australian limes however this is still controversial within the scientific community earlier in the video i stated another theory that puts pamelas citrons and mandarins in the same subgenus called citrus there are other contradicting theories as well for example another study based on complete chloroplast dna sequences came up with three main clades for citrus the first being one composed of micrantha and pomelos a second one composed of mandarins and inconginences and a third one composed of citrons and the australian limes now this theory does support an idea that micrantha and pomelos make up a separate clade within the genus citrus but it places citrons with the australian limes these studies get different results because they are either using different dna sequences or using different evolutionary evidence such as morphological or chemical traits all these different theories on how these progenitor and native citrus species are related show just how much more there is to discover about the evolutionary relationships within the genus citrus if pomelo citrons of micrantha do make up their own clade within citrus this would suggest that after the initial radiation of citrus all three share a common ancestor when citrons expanded westward the ancestor of pomelos and micrantha split once more in the thai malay peninsula this theory makes the most sense according to their biogeography the story continues with incandescents mandarins and kumquats who spread eastward of the initial radiation zone there were three corridors of confluence eastward the pacific coast associated with kumquats the yangtze river associated with mandarins and central china associated with inconsciences interestingly there were no barriers between myanmar and yunnan eight million years ago in the past as there are now the eastern portion of the himalayas or the hengduan range did not exist this area actually underwent a massive uplift after the miocene into the pliassy mandarins and kumquats may be phylogenetically more closely related and likely shared a common ancestor that took this route however the study based on complete chloroplast markers clustered mandarins and incongenensis in the same clade it is probable all three share a common ancestor after the original diversification of citrus into yunnan [Music] we have discussed the radiation and spread of the asian true species of citrus however a portion of this story regarding the australian limes remains untold it will take us further south past the wallace line into what is now papua new guinea and australia we have traveled forward in time from the miocene to 5 million years in the past into the pliocene epoch [Music] our own lineage just separated from our common ancestor with chimpanzees a possible direct ancestor of us artipithecus kadaba roams the savannahs of ethiopia and may even be using bipedalism as its primary form of locomotion the macedons diversify throughout the world and camels are abundant in the continent of north america the oldest representative of the mammoth genus mammoth subplanet of thrones rome is the savannas of south africa the only other fossilized and extinct member of the citrus genus besides ling sanjinensis citrus melatensis grows as an understory bush in what will be valdarno italy a world away in the continent of australia or sahul our story of citrus evolution continues unlike asian species of citrus the australian limes did not diversify during the cooling of the late miocene genome studies have placed the emergence of the australian lime clade at around 5 million years ago at the beginning the late plyasin epoch the climates of this epoch are relatively similar to today if you discount human alteration [Music] as for mentioned the australian lime is a generic name used for genera urema citrus and micro citrus clemenia and oxen thera which were described earlier in the video are also clustered with the australian limes based off of chloroplast markers so we will associate them with a generic name australian limes as well all of these genera are found from papua new guinea new caledonia to australia their adaptations range from tropical to desert environments these species likely form a monophyletic clade within citrus meaning their ancestry originates from the same diversification that led to the pure asian citrus species in asia it is speculated a species related to the kumquat migrated from southeast asia to these areas and further diversified into the australian lyme groups we know today this is based off of the fact that phallogenetically kumquats group with these species according to chloroplast markers in addition they share some morphological or physical trace as well although in some studies the citron is shown clustering with the australian limes it is more accepted in the scientific community that kumquats are more likely their ancestors biogeography supports this idea as well since citrons spread westward of the initial radiation while kumquats were located on the south china coastline kumquats and the fruit of the australian desert lime or urema citrus both have a low number of fruit loculi and alveoles loculi refers to a small cavity in the fruit for example if you slice an orange in half you will see individual juice sacks in the kumquat you will only see four this is also true for uremus citrus to further show the close relationship between the australian peer species and kumquats is that clemenia does not hybridize with most citrus species but will with kumquats citrus was not alone in its early pliocene migration to australia botanist theorized that many other plant species crossed over at the same time as well australian flora closely resembles into malayan flora so much so that it can even be considered intrusive these asian species likely outcompeted original australian species the migration was aided by the uplift of western militia which started to occur around 5 million years ago interestingly sumatra java sulawesi and parts of the band arc went from being below sea level to being similar to how they are today 5 million years ago sarah and timmer only emerged around 3 million years ago these new landforms springing up from regional plate reorganizations in what is now indonesia would have acted as stepping stones for citrus to reach australia as well as the other flora all of these events aided citrus in its migration south to colonize australia and the surrounding islands the australian limes then radiated into diverse environments into the fascinating species we know today there is one more diversification period worth mentioning that took place in the early pleistocene around 2 million years ago which involved the mandarin the pleisoscene saw 11 major glacial events and was a time of massive climate fluctuations this period gave rise to all the animals we know today and the beloved awe-inspiring megafauna we associate with a generic term ice age by the end of this period our own species colonize all of the continents 2.4 million years ago it is theorized that citrus rotakilata tachibana became isolated from the rest of citrus rotakilata on the mainland of asia as for mentioned earlier in the video citrus tachibana is found in taiwan japan and a few other islands off the coast of mainland asia it is believed to have gotten to these land masses during a glacial maxima when sea levels were far lower studies show that taiwan japan and the ryukyu archipelago received much of their flora during this time from mainland china these land bridges appeared eleven times during every glacial maxima in the pleistocene situated tachibana eventually became more and more isolated to where it became a subspecies of reteculata that concludes the story of how all the native species of citrus evolved and the climactic changes that push their evolution we have traveled to two major speciation events and one minor one over a span of six million years we started in the late maya scene epoch and ended in the early pleistocene 2.4 million years ago the next event in citrus phylogeny took place at the hands of people through thousands of years of cultivation citrus was cultivated from its wild ancestors and also extensively through crossbreeding artificial selection also took place for important agronomic traits which resulted in an improvement in flavor yield quality and other attractive traits we cannot say for certain when cultivation of citrus started but archaeological and ancient literature shine some light on the subject citrus seeds were discovered in excavation in the mesopotamian civilization dating to around 4000 bc citrus is also referenced in some chinese literature dating back to 2000 bc if citrus ended up in mesopotamia 6 000 years ago which is outside of its native range it is safe to say such as cultivation dates back to neolithic china and india around eight to ten thousand years ago it is highly likely that before the time of agriculture hunter-gatherers readily consumed ancestral forms of citrus it is only natural to assume that during the early agricultural revolution humans cultivated citrus seeds for the first time implanted them next to their settlements over the next thousands of years humans molded and bred citrus into the hundreds or possibly thousands of varieties we know today i will give a brief description of the genealogy of cultivated citrus species and go over which species were specifically crossed together the two most prevalent ancestral species whose genes are found in almost every citrus variety are citrus maxima and citrus retuculata or pamelas and mandarins interestingly mandarins which were thought to be pure decades ago actually contain pomelo or citrus maxima in tragression in fact pomelo introgression is now a general rule for all cultivated mandarin or tangerine species intragression refers to the genetic information of one species to another as a result of hybridization and repeated back crossing therefore every tangerine and mandarin that is used for widespread cultivation is actually a hybrid of the two ancestral species there are two distinct groups of mandarins based on how much pomelo and traditions can be found in them the first group only contains 1 to 10 percent of the pomelo admixture and is composed of the more traditional mandarins such as cleopatra sunki and pokhan to name a few the second group of mandarins contains much more pomelo admixture at around 12 to 30 percent this is composed of the modern mandarins such as satsuma clementine and king to name a few interestingly and to make things more complicated the sweet orange sour orange grapefruit and all of their own admixtures such as tangelos tangors and orngellos are composed of the same two ancestral species as well pomelos and mandarins all these fruits closely share the same genetic material but are phenotypically and taste wise so different different ways pomelos and mandarins are in tragress result in all of these different varieties it should also be noted that different mandarin and pomelo varieties were used in creating these other varieties when you simply cross a pamela with the mandarin the result is a sour orange a sour orange is not the same as the sweet orange the sour orange is a simple hybridization of the two ancestral species when the sweet orange is a complex introgression of back crossing between pomelos and mandarins for generations the grapefruit was a recent addition to the plethora of citrus varieties only coming into existence in the 17th century on the barbados islands it was the result of a cross between a sweet orange and a pamela the next important ancestral species for modern citrus varieties is the citron or citrus medica as mentioned at the beginning of the video the lemon genome is comprised of three species citrons at 50 percent pomelo's at 18 and mandarin's at 31 it is most likely the lemon is a hybrid of a sour orange and a citron the ring per lime and rough lemon are both the result of a citron cross with the mandarin likely of different varieties of mandarin a citron cross with a micrantha is what gives us the mexican lime as you can already tell the citron pomelo and the mandarin are responsible for the majority of cultivated citrus and economically important such as varieties incongenensis cross with the mandarin is what gives us the papita the yuzu the last progenitor asian species not mentioned is the kumquat which has many varieties and shares crosses with mostly all the asian ancestral species the one i will mention is the kalamandin which is the result of a cross between a male kumquat and a female mandarin the only asian species not mentioned on this list citrus manginensis which hasn't really been cultivated by people the australian lives have recently started undergoing hybridizations the australian bloodline is the result of an acid mandarin and an australian finger line the australian sunrise lime is the result of a cross between a finger lime and the as for mentioned kalamundin citrus hybrids are extremely complicated and there are hundreds of them perhaps thousands i plan one day in the future to do a video specifically about interesting citrus hybrids hopefully this section explained at least the basics on the origins of different citrus [Music] varieties [Music] the story of citrus its origins and evolution is fascinating this fruit is such a major part of our modern diet and yet so much of its past remains mysterious we have an idea of the relatedness of citrus ancestral species but nothing concrete there are still some contradicting theories out there we can at least say for certain citrus maxima or taquilata medica manchester micrantha fortunella incandensis and the australian lions make up their own native species it can also be said that all these different native citrus species are all members of the same genus with the exception of ponceris there is also sufficient evidence that the origin of the citrus genus we know today took place in assam northern myanmar and south china the citrus fossil links angenenses took us back over 8 million years into citrus evolution starting in the late myosin cooling and ending in the glacial maximums of the pleistocene we also went over the basics of when domestication likely took place and how modern varieties came into being today the contents of the theories discussed will likely change as more research is conducted in the future i personally find this exciting and can't wait to hear the results of future studies hopefully this documentary will spark a sense of fascination the next time you use a lemon to flavor your water add lime to your alcohol or buy into a juicy naval orange hey guys anthro man here thank you for watching the video especially if you've managed to make it this far i put a lot of work into this video and plan to do other projects like this in the future please subscribe hit that notification bell and leave a comment i'm interested in hearing what you have to say until next time see ya guys [Music] you", "X_5D2IBq8j0": "\u266a", "D4aL8PqL_xs": "hmm disclaimer so in this review I tried the trifoliate Orange and I made trifoliate orange aid where I take the juice and put water and sugar in it so I tried the fruit I was totally fine I had no problems whatsoever I made the juice I drank that juice so probably a glass or two every day for about a week no problems whatsoever but then my girlfriend came over and I gave her some of the juice and it made her very very sick so one I'm sorry honey [Music] and two guys be careful okay so that everybody has the same sort of Constitution as other people some people may have allergies and people may have sensitivities to foods I feel like I over the so many years I have eaten a lot of things that are very questionable and maybe I built up tolerance to eating whatever the hell is in trifoliate oranges so because of everything that happened in my experience I think it's probably a good idea for you to view this video for educational purposes only okay I think that some people can eat this thing and they'll be totally fine I was but that might not be you so if you do eat this thing please be careful look at a lot of sources not just mine and if you do get sick don't sue me guys I told you not to do it alright enjoy the show [Applause] this everybody is the trike foliate orange which is a very very odd citrus fruit because it looks like a little orange and it's got a lot in common with a little orange however there's some really odd things about it before I talk too much about it I want to give a special shout-out to Ashton for sending this to me Ashton thank you very much this is cold hardy so this actually will survive in cold temperatures and most oranges of course need to be in very warm temperatures also the outside of this thing you probably can't see it but it's fuzzy kind of like a peach which is very odd for a citrus fruit it is so different than normal citrus fruits that some believe it shouldn't be in the citrus genus but it should be in a different genus all of its own pond seriously so it should be pond serious trifoliate rather than citrus trifoliate that's a fun thing to say it also contains a couple of compounds that are unique to this one of them is pond syren and that's a compound that is used in medicine to act as an anti-inflammatory this is one that people argue it's edibility on some people think it's poisonous some people don't and it has been used historically in China and other parts of the world as a medicine and as something that you can cook in order to eat a very popular thing to do with these is to make marmalade out of them I'm not going to do that I don't have the time but I am going to do something with it I'm gonna make a juice out of it but before I make a juice out of it you know what I have to do I need to try this raw they are not super juicy but you can see a little bit of juice going out there and you may notice that I can't cut through it all the way that is because this thing is full of seeds as if it wasn't enough of a hint to see them flying out of it this thing is just jam-packed full of seeds it smells really really good but unique it has a scent in there that I'd say is unique to this fruit that I haven't really noticed in other things but I say the closest thing I can relate it to is if you were to take like a grapefruit and make it more floral it's like a grapefruit covered with flower petals I'm also noticing that it's kind of late EXCI as I'm cutting it I'm noticing like my fingers sticking together that is also a bizarre thing for a citrus okay I think I got all the seeds out I know this isn't going to be good that's very sour that is like a 10 on the sour scale the flavor is good though it's really good that's um that's surprising I thought that this is going to be like completely horrible but flavor is really tasty it's something like lime and grapefruit it has a slight bitterness to it but not as much as I've been seeing online people have been saying like this is the most bitter thing ever but it is intense I think that would be a tough thing to eat raw you definitely want to dilute it or cook it I can see this being really good in things so that's what I'm going to do I'm going to make a juice out of this thing so this juice is going to be a little bit different than your typical lemonade or something because I'm going to use some of this rind and how I'm gonna do that is with this mofo right here so I'm going to get some of the rind off of this you don't want to use the pith because the pith is very bitter so I'm just gonna kind of like get the very outside of a few of these so right here I've got about four fruits worth of rind I'm going to take that and put it into a pot of boiling water it's not a whole lot of water just a couple of cups I'm gonna turn the heat down on to a simmer and take 1/2 cup of sugar and put that into the mix so that's going to infuse as I juice these fruits so I'm going to just squeeze these into this glass here I'm doing the seeds and all because I'm going to separate them out later just did as much juice as I can into here so I've got a pitcher we've got a strainer I got the juice I'm gonna let this strain into so many seeds oh my god just gonna let that strain into the picture I just added some water to these seeds to try get a little bit more juice out of it and yeah there is a lot more to be had okay fill this about half full of water so next I'm going to take my infused rind and sugar water and put that in here as well straining out at the rind and you're left with a big old jug full of tripe foliate aid which you can put in the fridge and let it cool down or be impatient like me and pour it over ice so here it is a nice glass full of my trifoliate aid [Music] that is actually really really good that is surprisingly good the flavor on this is it's different it doesn't taste like orange Jade it doesn't taste like lemonade doesn't taste like limeade this tastes like its own thing this is somewhere in the direction of like lime aid but if you were to add grapefruit juice to it and some flower petals maybe a little bit of lulo that one tastes a little bit like ecto cooler that's really really tasty I'm not sure why this isn't more common because obviously this is a very productive plant it produces a lot of seeds it grows in cold temperatures yeah this is a very useful fruit I think like if you want to grow something this is a good one to grow maybe it's invasive or something that's always something to check out but the the flavor is really good I'm not sure why people say this is inedible because I say this is just as edible as a lime or lemon where you're not gonna want to eat it on its own but if you want to cook with it or make a juice out of it it's really really tasty so I like this a lot and yeah if you have the means check it out and once again thank you Ashton for sending these to me this is definitely a cool one to try all right take care you're so cute it's dawning on me right now that my hands are very very sticky from all that latex [Music]", "Q42yqFTdjuQ": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey everyone this is Jenny from homestead corner and today I'm going to be dehydrating lemons and limes I got a pretty good deal on bags of these this week so they're usually pretty expensive usually 79 to 89 cents per lemon but we were able to get like three pounds for three dollars which is really good there was a couple more but I used some and I also got these limes for like $2.99 for a three pound bag so that was a great deal also on the lines so I'm going to use some of these I've pulled a couple out we used a couple and I pulled one out for later that will use definitely this week and I pulled a couple of limes but we're going to dehydrate these up so they will last in storage and once you dehydrate them they are perfect to throw in soups and any dishes that you want to add lemon or lime flavor to into I use the lemon a lot in my teas you can just take it and throw it right in the cup and it will rehydrate while it's in your tea which is wonderful so this is super easy to do we are just going to give these a good wash in water and a couple tablespoons of white vinegar so to make sure we get anything off the outside that might be on them because we're going to dehydrate these skins and all we'll use the entire lemon this way so I'm gonna get these guys to wash these I'm just gonna I got a bowl about half full of water and I'm just going to put a couple tablespoons of white vinegar in there and we are going to add our lemons and limes right into the water we're gonna let them soak for about five minutes and then we will come back and give them a good rinse off but I just kind of move them around a little bit make sure they're getting nice and clean whoa splash myself because I like that told you I'm messy in the kitchen oh my goodness so you just want to get them all under there and make sure they're soaking around so we're just going to let them soak for a few minutes and I'll bring you back while we rinse them up okay so after these got done soaking I just gave them a little rinse with some fresh cold water and I am just gonna start slicing these and I just take the end off until you start to see the little lemon in there and any spots you can just trim those off you want to cut these kind of thin I go home I try to go 1/8 inch on the thickness and the seeds you can kind of just pop the seeds right out right now you don't have to take the seeds out but I don't really want them in my food later when I use them so it's easier to get them out now so you can just kind of pop those out and we're gonna put them right on our dehydrator trays and these can touch each other on the trays it is okay if they're touching each other it's not a problem at all and you want a single layer them you don't want them on top of each other but they can definitely touch so we are just going to keep going until I have all my trays filled up and I'm going to cut my lines the same way as I do the lemons [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so we have all our trees filled I've got two trays of lemons and two trays of limes and we are just going to put these in the dehydrator and we're gonna get this little darlin started and we're gonna set this at 125 degrees about 120 530 and we're gonna turn it on and we're gonna let this go 12 to 15 hours about is what it's about what it's going to take it can vary depending on how thick you could cut them and you know how how much liquids in them it can definitely vary so but we're gonna just let this go and we'll come back and check it in about 12 hours probably 12 to 15 and I will bring you back when they're done okay so these have been going for 16 hours and they are all dry you can see how they look and they are you want them to be like crispy dry and they are going to last in your food storage this way you can hear them and they are you know if you take one you can like snap it it's so dry crunchy dry so that's it these are so easy to do and we're just gonna put these on a plate for a little bit and we're gonna let them kind of come down to room temperature so we can put them in jars and that way I can throw them in the pantry if you're gonna store these long term you definitely want to seal your jars but these are ones that I'm gonna use if I do any more I'll seal them up you just want to use food saver and make sure you seal the top of your jars and they will last for a super long time years I have oranges that I've had for three years I like to test things so I have oranges that have that are sealed downstairs and they are three years old and they still look exact with the same they smell wonderful and they're perfect so um these are our lives and the lemons they they both darken up a little bit when you draw him but these are still there so flavorful you just toss these right in your tea into soups anything you need a little lemon or lime in you can put these right in you can rehydrate them first or you can just like if you're doing soups or something like that you could just toss it right in hold and it will rehydrate and you'll have all the juices right in there so it's perfect and that's it for this video if you like this video give us a thumbs up subscribe we'll see you in the next video bye", "WerM0isdgdw": "how's it going today I'm gonna talk to you about the citrus myth I keep getting emails on the somewhat regular basis people asking me Tyler what do I do with my citrus peels the answer is you compost them simply put they're natural they're organic they break down there's no reason to not add them if your pH isn't gonna go to like three and all of a sudden you have this acidic mess it's not crazy like that there's nothing wrong with it the only suggestion I would make is to break it up a little bit so if you can chop it up into pieces that'll help because the skins can tend to be a bit stubborn but it's still again it's nothing to be paranoid about it also get to it compost the crap out of it that whole myth is baloney which you can also compost it just takes a little while longer and it might smell but anyway with me here I have a huge container not of Tidy Cats multiple scoop whatever this is but actually of fruit runs me personally I'm not the healthiest dude I like to eat a lot of junk food but my friend is constantly juicing so she's always kind enough to give me her gift of her leftover vegetable and fruit scraps so let's take a quick look at what she has here for us so what you can see here is this is quite a mess we have in here I actually went through with a little mini shovel and beat the crap out of it to try and break it up a little but I decided to leave some of the pieces hold so I'm gonna throw in some rinds and I'm gonna leave them in really big pieces and then most of it I ground up you can also see I got some banana in here and some oranges and some lemons whatever so this is the type of things that I get I come home from work and this is on my doorstep which is the greatest thing I love it so I'm gonna add this to my compost and of course since I'm adding this much stuff which is actually really heavy and wet and full of nitrogen I'm gonna need to add a ton of dry stuff so it's that time of year where we're getting tons and tons of leaves so let me show you what I'm gonna do with the leaves now because there is definitely a way to put them into your compost so they don't cause a lot of clumping so to speak you guessed it we shred them so let's do that all right so as you just saw I have a ton of fruit and vegetable waste to deal with so because I have such a large quantity obviously now I have to add a lot of dry material and it's the fall right now my favorite time of year kind of and if you're a composter you know that you're out there right now hoarding all of your leads because this is a super important ingredient in successful compost so as far as that goes for every one part of food scraps you put in you want to make sure you do at least three parts of leaves so that's what I'm gonna do so behind me is only just a fraction of the amount of leaves that I've cleaned up and these gloves that I have have bumps all over them yeah they're pretty cool and this actually helps me shred them I don't have a lawnmower or any of that I know some people run over their leaves with their lawn mower unfortunately I don't have that but this is more fun anyway even though it takes forever so I'm gonna go ahead and start doing this I just want to grind up my leaves because if I put in whole leaves just piles and piles of them in something like this it's just gonna get really clumpy and as their result you're just gonna have crappy compost it'll take a lot longer to break down but also keep in mind you don't want your leaves to be turned to dust because then that's not letting as much oxygen into your overall pile so somewhere in between but yeah so you just want to go through and beat up your leaves really good so that's gonna help with the process so I'm gonna be here for a while so I guess you don't want to watch me grind up leaves for a half hours and that's pretty much all I have to say so to recap the the citrus myth is exactly that it's a bunch of crap and plenty of all the citrus stuff maybe your worms won't like it if you have a worm bin I have a sweet worm bin and I actually give them citrus stuff from time to time maybe a little bit in moderation you can see that they'll like move away from it if they don't like it so then you just take it out but even then they'll still eat it so again no worries so keep on composting it's that time of year to really have fun with it hit the like button for my video and get in touch with me on Facebook because I have a lot to say and I'd like to hear what you have to say so keep it dirty and have fun this season all right take care", "xTDoW-NsJTE": "This video will show how to graft citrus\ntrees using the cleft graft. I will use the cleft graft to add a new\nvariety to an existing tree to create a multi-variety citrus cocktail tree. This is the tree that I will be\ngrafting to -- an Oroblanco pummelo hybrid tree. I'll be grafting a Sarawak pummelo scion. I like to use the cleft graft when the\nscion is the same size or slightly smaller than the target branch. I ordered my Sarawak scions from California's citrus budwood program,\nthe CCPP. So that my graft succeeds and also\nto prevent the spread of disease, I sterilize my tools between grafts using\nchlorine bleach at a concentration of 1.5%. Cutting the target branch with a saw creates a minimum amount of damage\nat the end of the branch. Next I split the end of the target branch\nto create the cleft into which the scion will be inserted. I begin at the middle of\nthe end of the branch and slowly rock the knife back and forth\nuntil the cut is the desired length. This cut is about 1.5 inches or\n4 cm long. Now I will pick\nthe flattest side of the scion to match the cleft in the target branch. I will cut it to a tapered point for\ninsertion into the target branch. In recent years, huanglongbing or HLB,\nthe most deadly disease of citrus trees, has been spreading rapidly\nthroughout the world. Invasive insects called citrus psyllids\ncarry the disease from one citrus tree to another. Human movement of\ncitrus trees, cuttings, and leaves has sped the spread of the disease\nand the insects around the world, resulting in the deaths of\nhundreds of millions of citrus trees.\n Because of disease, it is very important\nto understand the local situation before grafting citrus. Local laws may require the use of\nregistered disease-tested budwood when grafting citrus. For example, the threat of HLB is so\nsevere in California that the state mandates the use of\nregistered budwood whenever citrus trees are grafted. The only source of registered budwood\nfor hobbyists in California is the CCPP. The linked video shows\nhow to order budwood. Theyzz will ship citrus budwood anywhere in\nthe world where the local laws allow it. If the local laws do not allow it,\nthere may be a local budwood program. fruitmentor.com/CitrusBudwood has a list. At the very end of the video\nI will have more on huanglongbing in different parts of the world. As I insert the scion\ninto the target branch, my goal is to line up the cambium of the\nscion with that of the rootstock. The cambium is a thin layer of tissue\nbetween the bark and the wood. For the graft to succeed,\nthe cambium layers must touch. I'm going to show how I have lined up\nthe cambium layers via an animation. The bark of the scion may be a different\nthickness than the bark of the rootstock. So if the outside of the bark is lined up,\nthe cambium layers may not be in contact. By adjusting the angle of the scion,\nit is easy to guarantee that the cambium layers are touching in\nat least one point. Here I wrap the graft with an initial\nlayer of parafilm to seal the graft and hold it in place. To get a good seal, I gently pull on\nthe parafilm as I wrap it. This makes it stick to itself. In order to ensure close contact\nbetween the cambium layers and to strengthen the graft\nwhile it is healing, I wrap it with a rubber band. Here I prune the scion to leave\nthree or four buds. The next step is to wrap the graft with\na second layer of parafilm. I wrap starting from the bottom,\noverlapping as I go up, and gently pulling on the parafilm\nto make it stick. Overlapping the layers keeps\nthe graft from drying out and will also keep out rainwater. Other than the buds, I completely wrap\nthe scion, including the cut end. Here I add a label with the name of the\nvariety and also the date of the graft. In order to keep the graft from\ndrying out, I wrap it with aluminum foil which reflects the sunlight\nand keeps the graft from getting too hot. After a three week healing period,\nI remove the foil and see that the graft is still green. The time-lapse video shows about\nfour months of growth of the graft. Unwrapping shows that\nthe graft has healed well. This includes the back side where there\nwas no attempt to match the cambium. In addition to this video, you can find a\nstep-by-step guide with more details at: http://fruitmentor.com/CleftGraftingCitrus Here's the whole Sarawak branch. I have patch budded\na pummelo called Mato Buntan. I have also cleft grafted\na pummelo called Hirado Buntan. I have made this video to stop the spread\nof huanglongbing. Spreading the word about\nthe importance of using budwood that has tested free of disease\nwill save trees. Please help by sharing this video. Also please be sure to give the video\na \"thumbs up\". You can also help by subscribing to this\nYouTube channel. Also be sure to check out my other videos on: Bud Grafting Citrus, Z-Grafting Citrus, Growing Citrus from Cuttings, and Ordering Citrus Budwood. You can download a free eBook with tips\nfor successful citrus grafting at: http://fruitmentor.com/GraftingTips I have created this map to show\nthe worldwide spread of both huanglongbing (HLB disease) and also citrus psyllids,\nthe insects that spread the disease. Please keep in mind that this map reflects\nthe situation at the beginning of 2016 and will become out-of-date as\nthis video ages. Even in 2016 this map will be inaccurate. One reason for this is that trees that\nhave the disease and are spreading it often display no symptoms and test negative\neven with a state-of-the-art test. Another reason is a lack of surveys in\nareas where the disease and insects may be present. Huanglongbing is a new disease of citrus\nthat originated in the 20th century. There are two main strains of the disease: one that originated in Asia, and another form\nthat originated in Africa. Two types of citrus psyllids\ntransmit the disease: again one that originated in Asia\nand another that originated in Africa. By the end of the 20th century\nhuanglongbing was widespread in Asia, greatly reducing the life expectancy\nof citrus trees in Asia. Red areas of the map show where both Asian citrus psyllids\nand Asian HLB are present. Asian citrus psyllids were\nfirst detected in Brazil in 1942. The psyllids arrived without the disease\nand spread in South America as a minor nuisance for many years. HLB was first detected in Brazil\nin 2004 and quickly spread with devastating results. Tan areas of the map show where the asian citrus psyllid\nis known to have spread,\n but where HLB is not yet known. Grafting with infected budwood\nin Tan areas will cause a devastating outbreak of disease. Asian citrus psyllids first arrived\nin Florida in 1998. HLB was first detected in Florida\nin 2005 in Miami. HLB spread much more rapidly\nin Florida than in Brazil due to the shipment from Miami of large\nnumbers of plants all over the state. These included\nHLB-infected nursery plants and plants infested with\nHLB-positive psyllids. In the commercial citrus farming zone\nof Texas in 2012, HLB was first detected in a farm\nnear the border with Mexico.\n The disease spread quickly. The lesson available from\nthe devastation in Florida is that citrus nursery trees\nin areas with citrus psyllids\n must always be sourced\nfrom insect-resistant structures. Unfortunately citrus nurseries\nin Texas were slow to change. In 2013, more than 10,000 open-air\ncitrus trees were shipped to Houston from a nursery in the citrus zone\nwhere psyllids were present, but outside of the area\nquarantined for HLB. More than 5000 of those trees\nwere sold to homeowners. Many of the remaining trees tested\npositive for HLB in Houston nurseries. At this point HLB could be\nanywhere in Texas. In 2012 the first HLB-positive tree\nwas detected in California in a home-grafted multi-variety\ncitrus cocktail tree that had been grafted with\nunregistered backyard budwood.\n In 2015 more HLB-positive trees\nwere detected in California, causing an expansion\nof the quarantine zone. In the expanded quarantine zone, the California Department of\nFood and Agriculture discovered an illegal citrus nursery with thousands of illegally-grafted\nopen-air trees on hand. Although the discovered trees\nwere destroyed, trees made illegally before the discovery\nwere undoubtedly sold. At this point HLB could be\nanywhere in California. HLB is now present in the\nmajor citrus farming areas of Mexico. The first discovery of the African form\nof HLB was in South Africa in the 1920s. Purple areas of the map show where\nboth African citrus psyllids and African HLB are present. Yellow areas of the map show where\nthe african citrus psyllid is known to have spread,\nbut where HLB is not yet known. The african citrus psyllid\nhas recently been discovered in Northern Portugal\nand in Northwestern Spain. Movement of citrus plants and\ncitrus relatives such as curry leaves outside of this area has the potential\nto devastate citrus all over Europe. In laboratory settings,\nthe african citrus psyllid has been shown to spread\nall forms of HLB. Although Australia\nhas its own assortment of native diseases and insects\nharmful to citrus trees, HLB and citrus psyllids\nare not currently known there. Let's stop HLB from spreading\nany further in California or any other place in the world.", "vHgDnm7GugM": "[Music] hi guys so you saw the other day that I picked fresh Satsuma oranges to my girlfriend's garden and today I'm going to teach you how to pickle to trip this works for any citrus that works for lemons limes oranges grapefruit the one thing that you might want to be aware of is of it the thinner the skin is the better it is and the more delicious and the flavors release so when it comes to lemons I really prefer Meyer lemons this is my first time doing oranges so what I learned about oranges if you do want to top them off with a little bit of lemon juice I see that fermenting food is really easy to cheap ingredients the food and salt and if you have high blood pressure please be careful about the salt and ask your doctor whether or not that's a good idea for you so I have a pretty sterilized jar put this in the dishwasher again soldiers were doing I don't get too crazy with anything I have a very fine sea salt that you can see if you'd like to know the brand I'll go ahead and put that in the notes at a later time to take tablespoons of sea salt just go in the bottom of this jar and I'm gonna start slicing up my septum lunges and this can be as easy as doing limes or lemons I'm going to slice off the bottom the beach side and then I'm going to cut almost to the end you'll see this with a cut that just goes almost to the very bottom and a fourth in fourth but it doesn't cut all the way and then I take about a half a tablespoon and pour it into each side kind of like remember those origami fortune-teller things you open up each side put the salt in there and then you separate it into a jar and I'm going to do this until the jar is filled and I'll also smush it down for the juices amount you can use anything to muddle which means to finish the juices out I like to use this flat bench rolling pin I don't make a lot of bed anymore because I'm allergic to wheat and it has been have some thyroid stuff so we avoid wheat a lot but I do have this beautiful rolling pin that I find awful so I'm going to just cut up this entire stack of oranges sometimes if there's not a thick bottom you don't have to cut it but you do want to cut with ruffles I was so I have clean hands this is a food that I'm going to be leaving out on my kitchen counter for about a month on that I'll show you maybe over in another video what it looks like over the course of the month and you don't have to slice off both bottoms but definitely the part that was attached to the tree I think there's some kind of chemical in there that makes everything a little bit so this is a very messy process I don't try to get too clean with it and I get Bansi I am a lazy cook and what I mean and make sure there are no bugs in there too because these are came off a natural tree so you know there might be a critter or two in there there's no spring my friend doesn't spray she she's guarded biodynamically which means she puts everything in the ground at a certain time ticks everything according to moon cycle you don't have to do that if you're just getting such great food vegetables into your life you are way ahead of beginning so I'm extremely excited to use these and you may be wondering how do you use fermented oranges or blended lemons well anywhere you would use orange or lemon or lime so if you'd use them in a salad or if you system in a braise or with fish they are amazing I know somebody who you know uses them finishes a jar every week her mother you know makes a picture every single week and she uses them all up so I know it stores like Trader Joe's carry them Whole Foods I carry the specialty stores carry them but when I went to Morocco there were huge jars of preserved lemons it was like it was the most gorgeous thing you've ever seen it was it was decorative and and you just wanted to know how they were using them and they use them in tagine quite a bit side note on Morocco you can see what I look like that is the first country that I've ever went to where I felt like I blended in people thought I was aligned what I told them I wasn't Moroccan was pretty amazing actually it was a great experience I went with my mother we had the best time that's a story for another day so you can see I'm not even looking I'm not measuring anything I'm simply filling these oranges in a few minutes I'm going to smush them all down so I can get as many in a tapa I'm making ten jars I use the picolit system to ferment it's an airlock system which allows that good bad air to get it out and keeps the air that the the bacteria needs to be anaerobic to stay in that's to scientific for you don't worry all you have to do is lightly cover this for three weeks check on it a couple times a week make sure there's no mold forming and if there are there are plenty of based groups book groups about fermented foods that can give you guidelines and you know if your sperm that have gone bad but this makes it well you know this is really beautiful I haven't gotten too adventurous that once my ferments are done that I just leave it on the counter like they do in Morocco because that's the next step for me this is this is like I said a brand new from area for me fermenting these oranges and if you get a lemon or an orange or something with a lot of seeds don't worry about it don't flip to the bill since the bottom you won't even eat them and it's going to be I've done this with lemons mill many times my refrigerator one of the staples in my refrigerator is lamented Langley always so one of the things I'm going to do now so that I don't lose the spaces I always have a pickling jar so this this is filled with different things cumin please not for this one chemical in just but cardamom cinnamon juniper berries I have peppercorns in here cardamom is my favorite spice so it's an Indian spice that I happen to love juniper berries feel really great in here I have some bay leaves one of the things that was suggested to me was to put in some ginger so I'm going to put in some ginger at the end and right now it's pretty slow that's good time to just muddle this down and smush to make more room and I've got the clothes are here I think about what would be great and orange no and neither be salty orange so you can use these other yams for Thanksgiving it's wintertime here so oranges and citrus fruits are really special my favorite felt growing up with little house in the prairie and I remember reading a passage and correct me if I'm wrong somebody but she was really excited to get an orange in her Christmas stocking and that was one orange and with her or an apple or some kind of fruit so apples and citrusy had to find a way to preserve these and you don't have to be too precious with these things others make it look pretty you just have to know that it's going to turn out okay and and the bacteria and everything is good bacteria it's great for your gut it's going to heal you you have any intestinal issues I mean really anything fermented anything fermented is really great for you if you eat it raw it's not too processed and pickles sauerkraut I'm going to teach you to make a lot of fermented long path and how gorgeous is that I love cooking it just creates so much beautiful food out of the most simple ingredients one more thing to know about is you do want to keep the jar covered so I use a kitchen towel so that sunshine doesn't come in I don't want a sunshine his son is an actual it killed bacteria so we want the good bacteria to have a nice cozy home so I just cover it with a kitchen towel and leave it on my counter so I don't forget it to check on it because this is day five you can see the bubbles and the work starting to happen I'll just shake it up and you can see those bubbles where the bacteria is actually creating its own anaerobic environment in there and that is hidden in his breath you know I had this jar from from hospital of a coma alt I save everything so I'm going to fill this up for my friend let her ferment it on her countertop with all the extra oranges that she gave me because that's my gift to her when people let me garden from their garden I always make them something special afterwards I don't think we're going to have enough of marmalade today but my other girlfriend wants to give me some of her oranges so we'll make marmalade with rosemary have a great day here's to your health that of the planet and that of your family take care [Music]", "TOTYu6jjLcg": "all right how's everybody doing so I thought I would do a video on my three new Meyer lemon trees I grew these last year I started growing one about a year and a half ago and last year we harvested lemons off of the tree had a great success unfortunately the soil got contaminated with all the bugs that I had in the basement and I had to let the plant go it's no longer with us anyway so I wanted to give people an idea and show them how you know you can successfully grow lemons indoors I bought these from via citrus this isn't promotional in a sense I'm just letting you know where I bought them I did buy them they did give me a code for a percentage off and it helped towards shipping and hopefully I'll be able to extend that code to my viewers in the future but for right now I got three new ones these are gonna be going with me as we go to where I moved to our off-grid cabin and in a few months and this is part of the perpetual garden that I'd like to keep going off grid on solar or on grid while I'm here still in town so each one of these lights I don't really get into the lights too much I try to show what the lights do but I've had a lot of people requesting more of a detailed video so for a basic idea what's going on with these lights these lights are my design of spectrum there's three different Kelvin temperatures and the light to create full-spectrum light and my claim to fame is the 10,000 K which does amazing job with terpenes with oil production with flowering with penetration it's just a really really great spectrum I've been using it since about 2010 and this light has proved itself out very very well I like the thirty-six waters which by the way the dimensions are twelve by twelve by one inch and they weigh about a pound and a half there's a hanging kit that comes with the lights or you can use zip zip ties and put them on baker's racks however you want to do it the lights are 36 watts and full-spectrum the reason why I like these lights so much is because they're very versatile you can you can add more take away split up make different Gardens or put them all together collectively and have one big garden and that's why I keep this lighter and the one I like the most has always been the 36 water this particular light the equivalent in comparison grow lighting is about a hundred and eight watts so for the draw which right now it's pulling 30 point 4 watts it's the equivalent amount of a hundred and eight watts of alternative lighting like t5 metal halide or high pressure sodium the way I've got the spectrum blend is a seven to two to one ratio and that ratio allows me to really replicate full-spectrum Sun without IR but there is UV in the 10 K and that's what helps with the terpenes there's a lot that goes on with the 10 K it's a nice mix so for folks that are they want to know a little bit more about the lights that's a little bit what's going on their full spectrum if you'd like to see what the lights actually do you can jump over to my Instagram we've got thousands of pictures a thousand pictures over there our hashtag hidden got harvest grow lights has got 500 plus posts from my grows and people all around the country in the world this light proves itself out all the time and for the low wattage it's perfect for growing off-grid I'm working on getting a DC for these I don't know how soon I can get it but I am trying to go DC with these it would be great and the solar people I'm hoping to start entering that market very soon I've got a lot of interested people growing off-grid right now with the current grow lights so 30.4 watts is what they draw twelve by twelve by one inch I hang them about 18 inches above the groves and that gives me about an 18 by 18 inch footprint so these are three of them together across a five foot span and I've got no problem with a grand total of nine ninety one point four watts of cover in this area so these will be coming with me to the cabin it's I'm hoping to get perpetual fruit off these year-round keep them short and keep it manageable they can be done in apartments so you really just you wouldn't need one light for one plant but you might be able to get to underneath maybe even three all depends on how you organize them how you prune them if you guys want any advice on lemons and how to do lemons I suggest you go over to lead farmer 73 on YouTube I follow him I like this guy a lot he's very inspirational he's got a lot to talk about and he's a master of the citrus so I hope this helps everybody out this is from via citrus these are their Meyer lemons they're back in stock this is about a two and a half year old plant I hope I'm speaking correctly two to three year old plant and they're well situated there's blossoms on one of them already and they should produce lemons extremely soon they'll be underneath these full-spectrum lights and we'll do an update once a month on these things I'll let you know as they blossom and when we start producing fruit hope everyone's doing well be safe and have a great night bye bye", "_OH8GwbNnK4": "today's video is all about citrus decorations I've really done a video all about how to use citrus peels for cleaning but today I'm going to show how to use them for traditional Christmas decorations let's start with tangerines and satsumas my favorite way to use these is to make citrus twelves with them what you need to do is take a sharp knife and start to cut around it just curl around the base quickly slice across the middle and then turn it around the top slowly it peel it along the cut but then you should end up with a shape like this now some scissors cut along those edges until you end up with a few strips of peel any leftovers either go into the compost on my citrus concentrate jar and I've already done a video all about that so I'll have that linked in the description box and here there are a few ways that you can turn them into citrus trials you can either roll them up like this and dry them in a dehydrator or you can wrap them around a chopstick or a drying rack this part can be annoyingly fiddly but with a little bit of practice they dry beautifully [Music] when you're peeling the satsumas even though you've already cut a line it can be very very easy to rip it and then end up with a Satsuma that's just no good for making 12 if this happens don't worry keep the larger pieces and then you can cut them out into whatever shape you want to decorate with you could cut out Christmas trees gingerbread men or stars I normally outline them on the back and then cut it out and then dry them [Music] before you dry them try and make sure that you add a hole first because if you want to hang them later they're very very brittle and it's very hard to add that hole later so try and do it first while they're still not dried another thing to point out is that if you let them air dry they have a tendency to curl up in on themselves it's great if that's what you're going for with the twelve but if it's something that you want to dry flat try and dry them right away either in the oven or in a dehydrator after that to cover up the marking on the back either fill them in with a marker I paint it or I foil it for foil you'll need a little bit of PVA goo you just want to dabble it over the back and then dabble some foil over I find that it's easiest to do this with a brush I have tried to do it with my fingers before and it just gets very messy very very quickly so if you can use a brush when it comes to oranges either dry these whole by sticking them in the boiler a few months before Christmas well not in the boiler but in the boiler cupboard and then another thing that I do is try and make them into little citrus slices I've tried to turn these into twelve and little shapes before but satsumas just work better so I make little slices with the oranges and make everything else with citrus fruits which are easily peelable [Music] I'll have a few more videos in the next few weeks showing exactly how I use these but just for today I wanted to do a quick video showing you just the basics and then later on I'll show you how I incorporate them into my Christmas decorations and as usual if you like my videos and want to see more content feel free to follow me on the mailing list do not

different I have a soap that I'm going to be doing and it's in B citrus-scented and I thought instead of like going out and buying dried fruit I thought I would do it myself so I'm going to share my experience here with you guys I went out to our local store called farm boy and I picked up some really nice organic fruits here I'm just doing one of each right now but what I've got here is a really beautiful orange I've got a pink grapefruit just gorgeous organics and a lemon so what I want to do is slice them and dry them in my oven so everything I've got here you can use a mandolin if you have a mandolin I do have a mandolin but today just for today I'm using a knife mandolins make it easier to get more uniform cut slices so next time I might use my mandolin but today I'm going to use my knife so I've got a good cutting board my knife I've got some paper towels off to the side here that we're gonna just dab away any excess moisture before putting them on our rack I've got a cookie sheet and on top of that I've got a silicon mat and then a baking rack here so I'm going to set my slices on top of this rock and they're gonna go into a 200 degree oven that's 200 Fahrenheit and so I'm gonna get started I've already washed my fruit make sure you wash the outsides really good I'm going to cut the ends off just so we can start seeing the nice citrus there on each side love the smell of lemons this smells mmm just so fantastic anyway I'm gonna leave those off and I'm going to cut these about probably about a quarter of an inch in thickness make sure you get a nice sharp knife to get a nice beautiful slice and probably cutting way too much more than what I need but I have like a couple oranges a couple of the grapefruit and a few lemons but I'm only doing one of each for this batch smells wonderful it's just the thing you want for this time of the year is some really nice fresh citrus and it's gonna look beautiful hopefully and they're all dried and sitting on top a soap so here we go got the lemons done and I'm just going to set them on top of the paper towels like so just like this and then I'm gonna dab the top with another set of paper towels just to get any of the excess juice and moisture and then I'm gonna set them right on top of the baking rack like so so now we're going to continue on let's slice up this beautiful beautiful isn't that a gorgeous grapefruit I love the outside just as much as the inside there's my my oven and there's slice it's a little more because I don't see mine there we go it didn't quite see the citrus on the inside yet do this a little bit more as well there we go it's just some beautiful red color I'm excited to see how this looks on the inside when we're done drying that is so again cutting about a quarter of an inch look at those gorgeous slices watch your fingers I'm not usually the most coordinated sometimes when it comes to cutting things I have had some mishaps my husband can tell you nothing that's required a trip to the hospital though this one's squirt now hopefully I can gracefully cut this last kind of curving my my fingers my knifes probably getting a little dull may grab another knife let's see if this won't work a little better I don't want to squish my slice too much that's ones feeling a little wonky that's okay yeah we won't use that one maybe we'll do these four so again I'm going to set these on my paper towel just to blot off the moisture again now when we put these in the oven what you're gonna be doing is putting these in for like a half hour then you'll come back and you'll turn them over just cleaning that up and then we're gonna come back every half hour for at least a couple hours I will let you know how long mine tape and then we'll know for sure how long is this gonna take but I don't want them to hit like to dry it out back to the beautiful orange mmm look at that doesn't that just make you hungry it's so pretty so now when I do my soap I intend on using like I'm gonna cut these probably into quarters to decorate my soaps with not those gorgeous slices look at them they're so pretty now this is where a mandolin would would be beneficial because it gets a little tricky in on the slack slice like I said usually this is something that this is where I would end up cutting myself off anyway this one's a little thick but I'm gonna do it anyway and we'll just throw this one in just like that so again onto the sheet here the paper towels getting some lovely lovely slices I mean look at look at how beautiful those are aren't they just gorgeous here dabbing them like so squinch these up all onto the same tray I'm sure they'll shrink up a little bit but look it isn't that a beautiful tray of sliced fruit oh my goodness so I'm gonna put these in the oven that way I'm gonna use a fork and just go in and and flip them over like so and we're gonna go every half hour I will come back and I'll let you know how long this takes to get my desired effect so we'll be back and we're gonna pop these into the 200 degree oven okay guys we're back and it's been about roughly five and a half six hours I've had these in and I took the lemons out maybe after four and a half five hours because they were they were looking pretty done see and so I cut those actually I cut those in half with my kitchen shears and then I've just taken the rest of these out of the oven they're not really wet to the touch anymore and I don't want them to lose too much of their color so I'm gonna take them out and just kind of let them finish drawing a bit I think if they were a little thinner maybe they wouldn't have taken so long in the oven I think I'm gonna get myself a dehydrator and maybe try that and use that and see how it goes but I really think they turned out lovely I can show you what I'm gonna do with these I've got these glass jars that I put my body whip in and I think I'm going to keep them inside the glass jars I'll keep the lemons in one and the pink grapefruit in another and then I'll put the orange in yet another so my little lid on there and it's just a pretty way to keep them stored you could put them in a little Tupperware but yeah go ahead and leave them like that and then when you open the lid and take a just wonderful sniff something else you can do with these I mean yes I'm a soul maker and this is what I'm gonna use them for but you could take these and put them in your coffee cup before pouring tea that would be a wonderful way to use these you could use them to decorate cakes with it's just gonna be a marvelous addition to my soaps though I mean look at look at how beautiful that is it's just quite hard but like I said I would take my kitchen shears and I'm gonna cut them because they don't want to put the whole slice onto my soaps I'm just gonna put I'm going to do these larger slices in quarter rounds like so and like so I'm gonna just toss them in a jar and keep them in there with the lid on so thanks for watching me in my little fruit drawing video and oh you could put these in mixed drinks too that would be really pretty to have these inside mixed drink but they really turned out lovely and I think like I said I think I'm gonna get a food dehydrator though that way I can do this at night I can just put all my slices in in the evening and let it run all night and dehydrate my fruit slices that way so anyway that was my doings for today on Friday actually just got off the computer chatting with you all during my sweet rain-soaked cake video and that was fun if you ever see it one of the premieres and you're able to make it in for the live chat it's always fun to chat with everybody so while we watch me make soap but anyway there we go that's our dried fruit slices and those are gonna be topping off some citrusy soaps that I'm planning on doing in my next video so thanks again for tuning in and we'll catch you all on the next video bye for now", "JgcSUZ6eQRc": "in my grocery shopping video this week I showed you guys that I bought a whole bag of lemons at Costco and I mentioned I was going to freeze them and I had several people ask about how I do that and so I figured I'd just go ahead and do a video on freezing lemons I love having lemons and my fries are all ready to go I have bought lemons in the past fresh with the intention of using them and then they just sit until they go bad and just getting a huge bag of them and getting them all frozen and in a ziplock bag in the freezer it makes it so easy to just pull it out whenever I need it and they can sit in the freezer as long as I want to leave them there so the three main things that I use the frozen lemons for the first is just to put into water I will pull out a slice of frozen lemon and throw it in my water and it makes delicious lemon water and it's an ice cube because it's frozen so it keeps my water cold as well and then also I like to throw a slice of lemon into smoothies or if I'm making like a veggie juice it's nice to throw in a slice of lemon in there it gives a really good zing and flavor and then also I like to pull out some slices and stuff inside of a whole chicken if I'm going to be cooking a whole chicken in my instant pot or roasting a whole chicken so those are the three ways that I mainly use the lemons I'm sure there's lots of other ways if you have other ways that you use lemons around your house let me know so I guess I'm ready to go ahead and get processing my lemons one thing that I like to do is sometimes I'm not going to do it with all of them this time but I like to zest my lemons and you can actually freeze the zest and have that in a container in the freezer and pull that out for recipes because that gives recipes a really great flavor and I rarely have the time or the lemons on hand to get fresh zest when I need some so having it in the freezer just to pull out whenever I need it is really nice so it's really simple I love these microplane zester I've had other ones before that weren't microplane and I did not like them very much but once I got this one I was like oh this is amazing and it's perfect for doing a lot of lemons you just zest the entire outside and collect the zest when you're done and put it in a container in the freezer and you can just pull it out whenever you need it I'm not actually going to zest all of my lemons this time because the last time I did a big batch I froze all the zest and I still have some so I don't really need any right now but you can I not highly recommend it it's a great way to get the delicious flavor and it makes it super convenient to have it right in the freezer this is my lemon zest container from last time you can see I still have quite a bit so I don't want to take the time to do all the zesting this time until I use all of this lemon zest now since I do like to put these lemon slices whole into my smoothies I want to take off the yellow part and if I'm zesting the entire lemon that's already done through the zesting but since I'm not going to be zesting all of these I'm gonna slice the just the yellow part off the outside of the lemons I want to leave as much of the white as possible because there's a lot of health benefits to consuming the white part of the lemon rind but I just don't want the bitterness of the all of the yellow part so I just slice it all off just like that and then I like to freeze my lemons into rounds and it makes it a lot easier to get out the seeds that way I have found so I'm just gonna slice these into rounds like that and you can see it's really easy to find all of the seeds and sometimes that this can be the most time-consuming part of the process getting out all these seeds because there could be a lot of seeds and lemons and I don't want those in my frozen lemons so I'm just pulling out all the seeds and then I will line them on my pan actually this is a plastic lid a pan lid that I use for freezing and I just have a silicone baking liner down there and I will freeze layers of lemons and as I do a layer I will put some of these cheap storage bags just on top of the the layer of lemons so that they don't stick together when they're freezing so I freeze them in single layers and then I once they're frozen solid can pull them out of the freezer and put them into a ziploc bag and then they're ready to go in my freezer so I got all the seeds out of here and I'm just laying them on my pan in a single layer there and now I'm ready to just keep peeling deseeding and slicing these lemons and get them all layered onto my pan [Music] I got them all done and I'm sure some of you have some great ideas about what to do with these leftover lemon peels I have seen recipes on Pinterest for my cleaning products natural cleaning products using lemon and orange peels but I have not tried any of them if you have any recommendations for what to do with this huge pile of lemon peels let me know I would love to hear it and here is my tray of the beautiful lemons I got two layers and I'm ready to pop these into the freezer and when they are frozen solid I will pull them out and get them into a freezer ziploc bag and I will be back to show you that when it is time lemons have been freezing overnight and so they are frozen solid and I'm ready to get them bagged up in a freezer ziploc bag [Music] and that's really all there is to it I have all my lemons ready to pop into the freezer and use whenever I need them and that is it for this video I hope you guys are doing great and I will talk to you guys real soon", "XkWJL03YLfo": "damaged fruit can be on the tree pick this fruit but do not put it in the bag throw this fruit away throw away all fruit that are split or diseased do not pick in the rain or fruit are wet from the rain or morning dew only pick the trees once fruit and leaves are dry if you see a fruit with a stem break off the stem before putting it in the bag do not throw the fruit into the bag bring your hand down to the bag and place it into the bag do not pick up any fruit that have fallen onto the ground do not pick fruit into buckets the harvest supervisor will not let you start picking in the morning until the air temperature is about 12 degrees centigrade you will also not be able to pick in summer if it gets too hot do not overfill picking bags fill it with fruit level to the top of the bag do not place the letter on trees with fruit remaining on the lower parts of the canopy first pick the lower parts of the canopy and then use the letter to pick the upper part of the canopy at the end of the day shake out the bag to remove any leaves twigs or insects that may fallen into the bag to unload fruit hang the bag over the bin hold the side of the bin as this will help to support your back as you lower the bag lower the bag using your arms to carry most to the weight unhook the straps and slowly lift the bag to gently release the fruit into the bin do not drop the fruit into the bin always lower the bag into the bin before unloading do not put the bag on the side of the bin always hang the bag directly into the bin ready to be lowered after unloading the fruit check the fruit and remove stems from any fruit do not use bins that have any dirt or debris clean the bin out with a rag or brush until clean do not under fill bins with fruit you might be asked to fill the bin properly wasting your valuable picking time Phil bins level to the top you can move a bin by rotating it on its side to do this first lift the side of the bin by bending

lorna and if you are new here hi how you doing and if you are not new here thanks guys for returning i have been enjoying getting to know the community down below in the comments you can always leave a comment i will respond at some point um if you're new here again thanks guys for stopping by and watching this video i have been doing some prepping videos for mainly short term i haven't really gone into my long term stuff but i do prep short term and long term side by side i think it is important but today we're doing a little something different i wanted to try my hand at some candied lemon and limes i love these these are so good um it was my first time ever doing it yesterday and i yes i did film yesterday but there were so many distractions and i also blew a fuse on the stone and i couldn't figure out which one it was because my boyfriend usually does that and it doesn't happen often so um yeah i just decided to scrap that footage restart it let's do it together and this is the outcome this is from last night oh so good guys oh so beautiful so tasty um these can hold up for a month a little over a month in the refrigerator and also if you store them correctly and maybe use a excuse me hang on one second all right sorry about that if you use a sealer on your jar and jar them up nicely and put them in a cool dry place these can last up to five to six months um so let's get to slicing one thing that i learned from yesterday is my slices were a little too thick so i'm going to and i did something a little different than most all the other recipes and i'll i kind of use two processes and mix it into one um for myself and this might not work for you guys but it worked for me last night and i'm telling you these are they're just so delicious look at those glaze and i have some orange slices too hang on let me get grab those i have not not very many but there we go these are so good i have these in the stove right now just kind of chilling out why i sorry i got myself a little tripod it's just a tiny little baby one um so that i can be hands-free with you guys all right i mean except for when that happens um i'm gonna get to slicing we'll be right back all right so we have the lemon sliced and i tried to go as thin as possible some of these are a little thick on some sides but um definitely sooner than yesterday's which i think will help dehydrate them a little bit better so i'm gonna do two methods in one like i said which i'm going to make the simple syrup which is one cup of water one cup of sugar let it simmer and boil put these in and kind of get them translucent and then i'm gonna pull them and set them on the food dehydrator and let them dehydrate for pretty much all day now if i wanted to just set these make a simple syrup uh glaze these up put some sugar on put them on the dehydrator just like this then they would need about a full day's worth like 10 12 i think it's what i think it said 12 hours i think i said 12 hours so basically an overnight um i'm not gonna do that that's why i'm starting this early i think it's it's only like 9 30 right now so by the time dinner rolls around these should be done and ready to pull i do flip them every couple of hours to get them nice and i also rotate my trays as well okay so let's get the simple syrup going maybe we'll just leave this on here let you face the lime sorry do not mean to make you dizzy all right so i'm gonna grab one cup of water sink is right behind me oh i forgot to turn this stuff on oh my goodness guys so it's um oops it's one cup of water and then that was two half cups right there and then it's one cup of sugar but i'm gonna do a little less i am i i feel like i don't need a full cup so that was a half half a cup plus about a half a half a cup so we're gonna let that get going it's really that simple simple syrup it's really that simple guys we're gonna let this get going and once it starts simmering and the sugar starts dissolving you add your slices um i'm gonna have to do two rounds because you saw how many limes or lemons i got i'm gonna do the lemons first and honestly i'll tell you the truth which ones i like better i like the limes i do i like the limes but these are good to throw in tea you know in winter fall and winter are here it's definitely getting colder um i am in the pacific northwest washington state and it's getting colder at night and i've been loving my cup of tea and you can throw a slice of lemon or two in there and if you really would like to get fancy and prefer an adult beverage you can do a hot toddy and throw a couple slices this i mean it's delicious guys they're good but the limes are definitely my favorite all right i'll be back once this starts submarine up all right so give you a little closer look at these look how pretty they are now i did not go overboard on the sugar um you can use powdered sugar you can use regular sugar and that's what i did i used regular sugar to coat these after they were done but i didn't want to go over overboard i really didn't oh they're so pd so i'm going to stick these away i'm actually going to pull this lime slice out and i'm going to eat that one and i'm going to stick them away and we'll check back in a second all right i'm starting to place these in because they're starting to get get little bubbles in there they're so pity smells so good i love citrus that's one reason why i wanted to do some of these because not only like fall and winter is here um just to keep no you can't have that lemon seed drop my dog was like yes um i do not take the seeds out like i've been doing this a lot that's funny um i didn't take the seeds out last time it was fine some of them actually like popped out okay so yes i'm gonna have to do two rounds which is fine oh yeah it's getting a little hot all right so once this is really simmered up give you a closer look here yummy so simmering uh you want to flip them they say like every 15 minutes but i found yesterday that i was flipping them like every like seven to get a real even translucent on them but again i did thinner slices this time so we'll see what happens um and how long they have to be in here so it is um 9 50. all right that's not right my clock's not right my clock's not right because i blew a fuse in my stove all right so we'll be back we'll check in once these guys get going all right so let's look at these little bubbles here so this is about where you want it to be don't let it get um any stronger than this because you don't want to burn your burn up your lemons like you can burn and burn them you're not going to burn them burn them but you just want them real nicely even evenly translucent so and this is going to make the syrup and you can save this syrup in a jar and use it in all kinds of stuff baking and take a tiny bit and put it in some tea if you wanted i did that yesterday and i showed you guys yesterday but again i didn't like the footage this video is going to be a little bit longer than norm my normal videos it's a i try to keep them about 10 minutes and we are at 9 10 mark so i'm gonna pause until we get to the next step here because i really don't like my videos to be that long um we all got lives we all got lives don't we okay we'll be back all right so i've done a flip and you can see how they're changing to a translucent um color see there's this one right here is more like solid and you can start seeing through them a little bit so once uh some of these bigger ones start um going a little more translucent as well i'm going to pull them and put them in the dehydrator and then we're going to repeat this process with the lemons i'm not going to show you that limes are the same we'll probably i'll show you a clip of the limes and then once they're in the dehydrator i'll show you how i set it up all right so we have pulled the last bit of the lemons and now oops i'm gonna put ah it's going everywhere put this simple syrup into a jar and i'm gonna save that and grab a towel wipe the bottom of this because i'm going to be oh it's sticky it's already sticky i'm going to be using it for the lines so now we have a lemon simple syrup and you can coat the lemons with this and put some sugar i didn't put any coating on it i find that's a little too much i tried a couple pieces yesterday all right i'm going to lid that up well actually i'll let that cool a little bit okay let's do some lines okay same process one cup of uh water one cup of sugar again not gonna do a full cup i don't find for myself that i need that so i'm gonna cut up these limes throw some in and then we'll head over to the dehydrator and see what it looks like okay so about four limes cut up i'm gonna keep the other three um because i like to cook with lime so until i get some more limes is all i'm gonna do today but we're gonna do the same thing as the lemons and then we will put them on the tray call it good and pull them later this evening very simple to do guys again you can keep the syrups you can glaze them after you pull them and add some sugar i don't do the glazing part i haven't because i've only done this once but yesterday worked out perfect where i didn't want the glaze i find it a little too sweet so i didn't get as thin as um i wanted uh i didn't want to do two rounds so i kind of shoved them in here but if you have a bigger pan which i do but it is in the dishwasher um they would probably fit better all right we'll check back in all right so we have the limes set up on the top shelf and we've got the lemons going on the bottom we're gonna let these go for um and i don't have the plastic trays to put in the trays but that's fine it's lemon and limes they're gonna be just fine um and i shook out off the syrup before i put them on so they're just lightly coated and then we put some sugar on the top as you can see you see a little sugar crystals and that's it guys you let this go for um a few hours like i said uh probably around dinner time for me um it is about 10 something like 10 30. um and we're gonna yeah probably around actually probably before dinner time for five o'clock i'll pull these but i'll flip them through the times through the hours i'm babbling now so i'm gonna let you go but thanks for watching let me know if you do this let me know if you've done this let me know if you've done this with other fruits i've done the oranges yesterday as well i didn't have very many oranges i would like to do grapefruits as well so yeah let me know what kind of candied fruits that you like and how your process goes we'll talk soon bye", "lGghvV6KqcU": "I'm Karen McKenna and today I'm going to show\nyou how we incorporate citrus into our holiday decorating. Cut Florida Oranges and Florida Grapefruit into thin slices Place on a baking rack and bake at 160 degrees for 6 to 9 hours Let fruit cool completely and hang as homemade ornaments", "4Rus4aKRDr4": "hey everyone this is jenny from homestead corner and today we're gonna can up some [Music] [Applause] [Music] oranges [Applause] so this is another one of those super simple easy canning projects that um it's really it i don't think it could be any simpler uh you just want to peel your oranges you want to start with that you want to make sure they're super clean i've already washed all these so we've got nice clean because i save these peels we want to save all the peels on this so um you don't have to but i use them there are so many uses for the peels and if you have one of these a little citrus peelers i love this thing my mom bought these back in the 70s i think and she gave me a couple of them and i just love them the tupperware has been around forever and this is really easy just pull these skins off and peel just like you would to eat it just pull those right out and you just want to try and get as much of this white membrane off as you can and a lot of times while you're pulling it apart it is going to come right off a lot of it so i just pull each little node off like that and throw them in a bowl it's that hard any stringy pieces i try to pull those off it's a little time consuming getting all this stuff off but it's well worth it they're ready to just pop right in your mouth when you take them out of the jar yum yum so i'm just going to keep going peeling and getting all these little nodes apart and i will bring you back when we get to the next step well that was a lot of oranges we don't have quite as many as we started with because they're really delicious and we were snacking on them while we were peeling them so um i've got all my oranges peeled and into the little orange node pieces and i've got as much of the little white membrane off as i can so while we were finishing up the last couple oranges i got a pot of hot water just plain old water i brought it to a boil and this is what we're going to put in our jars these oranges are plenty sweet enough they do i don't think they need any sugar you could do a simple syrup lots of people do it that way but i don't i think they have plenty of sugar natural sugars all on their own so i am just going to take and start filling jars so i have these in the hot water bath canner and i have heated them up so they're nice and sterilized and hot our oranges are like room temperature so they will be fine in there and i am just going to start putting these in you want to make sure you have super clean hands oh there's a little crazy piece get that off and just pop these in and we want to shake them down and oh it's a hot and just pack them in nice and tight you don't want they're going to shrink a little bit so you want to get them in there i want to get them kind of tight in there so you can kind of arrange them and poke them around get them in there how you like them so i want to kind of squish them in and i like to leave one inch headspace which is right about this rim you can use a funnel for this but i find it to kind of be a pain in the butt so i just stick the oranges in and then use the funnel for the liquid and we will fill up this jar as well so you can see two and this is really super simple and easy to do i love these easy canning projects and in the winter time fresh fruits and citruses all these canned fruits are just such a nice comforting taste and oh my goodness they're great you can add them to recipes you can do all kinds of stuff with this ah they're not gonna settle too much but i'm gonna get that right in there and brenda this is for you these are i almost forgot these are the classico spaghetti jars that i'm using for this and they are this exact jar you can see it's the atlas mason it says right on the side it also says it under this label but those are the jars and they are one and a half pints and i have a couple of the lids i'm going to do two with these lids i don't i have plenty of other lids but i'm going to do those just for you so you can see them and uh now we've got these full i am just going to put my funnel on and we're going to fill these up with this hot water and just up to that one inch mark now there is a ton of ways you can do this but i think this works perfectly it keeps them nice and yummy you've still got your oranges all winter long goodness [Music] and then we're going to de-bubble we just you can see the bubbles coming up you want to make sure you move everything in there because these really hold the air in and you can see if your water level drops too low after you de-bubble you can re-add just a tiny bit more to fix it so everything is covered and there we have it so once our jar is full we're just going to make sure the rim is nice and clean and we're going to add a lid and a ring and this baby is ready for the canner so i'm going to put this in the hot water bath canner and get the other jar finished ball always recommends to use a new unused lid every time i did have someone ask me about using these classical lids and the classical jars so i'm doing this to show her how i do it but this is not a recommended practice but i do it for myself so and it works for me so she asked and i am sharing all right so we're just gonna fill this one up just like the other one with that one inch head space and then i'm going to de-bubble you can see those little bubbles coming up all right and just want to make sure everything is underwater and then i'm going to wipe the rim we're only using hot water so there's not much of a chance is too much on the ring so that i'm just using a dry paper towel today because i'm just using water and then we're going to use this classical lid again ball does not recommend this nor does the usda or anybody that i know of but i do it and it works for me so these lids you can see they have a rubber ring inside i've heated it up in the warm water with my other lids and i'm just going to put it on and two fingers tight just like all of my others and this is ready to go in the canner and i am going to continue to fill jars and i will bring you back okay so once we have our jars all filled and in the canner i have turned this up on high we're going to bring this to a boil once this is to a rolling boil we're going to set our timer and process it for 10 minutes and then once it hits the 10 minutes we'll turn it off and let them sit in the canter for 5 minutes then we'll pull them out and that is it to canning oranges they're really it's a simple project it doesn't take all that long peeling them and getting them all ready to go in the jars is definitely the longest hardest part of the whole project but then you just pack your jars quick and easy just hot water you can do it in a simple syrup if you wanted them to be a little sweeter but these oranges were super sweet all on their own so just a little hot water was all they needed and they the lids back here the classical lid if you just press on these you can tell that they're sealed they'll pop if they're not and that one's all sealed and we got one over here these are still really hot so um this one has not sealed yet that's one of the ball lids but if sometimes it takes a few minutes for them to seal up and that's okay we got time they're gonna sit here all night and i will clean them up in the morning and oranges are easy and wonderful to add to recipes in the winter they're a must-have in our pantry if you like this video give us a thumbs up subscribe we'll see in the next video [Music] bye [Music] [Applause] you", "GHUOlq-KVo4": "let's make candied blood orange slices we want very thin slices start with two cups sugar and a cup of water swirl this around over medium heat until the sugar melts place your orange slices in and cook them over low heat until the rinds become translucent place each slice on parchment paper to let them dry that's almost as pretty as you these would make great gifts for the holidays", "7bg0zktpRfI": "guys welcome to rains place tonight I am dehydrating some citrus and very easy to do and once it's dehydrated you can just eat it like a snack you don't have to peel it you have to wash it really good and okay this is a lemon slice I'm using a mandolin to slice them all evenly I'm doing navel oranges lemons and limes now again you don't have to take the skin off of them you can if you want to I prefer to leave it on because I like a little bit of the bitter with it and once they're dried you can just eat them like candy or you could sprinkle them with sugar and then dehydrate them I like complain but I also like to put them in the bottom of like my tea cup and then add the hot tea to it it's really good you can eat it when it's done then so let me just show you what I'm doing real quick I'm doing navel oranges right now I just cut off the ends and you don't have to throw the ends away you can put them in a pitcher see how it's got a lot of good fruit on it still you could put it in a pitcher and then just fill it with water and leave it in the fridge with some ice cubes or something and then for safety if anybody's ever sliced their finger off on a mandolin y'all know what I'm talking about just put it on here on the safety thing and I got this on HSN it's the brand name is called plate PL and then the number 8 and I have it on the largest setting which is I think it's about an eighth of an inch so I'm just going to put it on here and I'm going to slice it's showing up on me I think up to recruitable there we go okay so anything ugly like this I just save and that's going to go in the water picture and then the rest of them are all nice and even and I'm going to stick them in the dehydrator over here I'll show you what I have give me a second lovely movie over there with me okay I'm back over here okay what I have is I have a nesco american harvest it's the square dehydrator and they came with I became with four trays what did you come with when you think one two three four I don't know I believe it came with four trays then I bought another four trays and then that maxes out my machine at eight trays and then this is like a little silicone insert that you can buy separately these are good when you do fruit and anything sticky because if you were to put it just on the hard plastic it's like you get stuck to here and breaks apart once it's dried these are nice I think they're made of silicone I'm not really sure what they're made out of but um they work real well and you can pick up the whole the whole mat and actually like bend it to pull your fruit off if you have to but let me just show you you want to not over stack them because you want the air to circulate that's how it dries and then just stick them all all around and these are so good like I said we we eat them plain like just after they dried or we can or I like them in tea I left my daughter put them into your not but that's how I like them and these navel oranges have some seeds in them so I'm just poking them out as I see them and I'm going to put these on I put I have to look at the book to make sure but I believe it's going to be 130 degrees and it usually I just let them run overnight and then I'll check them in the morning sometimes halfway through you can flip them over if you want to and I think that's all I'm going to stick on that trick so don't want too much all right I'll come and I'll show you what I have all the trays filled up and then I will start it guys I'm back I got six trays filled with lemons limes and navel oranges I'm going for the top of my dehydrator if you don't have a dehydrator and you want to get one I suggest that you can get um let me just put this on real quick 135 is roots and vegetables and that's it I'm going to leave it all night long if you don't have one you want to get one I would suggest you get one that has the fan in the top and a temperature control so you can do all kinds of things like the big name brand for the you know like the big expensive good ones are called Excalibur's and yes I will own one day but for now this one does really good so I'm happy with it in fact I might get a second one before summer so I'm bringing you back in the morning and I'll show you where it's at probably once before I go to bed I'll open it up and check it and maybe I'll bring you along for that maybe not but I will see you again definitely at the end of this hey guys it's been about they were in here drawing for 16 hours and then they've been sitting in here cooling off for another two hours or so and you see them they're totally hard and these are real bitter which I do like and I've already tried a lemon one and oh my god they're so good I could just they make you pucker but boy are they delicious and just eat them like this or I'm like I said I really like to throw a couple like maybe an orange and a lemon in the bottom of a tea cup and pour some hot tea over it so good I'm going to take them all out of here and that's it that's all there is to it you basically slice them because there's citrus you can see the limes got a little darker as opposed to the lemons well that kind of dark too but because there's citrus you don't have to add anything on them if you were to do like apple slices or bananas you might want to split them with some lemon juice to keep their color but these you know I think they're beautiful just as is so um now that they're completely dry you can stick them in a mason jar and put them like that or if you're going to eat them sooner than that you can just stick them in a ziploc bag and enjoy them that way alright guys um have any questions on dehydrating leave it in the comments section I will be doing some more dehydrating videos over the next couple days or weeks or so so if there's anything that you'd like to see or have any questions about don't hesitate to ask I hope you enjoyed this video and we will see you soon", "E0NRK7PrrdM": "today I want to share with you how to make preserved lemons they're basically lacto-fermented lemons and I'll also show you how to do this with limes and mandarin oranges plus I'll share some ideas for herbs and spices that you can add to your preserved citrus to make it extra special hi sweet friends I'm Mary and welcome to Mary's nest where I teach traditional cooking skills for making nutrient-dense foods like bone broth ferments sourdough and more so if you enjoy learning about those things consider subscribing to my channel and don't forget to click on the little notification bell below that'll let you know every time I upload a new video when citrus is in season it's a great time to get a lot of it at a reasonable price and one of the things that you can do with it is to preserve it and basically you're preserving it in salt and you're creating a lacto-fermented citrus and it can be used in all sorts of recipes both savory and sweet commonly you often hear preserved lemons being used in Moroccan dishes that are made in a Tanjung I think that sounds pretty health stuff not sure but it can be used in a lot of other things when roasting chicken or making stovetop chicken dishes it's wonderful with the the mandarin oranges are wonderful with lamb and beef dishes the limes are wonderful with fish dishes there's so much that you can do and you can use both the fruit the pulp inside as well as the peel therefore its prized for the peel but the pulp can be used too so nothing goes to waste and all you need to do is just pick the citrus of your choice and get some salt and you're going to want to use a kosher salt or a fine ground sea salt you want to stay away from your typical traditional table salt because that often has agents in it like anti-caking agents and sometimes chemicals and so on and so forth that can interfere with the preserving or the lacto-fermented process but kosher salt or sea salt is fine all you're gonna need is a jar this is just a clean glass jar this is a canning jar quart size jar but you can use any size you want just adjusted a quart by how many oranges or lemons or limes that you can fit into your jar and as to your fruit if you can get organic that's great but if not don't worry if you can't find organic what I like to do is wash my citrus very well with a mixture of baking soda and vinegar it'll become kind of frothy you can give everything a good scrub and a good rinse and hopefully that helps remove some of the pesticides so once your fruit is all washed and dried all you want to do is remove the little ends just like that just each end and then all you want to do is take your knife and slice partially down through the lemon or whatever other citrus you're using you just don't want to separate it you want to go basically three-quarters of the way down and then you just want to turn your lemon and then again go three-quarters of the way down and that's basically it just one slice down only about 3/4 of the way down and then another slice down just turn it a quarter turn and then slice it again and I'll overlay a video so you can see exactly what I'm doing and then once you have gotten those two slices in you'll be able to separate it almost like in two little petals of a flower if you want you can remove the seeds but it's not required you can remove them after the fact when you go to use them in a recipe the next thing you want to do is just get a bowl this way this just helps so that the salt we're going to put on stays somewhat corralled and you can reuse it what you want to do is get your salt and then just start to sprinkle some right in the middle of the lemon just like that not take a close-up picture so you can see exactly what that looks like with the salt going into the middle of the lemon next you want to get your jar and you just want to spoon in a bit of salt so that you have a base of salt on the bottom not much couple of teaspoonfuls and again depending on what size your George are using you may need more or less next you can go ahead I'm just looking down here at my herbs and spices which I'll talk to you about next you can just go ahead and put your lemon right down into the jar and then just continue to repeat this process which will do stuffing this entire jar just with lemons but what I like to do and that's fine you can do that and it's wonderful but what I like to do is I like to add some herbs and or herbs and spices to the lemons that I preserve and with lemons I really find that I like to add a bay leaf or two and I'll just put it down on the bottom and some thyme those are just two herbs that work so wonderfully with lemon as an alternative though if you think you might use some of these preserved lemons in a more sweet based dish some nice things to add are cinnamon sticks this is wonderful or allspice berries and I'll take a picture and overlay you can see everything I have here work some cloves and if you like a little bit of a licorice flavor you can use the star anis and we'll use some of these with the mandarin oranges I really like using the sweet spices with with them that works beautifully but it also works very well with lemon then I'm gonna take some time this works wonderful with these preserved lemons and I'm just gonna put that down on the bottom and you don't need a lot then I'm gonna go ahead and put my first lemon down into there perfect now we'll go through this and work on the rest of the lemons getting in as many as we can and don't be afraid to really mash these down really tight you want these lemons to be in really tight so just keep pushing them down as much as you can with your hand perfect now will you add another one and periodically as you're pushing the lemons down into the jar you can take some additional salt and just sprinkle it all down into the jar into any of the crevices and then when you think you've got a lot in there go ahead and add in any extra salt from your bowl that you know over pull you that pour it over the when you're pouring them over the lemons didn't quite stay inside the lemons and you could just jiggle that around a little and then what we're going to do is write either with clean hands or if you have a clean grout pounder like this we're going to try to push these lemons down even harder and we're gonna get them to release their juices in this process because eventually we want them to be all covered with the juice well as we keep compressing it you'll see that more and more juice is being released and what we'll do now is we'll add another lemon because I think we can fit more in there so you want to just keep pressing this down and pressing this down fitting in as many lemons as you can and helping them to release as much juice as possible now once you're all done with that go ahead and give another sprinkling of salt right on the top now you eventually want all of your lemons to be under the salted lemon juice however resist the urge to add extra lemon juice if after you're pressing these down not everything is covered with lemon juice don't worry what you want to do is we're gonna go ahead and put the lid on and just watch it over the next couple of days and you will see that the lemons will continue to release juice and over its my icemaker and over the next couple of days chances are your whole jar will be filled with lemon juice and all of your lemons will be covered by the lemon juice and you can even when you open it you can even take your clean kraut pounder and push it down to help them release more lemon juice you can use clean hands to help them release more lemon juice but only if maybe by the fifth day they haven't released enough lemon juice you can add in some fresh lemon juice but give them a chance to release as much juice as they can on their own because you'll be surprised how within a few days you're going to see this slowly fill with liquid naturally now once you're sufficiently happy with the number of lemons that you have in your jar and you feel they're really pounded in and pounded in tight then you can get ready to put your lid on now when I make preserved lemons I do like to leave a little headspace some people like to bring it right up to the top and then when they put their lid on their lid is actually even weighting it down farther however I do find that lemons do continue to release liquid and you can wind up with some bubbling over if it's filled too tightly but if you're concerned that they're not everything is submerged under the liquid you can always add one of those pickling weights those little round glass pickling weights or a little 4 ounce jelly jar a little 4 ounce counting jelly jar and push that in but you really don't need to worry too much about it because there is so much salt in preserved lemons the chances of mold or bad bacteria taking over is highly unlikely this is a very unhospitable environment for for bad bacteria and from mold so what I like to do is just go ahead leave it as is and just put my canning lid on and my canning ring you can use whatever lid your your jar came with for canning jars you can also use the white storage lids whatever you're comfortable with using and whatever command is keep an eye on it as I said if your lemons are not completely submerged under the liquid keep an eye that the lemons are continuing to read release liquid and if by the fifth day there still isn't enough liquid then you can go ahead and add the extra lemon juice it's not so much a matter of keeping them submerged to prevent spoilage because I said there's just so much salt in here but it's keeping them submerged so that the preservation process takes place so that the rinds really soften and change in in taste and what happens is the lemon rind and the lemon flesh begin to absorb the salty brine and it creates a wonderful flavor in the rind and in the flesh and you know with any ferment you just want to keep an eye on it if you feel that maybe there is some fizzing taking place or you're noticing some changes in your jar you know in terms of liquid in terms of color so on and so forth always you can always feel free to just as we say burping you can open it if you're if you're using a canning ring you can just open it like that if you're using a storage lid or any other drawer with a regular lid you can just really some of the pressure if you feel that it's building up inside something that I do recommend is when doing fermented lemons as I've shared with you with some other ferments putting it in a jar in a jar putting it in a bowl is very helpful in the event that you get a little bubble over this can save you a lot when it comes to having to clean up a mess this way if you do get any bubble over its just contained right here in your bowl and it's very easy cleanup now what you want to do is find a warm place in your kitchen and when I say warm place I'm talking about room temperature so somewhere you know in that 70 to 80 degree range just a room temperature place out of direct sunlight and put this aside for 30 days and in 30 days it's going to be lovely and we'll move on and do and I'll show you some ideas that I like to use with the other citrus but in 30 days we'll come back and we'll go through all of these citrus that we've preserved and we'll talk about how to use them in various recipes now limes are great just don't totally on their own just preserved as limes plain no herbs no spices nothing they're terrific however since limes are often used in Mexican cooking it can be fun to add in some spicy chilies now you can break one of these open and add it in like that or you can just keep them whole which is what I'm going to do so there's not too overpowering and we just go through the same process we just cut three quarters of the way through we cut the tips off and we will cut each lime three quarters of the way through fill it with salt push it down into the jar and continue just as we did with the lemons now I just want to mention about these little tips of the lemons and the limes and eventually of the mandarin oranges that I'll trim off don't throw any of this out add this in with your bag of scraps your bag of vegetable scraps that you save for making bone broth because these can help acidulated water and as I've shared if you've seen some of my bone broth videos I like to acidulated water because that helps pull the collagen out of the bones out of the cartilage so on and so forth to help improve the chances of developing a really nice gelatinous bone broth because the more collagen that you can pull out of your bones and out of the cartilage the more likely you're going to have a very gelatinous rich bone broth now we're done with our limes here and we'll get ready to work on the mandarins and I'll show you what spices I like to put in with them now with the mandarin oranges I really like to put in two cinnamon sticks and I'll just put those down in the bottom I like to put in some allspice berries there's little allspice berries and they just put those down in the bottom of the jar maybe a few more and then I also like to add a good helping of cloves this is wonderful and then when you make some desserts where you want to use orange peel this is wonderful what you'll do is you'll remove your mandarin oranges and you'll rinse them really well to get off as much salt as you can and the rind is going to be very tender and you can chop that up really fine add that to different desserts you can add it to muffins you can add it to scones you can sprinkle it in on top of a cake you can mix it in with icing and ice a cake with it it becomes so nice almost like those candied fruits that you see that are sold at Christmastime there it's delightful and it'll have such a wonderful flavor and we're just going to go ahead and do the same thing that we did with the lemons and limes I'm going to take off a little bit of the tip and a little bit of the tail so to speak and then we're just gonna cut it 3/4 of the way down just don't pin it up like a little floral a little flower petal and then add your salt in and then I'm gonna go ahead and put this in I'm actually gonna add a little salt I always like to add a little salt to the bottom of the jar just to get things going and then I'm gonna go ahead and put my mandarin right down in there and the one thing that I love very things I love about preserved citrus but working with mandarins the aroma is so wonderful as is the flavor that's why I like to use the mandarins as opposed to any of the other oranges in the orange family these are just delightful and again we're just gonna you know just use a little force just get it in as get the citrus in as tight as you can and then just continue with the process well we've got all three done the lemons the limes and the mandarins now we're going to put these in as I said for the lemons all three the rules are the same we're gonna put them in a warm place in the kitchen preferably but out of direct sunlight and just keep an eye on them the first five days if they've not completely filled with juice if the citrus hasn't completely released its juices to fill the jar then you can add a little extra lime juice or a little extra lemon juice or a little extra mandarin orange juice but just keep an eye on them put them in bowls find a nice cozy undisturbed place out of direct sunlight and we'll check them in 30 days well it's been 30 days that these have been preserving or fermenting and they look wonderful so let's uncap them and see how they're doing ah oh my gosh I wish you could smell it those lemons are glorious and then over here we've got the limes it's Oh also wonderful and now these mandarin oranges which are my favorite if you preserve mandarin oranges you will love them oh my gosh it's intoxicating it smells so good and with the cinnamon stick and the cloves that we added this is perfect for using in baking well that's leads us to the point of now how do we use these now the first thing that you want to do is just start to take out your preserved lemons depending on how many that you want to use and I'll just get two out and then I'll show you what we're do we're gonna take these over to the sink and we're gonna give them a really good rinse to get off as much salt as we can now once you give them a good rinse and I like to rinse them holding them like this so they're the the skin it's like flesh side down so that I'm not rinsing the water into the flesh like that but rinsing them holding them this way so the skin is there water is hitting all of the skin and the reason I like to do that is it helps preserve some of the lemon flavor of the pulp but yet helps release a lot of the salt off of the skins and I'll take a little video and I'll overlay it so you can see exactly what I'm talking about now the lemons are very soft and pliable after 30 days of being preserved in the salt and they pull apart very easily now generally you'll see that many people will just remove the pulp and use just the skin now you know me I don't like to waste anything so I don't throw pulp out but what I'll do is say I'm roasting a whole chicken and I want to stuff the cavity with lemons I'll just use preserved lemons I'll give them a rinse and I'll put them in hold just like this with the pulp and all and if I'm doing something where I want to use just the zest then I will remove the pulp but I'll save it and I'll grind it up roll it up you know make it into much more of a puree and you can use a little bit and smoothies you can use some in baking you can use some in the water when you make rice or grains there's a lot of things that you can do with the pulp so I personally don't like to discard it but what we're going to do now so I can show you how to prepare the skins or and and create basically lemon zest is we're gonna remove the pulp and then we'll start slicing it up so it's very soft it comes off very easy I'm just using my knife here to move it down once you loosen it a little you can even just pull it off with your hands and it'll come off very easily like this I'll take a close-up picture so that you can see so just continue to pull that off as you'll see it comes off very easily now you have this beautiful piece of preserved lemon rind and at this point you can basically do whatever you want I've just got a little knife here and I'm just cutting some very fine little strips like this or you can chop this even smaller depending what you want to use this in you could use the zest add it to a pie add it to any baked good that you're making you know add it to a Crane's add it to salad salad dressings there's so much that you can do with this and this method of preserving them with salt really brings out Neal Yule when you if you've never done this before and you do this for the first time I think you're going to be so surprised at the aroma of how the preserving method with the salt really releases the the lemon oil the smell is incredible and what's nice about this process is it becomes very very soft it's very different than if you were just zesting a lemon or you and you know with a grater and using zest like that or even slicing some zest this is very tender and actually very flavorful hmm oh it's delicious not salty at all and just a beautiful lemon flavor it's the same process working with the limes exactly like the lemons you can stuff a whole chicken or a turkey whatever the case may be with the lime with the pulp and and the rind put the whole thing into the cavity or if you want remove the the pulp and slice up the rind and make a nice lime zest and then there are these mandarins which are there they're just oh my gosh they smell so good these I think would definitely be wonderful for stuffing a Thanksgiving turkey because citrus being in season at that time of year and then with the little bit of a the cinnamon and clove aroma that has permeated them it's just a lightful and then also after giving these are good rents this pulp can be made into a puree be wonderful adding into cakes or pies especially those that are made when citrus is in season and especially those type baked goods that enjoy the flavor of the clothes and the cinnamon now you know that I like to add you know some spices you can just preserve the mandarins as is you don't have to add cloves and cinnamon or allspice berries whatever you want you can just preserve them plain with the salt but I think adding those spices really adds something very special and makes them very very seasonal since those are those spices are common at the same time that citrus is in season and then as I showed you with the lemon it's the same thing the pulp will come out very easy like that and then you have this beautiful skin that you can the rhyme that you can just zest slice up into little strips or chop it up whatever the case may be and this would be wonderful added to couscous that you make where you've added some dried fruits like apricots and currants and then and some nuts maybe and then add in some of the zest of this preserved mandarin orange it will be scrumptious now at this point you can leave these on your counter if you want and chances are you're going to use them up pretty quickly or you can refrigerate them I like to refrigerate them at this point just put some storage lids on you know the white storage lids that come that you can buy that are made for canning jars and I find I like keeping them in the refrigerator in the refrigerator after 30 days of preserving I find that the texture and the flavor everything just for me I find stays a little better by refrigerating them but you can certainly leave them on the counter and they'll continue to ferment and when you've used up all of your preserves citrus don't discard the brine you can use this brine to start this process all over again preserving lemons limes and citrus whatever the case may be this brine is going to be wonderful to help jumpstart the process or if you decide that at the particular time you don't need anymore preserve citrus or it's out of season don't discard the brine use it just put it to keep it in your refrigerator and when you need a salty lemon flavor or a salty lime flavor or salty orange flavor you can use this brine so again like if you're making your grains or rice or whatever the case may be add a tablespoon of this to soups it will be wonderful well I hope you'll give preserved citrus a try and if you'd like to learn more about traditional nutrient-dense cooking be sure to subscribe to my channel and then click on this

from self-sufficient me\nand welcome back to another how to basic fruit and veg growing tips in just two\nminutes video today I'm going to answer the question why do fruit trees drop\ntheir fruit and what can we do about it let's get into it there can be many\ndifferent reasons why this happens but in my opinion the four main reasons why\na fruit tree sheds its fruit are number one lack of water is probably the\nmain reason why a fruit tree will start dropping its fruit you can imagine that\nsay citrus behind me an imperial mandarine if it's growing well and it's\nwanting to produce a lot of fruit and then it suddenly feels that it's not\ngetting enough water it's going to drop those fruit or as many as it thinks it\nshould so that a the tree can survive and be the remaining fruit have a chance\nto develop properly so what you can do is you can give the tree extra water\nespecially if it's really dry because dry weather obviously can stress trees\nout and if they feel stressed they may drop the fruit number two not enough\nnutrients if a fruit tree hasn't got enough food for itself it's not going to\nbe able to produce much food so make sure that your fruit tree is getting\nappropriate nutrients as in fertilizer and also trace elements number three\npest and disease if a bug or disease gets hold of the fruit the fruit tree is\ngoing to discard it if the fruit starts to rot because it's been stung by a bug\nwell then the tree is going to drop it because it's not going to try to develop\nsomething that's not going to grow to full size anyway and be able to\nreproduce so what you need to do is rid the tree of those pests and I like doing\nit the organic way just go over the tree and wherever you find them knock them\noff stamp on them put them in soapy water or drown them or whatever you want\nto do and the last point number four is totally natural you can see that this\ntree is absolutely chock-a-block with fruit it knows it's got too much and I\ndon't mind that at all I know we're still going to get\nplenty and a bountiful harvest anyway so don't be too deterred if a tree has\ndropped some of its fruit particularly if it has a lot of fruits to left on the\ntree it's probably totally a natural thing to do well I hope this helps let\nme know down in the comments section if it does or if you've got any tips or\nother comments you'd like to make about why fruit trees drop fruit whack them\ndown there too don't forget to subscribe share the video around and give it a big\nthumbs up thanks for watching bye for now", "9dCaso71G8M": "okay guys welcome back to my channel simulations arrangements today we are going to be making lemon candy or candied lemon huh however you want to put it so the ingredients that you would need is lemons how many ever you would like depending on the quantity of your guests I am doing two lemons because I am only serving 24 people unite to cut your lemon your spatula a bacon tray if you have wax paper use wax paper I totally forgot to get mine from the grocery store today so I'm using alumina for you.your one cup of your one cup measuring cup this will be for the process to stop cooking the lemons once we take them out of the hot water I may use a little bit of pure lemon extract a little bit of karo syrup and your powdered sugar which they call it confectioners sugar so we're just going to start with cutting our lemons and let's get started okay so now that we have our two lemons here what you will want to do is just chop off the butt of the lemon and I think this is the copper knife I just love the color copper so but if you would like to know where I got these from I can leave it in the link below just leave me a comment or a thumbs up and I would definitely get that to you so I'm just going to be cutting my lemon you don't want to cut them too big nor too small just right in the middle so I'm gonna cut mine about this thick you okay so now that I have my lemon slice I am just going to take the seeds out of the lemon it's no purpose for those to be in there okay so now I'm just going to take my lemons and I'm going to place them in my pot of hot water and the reason why I'm doing this is because lemon has a lot of acid in it and we just want to die down some of the acid that's in the lemon we're not gonna leave them in here too long but we just want to place them in here so that acid can disappear just a little bit so I'll leave them in here for a good minute or two and then we'll take them out and we'll place them in our ice bucket right over here okay so now that it's been two minutes I'm going to take my linens out and I am just going to stop the cooking process and I'm going to place them in a bucket of a bowl of cold water you now here is the hot water with the money we do not want to throw this away we're going to keep this water so that when we add the water to our saucepan with a confectioners sugar and our lemon extract and Caro syrup we don't have to use new water this water already has some of the lemon zest and everything in it so we're just going to use this water okay so now that our lens are cooled down I am going to take one cup from the boiling hot water and I'm just going to place it in my saucepan then I will be taking three cups of powdered sugar and placing that into my saucepan and you want to turn your heat on medium-high heat it just start on the round so you see it dissolve you and now we're going to add just a little bit of Cairo zero not sure what's the measure mix I just put a little bit in there and just keep and you just want that to cook until the sauce thickens up and once he thickens up we will come back so right now I'm just gonna add a little bit of lemon lemon extract see if they can focus there we go lemon extract just a little bit not too too much you don't want it to be too lemony so I'm just going to be using a little bit from the top and I'm just going to pour that in there oh that smells so great all right that smells great and now that a sauce that starting to come to a boil you just want to place your lemons into your saucepan and this is what it would look like once it comes to a boil your lemons will start to look transparent and the longer they cook the sauce will thicken up and it will become a syrup and your lemons will be no longer sour or tart they will be sweet delicious and delightful okay so now I'm going to take my lemon and I'm just going to place them on my baking sheet and let them cool and the syrup from the baby from this woman and the powdered sugar and everything I'm just gonna keep that and I'm gonna save that for my cupcakes so that I can drink them drizzle the syrup on top of my frosting and then I'm going to place my lemon inside of my frosting on top but this taste is so amazing I cannot believe I just made these not doubting myself but since these are isn't light I think you girl you know you had girls playing stop playing can keep that with yourself you know so when I think of ideas I'd be ready to put them on YouTube because I'd be like but now that you know I'm a cyst like this is an A+ okay like I wish you guys can taste this because this is great so I'm just going to place these on here I'm gonna put them in the refrigerator let them cool down and then I will put them on top of my cupcakes and if you would like to see how I make my lemon cupcakes please leave me a thumbs up on this video and now I am just going to store all of this great yummy syrup look at this syrup great yummy syrup into a bow and thank you guys for

Citrus trees are very beautiful, and they produce tasty fruit like these mandarins. However there's not many places in the\nUnited States where you can grow citrus outdoors, but that's ok. If you're in zone 7 or lower I'm going to show you how you can grow them indoors in containers! The easiest citrus to grow indoors is the meyer lemon, however also easy to grow indoors are the lisbon lemon, the washington navel orange, and the barris lime. Citrus need 8 to 12 hours of\nlight per day to produce fruit. You can grow them as a foliage plant with about 5 hours of light per day, but if you want fruit you may want to supplement\nthe light with either full spectrum florescent lighting, or a professional\ngrow light. Either way you need a southern or\nsouthwestern exposure. Before repotting your tree, place it in your desired location for a couple of weeks to make sure it's happy. If it is, pot it up, if not, find another location. Today we're gonna be potting up this meyer lemon. Meyer lemons are the sweetest of all lemons, and are actually a cross between a mandarin and a lemon. For a 2 to 3 year old tree, choose a pot about five gallons and about 12 to 15\ninches tall with good drainage. Citrus likes light soil. I've got some peet moss moistened. I'm going to add potting soil, and then perlite. A third, a third and a third. Avoid potting soil with wetting agents\nbecause that will keep the soil too moist. Slide the tree from its container, examine the roots carefully, trim off any that may be dry, and fluff them up if they're matted or\nencircled. So plant the tree with the crown just above the soil line and the fibrous roots just below. Now we just want to water the citrus\nplant. I like to add some Thrive Alive B-1 to the water which will help encourage root growth. As you water, watch for settling. Make sure there's no air pockets. If so you can just pull up on the\ntree a little bit. Citrus are heavy feeders. Be sure and\nfertilize with a citrus fertilizer like this E.B. Stone Citrus and Fruit Tree Food or the PhytaGrow by California Organic Fertilizers. Be sure and read the\nlabel and follow the directions carefully. Citrus like high humidity. If you're going to put your plant inside the house, make sure you have a humidifier or a tray with rocks that you can put water in and you can put the plant on. Make sure the pot never sits in water, however, and spray down the foliage once in a while. That will help too. If you live in a climate where you have warm summers and cold winters, you can grow your citrus outside in the\nsummer and bring it inside in the winter, or overwinter it in a greenhouse. When making the switch from indoors to\noutdoors or vice versa, put the plant in the shade for a couple of weeks. The best time to make the switch is when the temperatures are about the same inside and outside. Give the tree a quarter of a turn every week to make sure that the tree gets even light all around. Repot your citrus every couple of years\nand do some root pruning at that time to make sure that the plant doesn't get root bound. Your citrus needs deep infrequent\nwatering. They like to be moist, but not soggy. A moisture meter is the best way to tell when your plant is going to need water. You want to water when the top two\ninches of soil are dry. You can prune your citrus anytime of year to control it's shape or size. So you can grow citrus no matter where you live! So grow citrus and Grow Organic for Life!", "mJC8bF9gAr4": "good morning again and welcome back to my kitchen today I'm going to do something a little bit different I'm going to prepare some lemons and limes to put on my dehydrator yes I did have a freeze dryer but for the citrus I prefer to do it on the dehydrator because I like to put it in my tea and when I put the when you freeze dried it snaps like a piece of styrofoam and the dehydrated ones are a little firmer so I don't have it break it into a million pieces in my team so I picked up a few limes and lemons and I'm going to chop them on my Mimico easy chopper and I'm using the quarter inch chopping blade I'm gonna bring y'all up and show you that I'll finish chopping them or slicing them and I'll get them on the trays and then I'm on putting me in at 135 degrees it'll probably take about 8 hours depending on the humidity and I'll show you what they look like when they're finished tell you again this is one of the best things my honey ever bought me I love this chopper it makes easy work no matter what would take a while and besides that I perfectly even slices and I like that they are all pretty well dry the same amount now I have a quarter inch the little squares chopper for this it also have a beam blade and I have 1/2 inch slice and chop but I love the quarter inch let me move it and I'll show you see I've got perfect little slices so I can not get them on the trace so let me get them tray over here and we'll get some on it and I have the excalibur nine trade fact I'm blessed I have three of them and the reason is they could have ownself real cheap and I bought my first one well then they put him on sale even cheaper this is a before I ever had a freeze dryer and I bought me a second one well I always watch on Craigslist for bargains and there was a lady that was advertising an entree excalibur for $35 well usually if something you hear something like that is she's too good to be true but I called her and she lived quite a it was about a mile over an hour's drive away but she was moving from Texas to California and she said she just didn't have room to take it with her and so my daughter rode down there with me as quickly as I could get there and bought that other one so I have three and there's been plenty of times that I've had them all going at one time I'm probably only gonna have a couple of trays this time but that's fine I just wanted to show y'all how I do this because I do love living in line and my team and I was going to give me some more because I'm getting low so if y'all have a dehydrator and also do oranges and I made pull an orange out here in a minute and so I said and uh cuz I just like it all in my tea not every day but some days I'm not going I don't want use these little bitty pieces well I can grind them up though let me put them back in there you can ground that up and make lime powder out of it or citrus powder to season with okay I've got room between each one pretty well where they'll dry so I'm going to go get these out there on the dehydrator and as soon as they get done of course I'll show y'all what they look like okay y'all I'm out here in the Sun Room where I have my dehydrators and see I've got one two three but I'm going to use this one I've already got them we have two trays so I took out the extra trays so that I'll have better air flow maybe and I'm going to set it at 135 and I'll check them but I think it's going to take about eight hours and I won't get them Georgia I always put him in just a jar and vacuum sealing until I'm ready to use them and then I put him in a jar like this one right here that has the lid that snaps it and it keeps them crisp and good so I keep one of these on the counter with my dehydrated citrus in it and when we wanted in our water or tea I have it ready to use I got these at t.j.maxx of course my favorite better place so I'll be back with some dehydrated lemons and lime slices to show y'all okay y'all here we are back again and I've got dehydrated fruit slices these are the limes some of them they did get a little dark I left them a little bit long but this isn't the orange that I went and picked up and I've got lemon in here they still do just as well in your tea even if they drive a little drier they rehydrate and if you look to eat it you pick it up and eat it I don't do that I usually choke it when I finish that tea but anyway there they are oh hey y'all I hope you enjoyed the little instructional video I'm using your dehydrator for citrus it makes your water taste good it's hard for me to just drink plain water but if I put some lemon or lime meaning I can drink it a little better and I do love orange in my tea so if you haven't tried putting orange in your in your tea dehydrate you some oranges and see what you think about it I love it so until tomorrow I guess I'll say bye if you haven't subscribed please subscribe to my channel and keep watching because I got some more good just instructional things like this but some yummy recipes coming up now y'all behave yourself and could have good supper on the table maybe make some tea and you know to go along with it big ol glass iced tea could use some lemon or lime them in it and hope you're blessed and have a fun day enjoy your family and I'll see you tomorrow", "mghVDwfKY1M": "hey everybody thomas joseph here and it is that time of year it is citrus season and you might be left with the conundrum of how to shop citrus and what to do with your citrus once you have it at home so let's start here with grapefruit i love grapefruit and did you know that grapefruit gets its name because the fruit grows in grape like clusters we have of course the ruby red grapefruit which has that wonderful pink interior and of course the conventional grapefruit that has that yellow interior which we all know now everybody drinks orange juice in the morning but did you know there are lots of different varieties of oranges the most common is a navel orange and it gets its name from this button like end here kind of looks like your navel ripe this orange is really great just to peel and eat it has no seeds in it which are really great for juicing as well a member of its family is the Caracara orange it has this really intense pink interior they're sweeter than navel oranges less acidic so less sour you can juice them you can eat them right like this or put them into salads another popular orange is a Valencia orange and it's actually known as the summer orange because it's available from February to October really great orange to snack on as well one of my favorite oranges to buy and to use our blood oranges and these are available in late fall and in the winter they usually have a reddish exterior and the surface is kind of dimpled and the interior of a blood orange looks like blood it's really nice and red sometimes it's variegated like this pick them up and try them in the supermarket they're absolutely delicious so now lemons and limes we have the conventional lemons here but have you ever tried a Meyer lemon a Meyer lemon is actually a cross between a lemon and a mandarin orange and they have a sweeter flavor the flesh itself isn't as sour it almost has a piney flavor to it it's usually available towards the end of fall throughout winter and you can use it in any way that you would use lemons it just has a slightly different flavor but it's really delicious now limes limes that you see in the supermarket they're a member of the Persian lime family when you buy them they have a slight squeeze to them otherwise they're too hard and you're not going to get that much juice now key limes are very popular for the key lime pie right they're yellow in color there are lots of seeds and they're more sour than a conventional line so when you're buying citrus in the supermarket you want to make sure that you look for citrus that has a bright skin there are no blemishes and you want to be able to pick up fruit that is heavy for its size give your citrus a slight squeeze if it's too firm like this one I have here that means that it's thick-skinned and that means there's more pith about white stuff and less fruit so this one has a slightly thick skin here this thinner skinned lemon which I have here and you can squeeze the lemon and you know that there's a lot of fruit inside and the skin is not thick see how much thinner the skin is here so less pith more fruit more juice when you bring your citrus home store it in the refrigerator for up to two weeks now when juicing any sort of citrus fruit you want to make sure that you go through a few steps I have a line here and to ensure that you get the most juice out of your citrus you either squeeze it in your hand like this or you can actually roll it on your board applying a good amount of pressure and what you're doing is you're breaking up the pulp so that the juice easily comes out of it so I'm going to cut this guy in half I love to use these citrus presses put it in cut side down and give it a good squeeze whenever you're juicing citrus juice it right before you're going to use it otherwise the juice will actually get better especially with grapefruits and also limes now in place of rolling the lime or squeezing it in your hand you can also microwave a lime for about 10 seconds and that will help to break up the pulp warm it up and you will get more juice out of your fruit so there you go that's juicing citrus for another way to use citrus I'm going to show you how to suprem and whenever you're stuck Reming what you want to do is cut off the top and the bottom of the orange and then just how you would trim a pineapple or melon slice around the fruit removing the pith and the peel the pith is this white membrane that is very bitter now as you practice and as you do this you'll get better and better at it so this looks good and now to sue Prem what you're basically doing is you're taking out these segments of the fruit so start with one segment take a sharp knife cut down the side of the segment along the membrane and then you can do it one of two ways you can either pull the knife out and cut on the other side creating a perfect segment like this or start off the same way and then rotate the knife slightly and cut along the other side of the membrane so kind of coming up so that's two ways in which you can segment segments are great just as is you can eat them like this you can mix them into fruit salads you can put them into green salads they're really great you can garnish desserts and now you can see I'm doing this over Bowl so that I catch all of the juices that kind of drip out while I segment the fruit I'm just going to remove these to a plate and do not throw this part away just yet what you can do is give it a good squeeze and you will get out at least another tablespoon of juice this could be a really great addition to your vinaigrette if you're making a salad or of course you could just drink it like that now the last step in a citrus 101 is zesting because a lot of flavor comes from the skin of the citrus itself so today I'm going to use a Meyer lemon and a zester so what you're going to do is pull the zester towards you scraping off just the skin you want to avoid going too far into the fruit where you get the white pith because again that's bitter zest is really wonderful in so many things it amps up the flavor of any dish you could use it in batters like cakes and cupcakes and a quick trick is that you can take the zest and combine it or mix it together with sugar or salt and what this does is it infuses into the sugar or salt if you were going to use it and you can rim glass for a margarita that would be really wonderful you could sprinkle it on two cookies or scones so I encourage you to go out experiment with different types of citrus fruits you have and use some of these helpful tips and tricks enjoy guys", "3XadpB8Qlas": "hello gorgeous how about you me whole bucket of sugar and a big pot Oh g'day I'm mark from self-sufficient me and I was just checking out my my lemon tree for pests and stuff no seriously did you know that a Meyer lemon is a cross between an orange and a lemon but they taste more lemony they're pretty well lemon however they make the most fantastic marmalade or Jam that you could ever eat you think the lemons and jam now think again this is a family favorite it actually takes a couple of days to make because we make our own pectin as well from the seeds keep watching I think you're going to like this it's very easy to do you my lemons also happen to be one of the most easiest lemons to grow besides being a citrus which citrus are fairly Hardy anyway a Meyer lemon grows faster than any of the other lemons do well in my yard it does anyway and from what I've read and feedback I've got is they are a very fast growing lemon the fruit is quite large as you could imagine if it is a cross between an orange and a lemon you're going to get a fairly big lemon having said that my lemons this season are smaller than usual because we've come through a very dry summer and it hasn't been a lot of water around to look after one of these trees give it plenty of water it needs a good citrus fertilizer and also if you in clay soil or a soil that it's not quite adapt to good dose of trace elements you can get that at any good gardening center and that gives it the required magnesium zinc and all those pretty little minerals that a citrus needs to flourish and do well so you can see I've got quite a lot of fruit that's normal for a my lemon tree they're prolific bearers we can't possibly eat all our fruit on fish and chips so we obviously make our lemons into lots of different things we've made obviously my jam is my favorite but we also make lemon curd lemon butter we preserved lemons Moroccan style with salt it makes excellent Moroccan cooking overall this is a really excellent tree the Meyer lemon well that's at all all the Meyer lemons that I want to pick anyway I picked there's still quite a lot that's left on the tree that are just still ripening this is typical of a Meyer lemon tree where it seems to be in fruit all year well it is at our place it's it's an amazing lemon tree so not only is their fruit starting to ripen but there's also small fruit starting to form on the tree so we're not going to be out of lemons just because I raided this tree I probably should also say that we all had my kids here yesterday picking a whole bunch so they've also picked a a fair bag of them probably 20 or 30 and that's how you make my lemon jam or marmalade whatever you want to call it it's lemons process with a bit of sugar using own pectin made from the seeds it's pretty well natural and it's a lot better than most of the preserved stuff you can get at the supermarket so as you can see it's a pretty easy thing to do grow the tree make your own Jam give it away at Christmas or on a special occasion or just give it away I hope you enjoyed that I love making produce from my own food that I grow you never know what's going to come out of this channel so please subscribe I promise it won't be boring today we made marmalade tomorrow we might be looking at chickens or chasing go Ana's or in

translucent clay I use fimo with a dark pink mix just a bit I then proceeded to start forming a teardrop because I'm making the slice I'm just starting with one slice of the grapefruit you can use the technique for all citrus canes you just need to change and adjust the colors quite obviously I then put some white around the slice a very thin piece of clay this is going to be the white clay that is in between the slices and then I'm adding some extra clay around so I get a nice triangle I the idea is to have a path a perfect triangle so I can keep the rounded shape inside and still easily be able to reduce the whole cane and it's much easier to reduce a triangle than a teardrop especially with fimo I've read somewhere that some other brands are mafia but fimo is on the middle scale I would say it's not like the softest of all place but it's rather soft in any case I'm reducing it so that I can sweat that I can cut out five slices here you cannot really see it but I'm cutting out the ends which have been squished down and I are not really usable I'm cutting it in five and then I'm forming a half circle I'm just pushing everything together and then reducing again so I can cut this in two to make around just keep on reducing until it's long enough and then again cuts out the ends because you are not going to be able to use them I used to rule at this time I don't always do but I didn't want to mess up in front of the camera really that's the reason and I used to toothpick to make an indent in the middle to add some of the white clay because usually teachers would always have some more white in the middle so that's just it and then I add the list with some extra white clay and finally the zest with some yellow clay just be sure to cut it properly so there are no overlapping edges and then proceed to reduce it if there are any air bubbles cut them out and reduce until you have the desired size if you have never done any cane this might be a little magical for you and it's really something that is great with polymer clay and that it really propel out through that medium and to glass I mean you can do pot you can do that kind of canes with less I also made a whole grapefruit for that I just use a round piece of clay of yellow clay and I sandwiched it between two sand papers and I add some texture and then I added some green and again more texture and this is pastel pink pastel that I'm brushing on top of it to give it that nice blush that grapefruit usually has and I made a mold out of it this is really optional you don't have to do this but it's how you can maintain a round shape for the half grapefruit now I'm making the inside of it so I cut out a cylinder of the cane I'm cutting it too and putting it in the mold and using a needle tool I'm adding bit-by-bit the texture of the grapefruit don't forget at the end she puts a hole in the middle and just add a few bits dots here and there you don't have to make it in a mold you can also make it directly on the tile but if you do it's going to flatten a bit more the fruit slice not the fruit slice but the fruit half and I added some extra tail for extra fruit slices I use the left over of the red fruit flesh and I cut out quarter's and then I textured them with the needle tool you can also use a pin a needle or toothpick it's starting to rain you know I don't know if you can hear it if you do I really apologize I cannot wait to make that voiceover so sorry I also made a plate as you can see I used some cellophane to have rounded edges and round cutter and I'm just smoothing out the edges a bit with my finger baking it and making a mold out of it I then put in a thin piece of white clay and push it down with Bowl and the tools I cut off the excess clay and then smooth the inside a little bit more with the bowl and the tools I then baked inside the mold and after baking I just sand so the plates get smooth and clean and until I'm happy with it and finally I'm just adding all the fruit slices inside of the bowl I added some liquid clay for it first and then I'm adding bits by bits different fruit slices sorry as you can see I made orange but as I said when working on the Klaine it's the same technique and here you go I very very much hope you like this video even though the voiceover was maybe not so good I I did it six times I think it's driving me insane anyway I really hope you liked it if you liked it give it a thumbs up maybe subscribe I highly recommend you my last video the miniature popsicles as they were really enjoyed by many people and I very much hope to see you in my next video bye", "cexb-rDjIAM": "did I I'm mark from self-sufficient me and I'm back with another how to basic beginners gardening tips but not in two minutes I've done with that kaput finished nada zilch oh gone because I believe beginners gardening tips should just take as long as they take they're too important to put a time limit on it and to get me or pressurized and stressed out right so this is going to take as long as it takes let's get straight into it [Music] okay here we have a closed disaster well it still could be a disaster if I don't act quickly we've got a beautiful mandarine tree it's an imperial and it's laden with a ton of fruit ton I think I can feel a ton of mandarine video coming on anyway you can see this branch here is precariously bent Laden down with I don't know maybe 10 kilos or more and for this little branch if we don't do something about it its kind of snap and all this fruit will probably be ruined and well I just don't want the branch to break while this fruit is developing so what are we going to do about it well it's simple I've got this really cool and easy gardening hack that's going to prevent this branch from breaking and save all of this fruit the hack is called the branch brace I've just made that up but it sounds good a brace to relieve the pressure of this branch and save it from breaking under its own weight where am I gonna get this brace from well it's easy let's just go make one up at the front of the veggie garden here we've got some prunings we've been doing quite a bit of work and I've laid them all out in front of the veggie garden for another project because we're going to use all that but I'm sure in that big pile of prunings I can find a brace that I can make up to help that tree No too short I need something with a long stem on it and a Y brace what have we got here that might kind of work got a nice long stem or Y yeah that'll be strong enough let's cut this to size [Applause] [Applause] obviously that's going to be way too high but I'll give it a measure Wimmer over there now you want to position this thing not on the bend but where the majority of the weight is falling so that it can support this weighted part of it so it's mainly towards the end pick it up until it straightens out a bit it's about there so if I'm gonna get this down I want to take about roughly a foot or so off by the eyeball method if you wanted to measure it out you could it's got a bit of leeway here as this fruit ripens it's only gonna get heavier and then it will eventually snap you can just tell all right let's see how that goes slide this under get a good bite try not to damage anything just pick it all between no it go pick him up yeah now let's reposition that it's just not quite right that's better that is much better there we go that's taking the pressure off that branch perfectly and that's just going to stay in place like that because of the pressure of the weight of this branch onto this stand here it's going to keep it in position but if you really wanted to you could dig a little hole underneath and push that post in a little bit and that way you definitely won't get any movement but that's not going to move anyway and I'm sure I'll be checking every night again in a big windstorm or anything like that if that happens to come just have to just check to make sure it hasn't fallen but even in a big wind I'm pretty confident that's gonna stay like that so there you go there's a really easy basic gardening hack on how to stop your light and fruit tree from

haven't uploaded a video for a while I've been busy writing a book but I'm back now just in time for Christmas and I'm going to show you how to make these some preserved lemons which is a really quick and simple recipe and I think will make a really nice gift for your friends and family or even for yourself I love preserved lemons because they lend a real deep citrusy edge to lots of dishes I mean it's traditionally used in North African cuisine but I like to use it for cooking off seafood pasta sauces stuffings for chickens and things like that we're going to start things off with our sea salt so that's just going into a big mixing bowl along with the castor sugar and some thyme so sprig or two of time just pick the leaves pop them in in here and then give this all the mix together really important to first of all sterilize your jar so the easiest way to do this is to put it through the dishwasher on a really hot setting or you can microwave it for a few minutes and that does the same thing just to make sure it's super clean and there's no bugs in there that are going to ruin your preserved lemons and I've got some really nice organic unwaxed lemons here which you have to use really good quality lemons because all this is is lemons salt a bit of sugar and some thyme so splash out on a nice lemon or two and then a really sharp knife and you're just going to start by slicing your lemon don't shut your fingers off okay that should do and then obviously it's going to depend how big your jar is as to how much lemon you need but maybe do a few and then get a few jars ready and then you can make a batch all in one go I find that to be the best way to do it so take your lemon slice dip it in your sugar and salt mixture maybe just scatter a little bit of the mixture into the bottom of the jar to start things off and then place your lemon slice into the bottom of the jar and just follow suit with the other slices and just push them down slightly once they're in to make room and you just want to you want to fit as much in as you can take any pips out that you can and there we go and it really is that simple then I'm just going to top it with a little bit of olive oil extra virgin just to seal in and then just put the lid on and then I would just give the whole thing a bit of a wash under the sink but that's it that's it's how simple it is and it looks really pretty it looks like you've got two loads of effort and this is going to keep on giving to people for the next few weeks from when they open the jar because you just need a slice at a time to play the things with so all in all a rather nice Christmas gift I think one final thing to mention don't open these for a week because you want them to mature and take on that deep flavor and for the salt to to work on the on the lemon skin to get it really deep and and savory so yeah I hope you liked this video if you have please subscribe to the channel and leave us a comment you", "u3ovC7cDMBk": "Hey Guys! Today I wanted to show you how to make cute lemon soap. It is great as a gift and for any other soap making project. It's easy and fun to make. Start off by melting some clear glycerin soap Once it's completely melted add a tiny bit yellow soap colorant. And to make it smell like a lemon I used a lemon, I used lemon soap scent but you can use an essential oil as well. Mix everything very well and then pour it into a small round mold. Spray some rubbing alcohol on top to remove bubbles and then wait for the soap to harden completely. Now you can remove the soap from the mold I repeated the same with a green and orange color, to create orange and lime soap. now with a knife cut the soap into small section like  you would cut a pie. The more section you create the more realistic it will look in the end. I created about 10 to 12 sections. Once you are done with that, take a toothpick and score the outer surface of the soap. This way the next layer of soap will stick a little better to the sections. And if you want to make it even more realistic and you're not lazy for that... You can also cut off a small piece on each outer corner. This way the shape looks a bit more realistic in the end. Now place the soap into a bigger round mold... and arrange the sections so that you have tiny gaps between them. But be sure that the gaps are wide enough that the next layer of soap can run through them. Spray some rubbing alcohol on top, so every side is covered with it... and then pour white glycerin soap to the side. You want the soap to cover the sides and the small gaps between each section. If they start to move around a  bit you can use a toothpick and move the back a little. And now let the soap completely harden again. If your mold was a bit too big, you can use around cookie cutter, and make the wide layer slightly smaller. Now with a toothpick score the outside of the soap as well and spray some rubbing alcohol on top. Then place the soap into a round mold that is slightly bigger than the soap it self, and pour in lemon scented yellow glycerin on top, also spray rubbing alcohol again. And let the soap completely harden. This is how it looks once you remove it from the mold. But if you want you can carefully slice the soap with a knife. and you get cute lemon slices. But you can also create limes and oranges the same way you create the lemon. Just with the right color. I hope you liked this idea and found it helpful.

in the state lindy savelle is one of those producers that saw the crops potential four years ago and started a citrus grove called joe nina farm in thomas county when i retired from my previous career my husband and i knew we'd be moving back to these two small farms that we have in south georgia and we wanted to do something with them we wanted to kind of bring them back to life they'd they'd been sitting here idle for several years so we researched we went to different conferences everything from you know blueberries olives strawberries pecans and we just kind of landed on citrus and felt like that was a good fit for our small farm and what we wanted to do with it we wanted to bring it back to life our farms and use the commodity we were growing to to do a give back for our state one thing they found out though is that growing citrus is not a walk in the park in fact it's a lot of work one acre of citrus is like 100 acres of a row crop it's a lot of work it's a lot of manual work citrus you have to harvest by hand in the initial years when the trees are small there's a lot of hands-on maintenance to them as well and of course you have to freeze protect citrus here in georgia because we do have freezing temperatures occasionally so you've you've got to be prepared to do some of that hands-on work that you might not do with other traditional row crops and just like every other commodity growing citrus doesn't come without some challenges some of the challenges right away are having access to good quality trees but georgia's has about five nurseries now that are producing trees in the states for our growers so that's the first thing and then of course you know 70 percent of florida's markets been been devastated by citrus greening so we are very hopeful that in georgia in our commercial groves that we don't get citrus greening and if we do that there'll be a cure or at least something we can do to prevent the devastation that florida and other states have experienced just like most fruit producing trees it can take a few years to produce a good quality crop the sevilles have found that out this year with their crop being more than double what it was last year so one of the things that we've seen is a huge change in our trees and in our fruit between years three and years four so last year we said well you know the trees look look healthy enough we can perhaps go to production and we did produce about 40 pounds of fruit per tree this year oh boy i mean we've we've gotten 100 plus pounds of fruit per tree most of it is really good and people told us you know take to that about that fourth year for trees and fruit to be ready for production in satsumas and that's been proven to us this year reporting in thomas county for the farm monitor i'm john holcomb", "8KP8pPcg4XA": "[Music] hello and welcome to fresh and fruity this is a program where we enlighten you more about food production how to become a successful farmer and also how to make business value from your food business now on today's episode we're in machacas County in an area called peony and here we are visiting a senior farmer now this farmer grows the tangerines the oranges and also the mango fruits now join us as he tells you Jonny in this of fruity business I'll be your host throughout the show margarett weary walk stand alone hello when apprentice a low bar grill Asante sana opposed to well thank you my boy I think we're so happy to be here and from our arrival we see you a very nice fruit tree now start by telling our audience who you are where your farm is located and what fruits do you farm on your area thanks Margaret Hyundai I'm very happy for your village I'm also impressed for you visiting us it is also another form of encouraging us from your mas welcome to my farm this bum I grow these tangerines which you can see around we have another forum just below here where we are Marcos and we also have Washington origins so just to start with in this farm of the tragedies you can see they are already started they have already started forming the fruit the fruit stages and before they come to the trick to this stage of food you have to ensure that the fruit is the tree itself is clean and you clean it up by removing all branches if you look at this tire entry if you look at this one you have found me working on it there are hot branches and some of these old branches prevented a tree from adding more production so what we do we use the cursor keys to remove these these old bridges we ensure that before the tree fully fruits up all the old branches are removed another thing with this trees is that the old bridge is also a bur some of them microorganisms which might be dangerous to the tree and as you know when something is dead it keeps on rotting and affecting the lower section so we ensure that you can and in addition when we are cutting where we also can use the sole for those very hard branches some of the brightest becomes very hard so what we do is that we use and now before we now get to maybe you can tell us when did you start about about 30 years luck and we started by having just a few trees and GRI gear we kept on adding because you have to first put them in the nursery and then from the nursery you come and plant some of these trees when you plant some of them dry and what we normally do is that we plant the orange tree that tree that seeds from the the lemon tree actually we use a lemon tree to plant in the nursery and that lemon tree after it has grown up is when we converted by grafting you can see this is a lemon tree it is funny so what we do we graft you can see from this tree if you look at the is here and the one not a upper side there is some difference so that is the graph table area after you have grafted then the tree takes about two to three years to grow okay so and during that time there is there are some infection C and there which we keep on fighting right and how did you start now these farming business because we say 30 years ago and 30 that as not a short time it is what motivated you to start farming in your farm actually here we started fruit farming under the guidance of our agricultural officer we have some like around here we have a gentleman by moon he's a man who is very active and he has been supporting us very much what they normally used to do what they normally come and do is that they guide us on what to do at those stages we had the only very few farmers who are growing these days and you can see van around here not every farmer is only those who laid initiative who started so when we were in current and shown how we can grow the trees those who were willing went forward so they could guide us on how to make the tree nurseries and all that after that we plac transplant and after transplanting yeah we are now and now looking at the land how big is your land and how many trees of tangerines and my thumb is we put all two together OTE that your increase is about more than two hundred two hundred trees and when we others there is good money you look like a person OS really enjoy it yeah we have really paid now looking at the land how did you acquire the land was this a land that you had bought sometimes bug or you inherited or how did you come about getting a big land where you can be able to actually I started from a small farm which I'd inherited from my father which is down here on the other side but where we are is a land which I have already vote so the land here to acquire land you have also to consult the neighbors and the willing neighbors also sell so I bought all most of this land which where we are is about section of land which is about three three four or five pictures ok very good now let's look at you 30 years in the business because you've enjoyed some benefits that come along with fur farming what are some of the benefits that you've gotten from doing fruits especially tangerine and the mangoes actually let me tell you one aspect is that one of Education have benefited a lot because I've been working as a civil servant and as you already know civil servants the cash we get from the employment is so unless you have to develop other means oh honey you might find serious challenge more so in education why are we to get my children and I have also managed to even whenever wherever we are sick forever one of us like in the left just last year last for two years I had a daughter and I managed to pay a big bill so it is affirming that you can say it is very very much sustainable to a farmer actually what you have to do is a farmer is to listen to the advice given by the Extension Office one thing which are Everland throughout the entity that period have been fun is that unless we used the unwise from the technical people to guide us and also show you the modern methods of green tea even getting there they have besides and also the phagocytes which we are going to spray if you just be going to the market and pick me anything you will destroy your farm what we normally do and what I normally do personally I always ring the extension officer asking this is what I have seen in my farm how can I solve this problem so even if you are working closely with a technical and device from the extension services which are proven which is provided by the government you will succeed but if you are running alone and buying anything on the reading everything that you get in the market will fail this one is the challenges you have gone through in the fruit farming business actually the fruit farming business is so good here including the mangoes including the tangerines and all this the worst aspect there are two serious crisis with the first crisis is the crisis of diseases wherever we get diseases you will find that they drag or the insect society which you had used the previous year if you sprayed this time it'll it restarts the root system so you have to go back again with a technical device versus ask them I have sprayed such-and-such a medicine but it is inside say it's not working they give you an alternative so that is why I've said they are very important the other aspect which has been really intense fruit is market marketing we do not have a centralized or a well-organized make way selling whatever we look for brokers who come from the major towns they come around with aurorus and what do you have to sell because like now you look at these trees they are full of origin do I hit it unless there is market this all this one's will will fall down here and they will come with you will see when we go to the area of mangoes the farmer loses a lot by not having good market now let's look at the tangerine tangerines are trees which are now gaining their fruits which are now coming up in Kenya and many people are eating this fruit so you as a farmer this tangerine how long did it take for you to grow since from sibling up to a point now it is producing its fruits how long did it take for the food to grow actually you look at it and that small one there you can see that one there it will only take not more than three years and you start August so within the firm after you have grafted you give it two to three years it is continuous it is continuous but since you know my childhood is an area where we normally have spans of oh and the serious eat it's only this year where we when we held on like this anyway sometimes it is terrible rocks so this Tiger rings there is a time you might come here and find that they are all appearing as if they are drying up and even sometimes we are forced to to water them so the the challenge which is there for the site of the trees is that when they start growing they will be born people giving you food every year year after year but normally once every year but it's a bomba produced like now you can see now looking at one tree of tangerine like this how many fruits can afirma expect to harvest from one tree like this one we will normally know taken to others less than 500 that is after every week every month no we allow the treats you know the fruits take a long time to write they do not all right but one time at once they do not arrive at the intervals they normally have a span of about two two weeks or one man three weeks for obvious honesty so we are we almost others all of them at the same time how much do you sell to us when they come to get the fruits on the farm one tangerine or a kilogram we normally sell using the kiln because if it goes to Cinco it is not it does not work very well so we normally get at at five shillings but when the market when it is about crowds it it drops to even twenty so you find out that time normally when they when the market gets flooded you find that you sell at a very low price and even you do not gain and with that any cost of production you put on the farm like when it comes to giving it insecticides laborers who are working to weed around the areas of the tree all this before you need to pay them that's what you recoup from the business help in pain it does relate to us you only find that you have to invest the amount that you gain during the harvest time you have and such that when you are in the process of farming bringing up the trees maintaining and ensuring that you spray you prune underage take out the tree the money that you should use is the one which are already okay and in this farm do you walk alone or do you have someone who you and she's able to monitor on the businesses she's serious for my hair because even she's the one who has done most of the work it's me I just support but she's very active and I appreciate our efforts alright in that segment we've lab but you can make good business from the tangerine yeah alright so guys we are going to take a short break but when we come back just remember Frances has told us that the wife is the manager we are going to talk now to the manager of the farm and we get our views and aspects and also how they have made it in this fruit business in machacas County [Music] [Music]", "m2tnKt1ZQGo": "today's episode is brought to you by by rainbow trees calm welcome everybody today's video I'm going to show you guys how to clone your lemon citrus plants and it's really easy if you follow these steps and make sure you do watch it till the end of the video I like to hear your feedback and then if you do try this make sure you do leave comments down below I'd like to hear your experiences and trying this method basically we've got a well I guess this is an old start of the show we had a five-part video series on how to grow a lemon tree from seed and this is our guy here it's time for pruning and it grew about three feet and one knee here did really really well and what I wanted to do is I want to just kind of take off some of these vertical shoots and we're gonna make them into well we're gonna try to promote I should say some lateral shoots because that's where the fruits gonna come from these lateral shoots okay so I'll show you how to snip it and where to snip it from and then I've got some over here prepared and and kind of what we do after that process so what you want to do is you want to find a node or basically where the leaf is protruding from that is called a node that is where you're gonna get action that's where your roots are gonna start so what I'm going to do is I've located this leaf right here and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cut into that right where it's coming out of on that stem right there okay so if you can see this right there is exactly where we want to cut into and then we're gonna remove this leaf okay because that's where that action is going to come from your roots are going to start to come out right here and I'll show you what you need to kind of promote and help that growth the leaves here that are left you can peel them off and leave I leave two leaves on my cuttings and I just cut these leaves in half that helps to retain moisture because what we want is we want this to retain moisture we want the roots to come out the base okay so we've prepped that I've got a couple other guys over here ready to go one thing that you guys will need is a rooting hormone I'm using fast route from Miracle Grow works great just a powder form it's gonna help promote root growth it's a hormone there and we're just gonna place it on the base of these cuttings as you can see I've been doing cuttings all morning a little bit of a mess going on here but so here's one we're just going to take this we're gonna dip it into the jar take off all the excess and that's what you want there so I'm going to prepare these for dipping it in the root hormone and they're just tapping off the excess some of your trees if you've grown from seed and you watched my videos and you've tried it on your own you'll notice some of these lateral shoots will have thorns and that's okay that's just it's non fruit-bearing no big deal but if there's a existing plant that you guys really really do like this is the way to get the exact replicas you can't grow from seed and expect to get the same fruit its hybridized it's taken it was taken the pollen from something else and now it's created an offspring and The Offspring just like kids that no one is the same so your citrus is not gonna taste the same either okay so I just have a regular pot here whatever you guys want to use that's fine the soil is the key it needs to stay moist the type of soil does not matter okay so we simply just sink that into the soil there we've got a greenhouse on the farm here so if you guys are worried about this has to stay moist if you guys are worried about this drying out you mean you may be gone for a couple days or you at work and you may forget to water you can always put plastic around this really doesn't matter the leaves can touch the plastic and just take a rubber band and take it across the top of this here and then that way it stays moist a little longer and you don't have to water as much all right guys down below in the comments make sure you let me know if you do try this out how it works out for you hope you guys enjoy the video and learn something today and we'll see you in the next video today's episode is brought to you by by rainbow trees calm", "oTJxgasttAY": "[Music] everybody welcome to my kitchen we don't normally film in here but today I'm making one of those DIY dried orange Garland's that I'm sure you've seen all over Pinterest and Instagram this year it's like the trendy thing to decorate with for Christmas this year I guess so I've got to make one I want to test it out I think they're really pretty and I want to add like a little bit of different embellishment to it and style it so I figured I would just show you the process if it's easy if it's hard and some ideas with how you can style it as well so I'm really excited that that's all we're gonna get up to today okay so here I've got my oranges that I picked up from Trader Joe's the other day I'm not quite sure how many I'm going to need but I guess that all depends on how big of a garland you want to make or if you want to make more than one so the first step is to slice them up so let's do that okay so I slice my oranges up using this serrated knife and they're about this thick hopefully that's right and if you have any little end pieces like this you can just toss them or if you want you could do a stovetop potpourri which is another thing I love doing this time of year but I'm going to take these and put them onto a cooling rack on top of a baking sheet because I don't have any parchment paper and then I'm going to put them in the oven for three hours at 250 degrees Fahrenheit [Music] you guys are so depressing it's 4:30 exactly and it's already getting dark out I just had to turn on the overhead light I hate this time of year for that reason but anyway the words are gonna take a while to be like they have another couple hours so it'll probably be dark by the time they're done so I think I'll make the garland actually tomorrow and style it and hang it up and show you all that but I'll try to get some footage tonight of what they look like when they come out of the oven so you can tell like how they should look when they're ready but for now I'm just gonna let them bake and relax oh but I did want to show you guys when I ended up doing with these little leftover like orange egg pieces that I cut off so I ended up putting them in a little pot with some water with some cinnamon sticks and whole cloves and I'm just gonna simmer it for the next few hours and just keep checking on in adding more water and it smells so good it makes the whole house smell really yummy cozy and festive you could also use like powdered cinnamon or cloves if you have them but yeah it's really one of my favorite things to do in the winter time [Music] all right so this is what they look like after two and a half hours and like you saw I did flip them over about halfway through the cooking process and now you can see they're like a little bit brown on the edges which is what they're supposed to look like this one probably could have come out a little bit sooner because it's really thin so you can see it started to curl up a bit but that's okay most of them look really good so I'm excited to see how they work tomorrow for the garland I'll let them dry overnight because I think that will help them to just continue like the dry out dehydration process and then we'll be ready to make our garland tomorrow okay so we're up in my little DIY studio office area I think it will be better to make this up here because there's more room so I went to Michael's and I got these Christmas stems they were 50% off I decided to go with fake because I think it'll just be better to use every year and then a little runaway bead I got a bunch of wood beads here so this was a value pack of a bunch of different sizes of beads I think it was also 50% off and then we've got our oranges so to make the garland I'll show you what I do but basically I just take some twine and some floral wire and I cut off pieces with my wire cutters and then I wrap it all together and then I'm going to do the oranges and the beads separately and then weave it into the garland so I'll show you guys the process but it's pretty easy [Music] so it's looking pretty good so far all of this is attached to the twine as you can see I was just wrapping the floral wire around both the stem and the twine so that it stays together and then using the next piece to cover up the wire from the previous piece and some of these pieces are bigger so they're taking up more space on the twine which is good and then what I'm done I'll take some of these little pieces that I cut off and probably use them to like to fill in any spots that are a little bit more sparse but yeah I'm just sort of interchanging the different types of stems that I bought so that it flows together well and looks good and I think it's looking pretty good so far so now that the garland is done I've set it aside and I'm using the same twine here for the orange garland and I've put a little bit of tape around the end so that I could slide it through this large yarn needle and what I'm going to do is string the orange slices onto here and then in between each one I'll do a few beads I'm not sure how many yeah I'm gonna wait and see what it looks like but I'll just repeat that process until I run out of orange slices and I made this string pretty long it's probably not as long as my garland but that's okay I'm just going to weave it throughout so I think that'll look pretty good so I'm gonna start stringing everything I think I'm done with the garland I ended up doing an orange slice and then I would do five beats so two bigger beads a little one and then two bigger ones and it's pretty long so I'm hoping it's long enough if it's not I do still have some orange slices left over so I can make another one and add it in but now the only thing that I need to do is just weave this in with the greenery garland and then it will be ready to make up so I decided that this would be perfect in my kitchen above my window I love the look of Garland's hanging above the kitchen window I just hung up the greenery I didn't film that because I had no idea what I was doing but I will show you what I ended up doing into the second and then I'm gonna fill in some of the bare spots with some of the extra greenery and then I'll add in the oranges to hang this up I just added the command hook on this corner and the command took on the other corner and then I used the twine to just loop that onto the command hook and it's staying really well I'm gonna add a little bit more greenery at the bottom of this and right here up at the top where you can see the twine but then we should be good to go so it's all filled in now I added some at the bottom and some of at the top so now I'm going to try to add the orange garland and I'm not sure if I'm going to just hang it right over top of this just the same way or if I'm going to wrap it around the garland I'm gonna play around with it and just see what looks best oh my gosh I love it so much so as you can see it's a little bit shorter than the garland which I knew when I was making it but I actually really liked it I liked that was just part of the top of the garland and not the whole thing I think it might be over till if it was super long and when I did to attach it was just hook the twine right through the command hook right over the other garland so it was super easy and now for the really fun part I'm going to go through my little Christmas set of decorations and put some things out here on the counter style it up and show you the final look [Music] all right we are done I love it so much it could not have turned out better in my opinion and it was pretty easy it was just a little bit time-consuming with like the baking but you just pop in the oven and do whatever you want so it really wasn't that bad you can customize it in so many different ways as you saw and I don't know about you guys but unless it's Christmas specific I will keep decorations like this up throughout February because it's really just a winter decoration it's so cozy and pretty so I think I'll be keeping it up through February let me know if you guys liked this style more like casual vlog style DIY it was pretty easy for me to film so I can do more of that and I'll have a few other videos coming out really soon with a bunch of Christmas DIYs which I'm really excited to share so make sure you subscribe

to play with from my ninja foodie so I thought I would open it up with you here and show you what it looks like if it came in the mail to your house and I'll show you how to put it into the ninja foody and maybe we'll try something out okay this is a ninja dehydrating rack attachment for the ninja food I bought this online and I can leave a link in my description so you can check it out but it came in the mail today and this is to be used with this particular model because it has a feature of dehydrating on it not all the ninja foodies have that but we were careful to get one that does because we are gonna make some good stuff on this alright let's see what it looks like inside package nicely stacked together here there's even some directions on how to use it okay each one of the racks is individually wrapped in plastic so that they stay nice and straight they're separated by cardboard nice job in packaging look at these racks they have nice little grid so you can put stuff on you it's pretty small and not worry about it falling through so many of them there's five I believe yep and five racks will give me quite a lot of food now first directions that they have is wash the racks first so I'm going to wash them and I'll be right back here we are all nice and clean now one of these racks has what they call ladders and the ladders are what are going to hold each of the trays going up the sides so you actually put this together as you make your laces or pieces of food that you want to dehydrate and then each of the racks has a little side piece on and they fit into the ladder every time you add a tray you fit it into the steps on the ladder and then you fill your next tray with the food then you want to dehydrate and you put it into the ladder and so on [Applause] alright it looks like this you open your fruity you don't use the pressure cooking lid you use the airfryer tight lid and you take your full rack of food and it fits perfectly into the food then close the lid and you turn on the tea hydrating question and go ahead with your project now I would like to make something for you with the first unboxing here so so I'm gonna get out some nice fruit and we're gonna dehydrate some citrus crisps so let me get them out and I'll show you how to make this nice little snack all right here we go I got a couple nice pieces of citrus here I have a ruby red grapefruit I have a big fat navel orange and I have a couple blood oranges which are so good I just love them so I'm going to cut these up in very very thin slices okay and then we're gonna lay them on the racks I'm gonna bring you up close so you can see what I'm doing okay we're gonna take a nice sharp knife for this now we're just gonna cut very thin slices let's start with the ruby red grapefruit cut off enough of the rind chilly start to see some nice fruit in there okay I just love when we get bright colors in the citrus fruits so that's what I was hoping for with this selection here now we're going to cut this as thin as possible and I'm talking to it you can see through that if you wanted to know okay now we're just gonna keep making slices nice sharp knife helps you do this to get good thin pieces as we get these nice thin pieces here we're gonna lay them on the bottom rack first this is the rack with the ladders on the side and what keep going here flip these on when I get that rat filled we're gonna go to the next layer and we have a lot of nice juicy pieces here if you see any seeds take them out if they start to become a lot of rind then just put them aside and you know what I'm gonna do with them I'm gonna have that for a little snack tonight while I'm waiting for the fruit to dry okay now there's two layers pretty nice here and we're gonna put the navel orange next this is almost as big as the grapefruit we're gonna cut into this till we get a nice big piece of Center fruit my sister told me that when years she made decorations for her Christmas tree by making orange slices and drying them but they were nice and thick and hopefully ours are gonna be nice to eat not hang on a Christmas tree but you can do that too it does make a nice decoration and you can even put some kind of varnish on it to keep them nice on the Christmas tree these are coming out so nice and with the naval oranges we don't have any seeds in there so it's a good choice here too to use without having to mess around with seeds all right now I have two rockets left I'm gonna put the rest of the naval orange aside and start doing some blood oranges because I think they look so cool and I love the flavor of them so we want a little bit more of those and once we get these going here rack in place okay now check out this blood orange doesn't that look nice look at those colors this is a healthy snack for sure okay beautiful beautiful let's spread these out for drying again I'm not finding any seeds in a blood-orange I do want to experiment here and try making a fat one and see how that comes out if any different I don't know if you can always find blood oranges in your neighborhood but I don't always find them around here when I do I scoff them up get the last rack on now many of you have used fruit dehydrators the kind that you have plastic racks and they're very hard to clean these can go right into the dishwasher if it works in the same nature but sometimes the fruit dehydrator takes a couple days this takes for what I'm doing here is going to take about six hours I couldn't wait for this rack to come in the mail I'm so excited and I know Rick is gonna be so excited too because he has in mind making things like beef jerky on this here we go that's what I'm gonna put into the Ninja and we're gonna dehydrate it overnight all right we just have the air frying lid on here which if you have seen this before this is how it looks inside all right I'm going to take the rack full of citrus and just lower it into the pot and it's a perfect fit everything is sitting there nicely now we're just gonna put the lid down on top all right I'll show you how easy it is just set it all right now we're gonna choose the word dehydrate and press it and then to set it to the default we're gonna press it again it's 150 degrees however I would like to change the temperature to 135 degrees then we're going to set the time six hours that's exactly what I want for the time that we're going to keep this in the dehydrator and then press Start that's all there is to it then you see the the light go on and it will start to dehydrate now we can check it throughout the cooking time just to make sure it's might be done a little bit early because we never tried this yet but I'm gonna go with the recipe book that came with the ninja and it doesn't tell you much but it does tell you dehydrating times for fruit and they're typically 135 degrees and six to eight hours so hopefully we get a nice crunchy snack out of this and in the meantime I'm gonna eat the leftover oranges okay we'll be back now we'll check it in the morning all right the drying time is over so let's take a look here okay we have some nice dried fruit let's lift the rack out all right now this is what we have dried each layer has looks like it drive pretty evenly a couple a little bit stuck together okay there's some fight on just do some navel oranges nice and bright now the navel oranges seem to stay more more solid compared to the blood oranges which dried up in the middle a little bit where they smell great the grapefruits I can smell them right away nice and beautiful all right Lorraine she's in a bowl for a nice snack these are really pretty you all right this is our citrus slices after six hours of drying time I think you would find that you could dry it even further if you want to be more crispy now this is pretty well dried that you could hear the snap in there it reminds me kind of like a dried pineapple would be but not as crispy as a what you would say a dried banana would be so you can't eat the rind and it's nice because these are very thin and if you do enjoy the taste of the rind then this is a nice thickness so let's have a taste mmm little crunchy and delicious they taste so fresh like as if it was the whole piece of moist fruit but this is a nice way you can take this with you for your lunch thanks for joining me for my first recipe using the ninja foodie dehydrator function if you would like to have a ninja foodie and you don't have one now I'll put a link in the description where you can get one I hope you get a chance to make this nice natural snack thanks for watching", "t7vfbidzlfA": "[Music] hi my name is Charles Malky biologist simply an expert without any organics where we grow cool plants and today we're gonna be talking specifically about pruning and feeding of and we're just gonna be working around these sweet Meyer lemon trees it's three of them that are on this stretch of the property we're gonna be talking about with pruning the concept of espalier espalier on depend on how you want to pronounce it and we're also gonna be talking about the ivory ganks products which i've got here our newest line which is the blue line which is the oil free products and then we've got the original yellow line which is got these seven natural oils in it and the ready to use spray but we're gonna be talking about all this towards the end but before we start let me first share with you that today is October 21st it's like a record hot day like it's surprisingly hot let's take a look here at the weather if you take a look right near here in Los Angeles at 9:41 a.m. it's already 93 degrees weather expected a high of 103 degrees and take a look tomorrow is gonna be 97 and then it gets back down to what's supposed to be normal within the next week the mid-70s I've even brought here a chart to share with you what our weather conditions are supposed to be like here in October where my finger is if you go up the average highest was to be 79 degrees with November being about 73 average high down to 68 in December and then here again 66 in January and then warming its way up going into spring and then ultimately summer but this is an unusually hot hot hot late October month um but with that being said and let's not get into politics let me give you the tour of these meyer lemons check out all of these fruits for those who've you've been following on all of these videos on how we've been pruning them successively throughout the year check out all of these fruit hanging solo and also right here we're gonna correct this like look my head's hitting and it's kind of annoying when you're entering the garden they've got all these fruits so we're gonna correct this without pruning so we're gonna be exploring that in just a minute we're coming a little bit further around here come around yeah you can check out all of these lemons that are here and take a look here at this banner it's gonna be of importance in just a minute I'll explain to you why in a second and then as you come around even further and further you can see that the plant is completely overgrown this is not ideal and it hasn't been ideal for at least the last 30 to 60 days it's kind of pushed out a lot of new growth check out all of these honeybees that are pollinating and doing what they do best on there's a whole bunch of new lemons in here if you come in a little closer you can check out all of these beautiful clusters of baby lemons as well and then within it all of these yellow lemons and then we've got some green lemons and there's just so much going on if there's one citrus tree then you're wanting to see a lot of activity happening on in your garden it's got to be in a consider what's now called instead of just Meyer lemon the improved Meyer lemon is a virus-free strain all these beautiful pollinators here in the garden so when it comes to the improved Meyer lemon variety it's basically a virus-free strain of what was originally called simply the Meyer lemon so when you go to your stores you're gonna notice on the tags they're gonna read and prove Meyer lemon and just check out how vigorous and healthy it is and again when it comes to a citrus tree and here's the third one back here so you can notice this one is growing a lot less but no less productive check out all of these lemons under here if I can pull this up there's got to be at least 20 right here behind my hand they kind of look like grapes how many lemons we've got sit so we can attribute the reason that this plant is significantly shorter than the surrounding two Meyer lemons because this is probably supporting a lot more fruit a lot more dense fruit and thereby it's consuming a lot more energy towards fruit production rather than growth and we have no problem with that the height is nice and we're gonna try to manage these trees before the end of this video to kind of match all three of these Meyer lemons so they all look uniform and we're gonna do that together right now but before we do check out these trees and believe it or not and let me get back to the other side where you can see all the fruit underneath the lemon so here we are now on the other side of that Meyer lemon tree check out that cluster of lemons again that I basically explain kind of looks like grapes with how cluster they are we're gonna thin all of those out but all of these lemons believe it or not are less than two years old I install them less than two years sometime in December to February of like I said about two years ago and just to prove it to you I'm gonna share this quick video length by Isabel Rose on a little red gardener who's my oldest daughter when she basically did a tour of these three lemons check this out we're gonna do today we're gonna plot trees and we're gonna and I'm gonna teach you about I'm Eric and X welcome to my garden [Music] so the first thing I want to share with you when it comes to training your trees because not always you have to prune it you can notice that this branch over here which if you come a little closer and then you can back back you know into position but you can see that we've got a whole bunch of little fruits so this is the next generation of lemons that will be coming and if this is the branch we want to keep we can simply pull it down and train it in the down position as we've done with all of these you may notice some of the string if you come in a little closer you may notice over here all of this twine that's in place is to kind of steer and direct these branches into the down position and now check out all of these lemons that are alongside of our very short and low you know our very short fence if you come in a little closer now that we're here I want to I want to point out another fact as well you may notice over here I'm going to show the video where we pruned these fruit that were coming off of this branch and then on this side as well you can notice that we've pruned over here another cluster of fruit that were hanging off of this and since we pruned II can see it's created these new branches new flowers and then ultimately all of these new fruit check all this out from what were to prune branches about a year ago check this one out now when harvesting your lemons think about what is going to be the next best growth areas what are gonna be the next best bloom areas on the stems don't just simply cut all of those fruit off the stems the right thing to do is to prune those branches back to where it's going to continue to grow and blue and support more fruit in the years to come and here's here's the point here the lessons I want to make here you'll notice that when I made that last cut I made a cut over here which is leading to nowhere northern any leaves or buds or anything coming off of it the proper way in a more logical way would be to prune it back to where you see some leaves and I'm actually gonna cut this back all the way to right about here and before I cut it what I'm going to do is remove all of these leaves and all of these fruits and I'm gonna encourage the plant to continue growing right at this point right here and I'm gonna cut it out at an angle right near and right underneath this leaf which has got a bud which will ultimately form the new branches to support the new flowers and we're just gonna cut it like so and now we've got all of these additional lemons as well and then over here there's another bundle of lemons and I want these branches to all continue to grow and hang and support more fruit I'm gonna do the same thing with this bundle of lemons and just prune it like so right here and now it's gonna happen take a look at all of these lemons that we've got on just this one print and what we'll do when when bringing them in the house is we're gonna now separate them like so I'm just gonna cut it about a quarter of revenge right above and this will be the perfect way to actually harvest your lemons and then store them and you can keep them in a cool dry place in your house for anywhere from 10 to up to 21 days so about 2 to 3 weeks they'll store but with all the rest of these lemons take a look at how many more lemons we've still got in here they'll remain on the plant for anywhere up to two to four months and still be in good quality condition on the plant so when training a branch all you simply need is your twine I've got my scissors and the main lesson when training your branches is to make sure you're not putting the not against the branch you're gonna want to put the not against the supporting stake or in this case defense so I'll move this bottle here out of the way and we're simply gonna tie a knot here hopefully you can follow this and then we're going to basically capture the branch we're gonna wrap it around and then we're gonna go back and secure it in place and now I've got this branch out of our walkway and where I can continue to support and create the fruit so we've kind of created now what looks like a weeping effect um by pruning you know by basically directing that branch down the other concern I have here what these branches before we get to pruning it's this one over here that's hitting my head it's kind of annoying and it's creating too much of a very narrow cave effect I don't mind the fact that we've got you know cave structure with you know underlying fruit but it's just too low so what we're gonna do is we're gonna pull this branch up and into position and what I did just before the video was I installed the state it's right there in that position so I'm gonna get over there and what I'm gonna do is do the same thing I'm going to tie my twine to the supporting stake and then grab the branch and pull it into position and it's basically gonna open this entire walkway as it pulls itself and the surrounding branches back with it one thing we're also being very cautious and careful not to do is to create too much of a compact structure I've invested the last couple of years creating an open canopy with basically pulling the branches apart in different directions to maximize the amount of light that gets onto each leaf that's on all of these different branches as the more leaves that are serving as your solar panels making the sugars and the vitamins and the proteins and all the minerals that go into creating the ultimately your fruit but as the plants making all of these resources these leaves in order to function best need light and to accomplish this we're gonna want to create as you know as open as possible of the canopy but in this situation we're pulling these branches back in but we're doing so cautiously still trying to keep in mind the open canopy policy so let's get into supporting the tree now [Music] so we just secured it with our twine the first time this bridge is still not high enough so we're now we're gonna do a second supporting support system so here we go with a second doing more than one is also preferred as that's also going to minimize the stress upon the bridge that we're not trying to redirect and resupport so here we go again going back behind the tree and again retired or not against the stake looping around the branch now we're gonna cat capture this bridge and pull this branch back up in a position while this one is still offering support to the overall main structure of the branch so here we go you're very again we're rapping if you want to come in a little closer so you can see what I'm looking for I've got another fork in the road over here some more forks in the branches over there we're just gonna wrap it I'm gonna select right in between the two that'll help keep that branch in the selected area now we're going to throw this back in the position now I'm gonna secure it here we go and watch the branch go right into position here we go and that's it and now we're tying the knot in place and we're done branches now out of the way we've still got these beautiful lemons in place and we did no pruning yet let's talk about pruning now follow me to the other side so I'm glad again I just want to reiterate the fact I'm glad we're doing a strictly Meyer lemon which is a sweet lemon variety video to discuss how these plants are typically more compact growing than a lot of the other citrus varieties these three lemons that are behind me are grafted on a standard root stock I brought this container plant over here being also an improved Meyer lemon variety that's grafted onto a dwarf root stock this plant only grows a matter of inches per year whereas as you can see these trees behind me are growing several feet per year on average maybe as much as five to eight feet annually this little thing has produced on average unfortunately as no lemons on it today but it a bridge is about three to five lemons per year on this teeny-tiny plant and we've used this in other videos in the past where you can see the fruit that were on it whereas these are producing I would say close to 50 to 100 fruit per year with expected production to be in the hundreds of fruit per tree per year being just that it's a standard variety meaning more branches more height and therefore more area to support more fruit and again such a beautiful tree and on this warm October day you can just smell the fragrance and this entire garden is truly magnificent but I want to share with you next is this concept of espalier which I mentioned to you at the beginning and whether you call it a spell EA which I believe is a French word or a spell year it's a horticultural and ancient agricultural practice of controlling woody plant growth for the production of fruit by pruning and tying branches to a frame plants are frequently shaped in a formal patterns flat against structure such as a wall fence or trellis and also plants which have been shaped in this way and here you can see is a horizontal espalier where it's basically maybe something like an apple tree you know grown with branches running horizontally against a wall or I feel like what I've created here is something called a free-standing a spell yard fruit tree and what what and the reason I'm saying it's a free-standing espalier is I'm trying to grow these Meyer lemons in a very dense and tight strip basically a rectangle shape against this growing area and if I went with my shears and just pruned away what I'd be doing is that recruiting away all of the flowers and fruits and basically preventing my success at having a maximum yield of fruit we got to be very selective and how you basically support the branches and also how you prune the branches we're going to talk about pruning in just a minute when we come to this Meyer lemon tree behind me this one here was most susceptible to the risk of sunburn when we pruned it back in February and again I'm gonna put the video link to all of the Meyer lemon work we've done on these trees behind me at the end of this video and also put it in the comments down below so you can just click on all of these Meyer lemon videos if you want to see a lot more but what we're gonna do here today is there's this open space and I'm hoping you can see this within the tree structure right down below is the tree trunk you can see the branches that are coming up and off of it they're coated in the ivory Kent or Ivor again it's color white they could also be done in colors brown and grain but we've selected white for this purpose but it would be nice if this branch that were here instead of it growing out into my courtyard was in fact growing vertically up and filling this empty space that otherwise has no branches behind it and the cool thing is we can accomplish that through training as we did on the other side of this Meyer lemon we're going to now basically support this brand to the stake that's behind it and create just that is a bridge in exactly the place we want it'll be filling in another open space maximizing on light thereby creating maximum amounts of sugars as well as the proteins vitamins and and all the other minerals that the plants need for health and that'll also maximize the amount of fruit production within this tree so we're now going to steer and direct and control this branch then keep in mind once I support it within about eight months to a year that branch will be permanently in that position if it's still too heavy with fruit you might need a resupport in a different manner but otherwise within the upcoming year to a few years this branch will be in that position indefinitely let's go to support this branch now so I found a place in here where I could squeeze I'm now coming again with my twine I'm simply going to tie a knot if you want to come in a little closer you can see how I tie the knot and what I'm using are these metal stakes that are covered in on this plastic vinyl material you can see the metal that's right up in here covered in this plastic vinyl material and what we're gonna do is we're gonna simply put the knot against it and then I like wrapping it one more time and then doing two more double knots and that'll hold the twine in the position that I want it to stay and that's it that won't slip up nor down and now I'm gonna grab that branch that I want to secure it's right here you're gonna wrap it I'm gonna try to get it in the most vertical position possible which is right here I may even put a second support on it as well as we did on the first to make sure that it's supported in more than one position so it's not too stressed in the position that we're trying to control and that's it let's go on to another lesson so over here is another branch which I could also train in to this position and take a look at all of those lemons it's gonna be such a showcase branch and it's also again occupying an area that's not being used by a branch and again capitalizing on light and maximizing fruit production and it's all within this very tight growing zone all of these other branches that are growing loosely into my growing zone and which if I pulled it back would be basically going into the shade of another branch we're gonna have to prune the hardest one for me to correct that I just don't see right here it's gonna be this branch over here and you can see this poor honeybee that's working hard collecting the sugars out of the flowers but if I were to pull this branch up take a look I'm going right into the under canopy of a branch that's right above it this is the branch that's gonna have to come out and what we're gonna do is we're gonna follow this branch back I'm hoping if you can come in a little closer I found this perfect place for pruning it would be right here take a look at all of these fruit that are here underlying we come up you can see a branch that's coming out as well we've got some more flowers that'll be um and this one will become dozens within the upcoming month or two if it keeps on blooming the way it has but we're gonna do is we're gonna prune it right here and I'm gonna explain to you why in just a second so we're just going to prune it like so and what we've done now is this area and this branch once it expands and grows will eventually heal over and enclose over this wound we're also going to seal it with the ivory organics products in just a minute but we're gonna continue this pattern throughout if there isn't a branch existing we can simply go down to the next nearest leaf and basically I'm pruning about a quarter inch above that leaf and then this leaf node will eventually turn into another bud that'll create the next branch and hopefully it'll happen up from one but maybe two or three leaves and we'll create a nice bushy compact system that will then fill in this growing zone are we gonna continue this pattern going all the way down so here we are now take a quick look at this entire length you can see I've cleaned it up a lot check out all the branches we've removed this is the end of October this is now at least my third if not fourth time this year that have significantly prune my Meyer lemon trees and again you can see a lot of those videos at the end the person behind the camera is asking well how about this branch that's you know near the bottom let me share with you what's going on here check out these little fruit and these have completely held its position so these will definitely turn into fruit here's some more flowers and more fruit on its way and here you can see much larger fruit that'll be ripe within the upcoming month or two but if these were to support its fruit as it's been doing we're gonna have fruit that's touching the ground chances are with winter and rain and the moisture and mildew that's going to be collecting near the floor it's going to damage these fruit significantly it is in your best interest to clean that up and to prevent that risk from happening otherwise you're gonna have very unpleasant one to look at or to they may potentially not even ripen well at all to begin with because we're touching the ground a small sacrifice but all that energy that you're taking away from this zone will go into a zone that you in fact you know want and in you know you can appreciate and that won't be at risk at rubbing against the floor won't be at risk of you know snails and slugs and other pests near the ground that may be chewing on your fruit so great pest control in a way and also by keeping your plan off the ground it's going to minimize also the risk of more pests entering the plant so what we're gonna do here is we're just gonna prune this branch and again it's gonna come in a little closer I'm just gonna prune this branch back like so back to these leaves and then this larger branch I'm just gonna follow this cluster of lemons that are underneath and hopefully create another cluster of branches and flowers off of this stem over here so I've allowed a stem to exist that will be hopefully the future cluster of flowers and fruits again in the future but this here is gone and there's one more brain so it's back here which is this is a poor or growing branch we can see over here I've got another branch structure that's over here the branch on this side is growing into the tree the goal when it comes to the structure of the plant I'm just going to hold my hands and my finger is out as far as I can the goal is you want to start from the middle and basically have all the branches growing in the out direction what is happening here is the branches growing back into the tree and even though this has medium sized fruit on it check this out one two three four five I'll squeeze what I can out of it and make a nice citrus drink or a marinade or salad dressing or something out of it none of this will go to waste but this branch is not in an ideal situation and potentially harming the underlying structure and other branches that are in there doing what they're supposed to be doing which is going from the inside out so this branch as well which is going into the canopy will be pruned out as well and again with the prune we're gonna come in as close as we can to the the branch pruned like so and carefully remove that branch from the structure and here we are here we are we're pretty much done I hope you guys like that there here we are now back in the on one side of our meyer lemon as you can see the whole walkway has now opened up so if you take a look here as we explained at the beginning we've got these products I want to share with you real quick and we're gonna start using one right right away on the first one is this blue line and then the second being the original on the yellow line and then the ready to use spray bottle which is here the three on one plant guard ready to use spray protection against damaging sunburn insects and rodents is derived as is a ready to use spray bottle from this product over here as you can see it's also registered material for use in organic agriculture and the way it works is the inert ingredients or iron oxide which controls the color lime stone mica which is about like a clay base milk and silica combined when applied to your plants will last for about a year the magic behind the yellow label are the seven natural garden oils which include castor oil cinnamon clove garlic peppermint rosemary spearmint oils and what these will do is once brushed onto your tree trunks as you can see with all of these lemons behind me that are coated in white also available in colors brown and green for both the whitewash product as well as the three and one will offer a protection one what the yellow label when applied applo offers protection against the rodents but also in your branches which we're going to see in a minute that'll help keep any Boris from entering such as beetles and termites but also when sprayed on your leaves as a foliar spray and you can use any of these cans to also create a foliar spray will help keep your plant several degrees cooler in the summer but also insulate your plants from freezing damage it you know damaging winter temperatures as well and lastly the products can also be used as a dormant spray as well to basically smother insects that are living within your peaches nut trees and even ornamentals so let's take a look at how we're gonna apply that product if you want to follow me over here so if you take a look at now this citrus you can see that the light is now coming through if you can come in a little closer I'm hoping you can see and I'll try to pinpoint it on the other side we can see here is a branch that we once pruned in the past this branch would have been offering more support more leaves more fruit and also shading this understory of the of this Meyer lemon what we're gonna do today and we've already done this about a year ago now but we can continue again today with taking our brush and simply recoding not prune branch we're also coating the entire stem as well the goal is is to keep the stems cool from the risk of sunburn there's risk pretty much on all fruit trees all nut trees all ornamentals roses and shrubs could benefit from being whitewashed and if you go to the ivy organics comm website you can find some PDFs which talk about the university studies to substantiate the benefits of protecting your trees at the time of installation as well as management has the plants get older especially around times of pruning so you can see we're now cooling this entire structure from overexposure of too much Sun whether it be summer sun or also known as winter Sun scald at the other extreme of the year we're gonna carefully continue this brushing on process down the rest of the tree let me now share with you the whitewashed product if you go back to where we started so again the differences between the products if you open your can of the yellow product you're going to find that base that exists as well as those seven natural garden oils that are bubble wrapped if we take off the bubbles you can see here's your vial with the oils that are in there the seven natural garden oils the difference between this and now your blue label we open up the blue label you're gonna see that it comes with your bag of powder but what the blue label also includes instead of the oil as you can see there's no oil in here but what it has instead is it has the added active ingredients of garlic powder and cinnamon powder so within this bag you've also still got some protection from some pests as well with the benefits of garlic and cinnamon but the product is being sold as a whitewash protection against damaging Summer Sun burn and winter Sun scald a Prada they can be used again as a brush on as well as a foliar spray as well as a tree paste depending on how much water you add to the product I want to show these brochures with you as well and there's a lot of PDF so you can now find those well at Highbury organics com if you come in a little closer when we open it up here these here are our banners that will typically find a conventions and Expos that we attend the first one being over here you can see that the ivory gimmicks has a protection from sun block protection or a sunscreen protection protection against summer sunburn winter Sun it's called premature blooms functions as an anti transparent I'm a time of planting there could be value with that prune trees and plants palm as an insect repellant on your prune trees as we just discussed with the exposed surfaces you can walk might wanna see all those damaged bark bulbs by coating them and also protect them from insects as well as rodents and then over here with the rodent repellent protection you've got protection from girdling trees there's your bulbs again and all of these function as a time-release our protection as well we just talked about these two products and this here is the ready to use spray when you install a plant or if you expect a heat wave that's gonna stress out your plants um not that we're concerned about these now very well established plants but on our new tender growth and I don't really see much behind me that's um that's a new growth within the last month but I could otherwise spray it I'm just doing this for demonstration purposes if you come in a little closer I can even spray the fruit and now I've created basically an organic sunblock spray as you can see with the light film that's accumulating over here but it's doing that same thing on the entire leaf and throughout that entire area that I've sprayed now with the I of organics protection from the extreme summer heat as well as this product having those oils will naturally repel insects and another critters from damaging those tender young leaves as well so let's talk about feeding now here we are now again in October so we're basically in the middle of fall approaching winter and before I explain this lesson there is a lesson we learned from Tom Tom Spellman at a lecture I attended earlier this year who works with Dave Wilson nursery which is one of the largest distributor of bare-root fruit trees in this country what he said is the feeding cycle of trees is analogous to the 24-hour day for the person when you wake up many of us skip breakfast but it's recommended that you have some food so you basically eat something for breakfast so you're not starving before lunch for lunchtime a lot of the medical professionals will recommend that you have as much as you can to eat not as much but it's supposed to be the main meal for the day is your lunch meal with dinner being again a sensible light dinner before you go to sleep and basically hibernate for I'm gonna call nighttime in your sleeping time winter similarly when you wake up that's spring for the planet you've got to feed your plants something to make sure all of the elements and minerals and nutrients are there for the plant so that the plants can achieve maximum success as you can see with these trees behind me so in this spring you feed your plants but you feed them lightly in the summer that's the plants lunch make it big follow the directions and give them basically the maximum recommended dose of fertilizer and again make sure you're doing things all organically when you go to feed your plants the plants in summertime are at their maximum metabolism rate and thereby by giving them all of these nutrients and fertilizers they're basically going to consume them quickly and readily again I recommend using using a granular over a liquid as it's going to be available to the plants much longer than a liquid feed unless you've got the time in the energy to keep on applying these liquid feeds and one other lesson when it comes to feeding in plants is by using multiple different types of organic fertilizers you're gonna be able to get more minerals and nutrients to the plants than maybe just one brand with those specific ingredients that are in there so consider also crossing some organic fertilizers as well into your garden so now we talked about a spring being light summer being a heavier feed fall being again a lighter your dinner a lighter meal for your plants and then winter you do nothing you do not feed your plants in the winter for those of us here in Southern California you can follow this schedule but for those of you that are living in more cooler climates such as New Jersey New York and even northern parts of California Oregon and Washington it may be too cold right now out of your organic fertilizer to the soil your soil biology is going into dormancy and it is not going to be able to metabolize those organic fertilizers into the elements and the fuel to ultimately feed the plants and again you don't want your plants growing and performing prematurely as well if I go and I feed my plants that's gonna push another flush of growth and again if we're gonna have like freezing temperatures or really harsh weather coming up or winter temperatures you're not gonna want them to be performing anymore you're gonna want them to harden and get strong for the winter and then get ready for a good spring summer and fall here's a chart just to summarize exactly what I just said when it comes to fertilizing or feeding your plants by season and the winter starts you know basically slow to nothing and spring you're gonna want to warm up in the summer that's gonna be a maximum amount of food so follow your labels and give them the most typically in the fall in the spring I'm giving much less than the recommended dose and here's winter for those of you again in other parts of the country you might not be feeding at all come fall maybe all of your feet is just going to be spring and summer and then just let your plants go into dormancy fall through winter but over here we're gonna be feeding our plants and I've got blow me on some organic fertilizers that we're gonna talk about what I've brought over here is a product made by ants Poma another one by Miracle Gro that's organic as well here's another one made by EB Stone a third one here made by eco scraps and then I've got a couple of chemical fertilizers the difference between and I'm gonna put this line here to separate the good from the chemical is that the good fertilizers basically are made out of blood meal and bone meal and feather meal and if you take a look at the directions or the derived from that are on all of these labels you'll see that to derive from organic sources if you take a look at these you're gonna see that they're made by chemical sources such as this you can see it's like a glow-in-the-dark read that's not made out of blood and bones and and feathers this is a chemically derived um source and the reason I've got miracle-gro over here and real grow over here is miracle-gro also has an organic line of fertilizers that you can also find in your garden centers but we're gonna try to do is do something that's pretty balanced here you here is basically a nice balanced five five five meaning five percent nitrogen five percent phosphorous five percent potassium here's another one made by a smaller exponent specific for citrus and the percentage is on here if you take a look a little smaller is a five to six so five percent nitrogen two percent phosphorus six percent potassium um we can use like I said a combination of fertilizers to basically get the maximum amount of nutrients and from more sources to maximize on the elements that are available to your plants what we're going to do when feeding the plants have been coming down to the under canopy of the plant what we're going to do here is we're going to lightly feed I'm just going to take my hands on one of these fertilizers I'll start off with the Eco scraps and again I can put a couple layers and keep in mind based on that chart I'm not following the directions if the directions reading this is without reading it if it says you know one cup per foot you know a plant height I'm basically going to cut that down to about a fraction whether it be 1/4 or even 1/2 of the recommended amount being we're right into the middle of fall and we're just going to want to make sure that we've got the elements in to the ground and the plants are gonna absorb it and basically maximize its output come spring of next year what we're gonna do is just scatter some of this fertilizer around the root zone of the tree so I probably you know just put a couple of handfuls and again no big deal if you even want to mix it and again the purpose of using a granular fertilizer is this is going to break down over the next two to three months this will feed the earthworms that are in the ground this here is gonna feed the beneficial bacteria the beneficial nematodes the beneficial fungus and all of the good things that live here in the soil I want to point out another thing too you can see naturally is a lot of leaves that are coming down to the ground this is fantastic news as these leaves are going to come down it's part of the decay process and that's also enriching the soil what we're gonna do next is we're gonna add a few handfuls of compost by doing this we're also going to be further enriching the top layer in the topsoil we're just gonna add about an eighth of an inch to a quarter of an inch this here is gonna further activate those organic fertilizers and enrich and improve the soil condition so we're just gonna toss that in like so and you can see I haven't made a thick layer you've got to be very cautious and keep in mind that that top 18 inches of soil is where 90% of the life of the tree is that's where most of the soil biology is that's where most of the air roots are that's where most of the roots are grabbing all the nutrients minerals that it needs for success what we're gonna do once we've done just that we've added the fertilizer and some compost to the soil we're just gonna mix that top quarter inch of soil eighth of an inch of soil gonna be very careful not to disrupt the surface root and we're just gonna mix that and level it out like so and the last thing we're gonna do we're gonna help retain moisture by adding some more widgets to the base as well we're gonna do that all around the tree and the goal is to add about a two to four inch layer of woodchips we're being very careful not to make sure these woodchips come in contact with the bark if it does the wood chips are gonna absorb moisture that moisture is going to translate into the stem and cause stem rot to your tree so make sure you stay about 2 to 4 inches away from the stem of the tree and here's the cool thing we're gonna take those branches that we pruned earlier today and we're gonna recycle these as well all of the minerals and elements that went into creating these branches it's going right back into the soil biology and getting some work its way right into those trees as well let's enjoy them let's enjoy that scent one more time before we recycle it once that's done your last and final step is water make sure when you're watering you soak the area but watering your plants you activate all the fertilizers you activate all the life that's in your soil and the biology begins with water when watering and I'm talking about specifically here in the Los Angeles and Southern California area on average when it comes to your citrus trees and most trees in general you're gonna want to water them and not water them again until the soil is dry but never bone-dry that's like the general principle to accomplish this on average for your in-ground plantings that would be in the spring and fall on average waterings deep water ones are talking about watering the entire root ball this can take several minutes - so not just the top inch of soil but all of the feet that surround that root ball you don't want to get two to three feet deep with your soaking you can see the water is now starting to accumulate around the tree the tree base but in the spring and fall that would translate to here in Southern California to being watering once a week to once every other week spring and fall again summer time could be once a week and maybe as much as two waterings per week depending on the severity of you know of the temperatures if you have a hundred degree days that may justify to waterings in the same week in the winter just follow your climate if it's not raining that month you may need a water one time that month I'm just not going to finish the watering over here [Music] so we're gonna repeat these steps of feeding and composting and mulching around each of these individual Meyer lemon trees if you let's do a quick comparison between these two fruit if you're coming a little closer you can see here that I've got on this side of my knife two of the Meyer lemons and if I on this side of the knife are two Yurika lemons coming a little closer so you can see the textures of the two of them and then I'm gonna cut them also in half I'll go with the one that's a little more yellow so you can see what this looks like so you can see what the inside of that looks like compared to let's do now the Meyer lemon and what you're gonna notice right off the bat aside from the difference in color you'll notice that the Eureka lemon for one is more yellow the Meyer lemon is more yellow orange ish and I'll explain to in a minute and secondly the Eureka lemon as well as the Lisbon lemon has a thicker rind the Meyer lemon very very thin and when it comes to juice it's significantly more juicy check out all of that juice that's coming out compared to now I'll do the this one here looks a little less seedy on that side but here's the Eureka lemon also juicy but I would say it's about 1/3 maybe 1/2 the juice content that came out of that Meyer lemon and again on a 100 degree day that's awesome when it comes to these two lemons the Eureka lemon is the traditional store-bought lemon the Meyer lemon on the other hand is a cross most research and scientists believe that the cross between the mandarin orange so imagine the sweetness of that orange into a lemon and that's what you get with the Meyer lemon so if you're looking for something sweet which is great for your salad dressings it's great if your goal is lemonade and it's creating a variety of things including marinades in fact there's a grower I've learned about in Beverly Hills just about seven miles away from where we're situated that has about an acre into a half an acre of land where he's planted rows and rows and rows of these Meyer lemons and Meyer lemons it's another reason why I should have these in new gardens and even if you're anywhere throughout the world including my friend al who's in Canton freezing Illinois in the winter where he's bringing his citrus pots indoors for the winter he too is enjoying fruits such as these Meyer lemons indoors where he protects them from you know in the winter from the winter freeze and brings them out come spring summer and fall to enjoy these lemons he otherwise cannot find at the stores and the grower in Beverly Hills is growing and supplying to all the local stores and restaurants in the area because again you can't find them and if you're looking for something like this they just don't transport well being that their skin is so thin so there's a high demand for the Meyer lemons and if you're looking for that sweet lemon in your garden seriously consider the Meyer lemon tree for your garden so I'm here with Isabel who's going to be doing the conclusion for us I hope you enjoy this educational mo of 5e

and then this is a ruby red grapefruit that he grew from seed I'm holding one of the lemons off of this tree put it in the shade it is a funny-looking lemon but it has the most amazing aroma and flavor people think that you can't grow trees from seeds successfully and have them turn into something good and they really don't know what they're talking about you're not going to exactly get a navel or a Valencia or a Meyer or whatever you planted but you will almost always get something really good Bruce how long did it go did you plant these this is probably six years old Wow six years old that's a heck of a tree under irrigation okay were these all seed grown trees here no this was a store bought this Valencia that one back there was a store-bought but it died okay and then this one here was the school Balaji was two trees growing together I thought was kind of neat that they had the lemon Hannah lemonade Key Lime yes and then the one in the back corner is the tangerine tangerine grown from the seed everything else has been grown from seed this is a beautiful-looking tangerine look at the beautiful leaf growth on this very small Lancie oullette leaves and it's in bloom how long would you say it took before it made any fruit this is the second year last year was the first year and it didn't make a whole lot of fruit some along the top edges this is the second year and a lot more bloom it looks like it's really going to do it I know some sub trees will take 8 to 10 years before they start setting any fruit I've had a Kalamunda and fruit in three years and I've had a key lime fruit in about three years but some of the bigger ones like grapefruits are supposed to take a lot longer yeah these two are probably close to eight years because I bought them first and then I started growing the others by seeing the ones my seed actually overtook them I love this strength I think when they haven't been grafted and they get those roots down into the ground like that they're unstoppable and a girl these from seeds I don't the problem is I don't remember what they were this is a lemon I think I have a navel orange and it might be - navel orange trees I'm thinking assistant in this one and I think that's another tangerine there I love the patience of growing things from seed that shows character what was really neat this to watch yeah and it's exciting to see when when this thing is actually gonna fruit you know last year there was just a couple of blossoms I think on this one but it's still kind of young what to think of those who want to step back all of your all of your trees a start from seed a much much stronger larger tree yeah for the for the ages you're saying very strong actually took over they pass their past of course this is that wild Ric that took that's what they told me of whatever it was grafted on took over and grew up but might like that grapefruit one we're coming out with see me afternoon yeah well the bees are out yep so the ruby red grapefruit is that fruited yet yes are they got to last year only had a couple of blossoms not a whole lot of blossoms this year but it's still pretty young actually oh that's a heck of a tree I mean it's it's a good fifteen sixteen foot and it's very heavy thick and heavy please don't look real good some great trunk matter of fact they they all look much better like the lemon tree down there that's that's half lemon half a key line if you look at it maybe it doesn't do near as good as these foliage wives don't let's not only more there was a few more look inside but this tree really hasn't produced yet but I'd like I said I did get two grapefruit off and they were good so I know it can do it how much did they look like the the mother grapefruit I mean did were they very similar to them a little bit smaller okay and like I said there's only two on the whole tree last year so I may come out better this year Wow yeah it really is I love the smell of the grapefruit foliage too instead it might have been 50 or a hundred maybe blossom peaches not a lot on the tree that size it's just getting going and grapefruit grapefruit it's a long time it could be a decade before good product production starts to kick in some really I was hoping for a real good cover of it this year but I think we'll have you know maybe 20 on there next time well we're looking for things to get really tough yeah real tough so as our week yeah good thinking you", "81BqH6l6cHw": "today I'm sharing how to make homemade citrus scented vinegar three different ways hi sweet friends my name is Mary and welcome to Mary's nest this channel is all about living the simple life by cooking from scratch making home remedies and creating a cozy home with charming thrift store finds so if you're like me and you like living the simple life be sure to subscribe to my channel and click on the little notification bell below that'll let you know every time I upload a new video well I love making homemade vinegar and for years I would just make it with Apple scraps and make the traditional apple cider vinegar but then I learned from my friend Heidi over at rain country homestead how to make vinegar out of pretty much anything and it's so wonderful because you never have to throw anything out even if it's at a point where you can't really do much with it make vinegar with it and then I have another friend named Alicia who has the YouTube channel moat cottage and she showed a very interesting way to make scented homemade vinegar and I'm gonna give it a try today now the scented vinegars that I'm making today are all going to be citrus based but you really can do this with pretty much any fruit or vegetable and even plants and herbs and flowers it's really endless but citrus is nice this time of year because it's in season and we have lots of it here in Texas I can buy a big 10-pound bag of oranges for 4 or 5 dollars so we wind up having an eating a lot of citrus but in any event what I did was whenever we ate oranges and we peeled them I would just have a jar in the fridge and I'd throw the peels right in there and after the jar would get to be about half or two-thirds full I would get ready to make vinegar with it and it couldn't be easier all you need to do is they had a quarter cup of sugar that's it and then cover it with water and you just want to go up about maybe three-quarters of the way you don't want to go right to the rim because this will bubble and ferment and it will rise up a little higher so I usually just kind of play it by ear but that's good yeah leaving about two inches or so from the rim here and the next thing you want to do is find something to stir it with I love using these chopsticks it makes it very easy and I know a number of you who've seen me make vinegar in other videos have asked me where did I get such a long wooden chopsticks and to be honest with you we've just had them for years but I did find them on Amazon so I'll put a link below if you want to investigate and learn more about them and so all you do is just stir this around a bit pushing it down just helping the sugar dissolve nothing fancy and that's it and then the next thing you do is just take a coffee filter or a little piece of clean cloth that you might have and take a little rubberband or some string and just put it on like this and what's going to happen over the next few days is this is going to start to ferment the sugar that we added plus the sugar in the in a little bit of fruit that's on the rinds oh that's over you all know Ovie's she's marketing and as I was saying the bacteria will feed on the sugar and it'll start to ferment and it'll start to bubble up and you'll begin to make vinegar and what you'll want to do is every day for about 30 days or so you're going to want to just stir things around a little and as it bubbles up you'll find that maybe after the fourth or fifth day it's just really calmed down a bit and at that point I'll often add another quarter cup of sugar to give it the bacteria a little more to eat another boost and I find that that's the perfect ratio you might be wondering why I don't just add a half a cup of sugar right in the beginning I've tried that but it doesn't work as well it actually just becomes kind of a sweet syrupy mess and doesn't seem to want to ferment oh my goodness Oh bees having such a day I think I'm gonna have to go give her a treat well Oh bees very happy I gave her a kale salmon and tumeric treat and then you just put this let it breathe stir it every day and then after about 30 days or so you can check it now your nose is going to be able to tell you if it's starting to smell like vinegar you'll still smell the citrus aroma but you'll also smell a vinegary aroma and if you want to be doubly sure that it's ready to be vinegar you can use these little strips that are sold you can find them you know sometimes at the drugstore in the pharmacy section or they also have them on Amazon I'll put a link below in case you're looking for them and all I do is just take a little piece like this and you're gonna dip it into your vinegar mixture and if it's like under for 44.5 it's pretty acidic I actually like to go all the ways 23.0 and then you can use this then you'll want to strain out the solids and then decant the vinegar and you can use it for salad dressings you can use it for cleaning you can use it for hair rinse whatever you want I don't recommend it for canning though if you're going to can you're going to want to use the vinegar from the store because you'll that vinegar is exact in terms of its acidity and when you're canning you need to know exactly what the acidity level is so that's making homemade citrus scented vinegar with just the orange peels and so I'm going to put this to the side now and the next we're going to talk about is making a centrist citrus scented vinegar with the actual fruit and again if you want it you know you can use any fruit but since citrus is in season I'm doing it with citrus and the reason that I picked these particular oranges to use I had some that just were starting to really dry out you had so many oranges and you know you can see it's kind of whole misshapen at all but they're not moldy or anything just kind of really dried out and so what I did was and I'll just move this out of the way so you can see I just take the orange and really just cut it anyway it's not it's not an exact science but I like to cut each half into six pieces just way that way is just some you know room for it to really to let the bacteria really get all those juices to start to ferment and then again I'm just gonna do the same thing I add this is sort of like you know yes there's fruit and the sugar and all of that but this is the insurance policy it really does help and then the next thing we're gonna do is just like with the peels we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna add water you know like I said about three quarters of the way we leave about two inches or so from the rim because it will start to bubble up as it ferments then we just take our chopstick or whatever you use to stir and get in there get that sugar mixed then we're going to take another coffee filter we're gonna put that lid on put the rubber band on again if you want to use cloth you certainly can and then every day for 30 days take this off just give it a good stir after a couple of days you know three or four days four or five days it really varies if you notice that it started to ferment and become bubbly and then is coming down at another quarter cup of sugar give it a good stir and then that's that just keep stirring it every day for another 30 days at 30 days check it with your pH strip or just check it with your nose if it smells vinegary give it a little taste if it's good then you like it then it's fine so now we'll put this aside and I'll show you the third way to make a citrus scented vinegar that's really easy oh and I just wanted to add as with the peels once it reaches the point of being a vinegar that you like you're just going to strain out the solids and add them you know to whatever you want the compost pile or whatever you're gonna strain out the solids and then decant your vinegar in whatever type of glass container you want to keep it in and when you decant it into your container after you've strained out the solids you'll just want to put some kind of lid on it like that and that can just be stored in your pantry at room temperature you don't need to put this in the fridge now this third way of making citrus scented vinegar is what I saw Alysia do over at mote cottage and I will link in the iCard Zand then there's in the description below folks are heidi's channel and Alicia's channel so you can see how they make vinegar now this is technically a homemade citrus scented vinegar but it's not homemade vinegar like the other two this is starting with distilled white vinegar now in here I've got mandarin oranges and the the peels from them and all we do is just pour the vinegar into this jar with the peels and we let it sit for 30 days or so and the vinegar will take on the citrus smell so even though you're starting with real vinegar and this is just a distilled white vinegar over time it's going to take on a lovely citrus smell and it'll be terrific for salad dressings or cleaning it'll be just delightful for cleaning if you like citrus scented cleaning products so we'll just go ahead and pour this vinegar right over the top of these peels and then we'll put a lid on and set it aside for about 30 days and we can just go right up to the rim is fine in this case and there you have it three homemade citrus scented vinegars if you'd like more information about making homemade vinegar be sure to subscribe to my channel and then click on this video over here where I show you how to make vinegar from strawberry scraps and I'll see you over there in my Texas Hill Country kitchen love and God bless", "NMt2sp5ugIQ": "if life give you lemons what if life gives you lemons why not grill them and make grilled lemonade you're burned already might as well make it tasty so i'm gonna do just that i'm gonna be making a unique and delicious haha life i'm grilling you and making you into lemonade so we have a cup of cane sugar just regular cane sugar and then i have sliced about five lemons in half and taken the seeds out the first step in this recipe is super simple we want to get a grill or a grill pan super hot you really want your pan to be almost smoking hot and we're going to take our lemons and we're going to coat them in sugar so i'm going to take my lemon and just dip it get it real good and coated with sugar on the outside i'm gonna place this right on the grill grill does lemon so i'm gonna dip keep on dipping and grilling until the outside of these lemons gets nice and caramelized you want that caramelized brown color i love lemonade especially pregnant this has been one of the things i've craved consistently is lemonade there's something about like the tartness of the lemon and the sweet and it's just so satisfying so i'm really pumped about this recipe make sure you give a good press down on your lemons caramelized lemons delicious so the beautiful thing that is happening to these lemons is we're caramelizing the sugars in the fruit and also the actual sugar that's on the outside of these lemons so the heat is allowing the juiciness of the lemon to come out it's creating this beautiful caramel crust so when we go to put it into our lemonade the taste is almost like a brown sugar eliminator like a little bit of a burnt sugar and you'll know these are getting ready to be used for our lemonade when we're starting to see these beautiful caramel juices happening in the pan okay so this one is looking good it's got those nice ground caramelization marks so once your lemons are ready to go i'm going to put them back in my bowl and then we're going to squeeze them all out at the end i'm going to keep on dipping so i loved selling things as a kid i feel like i was probably an entrepreneur at a young age and i definitely had a lemonade stand i was not creative enough to think about making grilled lemonade which if your kids have a lemonade stand this is going to bring all the people to your yard this grilled lemonade is going to be awesome it's going to be a big hit while these last lemons are grilling i'm going to take my cane sugar i'm going to pour it into about four cups of water that i have in my pitcher i'm going to go ahead and stir this together so it can start dissolving and even the sugar is going to have a little bit of that lemony flavor already in it from me dipping the lemons in there all right peeps that's a good one we're good on these they're looking gorgeous they're looking grilled they're looking fantastic perfect okay so i've taken my grill pan off the heat it needs to cool for a bit and then we're going to clean it because i want to do a really pretty grilled lemon slice on the edge of the glass and if i were to put the lemon slices in right now they would just turn black all the lemon juices and the burnt sugar wouldn't be your best bet on that so we're going to let it cool we're going to clean it re-oil it and then we're going to grill those in a second but while my pan is cooling i'm going to go and juice these lemons for the lemonade so we have our pitcher of water with our cane sugar that's lightly dissolved in here and now we're going to do the fun part we're going to squeeze these grilled lemons into our water so i'm just going to take a lemon as so and just lightly squeeze it over the spine mesh sieve the sieve is going to catch all of those kind of big kind of caramelized bits and just allow the yummy caramelized juice to come through so we're just going to do this with all of our lemons the color of this lemonade is going to be darker than a traditional lemonade because we have that caramelization and that grilling that's happened on the outside so if this looks a little bit like an iced tea color that's totally normal actually makes it really delicious because you're getting that caramelized sugar okay y'all our final lemon this smells so good it smells like a like a lightly sugared lemon combined with like a little bit of caramel sugar smells good all right so our lemonade is ready to go i'm going to push these final juices through our sieve because they're too tasty to waste and i'm going to stir this together until our sugar dissolves and then while this is setting i'm actually going to wait to add my ice right until i serve it and i'm going to bring our pan back out and we're going to grill those lemon slices for the garnish all right so we have our lemonade all ready to go the sugar is dissolved and now it is time to make our pretty garnish so we are going to grill some lemon slices our pan is cleaned and lightly oiled so we're just going to put these right here on the grill sizzle love it so we're going to grill these until they get those pretty grill marks on each side of our lemon slice and then the extra ones that we don't use for garnish we can actually put into the lemonade it's gonna give a little visual cue of the fact that this is grilled lemonade this isn't just any old lemonade which makes it extra fantastic so we're gonna flip this guy i'm gonna grill the rest of our lemon slices if you're really wanting to impress your customers at your lemonade stand you can garnish each drink with a grilled lemon pay attention kids it's the extra touches to get people to buy stuff just maybe don't operate a grill without your mom and dad let them do the grilling you can do the lemonade part all right so i'm gonna let these lemons cool really quickly and i'm gonna get our glasses ready to roam with sugar we have our clean glass ready to go and we're going to rim this with some cane sugar so i'm just going to plop this right into our corn syrup just like that corn syrup is perfect for  glasses it keeps the sugar right there neatly on the rim do a quick little dab in our sugar perfect it looks so good i'm gonna add our ice to our lemonade you can add as much ice as you want i'm putting about four cups in here but it's totally to your preference all right so i'm gonna give this lemonade a quick stir so we're gonna pour our lemonade in the glass oh this looks so pretty caramelized sugar fresh squeezed lemon juice i'm gonna put our grilled lemon slice right here on our rim final touch green straw summery straw and i'm going to add the rest of these grilled lemons into our grilled lemonade just for that visual touch this is such a fun idea for your outdoor parties for summertime and it is definitely an upgrade for your lemonade stand [Music] yum that is delicious and so refreshing i want to see a pretty picture of your grilled lemonade just tag pop kitchen on instagram and comment below i want to know what you want to see me make next", "KH5E4zqmoKo": "hey everyone welcome to my food painting series I will be showing you guys how to paint three different food paintings but I also will be doing a giveaway on these original paintings by me and on this startup painting kit including brushes a mixing palette acrylic paint and canvasses so if you guys want to win them then don't forget to follow the rules that are on the bottom of this video so I will be breaking this tutorial up into three parts for this video I'm going to show you how to paint a lime so if you guys are interested in the other tutorials as well I will link them towards the end of this video so let's begin let's start with the materials first you will need a wide variety of croolik paint for this tutorial you will need white yellow and green you will also need paint brushes but you will also need something to mix your paint and a cup of water to clean your paintbrushes finally you will need some canvases I'm using 20 by 20 centimeters but you can use any size you prefer once you have all your supplies and you are ready to paint what we are going to do now is drawing a curve unto the canvas for this step I used a plate that I placed at the upper right corner of the canvas then draw a second line below the line you just created at about 5:00 or so millimeter if you have that draw a third line below the second line these are going to be our guidelines for the skin if you have that mark the center of your fruit you can use the plate as your guidance but it doesn't have to be super accurate then we are going to draw in the segments of the lime the line has nine segments so what you want to do now is divide the inside into nine sections starting from the center if you have that draw round edges at each corner of these segments after that we can actually go ahead and start painting take some dark green paint and with a small brush line out the outer curve of the lime this is going to be the rind of the lime as you can see here then take some white paint and mix it with a little bit of green to get a light green color since there are about three different colors underneath the skin that are blended into each other I went ahead and painted another curve with this light green and blend it into the dark green paint to create a soft transition between them because the third layer of the lime is a bit more yellow I went ahead and mix the yellow paint with my green and white paint then I just added this color on top of the light green paint and just painted on and colored in the last curve now you should have a nice transition between the green skin and the different color layers off the rind now we can go ahead and paint the inside of the lime for this step you want to mix a bright green color that is slightly yellow I used some green yellow and white color for this my green turned out a bit too green a thing but if you would like to make it more yellow just add a little bit more yellow to the mixture once you're happy with the color go ahead and start painting the food segments when you do so leave a little bit of space in between each segment so you see the guidelines you drew on in the beginning to make the canvas look better I kept painting on the edges of the canvas as well so you don't have a sudden break in the fruit and it just looks nicer I think if you paint it in all segments we can now go ahead and paint on the fruit pulp for this step take a little bit of foil and crumple it up to get an uneven surface we will use this as a stamp for the pulp but this step dab the foil into some white acrylic paint and remove the excess paint by dabbing it onto your mixing palette and then just start dabbing the foil onto the lime segments but avoid the rind of the this where we get an uneven and reflecting surface for the line pulp if you want to make it more green a yellow just add a little bit of yellow to the white paint so it looks a bit more realistic but don't forget this is all about having fun and relaxing while painting so don't be so harsh on yourself if your color or brushstroke is not as perfect as you wish keep dabbing the photo stamp onto each segment until you cover the whole lime segments if you have that you can finally add the outlines of the segments by using a thin brush and white acrylic paint leave your painting drying until it's completely dry and then we can seal the painting with some glue I use Mod Podge but you can also use any other clear liquid cool you have this way we can create a shiny surface to make it look more juicy and fresh looking to add more texture to the surface itself I try to apply the glue with a dabbing motion to create an uneven surface except for the outline segments for this part I apply the glue evenly to make the surface flat compared to the segments now let everything dry and your line painting is finished don't forget this painting is part of a set of three paintings so if you would like to challenge yourself and create the other paintings don't forget to check out the other tutorials that are links below and at the end of this video and also if you are going to be making these please tag me so I can find and like your

making honey citrus chicken it's one of my favorite ways to make chicken it is so irresistibly delicious so it's a start I'm going to start by making a marinade I have some orange juice in a bowl to that I'm adding some honey garlic paste onion powder olive oil salt in some black pepper and I'm gonna mix this together very well and set it aside I have some bone-in skin-on chicken thighs that is very well cleaned and I made couple of cuts on them to help soak in the marinade very well so I'm going to pour the marinade all over the chicken next you want to get your hands dirty and move the chicken around to get the marinade all over them I sliced up a fresh orange and I'm going to tuck this in between and under the chicken to give it that citrus flavor next I'm adding some fresh herbs I'm using fresh thyme on some fresh rosemary and I'm gonna sprinkle some paprika on the chicken to give it some extra flavor and also some color and add a little bit of salt and pepper to taste next I'm going to cover this up and let it sit in the fridge for at least six hours to marinate very well after six hours I'll take this out and drizzle a little bit of olive oil over it and let it bake in a 400 degree oven for about an hour and I'll show you what it looks like when it's done and this is what it looks like when it's done baking it has very good flavor and really good color I like to add some freshly chopped parsley and some of that delicious juice to it and it's ready to serve thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed spending time with me don't forget to subscribe to my channel I'll see you in my next video bye", "Vgy5NQolgr0": "hi I'm Cathy Thomas having citrus slices frozen in the freezer can add pizzazz to summer drinks cut the citrus into thin slices and then placed on a plate that's been lying with wax paper freeze them once frozen transfer to a plastic bag", "ZxiGySiClNo": "we had so much amazing citrus this year um what a blessing we didn't get oranges but we got lots and lots of lemons and zetsumas and i will use them all up minus the ones we gave away this is part one of the how to preserve citrus series let's get going [Music] some are peeled most are still left but it's progress so what we need to do we need to peel and then get all this white pithy stuff off and really thoroughly because that what makes them bitter when they're canned up and then we'll break them apart in pieces and then we're ready to pack them in jars hours later i went from the big pile to finally this there's that much of that pith stuff coming off looks like chase it's kind of pretty actually um they're pretty good now i may i'm gonna call it quits for now but i made tomorrow there are a few that have uh seats and i'll just snip it with scissors and then press the seats out uh a lot of people cut them and then peel them this too is way too much work for me i mean i would take dice to finish all the many pounds i have so that's not gonna happen um the ones that you buy in the store the mandarins in the in the can they have been obviously they don't sit there peeling that stuff off they actually dip them in an asset and it dissolves the skin and everything around that's why they're just flash i don't even want to eat those i think that's a gross process so we'll eat them with the skin it's healthy and they still be fabulous to eat i will also pack some lemons in the jars with the satsumas them tangerines and to prepare them i'll just cut around there like this and then just slice it up in pieces there's no big pith peeling for me on those they just go in as are see once they're cut in half and you get this center pith part out they kind of come apart in slices quite nicely now these are mere lemons honestly i don't know if that works with the regular store lemons too everything is set up we have the setzumas i have those tiny little things that are a little sour and i'll also put some lemon slices in it get the lids uh i'm not making a syrup you can candies in just water a light syrup a super light syrup a medium syrup i'm just going to put probably i have pine tarts probably a little short of a teaspoon of sugar directly in the chart that works fine and i'll also add just a tiny tad little bit of salt you need something to wipe your top before the utensils the ladle to get the hot water on the char thingy and my plastic thing to get the bubbles out of course i have jars i want to do a round of the pints and then if there's something left over i'll do the half pints because they are the perfect snack size the perfect dessert size i'm using tattler lids those are the plastic lids that come with the rubber bands they are reusable i'm loving my tattlers i never ran out of lids then i need a pot of hot water to fill up the jars and i'm using the pressure canner pot but that's i won't be pressure canning it it's a water bath i'm just using this because my stock pot isn't quite tall enough in case i want to put a couple quarts in it as well which i may do later with the lemons so i store my jars with the lid on that cleaned always and with the lid on that way i don't have 30 chars and i'm not going into sterilizing jars i know there are some gasps out there what i do which may be a little horrible for some people i take them and put them in the microwave and i just notice the eggshells are in here we microwave them so we can crush them and give them back to the chickens so i put all my chars in here to warm them up because i don't want to shock them obviously and then the bottom falls out they all go in here it goes on for a minute and then maybe another 30 seconds while i walk off i don't want to be around the microwave this and the eggshells is the only thing we use it for and i've been doing this for 13 or so years i never had a jar failure because of it and it's so convenient it's right above the stove i don't have to handle wet jars or start up an oven to heat them up this works fine so one word on the tablets they have to boil um the regular lids they don't even recommend boiling anymore you just put them in some warm water to get them warmed up but the tattlers have to boil i usually let them boil for a good 10 minutes and that way the rubber is soft and the cap has expanded whatever it does and also with the tattlers on water bath i do not take all the chars out and fill them up all at once i do a char at the time so that when that lid is hot it goes on and then straight under the water in the canner and that way they don't cool off ready to go the lids have been boiling i'll shut this down a little bit now this is the water to top it off that's just at a bare simmer right now and the water where the jars go in is getting pretty warm too i keep the lid on this now it's time to jar up the jar is heated now i'm adding some tangerines and then two or three of the lemon slices and some of these little cutie sour cutie things and some more tangerines i'll pack it down a little and then top it with a ladle of water if you're new to canning this is what you want to can because it's just about the simplest thing you can do some sugar a little bit of salt some more water this requires no preheating of the you can't do a hot pack where you warm it up first but it's not necessary so that makes coordinating everything a whole lot easier now we need to get the bubbles out you take some plastic or wood don't use metal it can ruin the jars you get the water out and right here is the one inch mark i might put just a little bit more in it because they may have some air in them here we go then we wipe the rim of the jar which may not even be necessary in this case now i need to go fish out a lid with the band with the rubber thing i meant and then on the tattlers they basically screw on the same as the regular lids you just when it starts catching it that's how you do it now some people put vinegar in their water if they have hard water so it doesn't get that cloudy film on the outside after they come out i choose not to do that anymore because i don't know if you can see this it really does a number on the bands they start corroding over time so what i do once they're out because i wash all the jars anyway when they come out of the canner once they're cooled off i'll just put some water and some vinegar in the water and then they are nice and crystal clear either way so let me get ready to put this in the canner and then i have quite a few more to do here we go last one going in the pot and lid on and as soon as he comes to a boil i'll set the timer for 10 minutes and while i'm getting ready for the next bed let's take a peek in the pot it's not quite there yet i want it on a little more rolling boil but it's it's getting there so when it's like this don't start your timer yet wait another couple minutes fog this is good enough for me i'll set the timer so could you have juiced all these fruits and then canned it yes of course this is orange juice and this is lemon juice but there are a couple things to know for one it'll settle over time the lemon juice is from two years ago let me shake this up and you see how brown it is that's because it oxidizes when it sits too long it tastes exactly the same as fresh canned one it just doesn't look as appealing the orange juice is from last year it still has the yellow the lemon goes oxidizes quicker than the orange but yes you can juice that up there's nothing wrong with it don't freak out even if it saddles it's really really good and a great way to preserve it too if you don't have freezer space 10 minutes are up time to shut the gas off and then we'll just wait until the bubbling stops we'll let it sit like that it needs to sit for a little bit and now we'll start taking them out so the water is fairly still now it's time to take them out when you take out jars with tattler lids you want to take them out don't tip them to get any of the water off or anything just like with other jars and then you hold them and tighten them up you want they need to be tightened once they come out and then they'll be good to go now i'm left with all this now that's a couple pieces of fruit and a whole lot of liquid and the liquid is not water this is truly liquid that came out of the lemons and the tangerines i'm going to candid up to add a little bit more sugar to it and it'll be a perfect citrus lemonade the aftermath while the last pot is going after this is out and they cool down with cracker jar here it is this one didn't seal so that was perfect anyway they turned out quite nice they taste good and he got this little syrupy sauce in it this really this is unchilled i suspect in summer when it comes out of the refrigerator this is a fantastic dessert or just snack for a hankering of citrus yummy well worth it obviously i'm gonna have a lot more to go", "bjtr44QCi78": "In this video I will show you how I successfully rooted\ncitrus rootstock cuttings. Citrus trees are commonly\npropagated by grafting buds from a desired citrus fruit\nvariety called a scion onto another citrus\nvariety called a rootstock. Citrus rootstocks are typically grown from seeds but in some\nsituations it is desirable to grow them from cuttings even though it is much more challenging. For example, in Florida\nhuanglongbing or HLB, the deadliest known citrus\ndisease is widespread and has been killing the rootstock trees that produce the seeds used\nto grow rootstock seedlings. If seeds are not\navailable it can be useful to grow citrus rootstocks from cuttings. I grew the cuttings in a hydroponic growth medium called stonewool. Stonewool is a man-made product created by melting rock and\nspinning it into a fiber. It is similar to natural glass fibers produced by volcanoes called Pele's hair. To avoid the possibility\nof spreading citrus disease with my tools, I sterilize\nthem with chlorine bleach at a concentration of 1.5%. I will be showing six\ndifferent rootstock varieties. I ordered the rootstock\nbudwood from California's Citrus Clonal Protection Program or CCPP. The CCPP exists to provide\npathogen-free citrus cuttings for the propagation of citrus trees. You can click here to learn how to order citrus cuttings from the CCPP. The bacteria that causes HLB disease can be spread easily if\npeople take citrus cuttings from trees not kept in\ninsect-proof screen houses. For this reason, the use\nof registered pathogen-free citrus budwood is now\nmandated in California and is critical to the\nsurvival of not only the citrus industry in California but also the citrus\ntrees in our backyards. Even though the CCPP budwood\nis not ideal for rooting, I used it with success. For each rootstock cutting,\nI cut off the bottom and dipped it in a liquid rooting hormone before placing it in a stonewool cube. The first rootstock\nvariety is Volkamer lemon, it produces a vigorous larged-size tree and is widely graft compatible with many citrus scion varieties. The fruit quality for lemons\nand limes on Volkamer lemon is good but only fair for other varieties such as sweet oranges. The second variety, Yuma Ponderosa lemon, produces vigorous,\nhigh-yielding large trees with good fruit quality\nfor lemons and limes. The third variety, Cuban\nshaddock is believed to be the same variety as the\nYuma Ponderosa lemon. It was once thought to\nbe a dwarfing rootstock but this effect is now\nattributed to citrus viroids that are not present in\ncurrently available cultivars. Fruit quality for lemons and limes is good and acceptable for other varieties such as oranges, grapefruit and pummelos. The fourth variety, Carrizo, produces a large tree if not pruned. For many varieties including\noranges, grapefruits and pummelos it produces fruit varying from good to excellent quality. The fifth variety, C-35\nproduces medium-sized trees about 25% smaller than\nCarrizo and produces good to excellent quality\nfruit for many varieties. The sixth variety, flying\ndragon produces slow-growing, small-sized trees about\n60% smaller than Carrizo and produces good to excellent quality fruit for many varieties. The plants were placed\ninside of a humidity dome with a hydroponic ebb and flow system used to water the plants twice a day. Light was provided by\nT5 fluorescent lights with a timer set for 14\nhours of light per day. The temperature was\ncontrolled by a heat mat, fan and temperature controller with a target temperature\nof 26.7 degrees Celsius or 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Leaf buds on the cuttings began to grow within the first week. Roots took longer to develop. The time-lapse video shows\nabout eight weeks of growth which should be sufficient\nfor the formation of roots. The budwood of Carrizo,\nC-35 and flying dragon all failed to root. These three rootstocks\nproduce high-quality fruit for oranges,\ngrapefruits and pummelos but they are more difficult to root. For a higher success rate\nI would have done better to start them later in spring rather than in early March. The success rates for the Volkamer lemon, the Yuma Ponderosa lemon and the Cuban shaddock were all 100%. Because they root more\neasily and are compatible with a wide variety of\ncitrus scion varieties these three rootstock varieties are good rootstocks to choose\nwhen rooting rootstocks. The next step will be to\ngraft desired varieties onto the rooted cuttings\nwhen they grow bigger. I have videos that show how\nto graft successfully, here. HLB is now spreading\nin Southern California by the Asian citrus psyllid and possibly by propagation with\ninfected citrus budwood from inappropriate sources. Given the catastrophic potential of HLB we citrus enthusiasts all must maintain the highest phytosanitary standards and only use registered budwood\nfor our citrus propagation. Please share this video\nto spread the word that we all must propagate only\nwith pathogen free budwood to help us win this fight against HLB. Thank you.", "yVqf4RxQq1E": "like all citrus lemons are non climatic now this means that unlike fruits such as pears apples and tomatoes they don't continue to ripen after harvest on the plus side it means that they retain their quality longer than other fruits to keep your lemons as juicy as possible you want to store them chilled and protect them from air here are some lemon storing tips if you're dealing with whole lemons bag them unwrapped lemons will start to lose their moisture after about a week in the refrigerator but we found they'll stay in perfect condition for up to four weeks when sealed in a ziploc bag and chilled when you're looking to store a zested lemons you need to protect them more since the oil and zest protects the fruit from drying out a lemon without its skin needs even more protection so tightly wrap your zested lemon in plastic wrap before refrigerating it when you have leftover lemon juice or zest you guessed it the freezer is your best option freeze your leftover zest in a ziploc bag for up to three weeks its color will fade but it will still be fine for all baking and cooking applications we found that freezing leftover lemon juice led to a small deterioration in flavor but are still acceptable in recipes that call for only a small quantity such as a pan sauce you", "CQdEU6tYnqA": "[Music] it's always sunny here in Florida but I know for most of you you can't wait to kiss the winter goodbye and say hello spring I'm going to show you today how to make a super simple chicken recipe that includes oranges and lemons and garlic and herbs it's easy you bake it in the oven it's gonna brighten up your day I promise you I'm sugar and you're watching cooking with sugar TV today's recipe is oven roasted chicken with citrus and herbs [Music] let me show you the ingredients you're going to need to make this super simple recipe some chicken parts I like to use thighs and legs on the bone some Italian seasoning paprika onion powder sliced onion I'm gonna use some fresh herbs today I'm gonna use thyme and some rosemary orange lemon some olive oil garlic a little bit of sugar and some salt and pepper and that's it we're gonna start off by making the marinade for the chicken by adding some garlic cloves to the olive oil a little bit of my lemon juice orange juice [Music] and sugar and this is gonna get mixed up and now what I did was I just squeezed one lemon and one orange and that's going to be my juice and then I want to mix this until it's all incorporated you're gonna also want to add a good amount of salt and pepper you can

you how to make a sliced dried sliced orange garland and individual ornaments for the tree the holiday season is upon us and what a great time to sit down and make some homemade ornaments and decorations for your home so let's just go over a few items and things that you'll need so the things you'll need to make your orange slice garland you'll need for usually about 4 oranges will make about a 6-foot garland 8 feet of jute or twine or you could even use ribbon a knife cutting board and two cookie sheets lined with parchment paper so choose your oranges that are that have few blemishes on them and we're gonna cut them crosswise at a quarter inch width so try to keep them as even as possible if you have a mandolin you could probably use that a slicer just try to keep them uniform in size that way they all dry consistently [Music] I'm going to cut up some extra for Christmas tree ornaments take your oranges and just kind of blot them to get some of the moisture off of them and place them on the cookie sheet [Music] let's preheat the oven now to 250 degrees and we'll cook them for approximately 3 to 4 hours checking them periodically making sure they're cooking evenly and not overcooking and you'll want to turn them over turn the slices over halfway through the cooking process so let's go ahead and take them to the oven they've been cooking about an hour so I'm going to flip them over the slices over so they dry evenly and stay flat they'll start to curl up a little bit as you can see that one's starting to curl up a little bit and we'll just flip it over and that will help it oh it smells yummy house smells yummy with these cooking I'm just gonna put them back in now for another hour and I'll just make sure that I can check them you don't want to overcook them just when they're dry we'll take them out as you can see I have dried my oranges I ended up cooking them about three and a half hours and they weren't completely dry when I took them out I didn't want them to overcook so I just put them on this cooling rack overnight and they're and they're ready to go you want to make sure that they're pretty much dry but you don't want to overcook them to this point so now we're ready to string our oranges with the twine or the jute I really like this thin jute that I purchased it's just a little bit thinner you can also use the thicker jute if you want to you can use a needle to poke the holes with a yarn needle or a nail I'm going to just use the yarn needle and thread my jute through that what we're going to be doing is poking holes one here and one here if you poke them directly in the middle they they'll sit the garland won't hang correctly it will almost start to lay flat we want them to be upright and hanging so we are going to just make a hole here starting from the back whichever one you want to be the front start from the back and we're gonna leave about a 12 inch tail on the first one and then just come so on a clock would be one o'clock and 11 o'clock and thread that through take another slice and poke a hole from behind at one o'clock pull it all the way through up to the next one then you're keeping it taut and not half and it won't rip the inner of the orange and then out at eleven o'clock and then we'll just keep going and make that as making that as long as you want it to be this hang so is so cute kind of fun relaxing little project and it smells awesome kind of mix up the sizes of the oranges you want to make sure that you're not stringing them too tight or they bundle it bunch up like this so as you're better to have them a little bit more space than not enough between the oranges there so the other end you have about that much love you can just take it double it up leave a wind of a loop there and then make a knot about a couple inches down from the loop just make a knot there cut off the excess and you have something to hang up from so really cute on a mantel or in a doorway a really fun project so to make cute Christmas tree ornaments single orange slices you can just take these ornament hooks that you can buy really inexpensive and just poke a hole in the around the rind and pinch it closed and there you have it just like really cute slice orange slice to add some really beautiful color onto your tree they almost look like little stained-glass windows as the light will shine through they're really quite cute so really a fun thing to do so make sure you when you're making your garland that you make some extras for some single ornaments to hang on your tree [Music]

also baked inside for delicious flavor and aroma roast turkey with herbs and citrus is a dramatic centerpiece for a holiday dinner I like to prepare my turkey a little differently than the traditional way so I'm going to start with my aromatics and I'm going to use lemon and orange to put inside my cavities of my turkey and I'm going to cut the lemon in wedges and an orange as well and the juices from the orange and the lemon they keep the turkey breast and the whole turkey meat flavorful moist and tender and they really do create a fantastic aroma and also some onion cut the onion up as well just like that and I've got some fresh herbs I'm going to use some fresh rosemary oregano and sage we're just going to use a few sprigs we're not even gonna chop it just leave it in whole because later on I'm just going to pull it out and before I stuff them and put them inside the cavity of my turkey I need to make the rub I've got some melted butter here and I'm going to add some herbs de Provence and herbs Provence is a mixture of herbs like basil marjoram lavender fennel seeds rosemary a lot of them and that's why I like it it's all mixed done into one container I use dried herbs for the rub because the turkey is going to be in the oven for a long time and fresh herbs would burn so we use a little bit of that and then of course a little bit of salt some freshly ground black pepper and olive oil got to add a little olive oil as an Italian turkey just going to mix this around a little bit and I'm ready to stuff the turkey and take all the orange wedges and lemon wedges and put them directly into the cavity of my turkey I like to take the turkey out of the refrigerator about a half-hour before I'm going to bake it that way it comes to room temperature when I put it in my preheated oven it doesn't have to defrost or come down and temperature it starts cooking the minute I put it in there don't worry about pressing it all in there it's fine and we're going to discard this we're not actually going to eat this so it's just to give a lot of flavor to the turkey and we're going to add the fresh herbs as well just like that just shove them in there you can do this part a day ahead of time and then place it in the refrigerator I just want to tie the legs together to keep the shape of the turkey that way take it out and it looks beautiful and everybody oohs and ahhs over it they're perfect now for the rub so the melted butter the herbs of Provence salt pepper and a little bit of olive oil just gonna spoon it actually we can just pour it and what the butter the olive oil the herbs do is it gives it a beautiful brown coloring on top so just rub all the parts of the turkey massage everything make sure all the oil and the salt pepper and herbs gets into all the little crevices over here I'm just also going to put my fingers just a little bit and try and rub some of the butter and herbs and olive oil in between the skin and the actual flesh of the turkey just right there is enough all right I'm going to wash my hands and get this turkey in the oven because the turkey is going to cook for a while I'm going to cover the breasts and the legs with some tinfoil so they don't Brown too quickly or burned and then I'll remove it later on after 20 minutes I'm going to add 3 cups of chicken stock to the roasting pan and then scrape up all the little bits that may have caramelized on the bottom and then I'm going to add some more fresh herbs just to add a little more flavor to the chicken stock then we're going to cook the turkey for another 40 minutes then I'm going to take the foil off reduce the heat to 350 and cook the turkey till it's done look at my beautiful turkey I stuffed it with oranges and lemons fresh herbs and onion and it's golden-brown and perfect I'm going to use substage now I'm going to show you what to do my leftover lemons and oranges right on the sides they're just like that you", "i4MM_FGki7g": "slicing up some oranges to dehydrate to put in my tea i may if they turn out kind of cute i may use some as decoration on our tree oh no i put my knife up because i saw on uh i don't know probably pinterest someone was using them as decorations on their trees on their christmas tree now we do not use modern ornaments for our trees we uh i made all of our ornaments i will be showing you guys those here soon because we will be getting our christmas tree up and going here soon and it would help if i could cut a straight line mother and my husband says i'm not allowed to cut you know the brick cheese because i can never cut a straight line i don't know why they say it's because i'm left-handed which wouldn't surprise me none but uh yeah wasn't i'm not allowed to cut cheese because of it it's like oh well works for me but i'll get all these in the dehydrator get them going today hopefully they get done soon we've got good sun hopefully for the next couple days so that gives our solar panels good sun to charge our batteries and that's why i can use the dehydrator okay guys i will show you when these are finished okay i got three trayfuls let's see maybe i can find a place to set you down maybe there kinda sorta okay we'll get this plugged in and get it going noisy there now it's going see you at the end they all got done they look good a couple of them got a little darker than i wanted but they're looking good now i need to find something to put them in until christmas i have a jar that i put the ones in for my tea but yeah we'll see on the next one guys thanks for watching bye you", "XX-R8sq6-vg": "okay my name is Bob Duncan this is for trees and more we're located at Sydney just north of Victoria on Vancouver Island British Columbia Canada and today we're going to talk about growing lemons and limes in a climate where previously was not considered possible there's a basic distinction with citrus there are what are called acid citrus and there are sweet citrus and as it happens the acid citrus meaning lemons and limes in the Japanese citrus lakes Adachi and Cabo su and so on all of these citrus will ripen to perfection with relatively low summer temperatures which is a condition that we have here in the Pacific Northwest our climate could easily be described as a modified Mediterranean climate with the exception that our summers are cool our winters are mild you so this opens the door to growing acid citrus growing sweet citrus under these conditions would not be as simple simply because they require a lot more heat okay so going back to the subject of the day which is growing lemons and limes on Vancouver Island essentially what is required is a sheltered location so typically a south or a southwest wall with an overhang is ideal for growing citrus now this system that we've developed here I've been growing citrus for more than 20 years so I have a lemon tree that measures five meters wide by almost three meters high and produces about 400 lemons reliably every year and we can actually pick lemons every day of the year simply because lemons blossomed from in our climate from late March to the middle of October so we have lemons in all different stages of development on the tree at the same time whereas citrus especially lemons and limes will store on the tree in perfect condition for several months after they're ripe so having such a tree that blooms over a long period of time and fruit that will store on the tree in perfect condition for several months translation we can pick lemons and limes every day of the year now if you look at this tree behind me this is one of the medium-sized lemons that I have on the property here this tree is about ten years old it measures approximately three meters wide by about two meters high and as you can see there are several hundred lemons the crop that you see on here is probably about 70% of what this tree has produced this year so it is absolutely thick with root and this is a normal course of events here so this tree right here is a line and it may at first confuse you because the fruit is yellow like a lemon but in fact limes if you leave them on the tree they will go yellow the same as a lemon so these limes are in perfect condition they wear green in november/december but now it's the middle of February here and that they have gone yellow however there is absolutely no loss in quality the juiciness and the truline flavor is the same as if they were still green so here we've got as I said lemon and lime trees now the climate that we have here is definitely a cool summer mild winter and virtually all of our winter weather citrus are absolutely fine with however occasionally we do get what we locally call Arctic outbreaks an Arctic outbreak for us is a temperature between minus 5 and minus 10 the fruit and the tree is not Hardy to minus 10 so when these events happen which are relatively rare and in fact in an average winter I would say that between five and ten nights in an average winter the temperature is cold enough that your fruit which will freeze at minus three is in danger of freezing so for those five to ten nights you have to do something or you're at risk of either losing your fruit at minus 3 or losing your tree if for instance a Meyer lemon is Hardy to minus 6 so if it goes below minus 6 you're in danger of losing your tree you need to have a strategy to protect your citrus so if you look carefully in the tree here you'll see that there's Christmas lights and these Christmas lights these are the old-style Christmas lights each bulb is 7 watts so a string of 25 bulbs is 175 watts so it's basically like having two light bulbs on so what I have for tree this size or a tree this size one string of Christmas lights is more than enough when it's covered with remate and the Christmas lights underneath even at minus 10 the temperature does not drop below freezing an almost zero intervention in other words through an entire winter having the equivalent of two light bulbs on for five to ten nights you do the math on that and you'll come out between one and two dollars worth of electrical energy to preserve a tree with hundreds of lemons on so and in there some winters here where it actually doesn't go below minus three where you don't require any energy whatever so that's basically the system that we've developed to successfully grow high quality lemons and limes in our climate here near Victoria British Columbia Canada I hope that they the suggestions and hits I provided will be useful to you especially if you live in the Pacific Northwest or northern Europe I think you'll find this system quite adaptable to your conditions thank you very much you", "UN-KZ8JnmxA": "fertilizer n P K you've seen and heard of these three little letters and the numbers associated with those those stands for nitrogen phosphorus and potassium those three elements are very important for all trees and especially citrus for proper leaf growth trunk growth root development flowering and having great tasting fruit so you want to have a fertilizer that has the proper balance and you want to give the proper amount for the size of your tree at the right times for a proper NPK for citrus we recommend and we resale Nelson plant food it has a great balance and we have recommendations for fertilizing every February May and August the first year 5 ounces around your tree at those times for one ounce if you don't have an easy way to measure it you could just use a shot glass and spread that around your tree the second year use 7 ounces and the third year in Ford use 9 ounces for every one of those applications you can also use for an organic method s Poma organic for citrus also you can use Miracle Grow for citrus we don't recommend fertilizer spikes they have the potential if you put them close to your tree to burn the roots and to have an uneven distribution these fertilizer systems are much more long-acting and a much more gentle and easier on your tree and they also provide the necessary micronutrients that your citrus tree needs you", "4eNGP58fTRk": "hey guys how's it going today's video is a care guide on how to grow citrus fruit in containers and this applies to any citrus fruit in a container whether or not you live in a mild enough climate to keep it out year-round or whether you're keeping it inside year-round or if you're like me I live in a climate that's too cold to keep it out during the winter so it comes in for the winter months and then it lives outside from late spring through usually early fall so I've outlined this guide into eight different points we're gonna be talking about how to choose the best type of container what type of soil to use how to plant them what kind of like to keep them in what temperatures best and how to transition them from inside to outside in spring and fall also about watering fertilizing and pollination and harvest but first I do want to mention that citrus trees that you're planting in containers will naturally not grow as big as they would in the ground and that's a good thing because for those of us who are moving our citrus inside and outside and around throughout the year we wanted to stay a manageable size I don't want something that gets so big that I can no longer move it anymore so when we plant anything whether it's a citrus tree or any other plant in a container we're just restricting where the roots can grow it can't spread out like it would normally in the ground so they'll just stay a little bit smaller but you can find citrus trees that have been grafted onto dwarf root stock which means that root stock will keep the plant portion of the tree smaller but it won't restrict the size of the fruit the fruit will still get the normal size today I'm planting this Meyer lemon tree in this container this is not a door if it's an actual tree that wants to grow about 13 to 15 feet tall and wide which in the world of trees it's pretty small but for a container that's massive and you know if I were to keep bumping up the container size to where it had a ton of root room for the roots to grow and I had the ability to take it inside and outside at that size it might reach that size but it's just not possible in our area because I can't get that big of a plant through our doors and I won't probably bump up that much more in container size I might do one or two sizes more but they do really well with restricted root room for quite a number of years so let's talk about point number one and that's about choosing your container and you can pretty much choose any container that suits your style so long as it has good drainage so if you notice that your pot only has one tiny little drain hole in the bottom you might think about drilling a few more and I'll talk about it in the watering section but citrus trees can be a little bit picky about water and soil drainage and root aeration are key to success with your citrus trees if you have to move your citrus from inside to outside plastic or something lightweight is really nice it also helps retain a little bit of moisture which I find helpful when your plants outside because there's just subject to more elements or subject to wind we have very dry heat here I am using terracotta because that's my style I like this look of container and I know that it's porous so it's going to be passing oxygen in and out through the sides of the container and I know it's gonna dry out a little bit quicker but if you know that and you know to give your citrus extra water then you're okay also choose a container that's a little bit taller than it is wide because it'll help keep your citrus tree more balanced as it grows it'll have more of an anchor system as opposed to if you chose a big wide shallow container as that plant grows it's just going to have a harder time staying upright and one last thing is if you buy your citrus tree in a black plastic nursery pot you want to get it repotted out of that as quickly as possible especially if you're keeping it outside in a sunny spot because that black plastic will absorb heat and can cook the roots during the hot part of summer point number two is soil you can go a couple different routes with this I've tried both of them many times with success it depends on what container you're using what kind of material it is if you go with terracotta that tends to dry out quicker I like to use a spoon of potting mix because it does help hold on to a little bit more moisture so it doesn't dry out completely really fast and citrus while they like to stay on the dry side they don't want to dry out completely between waterings if you go with something like plastic that tends to retain more moisture you can use something like vs Woma cactus mix which helps facilitate a little bit more drainage and I find that the combination for both of those types of pots with those types of soil works really well point number three is on planting and this is pretty basic so I'm going to show you how I do it so first I'm going to add some potting soil to the container so I added just enough potting soil to where I think I can still accommodate the root ball of my lemon tree but before I plant it I want to add in my slow release fertilizer incorporating it into the soil and I'm adding some citrus tone which is a fertilizer geared towards citrus trees it has the right balance of nutrients and I'm just following the instructions on the label so it says when you're planting a brand new container to incorporate about two cups of the fertilizer into one cubic foot of soil I only used about half of a cubic foot of soil so I'm only gonna mix in about a cup so now I'm just gonna mix the fertilizer in all the way to the bottom of the container fertilizers all mixed in so now I'm going to push some of the soil along the sides of the container here and kind of create a well in the center I'm kind of looking at the size of the root ball and I'm going to try to create a well that's approximately the same size as the root ball it'll make planting a lot easier so one thing you do want to look out for if you're planting a grafted citrus tree that's been grafted onto dwarf root stock you want to look for that graft union on the trunk and you want to make sure and it looks like a bump or a scar along the trunk of the plant they're pretty easy to identify you just want to make sure that that stays up above the soil level so what I'm going to do is pop the lemon tree out of the container and I'm going to try to Center the trunk as close to Center as I can in this container so I'm actually going to remove a little bit of the soil on this side because that'll help me Center it in the container a little bit better all right and then I'm going to take the soil that I pushed up along the sides of the container and I'm going to tamp it in around the root ball and it's really at this point I might add a little bit of extra soil we just want to make it kind of we don't want to bury it any deeper than it was buried in this pot here but I want to make sure that their soil tamped in really well around the whole root ball so there's no air pockets you also want to leave a good inch or two lip along the top of the soil from the top of the pot that way it makes watering a lot easier a little bit more soil the fourth point is lighting and they like a lot of sunshine like a minimum of 8 to 12 hours per day and it'll be a little bit different based on whether you're keeping them inside or outside so for those of you who are keeping inside it's best if you can put them in the brightest window you have so like a south-facing window where they can get Sun for the better part of the day is a really ideal you do need to remember to rotate that rotate them on occasion so that all sides of the plant are receiving the same amount of light to keep them the happiest in the wintertime like when I bring mine in for the winter a supplemental lighting is also very helpful because you know Sun isn't as intense a lot of times we don't have windows that will supply enough light for the plant so if you have a smaller citrus tree like this you could do something like we installed recently a bamboo LED grow light garden in our master bedroom actually where I winter plants over and that would accommodate citrus tree this size and maybe even a little bit bigger but there are other options available for larger plants like you can get drop pendant lighting I think one is called aspect lighting and it's a drop pendant light that you can put above like a single plant that's really large that will provide it with that light that it needs if you are keeping your citrus outside though like in the summer time I find that morning Sun is really good for my citrus and then filtered light throughout the afternoon just because we have such dry intense heat through the summer it tends to scorch their leaves if they stay out in too much so I find having a really strong block of morning light and then that filtered sunshine is really great if you live in a more mild climate though that gets more humidity and has cloud cover and maybe some rain coming down which is really not typical of our summers here you might be able to keep them in a more full Sun location throughout the whole day so it's just something that you may have to adjust based on where you're keeping it and what your climates like and point number five kind of goes hand in hand with lighting I want to talk about temperature and then how to transition your plant from inside to outside in the spring or fall in terms of temperature and light so typically most of your citrus trees can handle temps down to 32 degrees I do not like to chance it like that usually my indicator when the temp reaches about 40 degrees outside that's when I know I have a little window to get all of my tender plants inside and that way I'm not running around in a panic trying to get everything in because it's a good idea to have time to clean your plants before you bring them in inspecting for insects you know give them a good shower with the hose wash their leaves off maybe repot if you need to so I'd like to have that little window and also getting down to close to freezing that can cause some damage as well so usually 40 degrees is kind of my cutoff and then I start bringing them inside you do want to acclimate them slowly though so if you can move them from your sunny location to you know a spot that's maybe not quite as sunny you know something that emulates inside conditions a little bit more like a covered patio for maybe a week so that when you move it inside it's not totally shocked that's a really good idea same thing goes in the spring when the temperatures have warmed up enough if you can put it outside for a week 10 days underneath a covered patio where it gets filtered light and then slowly move it like a foot or two you know the consecutive days after that first week until it reaches its full Sun location you'll deal with a lot less shock because they tend to shock when you move them I mean you've bought it might have bought a citrus plant at a store your garden center you get at home and it just drops a bunch of leaves that's kind of typical of citrus trees but if you can acclimate them slowly you'll get a lot less of that and you won't get scorched because if you put your citrus tree from inside where it's much more protected right out into full Sun you're gonna have some burned leaves and it's a total pain I'm not gonna lie to have to transition plants and acclimate them it's like hardening off seedlings something you have to remember to do if you have it in a heavy pot it's harder to do so it's a good idea when you get it like from inside your house you bring it outside put it on a caster that has wheels so that it's easy for you to move it from one location to the next you know moving it out into more light so you're not having to physically pick up your container every single time to move it and that makes the process a lot more pleasant point number six is watering and this could probably be one of the more frustrating things because citrus are more picky like I said earlier they don't like to dry out completely but they do like to stay on the dry side they don't like overly wet soil because they can root rot really quickly but they do need consistent moisture for fruit development so it's one of those things that's so hard to tell like exactly how much water to give or when to give it because it's so dependent on so many different factors like what size your plant is what type of pot you use what type of soil you use what kind of weather is it subject to is it getting rain or is it totally dry or is it getting wind dried out too quick so the best thing to do the best thing I can tell you to do is just monitor the soil moisture and you can do that easily with a really cheap moisture meter that you can buy it the garden center you can also use a wooden skewer or a wood chopstick it's a really easy thing to do you just stick it down in the soil let it sit for just a second pull it back up and you can see how much water has absorbed into that wood skewer if the soil it seems dry and the soil just kind of like dust right off of that skewer it's probably time to water typically I wait for the top inch or so of soil to dry out and then I know to water it when you do go into water you want to make sure to give enough to water and saturate the whole root zone of the plant if any collects in the saucer underneath if you have it on the saucer you do want to make sure to pour that out because you don't want it sitting and wicking up extra moisture and the seventh point is fertilizing which is really important because when you have containerized plants of any kind the only nutrients they're getting is what you give to them and when you have something that you want to both bloom and fruit you need to make sure that they're getting enough nutrients so I use a fertilizer that's specific to citrus plants because it's formulated for their specific needs and I just follow the instructions on the bag typically though as a general guideline you want to give them a dose of fertilizer about january/february right before they start to bloom and that'll help them bloom better and then you can give them another dose in like May June right after they're done blooming and that'll help give them more energy to produce their fruit and then if you're bringing them inside giving them a fall dose of fertilizer is also really good if you are keeping them outside though it's may be a good idea to skip the fall application because you don't want them putting on extra foliar growth right before a cold winter because that tender growth is really susceptible to frost damage if you live in a tropical mild climate though where that doesn't happen you can go ahead and give the fall dose now that is just for the slow release granulated fertilizer that I use today so I mixed it into the container today the next fertilizer it'll get is in the fall when I bring it in there is liquid fertilizer you can use as well which is a little bit more of a quick shot of nutrients so you have to give it more often like every 2 to 4 weeks typically with the slow release it's just 2 to 3 applications a year and it's really easy all you do is take the diameter of the pot and for every four inches a day you use one teaspoon of fertilizer so with an 18-inch pot I think you use four and a half teaspoons I think my math is right on that anyway it's super easy you just sprinkle it around the edge of the pot and water it in and so I find that to be a nice slow feed to the plant and then I don't have to be remembering to fertilize it all the time point number eight is about pollination and harvest so most citrus trees are self fruitful or self pollinating meaning you only need one variety of tree in order to get fruit you know a lot of fruit trees like apple trees and pear trees and things like that you need two variety is in order for them to cross pollinate in order for them to bear fruit there's only a handful of varieties of citrus that require that so just check the tag this Meyer lemon is a self-fruitful tree so I only need the one even though I do have a lime and another pink lemonade lemonade here on our property so even if that wasn't the case I would have enough for this to bear fruit so with most citrus trees they start to bloom in early to mid spring and then they start setting their fruit which this one has lemons all over it and they'll sit and they'll size up throughout the course of the summer and then you start harvesting usually late fall and winter and the best way to to determine rightness is to taste-test the rhein will tell you nothing as to whether or not it's sweet enough or it's ready and the best way to store your fruit is just to leave them on the tree and use them as you need them and that is my guide on how to take care of citrus and containers I've done it for many many years with really really great success now I did not touch on insects I haven't dealt with a lot of insect pests I find that if you can put them out in the summer time you deal with a lot less insects because they have really good airflow outside they're getting the light they need so they're not stressed so the least the least stressed you can keep your plant the less susceptible they are to getting attacked by any kind of insect I had will say that I have had a lemon tree get spider mites before and mealy bugs I treat the spider mites with some derivative of neem so some neem based spray and that usually takes care of them I'm usually with container plants pretty quick to find any problem starting and I think that's key to really keep your eye on all of your plants and that way if you notice a problem starting you can take care of it right away before it becomes a full-blown issue and mealy bugs are super easy as well you just take a q-tip in rubbing alcohol and just wipe them off and that's something you don't want to have take hold either so just keep your eye on your plants so that nothing becomes a super huge problem so anyway guys I hope this video was helpful I'm excited to see how this lemon does throughout this season and I hope I get lots of really great fruit off of it this year we will be updating you on it as we go so thanks so much for watching this video and we will see you in the next one bye [Music]", "bPYAdYc_Piw": "Hi everybody welcome back to my kitchen and today we have a little something different today We're gonna be making these delicious preserved lemons You may not have ever thought about using these and maybe you use them all the time But if you do, you know how versatile and delicious they can be I'm gonna be using this jar here Which is all ready to go in a roast chicken dish and I made a jar here to share with you So let's go see how these all come together Okay, this is so easy and when you have a plenitude of Citrus coming off your trees and for instance right now everywhere in the stores Meyer lemons are making an appearance and those really are great to use for preserved lemons we're gonna make these preserved lemons with just organic lemons I Brought these home And I wash them with hot water and I scrub them and I rinse them with a little apple cider vinegar And I just let them drain and what you want to do is you want to just um very thinly slice them You don't want have any thicker than this and that is probably about a quarter of an inch But you also don't want them too thin because they like completely dissolve in the end this is what you'll have this is a you know a jar that I Preserved a while ago these you can make in advance They're gonna need to cure for about 30 days, and then you can stick them in your fridge these are gonna last I'm gonna tell you they're gonna last pretty much indefinitely, but they're gonna you're gonna use these so fast You're not even gonna believe it lemons in salt. That's all we need and what I have is I have a couple of pint and a half jars here that I sterilized we're gonna put some lemons in here And this is kosher salt And what you want to do is you want to layer and you want you want to make sure you stuff this jar, okay? so you can layer down the middle, and then you can just store sort of Start to build your jar up and My hands are clean. These are super delicious to have on hand we're going to be using these in a roast chicken dish Not these but the ones that I just showed you and don't freak out about the salt because You rinse these before you use them, so just continue sticking these in the jar layering them up These add such brightness and flavor to so many things you can make amazing dishes With these lemons you can Yes, you can eat the whole thing, I mean you can eat the whole thing now But it's gonna be bitter this salt is going to kind of Diminish the bitterness of the lemon rind oops sorry So just go along and throw some in and throw a good dose of salt in there And then what's gonna happen is this is gonna leach all the liquid out, and it is going to create its own kind of Juiciness in here you can also add fresh herbs in here if you like you can add rosemary thyme Bay leaves whatever you prefer, and you'll have just a really see a nicely seasoned preserved lemon And you really want to press these down okay, and you really want to cram this full You just want to make sure that you use kosher salt or Canning salt you do not want to use iodized table salt Okay, so what I'm gonna. Do now is I'm gonna grab one of these lemons and I'm gonna cut it in half, and I'm gonna just squeeze the juice in here And I'm gonna go ahead and do another lemon there use the lemon squeezer because that's what it's for and There we go, and then we get a lid I'm just gonna wipe this rim off real quick Give this a good shake It looks kind of yucky now, but I promise you after these have done their business They're gonna be delicious, and they're very gonna be very salty like I said you want to rinse these before you use them But they need to cure For 30 days on your kitchen counter. Nothing's gonna happen to them just leave them alone and everything is gonna Be just fine as these sits, and you shake them every day the salt is going to dissolve They're going to draw more moisture out of the lemons It's going to produce more liquid and in the end it's going to look like this That's what you're going for So that's how easy it is to make preserved lemons. I'm gonna show you what these look like hang on Let me grab a plate and you can see that it they soften up really nicely these are fantastic Put in a roasted chicken or on top of a roasted chicken if you don't add any additional herbs These are great added to cakes You can sugar these and you can Dehydrate them after you rinse them And they'll be beautiful little garnishes for like little tea cakes absolutely beautiful you can Grind these up in a blender and you can add them too drinks. You can make salad dressings with them There's really an infinite number of things you can do with these preserved lemons But I know Rick wants to taste one even though. I haven't rinsed it off so If salty it. I don't think it's overly salty Lemon now it almost has a perfume to it It does it really does have a very earthy taste mm-hmm, I think they're really good you're gonna want to rinse them before you use them these will stay in your refrigerator perrolli indefinitely there's so much salt and Acid from the lemons that these are going to hang out for as long as you need them to You don't want to be canning these because they will completely break down into nothing This is just something you're gonna want to make in small batches and keep in your fridge You don't want to keep them on your shelf you want to keep them in the refrigerator after 30 days after they have cured you Want to keep them in the fridge, that's that that's how you make preserved lemons.

I'll see ya", "1gwFQVvYVr4": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] I've been out picking a citrus today it's winter and winter is when citrus comes off so this is the dead of winter the middle of winter and look at what I've just kicked out of our orchard it's just wonderful I've got a couple of different types of lemons here and I'll tell you the difference this is a true lemon this is a Eureka lemon and it's a real sour lemon so if you wanted to make jam it's very high in pectin and perfect for that so that's how you recap this one on the other hand is a Meyer lemon and as you can see it's a little bit more orange in color and that's because it's a hybrid cross so this is a cross between an orange and a lemon and it's much sweeter it's much juicier and it doesn't have the same amount of pectin so it's excellent choice if you're using it for dressings and sauces but it's hopeful it's the jam so if you're choosing lemons if you want to make jam something like a eureka if you want dressings and sauces the Meyer lemon is ideal and this funny little fruit is the bush lemon which is a naturalized Australian lemon we call it the bush lemon is very very popular and I've got all sorts of other different types of citrus here I'd like to show you this has been my favorite of the season this is a a navel orange so it's a totally seedless fruit it's very aromatic you can see the juice dripping out of it this has been my favorite it's a navel inna this is a cara cara this is also a navel orange but you can see this is too the oranges what the ruby grapefruit is too the grapefruit also seedless sweet it's another really beautiful orange I love both of those they're great for juicing as well now this one here this is a this is a little orange just cut it I think you can have a look at that this is another type of blood orange this one is called an Arnold's blood that's quite different to the Caracara so with the Caracara you get even color throughout the fruit with the Arnold's blood you get all this beautiful dark bleeding color coming in from the outside so that's just a really gorgeous specimen this is really beautiful juicing orange so I get a really lovely deep red juicy produced the Arnold's blood now this one here this looks like an orange but if I scratch it it smells like a grapefruit and the reason being this isn't another hybrid this is what we call a hon of surprise grapefruit and it's a cross between a grapefruit and an orange so once again has this beautiful orange colored flesh now if you also like grapefruits let your life things a little bit sweet this is the way to go now this lumpy novelty looking thing is what we call a flicks yellow pomelo it is another hybrid and you can see that a lot of it is PF around the outside so it doesn't have a great deal of flesh it's got you know a good centimetre of of pith on that so it's great because a fruit fly can't get into that and it has really lovely sweet flesh as well so that's another excellent fruit this one here's a bergamot orange oak it's actually quite pale in color and it's used for its more use for marmalades and as a flavor so you can put it into flavor - it's a lovely aromatic fruit so it's another really lovely type of citrus so you can see that this the citrus world is not really a matter of just oranges and mandarins I do have some mandarins here as well these are this is a light Mandarin this is a honey Mercat there are tight skinned mandarin so they're little bit tricky to peel but once again beautiful colored flesh producing and lovely lovely scented fruit they're just lovely you can see it's got seeds now I've got some other things to show you here as well now these are kumquats and I love kumquats I think they're great I think a kumquat a day keeps the doctor away should be the same I come off in winter just when you need them they're packed in vitamin C and it is a perfect little mouthful of a fruit this is a meal arm which is around kumquat and it's a really sweet fruit it has very sweet skin and very sweet flesh so if you like sweet things the meal a kumquat will be the one to choose now this little one on the other hand has very sweet skin this is called a Nogami it has these lovely over fruits and it has really sour flesh which I think it's just fabulous so it's a really lovely mixture of sweet and sour look at all those different types of citrus you can't go wrong with growing citrus they're really prolific fruiting plant they're very easy to grow they do require perfect drainage and lots of Sun so if you've got a full Sun position growing a citrus tree is going to give you a bumper crop so if you've got a lovely sunny spot and you want to grow a really prolific fruit tree why not grow a type of citrus tree there's just so much to choose from and there's really something for everyone when it comes to growing citrus [Music]", "6ojhIZkmceg": "hi guys today we're going to be talking about growing citrus and other tropical fruits outdoors and I don't mean in pots I'm talking about in the ground this is my lime tree it's a Persian lime that I picked up in Texas about three to four years ago and most of you that have been watching know that I'm in Michigan and this is not an ideal place to grow citrus unless they're in a pot now most of the citrus grown in the United States is grown in California Arizona Texas and of course Florida and the ideal hardiness zone for citrus is nine to eleven which means that the temperatures in those areas rarely drop below thirty degrees they can get a little bit lower but not mostly China whereas I'm in zone five and we can get temperatures down as low as 20 below zero Fahrenheit and if you have a citrus tree down in the low 20s for thirty minutes or more you're going to start to get damaged so today is the first video of a whole series on how to grow them successfully outside up obviously this is an experiment but if it works I'm going to increase the number of plants that I grow for instance back here I have a bacon and a Hass avocado that I bought in from California I have over here on the table a Eureka lemon and I have I've been growing pineapples for years here and I have been able to get full-size pineapples and I'll explain that in a different video so I plan on also planting a tangelo which I have on my front deck and maybe mango and probably some grapes that would not be Hardy here in Michigan so you might ask why don't you just keep them in containers dude and not go through all this trouble of trying to grow something where it's not supposed to grow well the first thing is weight if you look at this particular tree here it's in a pot that's probably two feet across and it's extremely heavy and what I have to do is move this thing in usually late September early October before we get those cold temperatures and then it has to grow inside under lights until around late May early when I can move it back outside then I have to get it accustomed to direct sunlight which means I have to put it in a shady or place for about a week or two otherwise I'll end up having sunburn on the leaves which you can see on the lemon to a certain extent another thing I don't have a lot of space I mean I have a pretty good sized basement but I don't want to dedicate the whole thing to plants that are going to get bigger and heavier all the time and plus the fact that the amount of fruit that I can have on a small potted plant is not as much as I could on a larger tree and the quality is not going to be the same either because growing something under artificial lights is not the same as the Sun so that's why I'm going to try this experience experiment outside plus the fact being a horticulturist I'd like to push the boundaries and and I think it'll be entertaining videos so we'll see how it works out now I was going to try this experiment on my new tangelo it's a much smaller tree but I thought you know this thing is getting really heavy and it'll be great motivation if I put it outside because I have an investment of three to four years in this tree and so I'm going to do everything I can to keep it alive okay let's talk a little bit about the site now citrus likes to grow in sandy loams well-drained soils no problem on the north side of my property is fairly sandy soil and it's very well-drained it doesn't hold water no water puddles over here or anything so check one second it likes a pH or that's the measure of the acidity or alkalinity of the soil it likes a pH of 6 to 7 which is about what most plants like they like to be slightly acidic no problem there now if you don't know the pH of your soil is you can simply run a soil test with your local University Extension Service and that can solve your problem right there finding out which pH is now light we need a minimum of 812 hours of direct sunlight to grow citrus and during the summer months that's not going to be a problem at all here in Michigan now during the winter months the Sun is much lower on the horizon that it is as you go closer to the equator and on the south side of these trees will be my garage so there will be some shading there but I do have the ability to give them some artificial light we'll see how that works out okay now we need to talk about the planting hold and this is going to be a little different than what we would traditionally do for a plant first of all I did the hole that was about four feet by four feet by four feet I'm essentially going to make an inground pot and that's 64 cubic feet of soil that's more than enough to supply that tree during the life of its growth this is a dwarf citrus also now I want to explain something a little bit we're going to delve into a little bit of science there are no different ways that you can have heat transfer and you'll see why that's important in a minute I have a bottle of water here and if I spray this on my skin especially on a windy day my skin is going to feel cooler the reason for that is is as the wind blows across the surface of my skin it draws heat away as the water evaporates that's called convection okay now I have a nail here in my pocket and if I were to stick this nail in the on the burner on my stove in the kitchen what will happen is heat will travel up this nail and eventually burn my finger if I don't have some kind of protection on my finger this is called conduction that's another way of transferring heat from one location to another now what I'm going to do in my planting hole is I'm going to put two inch construction insulation and what that will do is be an insulator between the soil inside this greenhouse that I'm going to have to build and the soil outside like during the winter when there's snow on the ground if I just had continuous soil with no insulation the heat would migrate out into the colder area so I'm putting two inch insulation in on the sides and on the bottom of the pot and also on the bottom of the pot I have drilled holes or I should say in the hole holes in the insulation so water can filter out I'm not too concerned about it because it's not sealed pot anyway but I did that for extra effect and then after I put the insulation in then as I fill the hole in I will eventually put in some drainage tile in kind of a bow shape which will allow me to put some fans connected to that and I can circulate the warm air from the greenhouse into the soil if need be now I will monitor the soil temperatures at about 6 inches 12 inches and maybe 18 inches just to be sure that the soil is warm enough for my citrus trees what I'm going to try to do is duplicate the ideal growing conditions for citrus as much as I can and we'll talk more about that in other videos so once the hole is dug I'm adding the soil in I'm putting the soil that came out of the bottom first I have added some organic matter some kitchen waste and I have some potting soil that I'm going to add to the soil too and I will water as I fill it in so that the trees quite water now you'll also notice over here I have a piece of wood across one side of the hole that is to protect the insulation because with dragging heavy weights across it it could break the insulation very easily and then the other thing since this is a one-man operation and a very heavy pot I'm going to take a piece of wood and slide it or put it on an angle so that I can slide the pot into the hole where I want it and I'll build a soil up toward the middle so that the pot is about where it needs to be at sort of level and I will plant that tree a little bit above the grade and then I'll fill the soil in now another thing I need to do is get that pot off of there so I'm going to use my chainsaw to cut the sides and try to cut part of the bottom so that once the tree is in the ground I can just peel off the pot once that's done if there any roots run around in circles I will cut some of those roots and spread them out and then I can finish drilling in the hole watering as I go once that's done I put on some malted weed control weeds and then I'm ready to go in terms of next part of this experiment now you heard me mention a greenhouse we will start getting cold weather around October maybe even September depending on how to learn goes the wind the weather goes and so I have until that time to build a greenhouse and this greenhouse is going to be an inexpensive one the idea of this hobby is to keep the cost down and I will give you some information on some of these costs as I go along and if I don't do that of course I'm going to lose the tree and I'll show you how this is done but the idea the greenhouse is it will be completely collapsible if you will I'll be able to take it apart during the summer and the tree will grow in the yard like any other tree and then during the cold months and I'll put the greenhouse around it we'll see how that works out now there are a number of additional problems that I'm going to have to work out for instance am I going to heat this economically I have to be able to water watering during the summer is not hard but I have to be able to water during cold months also and then I have to trick the plants in the flowering when I want it to for instance tangelos are right in Florida in January and we normally order citrus from those orchards and it's just delicious I just absolutely love it but we can't have tangelos ripening in January in Michigan because they're just not going to be the same so what I need to do is trick the plant into flowering and producing at a time when our weather is analogous to the weather when the citrus is wrapping in Florida now some of you might say it's not going to work well that's the experiment and I'll explain how these things work a little bit later and then I have to think about pollination some of the plants do not need a pollinator and other plants do so I'll have someone have more than one in some cases now this lime does not itself pollinated also I have to have something to pollinate the flowers if we have plants with flowers out at a time when our pollinators are not working like you're in the winter months then I have to solve that problem too and then there are possible pest issues and various other things that I have to work out so I hope you stay tuned and we're going to see if this works if nothing else I'm going to have fun because I've been thinking about it for quite a while so let's get over here and start planting the tree you you", "RTZ6qb8y85M":

beautiful and produces delicious small fruits let's look at growing the dwarf mandarin \"kishu\"so january is a good time to start citrus trees if you're buying the trees now you can also start citrus trees from seed but they do take a long time to give fruit so i recommend that you buy a good grafted plant like this one you see here and use this kind of a large container to grow your dwarf citrus trees now you can even plant your dwarf citrus trees in the ground like you saw with the other citrus tree we are growing like the dancy tangerine now the potting mix that I'm using is just standard potting mix I'm not creating my own using peat moss and there is a reason this dwarf citrus requires a soil pH which is neutral now if you add a lot of peat moss your soil becomes acidic and then you add some garden lime to neutralize the acidity of the peat moss so in this case what I've done is I have just used regular potting soil potting mix and then I'm just going to be adding more mix till I see that the plant will fit into the larger pot and then you just tap around the pot just like that the container that you got your plant in and a grafted tree is something that has a rootstock which is a citrus plant which grows pretty strong something like citron which not many people like to eat though its healthy but the rootstock of the citron is pretty strong so they use it for most citrus trees and what is done here is we've crafted the store has grafted a kishu mandarin plant onto this rootstock as you can see here we get this plant which will produce delicious kishu mandarins I'm trying to seat the plant in the larger pot now if you don't have a very large pot that's still ok but just make sure you get the plant a little bit of growing room so that doing at least the first year of planting that would get some space to grow out now just keep adding more soil around the plant till it gets full and that completes the bulk of your soil addition for your container and then watering is very important as soon as you plant water to make sure that all the air pockets are closed and at this time you can add a liquid fertilizer if you want to i did not do that because the potting mix that i use does have some nutrients and so I'm not going to be adding any more fertilizer here and I kept it at a sunny location where you get at least about six to eight hours of Sun and I certainly go into the sunlight requirement for the citrus plant but try to use a container that you have which is slightly larger than the one you got and here you can see a transplant this plant into a different container due to some other arrangements I was making in my side yard but as you can see here this mandarin plant looks pretty healthy and by April it grew into a pretty large-sized plant and you can see here this is partial shade this pot gets about six hours of Sun every day and the citrus trees that produce sweet fruit like the mandarins the oranges they need at least six hours of Sun now if you're growing Meyer lemons or some other sour lemons that are not sweet any citrus that's not sweet you can get by with a lesser sunlight maybe like four hours would be okay but for any sweet fruits you need a lot of sunlight because it's that sunlight that really make the fruit sweet as you can see here in the month of March the following year the plant is now flowering like crazy and this plant produced a lot of flowers i know have other YouTube viewers that have mentioned that they had the kishu mandarin and it was flowering like crazy and I can completely relate to them this plant had a lot of flowers and in the end of april the flowers had turned into small fruits as you can see here a lot of small fruits all around the citrus plant now you need to make sure that you add fertilizer to your citrus plants very well starting february and i recommend that you watch my video on fertilizing citrus plants fruit trees so that you can get an idea of when to add fertilizer for your citrus plant now as far as insects go there is one big enemy of all citrus plants and that is the leaf miner and the leaf manner will devastate your citrus plants so make sure that if you do get a leafminer attack follow the video that is there in your screen right now you will be able to counter leafminers this kishu mandarin plant is a dwarf plant it doesn't really grow that big it grows more like a shrub than a tree I always advise my viewers my fellow gardeners I always advise my fellow gardeners to buy dwarf trees so that you optimize your space in your garden dwarf trees give a lot of harvest you'll get an abundant harvest while not taking up a lot of space now unless you're in a tropical or subtropical area you have to grow your citrus plant in containers because although they tolerate cold well they will not survive a hard freeze so it's better that you plant your citrus plants in containers if you're living in an area that gets a freezing winter and while the fruits are ripening you can see that one or two fruits may die and fall off and that's perfectly fine there is a limit to how many fruits the plant can produce now by the time it's August you've seen that the fruits have become slightly larger and this plant doesn't produce very large fruit it produces fruits that are small actually smaller not even medium i won't even call them and medium-sized at least not in the first year but what i have read about this mandarin plant is that it produces slightly larger fruit as it grows bigger so i'm going to wait and see for the second year how this plant produces but these are still decently sized fruits maybe not for adults but the kids absolutely love it it's very easy for them to peel these fruit and then just gobble them these are seedless there are no seeds inside them kids absolutely love it they just can harvest it right off the plant and then just skin them very easily and then pop them in their mouth so the kids really like it you can even give these kind of mandarins as a good smack your kids while they go to school and even otherwise when you're hanging out in the garden with such an abundance of fruits in just the small container you can imagine how much fun the kids have and here i'm going to show you by peeling this fruit you can see how think the skin is extremely thin skinned fruit and inside the mandarin you can see that it's pretty small and you can pretty much eat them as whole but they still have the shape of a standard orange fruit you can even split the pieces and eat them and they're  absolutely sweet, they taste absolutely sweet and delicious just wait for them to ripen on the vine as with all citrus plants sweet citrus the earlier you harvest the fruit the more sour they're going to be but if you let them ripen on the vine properly on the tree properly then you can expect to get some really good harvest of some delicious fruit and watering your container generally depends on how hot it is in your area and what you see on your screen as a general guideline and as you can see here towards the end of the season which is in January after two years the citrus plant has produced slightly larger fruits towards the end of the harvest season and this is the best time to harvest this fruit which is somewhere around january that's when you get the sweetest fruit so i think we covered all aspects of growing this lovely dwarf Mandarin called kishu I would like to know from you whether you have tried growing any dwarf citrus trees and what are your favorites do you like going dwarf trees or do you like growing the full sized trees please let me know why do you think each choice is better than the other and if you'd like me to try growing a different citrus variety in my garden please do let me know in the comments below and if like this video do give us a thumbs up and we'll see you again soon happy gardening!", "fS1_FC2jihw": "now I'll be showing you how to supreme an orange or cut it into segments the first thing that we'll be doing is cutting off either end of the orange using good knife technique keeping our off hand in a claw formation from there you set the orange up right and you'll be cutting in a curve around the outside of the orange to remove not only the rind but the internal pith as well exposing the fruit underneath will continue on around the orange until all of the pith and all of the rind have been removed the reason that we do this cut is it will remove for our guest the less desirable parts of the fruit and it will give us a much cleaner more elegant and simple presentation so this is what we are left with the fruit is still in between all the membranes holding it in there so what we will do with our knife is cut on the inside of each membrane carefully and release the orange itself so all we have left after that is just the pure fruit one of the hallmarks of this cut is a very precise edge this is a very simple cut to make so it's very easy to practice at home one of the most important things that you want to keep in mind is to not try to cut too carefully or too closely to the membrane that will make it much more challenging to get this sharp edge which is one of the really beautiful hallmarks of this cut so make certain that you are cutting in a very pronounced v-shape even if you feel like you're leaving a little bit of fruit behind the finished cut is worth it now we do have some fruit that is left in the orange and since we're chefs and we don't believe in wasting food a simple way to remedy that is to squeeze the juice the remaining juice from the orange which is then usable in all different kinds of cooking from sauce making to everything else that we would do additionally there is still more use that we can get out of this orange if you're looking for orange flavor this is the most flavorful part of the orange the zest the outside part full of all those volatile oils that give that very strong citrusy orange flavor from there you can remove that with a knife you can remove that with a microplane or a zester to take that and use that in your cooking as well you", "LwqyGdAhGf4": "today I'm continuing with my dehydrating 101 series and I'm going to show you how easy it is to dehydrate citrus peel hi sweet friends my name is Mary and welcome to Mary's nest this channel is all about living the simple life by cooking from scratch making home remedies and creating a cozy home with charming thrift store finds so if you're like me and you like living the simple life be sure to subscribe to my channel and don't forget to click on the little notification Bell below that'll let you know every time I upload a new video dehydrating citrus peel really couldn't be easier and it's a wonderful thing to do with something that might otherwise go into the garbage or into the compost pile but instead you can turn them into something that can be used in recipes now what I like to do is when we eat any kind of citrus before we peel it if it's not organic I give those skins a real good scrub with a little combination of baking soda and vinegar which makes a little bit of a frothy mixture scrub them up give them a rinse and then we go ahead and eat them and what I do is I take a little container like this it's a little glass container and I have everybody put the peels in here and I save them and when I get a good amount I D hydrate them and you can really do this with any type of citrus these are the peels from mandarin oranges but you can use lemons you could use limes you could use oranges grapefruits any citrus that you have now mandarin oranges have a very thin peel and very little pith if you were doing something like a navel orange that has that thicker skin it's going to take longer to dehydrate and you certainly can do that but if you want another option would be to simply try to remove the zest either with a potato peeler or one of those microplane zester is depending on how large or small you wanted your zest and go ahead and dehydrate it that way now if you want to dehydrate citrus peel in a electric dehydrator all you need is your basic dehydrator tray you don't need the silicon mat and you're just going to want to put your citrus on it just like the citrus peel on it couldn't be easier that's it you're going to set it to 125 degrees and now in the stew hydrater it's going to take anywhere from 8 to 12 hours to dehydrate if it's very thin like this with very little pith it's probably going to take closer to 8 hours so that's when you really want to start checking your peels if they have a thicker pith you know like if you decide to dehydrate a navel orange with the entire pith in place instead of just doing the zest it's probably gonna take closer to 12 hours now if you want to do this in your oven if you don't want to use your electrically hydrator or if you don't have one it's very easy to do basically you're just gonna want a baking sheet like this with a rack like this just put that onto your baking sheet and then again just like you did with your dehydrator sheet you're just going to go ahead and you're going to put your citrus peel on it right like that and you're going to want to set your oven at 175 degrees now in an oven dehydrating citrus peel it's probably gonna take about 4 hours you'll want to check it at that point and again like with a dehydrator if it's a very thin peel like this with very little piss it's probably gonna be ready in 4 hours if it's a much thicker pith like as I said a navel orange you're gonna want to probably let it go a little longer but you'll know because you're going to want it to be very dry and very crisp now this is a batch of citrus peel the mandarin orange peels that I dried in the oven at 175 degrees for about 4 hours and you'll see they're very dry they're hard they're crisp see you can break them right in half that's exactly what you're looking for now what can you do with these citrus peels well there's a lot of things you can do one of the best things to do is to grind these up either in one of those little mini chopped food processors or in a little coffee bean grinder and make them into a powder and then you can mix them into sugars you can mix them into salts you can mix them with herbs or you can just leave them plain and use them in various recipes they're wonderful in baking they're wonderful in seasoning roast chicken or any dish for that matter if you'd like to learn more about dehydrating be sure to subscribe to my channel and then click on this video over here where I show you how to make crispy citrus chips they're delicious and I'll see you over there in my Texas Hill Country kitchen love and God bless", "vv_N-LNO60o": "if you watch my Twitter Johal vo I love that sweet and dried lemon slices and the orange slices and I started thinking I'm gonna slice them up and I'm gonna make a simple syrup with just white sugar and water and I'm gonna put all of these in there once this slice I'm also going to Meyer lemons that I got from the grocery store and I'm gonna slice these up and also put them in that simple sugar and dehydrate them and we'll see how they turn out okay guys what I've done is I've put three cups of water into the saucepan two cups of sugar [Music] there's one and there's two then I'll squeeze just a little bit of the orange juice from the ends of the orange and cinnamon stick in there and well it could be until it becomes a simple sugar so once I get started with that I'll come back okay now I've got my water and sugar and cinnamon boiling you want to wash these really really good because you're not going to peel this this is all going to be sliced about 1/4 inch thick okay so after I'm done washing them we'll start slicing just gonna dry them off just a little bit you're gonna get wet anyway but [Music] okay so now I have my bowl yeah think about that thick quarter of an inch these are gonna be so good you guys I've got the simple syrup simmering on the stove take these two and squeeze the juice into the simple syrup once it's done homegrown oranges are so good and he orange trees you want to keep that right on cuz that is really good dried how pretty is that the dried apples you can also do dried oranges for crafts okay when I'm done with this and they get into the simple syrup I'll be back okay guys here are my orange and lemon why are you here are my orange and lemon slices the simple syrup is boiling I'm gonna turn down a little bit and now we're gonna start adding once I get all these in and they've been simmering I'll come back and show you and then we'll put them into the dehydrator and I'm gonna leave this for 20 minutes and I'm going to come back and turn it down to a simmer after the 20 minutes on medium high and let them simmer for 10 minutes and then I'm gonna put them on I might the hydrator racks and then don't throw the syrup away when you're done put it in the refrigerator and then you can use it for different things okay I'll be okay I got my dehydrator out I'll be plugging that in and then when I get everything where it's supposed to be I'll come back and show you okay they're almost done what I'm going to do now is I'm going to let them simmer another ten minutes I'm gonna take them off let them cool and then I will put them on the racks of the dehydrator and I'll show you okay guys it's ready and I've washed my hands I am just gonna do this with my hand when the oven I believe it was 240 for seven hours six or seven hours if you do it in the oven I just wanted to show you how I did that and then I'll put them on the rest of my racks and then I'll show okay everyone the orange slices are done and they are beautiful now I can tell what I'm gonna be doing from now on guys this is what sometimes at night when I'm watching TV this is what I'll eat for desserts well I used to always eat the Trader Joe's now I can make my own oh my gosh let me get the package we'll see what it looks like okay there's the package and here's mine oh my gosh these are so good you guys you need to try this if you like dried fruit you need to try it oh my gosh okay I'm gonna put these a plate and then I'll be right back okay everyone I put them on a plate so you can see and here are the oranges here are the Myers lemons and here are the tangerines is that beautiful or what and let me tell you they are delicious and I added like I said I added a little bit of cinnamon this is the way to go if you like dried fruit and I'm going to show you also how I use these in my tea and I like I say I would buy them from Trader Joe's now I can make my own okay I just wanted to let you see this and I will be back to show you what I do with my team okay remember I told you I was going to show you how I drank my tea well this is what I do right now I'm hooked on this one and I drink a lot of the celestial teas because they're caffeine free and I love the flavors this cinnamon apple spice already has a sweetness to it not real sweet but a little bit anyway what I add to this is I take two of the teabags and then I buy the cinnamon the little cinnamon candies like this put it in to the cup and this was boiling water and then I used to take the Trader Joe's dried oranges and now I have my own that I made I let this steep for about 10 minutes take the teabag out leave well the cinnamon candy is dissolved and since this is cinnamon it just enhances the cinnamon flavor and the orange I don't know what it does but it's really good so that is the way I am drinking my tea today people so I told you I will show you and I did okay about 10 minutes and that is one good cup of tea people [Music]", "2k9Csr-iKx8": "hi guys Chris at the automat recycler time for a test on my worms again and this time citrus lemons more specifically now this is traditionally a no-no for worms you find many people throughout the internet and on forums and Facebook groups say don't feed lemons do worms they're too acidic or whatever other reason they have generally reading lists that citrus is a no-go so it's time for us to do a test you can't please come off a tree over the road some had fallen onto the ground some are a bit spotty I'm not sure what's going on with it they might have some sort of disease but some actually look quite good they all smell very lemony so we'll slice these up and put them sure the mulcher and then we'll try the worms out and just see what happens okay I've sliced all these lemons up so they can fit through the hakama mulcher so let's put them through and turn them into worm food [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay there we go when life gives you lemons mulch them here we go we've got a nice slurry oh very juicy so this will be a really good test we'll spread them in the worm farm now and we'll see how they go so this section of this garden bed hasn't had anything for quite a while and I just dug through it before and got all the fibrous roots out because the plants roots seem to be attracted to this rapidly increasing fertility certainly the wound castings are just beautiful black gold for your garden so in this spot I couldn't actually I think I found one or two worms in here so they've clearly finished what they were eating in gone elsewhere so now we're gonna add all these mulch lemons it was about three-quarters of a bucket full of lemons and now they're all spread around in this garden so we'll give a good layer I said they're very wet and juicy they'll possibly heat up a bit like um like nitrogen rich foods do and then I'll start to break down and it'll be really interesting to see if the worms come back into this spot and it'll be a really good test like everything I've gone fairly extreme i've always included a few lemons and citrus in my food mixes and has never been a problem the next an extreme test will soon tell you just how much worms like or dislike the lemons the good thing about doing it in a and outside garden area like this is that they can keep away if they don't like it whereas you probably wouldn't you certainly wouldn't put this much citrus you know in an enclosed a small worm bin but for the purposes of testing the foods the food like ability this should work really well so we'll check back in maybe a couple of weeks and just see how it's going so it's been two weeks since I've put the lemon mulching here and I've resisted the urge to have a peek so now unveil it well it's gone mouldy big time so things are gonna happen a little bit slower to this time of the year it's been quite cold here it's just into July middle of winter and we've had some really wicked Frost's so that's kind of slowdown activity well look at this now I only found one worm when I dug this garden bed through before putting these lemons in and in two weeks time they've gone moldy and underneath the top layer there's worms now it was very juicy too you may remember so the lemon juice would have soaked into this soil so let's dig a big chunk out in the middle yeah well there's not a lot of worms but the fact that no this little one the fact that I'm seeing more worms now than what I did when I dug this garden bed over because it had gone but have gone a few weeks without any food and the worms had moved elsewhere so the fact that they've come back to this spot through that soil all the other worm castings underneath that was soaked in lemon juice and they're now getting into this is really promising so it's an extreme dose of citrus alright given there they're not they're not crazy about it if this was some if this was a mixture of say watermelon or apples or peaches or some of the other experiments that have had success with I would imagine the wounds would be right through this now but it's a really promising sign that even in the cold weather within a couple of weeks won't seem to be coming back looking for food yep there's one straight off there another one in there little ones so I'm concluding from this that there's no issues with their list not severe issues with any toxicity or high acidity from citrus it may take a little bit longer to break down but then again as I said the cold weather is probably influencing that so we'll leave this run for another couple of weeks and then we'll have another look before I close off this experiment okay a further two weeks have passed time for the final wrap-up of the experiment with lemons I haven't had a look so let's see what we've got okay here we go positive results the lemons are disappearing there's big areas where there's just worms what quite a lot of them the molds kind of gone now but the worms are moving in and just by the look at this I'd say at least a quarter or a third of these lemons have actually gone now there's some fresh castings around the edges and there's plenty of worms working their way out from underneath and getting into these lemons so that's very conclusive in my mind there's absolutely no issues with the acidity from citrus look at these lots of wounds right through it working their way up and I would say if I check this again in another two weeks all these had be gone so in conclusion a successful experiment there's no issues with feeding citrus to worms as I mentioned earlier it's been very cold so perhaps they've been a bit slow eating and they would be slow eating anything but definitely myth busted you can safely feed certainly is small quantities of citrus in any worm bin this was an extreme case and they're still managing to deal with it so I'm pleased - that was I hope you've got something from this just goes to show that you can't believe everything you read or see on the Internet and that's why I like to do my own tests for my own peace of mind and and knowledge so thanks for watching we'll get my next video on doing trials on worms all the time until when bye", "WEKHESRlXxg": "I own this from night aircrafts Australia and today we are going to be making three fruits marmalade to make three fruits marmalade you are going to need three grapefruit two oranges and one lemon plus the juice of two to three lemons you will need ten cups of water and sugar which will equal the amount of fruit once it's cooked you'll also need extra pips we save the pips from any citrus fruit that we eat and we freeze them ready for use in making the marmalade the advantage of having extra pips is that they add pectin to the mixture which helps it to sit you will also need a stocking that hasn't been worn ever tie the ends and then put the pips into the stocking and these will then soak it with the fruit and the water overnight before we cook the mixture tie them off so that they don't come out of this stocking bag into the cooking pot where it will soak overnight with the fruit and the water and the extra lemon juice I use a mandolin to slice the fruit because you get nice thin slices all of an even thickness however if you don't have a mandolin you'll just use a knife to cut them as thinly as possible prior to slicing them all up you will need to cut any defects from the skin or the rind of the fruit we're using Washington navel oranges these don't have seen but the additional seeds will compensate for that so just cut off the stalk section and the end of the orange check the orange for any major defects which that one's not too bad and the same with the grapefruit you just want to remove the little core of the stem once you've trimmed up the fruit its then ready for slicing again if using a mandolin take care as they are extremely sharp using a handguard is the best and safest option when slicing with the mandolin if you're using a mandolin use the insert that has the little tooth touch menteur that will julienned the fruit so that what you're getting is fruit that is cut into fine strips rather than round slices you can to start off with just hold the fruit with your hands if you find that the hand grip is too small for the fruit but as you get towards the end of the fruit you will need to use the hand grip because it is too dangerous to be slicing the fruit right to the very end using only your hand as you're slicing the fruit with the seeds in them check every cell every few slices for any obvious pips and just remove them as you go to add to the pips supply at the end just in order not to waste any the little bits that you have left over after you finished mandoline mandoline or find julienning the fruit just trim them up into small bits and add them to the pot as well all the citrus fruit gets used the skin and the flesh so apparent from the trimmings at the end of the fruit the stem and the base the whole fruit is used including the seeds which add they're part of setting the fruit and make sure that at the very start you give the fruit a thorough wash because you're using the skin you to make sure that there's no contaminants on the skin before you chop them up once you've got everything julienned up and you've added your bag of seeds add in the extra juice from the two to three lemons and then add the ten cups of water this mixture will now be allowed to sit overnight just covered with a tea towel and the next step will be the cooking of it having soaked the fruit overnight you then put it on the stove and bring it to a simmer it will take about half an hour to reach simmering point at this stage you will need to remove the bag of seeds and using a gloved hand you will need to squeeze out all the liquid from the bag of seeds what should come out should be a gelatinous liquid if need be just use a knife to help scrape away any of the liquid into the pot this liquid is important in helping the mixture to set the mixture will now be tipped into a container to measure the volume we will need to match the volume with sugar added so we tip the mixture into a sauce and just to gauge how much volume we have it's best to wear an apron as it's likely to splatter a little bit and be careful as it will be hot you don't need to get every little bit out of the pan as it's only a rough guide as to how much sugar we will need so the pan is about an inch from the top in marmalade mixture we will need to measure sugar to an equal volume I an inch from the top to add to the pan to the pan I'm adding ordinary white sugar to the same volume as we had marmalade mixture we need to take it to an inch from the top this sugar is then added to the marmalade mixture just great any sugar that's stuck to the sauce spoon into the nominate mixture and then you will need to stir until it has dissolved just keep stirring until the sugar has dissolved you'll be able to feel the grittiness over fully dissolved you will then need to return it to the simmer and simmer it for anywhere from half an hour to one hour on a slow simmer after half an hour you will need to check to see if it has reached setting point if it hasn't reached setting point by one hour it is unlikely to ever reach setting point should this occur you will need to add some Jam set in which you can buy at your local supermarket to test for setting get a saucer or small plate put it in the fridge for as long as you can and then bring it out cold and put a small amount of the marmalade mixture onto the plate if the plate is cold enough that this will cool the marmalade fairly quickly as you can see this is still fairly runny so it is not going to reach a setting point yet we will test it again in another 15 to 20 minutes remembering to stand stir the pot periodically to stop it catching on the bottom this is a second testing of whether it is read the setting point it is not nearly as runny as it was before and it is forming a slight skin on the surface so at this point it is safe to bottle it using your sterilized jug you can fill the jars that have come straight from the oven and then put them on the bench to cool slightly when filling the jazz leave a space at the top approximately half an inch if you fill them too full they tend not to see at this point having filled all the jazz we can now go ahead and tighten the lids on them all so we now just leave them to cool and wait to hear the Pops and then they can be labeled and if you're selling them at a fete or a store you can make nice little caps for them paper caps don't feel that you have to buy new jars and lids you can recycle jars that have been previously filled and used just make sure that you clean them thoroughly heat the Jazz 200 degrees in the oven to stir a tree sterilize them and boil the caps in boiling water for a few minutes to sterilize those as well please subscribe and watch further videos from night aircrafts Australia thank you", "uDEApj54eCw": "hi everyone well today I'm gonna be\nharvesting some citrus now I'm pretty sure I have one or two oranges ready and\nthe little dwarf orange tree I've been growing for a couple of years and\nhopefully even a lemon or two let's check that at the end of the video now I\ncannot wait for the taste of fresh juicy citrus that I grew right here in my own\nSouthern California backyard but citrus could be a little bit of tricky because\nit doesn't ripen off the tree so you really have to make sure it's ripe\nbefore you harvest it for the best flavor so let's take a look at the\norange tree and we'll see how things are looking\nwell this dwarf orange tree has been growing here for about three years and I\ncould swear the tag at the nursery said it was a lemon tree the first year\ndidn't get any fruit the second year you could imagine my surprise when two\noranges started growing well this year I tried to be more regular with\nfertilizing gave it Good Dirt Plant Food and Vermisterra worm castings on a\nregular basis so I am really excited to have a few more to harvest this year now\none of the clues that citrus is ready to harvest is when it changes to its true\ncolor and for oranges it means obviously they'll be orange there won't be green\nleft on it so we're going to check the color in just a second but the second\nclue that tells you if citrus is ready to harvest is if it pulls off easily or\nif it falls and you can see right here I have got a orange that fell off\nno green left on the little top of the orange here now the third clue though is\nto do a taste test of one of the oranges and that might be an indication if it's\nripe if the rest of the oranges are ready to harvest\nso let's go ahead and do a taste test on this one so I'm gonna go ahead and dig\ninto this one Oh looks so good wow that looks absolutely beautiful let's cut off\na slice and give it a try I am so excited to try this you guys I\nhave been looking forward to this for so long and I'm hoping it's not overripe\nbecause I think it fell off the tree a couple of days ago mmm oh my gosh it is\nperfect it is just juicy mmm Wow the flavor is absolutely amazing so if this\nis any indication how the rest of the oranges are gonna taste I can't wait\nwell the oranges are looking happy and they definitely pass the taste test\nlet's check the ones on the tree to see if they pass the color test too so here\nyou can get a better idea of the size of this little dwarf tree it's really\nperfect to grow in a container if you don't have a lot of space and I'm sorry\nyou don't know what size that container is let's go in for a closer look\nand if there's no green left around the tops near where the stems are that means\nthe oranges are ready to harvest so let's check these three right down here looks like there's definitely a little\nbit of green on that one this one still does have some green tinges as does this\none too so we're going to actually leave those but keep a really close eye on\nthem over the next week or so now the oranges up top here are looking\nabsolutely beautiful no green around the stems the color is\njust the most gorgeous color of orange so let's harvest these today\nnow when harvesting citrus I like to cut them from the stem rather than pull them\nfrom the stem that way you don't damage the peel and then they keep longer\nalthough we'll probably eat these within a couple of days so I don't think\nthey'll last long anyway now there is a little bit of green here at the top but\nit's mostly orange so I'm just gonna give it a little bit of snip oh this\nlooks absolutely amazing I can't believe I'm picking citrus from my own backyard\nsnip that one these are absolutely delicious I think we're just gonna eat\nthem fresh just like this well now that I have my delicious orange\nharvest let's go check out the lemon tree the lemon tree is up here on the\nside of my house up closer to my kitchen you can see we've got the furniture\ncovered there because of the rain so let's check it out\nso there's definitely several lemons growing on this tree it's in like a half\nwhiskey barrel type container and I've had this planted in here for a little\nover a year actually got a couple of lemons off it the first year so you can\nsee there's several that are actually still pretty green here it's 1 2 3 4\nlooks like this one might be a little more promising don't see any green\naround the top so let's go ahead and harvest this one so we're just gonna go\nahead and snip it off wow this looks so so beautiful I think I'll make some\nlemon chicken tonight I hope you enjoyed my sunny citrus harvest today especially\nif you're in the dead of winter where you live hopefully this brought some\nsunny Southern California warmth your way well I'm still learning about\ngrowing citrus they'll comment below let me know all your citrus growing and\nharvesting tips and make sure you check out my seed and

easily and quickly you can remove wax from your fruit so like lemons or limes citrus fruit the fruit that you want to zest for example and you can't find unwaxed varieties so let's begin so what you're gonna need you're gonna need obviously your citrus fruits so I've got lemon and I've got a lime they both waxed you're going to need some kind of like a bigger blow and like a small little jar perhaps or something like this ramekin and so I'm gonna put their lemon in there and you also gonna need a kettle with boiled water so that kettle just boiled so what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna pour it on the outside of the fruit just like this just a few times and then you could swap it around as well just to make sure the bottom bit is also covered and then take a a paper towel and just wipe the wax off so because the wax is hits it it'll come off the fruit quite easily so that's as simple as that and I'm gonna do the same with my lime here so just pour it on to kind of heat the surface and then it's ready to be wiped down by a clean piece of paper towel - to get that wax off and that is this I mean if you're not certain that you removed it all you could concur a piece it cover the tires and use a fresh towel again but that's pretty much good to go to zest now this was a waxed a waxed lemon and now you've got yourself and unwaxed lemon so I hope this tip was useful to you and and you can use this in a pinch when you can't find the unwaxed lemons or limes so if you like this video give me a thumbs up subscribe and hit that Bell button for more videos just like this with

down here in the southeast of the UK and I've had a number of people requesting further updates and information on the citrus trees so I thought why not show you how the trees are getting on in early winter as we're coming into December now and the pros and the cons of growing citrus trees outside here in the UK I know I've mentioned in previous videos that I grow my citrus trees outside in the ground perm a little all year round and they do pretty well with the climatic conditions that I have here it is quite a microclimate in this area and particularly in the areas in my garden so that benefits from the trees benefit from that the tree that essentially behind me is a young it's a tangerine and Clementine variety I'm not quite sure the variety of it the reason you can tell from that is because there's this sort of pinnate leaf shape it's kind of sort of a pointed into it it set the fruit has set on it at the moment this won't be ready now until spring they'll kind of they'll probably orange up over the winter because actually for citrus trees it's the cold nights that encouraged the orange color that we get on the fruits if you growing citrus in warmer climates when I went to Ghana I saw a lot of orange trees and the fruits they sell on the roadsides are still green it's the greenish tinge because they don't get chill time and the cold weather to be able to turn the fruit to an orange color so at the moment they're still green you can kind of see the size of them it has set quite a quite a few on this tree it's only still a young tree this has been in the ground two years now so we're coming into the third winter for it same with all the rest of the fruit trees but I had moved some of them around I thought this morning to show you around and see how the trees are doing through two years in the ground in the southeast of the UK and a protected climate you can see how they getting on so the first tree I want to show you is the lemon tree that has been planted it's planted actually just under the bananas the bananas go up way up way up there you can see them bananas will always get in if you're in the wind you get these high shredded leaves I don't mind it some people don't like it some people like them to look you know neat and sort of together like a banana tree so that should but the lemon tree and it here has put on quite a bit of growth this summer actually it sort of set for a while and eventually it's put on sort of a big growth Oh the fact is whenever you plant new citrus trees in the ground then you probably won't really get much fruit off for the first couple of years it's just putting all its energy into growing which I don't mind because that's part of you know getting it up to size with all citrus trees you want to provide a really good mulch for the roots and so they like that the shallow feeders and so the rich organic nutrients that they get is from things that are broken down on the surface of the soil so as you can see under here is a good mulch of banana leaves and all kinds of stuff and that's in there but just sort of to keep over the roots of the tree and you can see that it's in pretty good condition for being outside these nice big glossy leaves that you can see and it's actually sort of it doesn't take a lot for it to this is the new growth that you get on it from here so you can see the red tiny little bits that'll be the new leaf it's a Eureka lemon variety this one and so when it flushes out new leaves they flush out red and the bananas actually stand above it there was actually a fruit on this banana here see the bunch up there actually with bananas and some so whilst I'm talking about it they once they fruit like this that's the end of that planter this plant here will come out once probably I'm thinkin maybe early spring hopefully in the fruit should ripen up and I can show you guys what the mr. berry fruit looks like it's full of seeds but I'll show you probably that in the early spring summer we brighten up for now this sort of just slow growing here over winter you can see the size of the trunks they get let me see my hand here against this shrunk there big big things and so it's pushing out the there is a wooden edge on there you can see it's pushing out from their bow on a site like this that's just the bananas they stay out all year and the leaves will burn back on some of the Frost's that we get that they don't need any protection they are absolutely fine here the way we just sit there this is the young Clementine / tangerine tree that I showed you about so this is the is the fruit that it kind of sets gets a little bit bigger than this by the time it's ready but it's set quite a few over the tree and these should be sort of ready by early summer spring summer time they're quite good cuz I'll sit on the tree actually they don't they'll sort of stay there so you can sort of pick them at leisure and they look quite nice glowing orange you see they're starting to take on a slightly orange e tinge to them now but apart from that they're still green at the moment we're still in just to come into early winter so the next tree is the lime tree this is a bear's lime I'd used to think it I thought it was a key lime but it has these big oil thorns on it you can see here but I've moved it because they were brief they were for a while over with the other trees but didn't figured out it wasn't not really the best location for them because then by the time they grow them up shading each other so it's been moved over here next to the FOA pineapple guava so it's up against a nice sunny spot and just out from from the FOA I've moved the kumquat into the middle of the garden these are a very highly citrus and worth growing I lost some leaves in the transplant of it but it's recovering now so that should do well and hopefully grow and fill this space down here so there's the lime on that side actually interesting the fahara also is a wintertime producer and see down the base here this is one of the fruits that it produces it's a pineapple guava fruit you know when these are ripe because they drop it did actually be juice a couple last year but I didn't actually film them so when this one's ripe and it falls off onto the floor I'll show you a video on on what the fruit looks like on the inside but that's not ready yet so that's the pineapple guava it's just under a loquat tree actually this growing up beside that is the kaffir lime these are so good for cooking the leaves just to just add that to a Thai dimension that you don't get without any other leaf using in cooking and curries and things it's just at the moment it's out here just under the local I may plant it somewhere around there and keep it as a small shrub because actually underneath an evergreen tree it protects it from the frost so it's worth doing alongside that is the set Summa theologia sets thing about this is a really worthwhile citrus to try and grow in the UK its own highly 2:8 and it is actually I've found one of the hardiest citrus along with the kumquat that I grow here and so I may even at some point get one a small client and try one up at the allotment which is a more exposed area it sets some fruit but I pulled it off because I wanted to just to get growing get some leaf on it and get up to size before I let its s them through it flowered profusely in a spring Lowe's although the flowers looks really nice but I pulled the fruit off of it and that's the owari Satsuma I'd recommend one of those next to that is the grapefruit which Isis talked about in the other video these are the young grapefruits that it has set and startin you can see the flowers for the winter flowers are starting to come on to it as well so that's some of the citrus trees above I've got currently growing outside they've now been 2 or 3 years pros and cons with kind of doing it is that you need to be fairly on top of with the weather you need to sort of not be a fanatic but you know you need to kind of be aware of cold snaps we're having one at the moment daytime temperatures today I think is only getting up to nine degrees and so it's been chilly overnight as well we've had sort of nights around sort of 1/2 degrees here in the in the Ipswich area and so it's been quite sort of cold but these have no protection they had no protection last winter and so I haven't as of yet protected them I may the only reason with this one to protect is because of the fruit getting damaged on any you know sort of - 1-2 and below that sort of night so it's worthwhile sort of watching the weather so that's when you plant six trees outside you need to be aware of what the weather is doing that's opposed obviously Department apart in a greenhouse yeah but I worry so much the advantage with growing the mass sizes that they do look better they have more nutrients home Ruth you're not relying on fertilizers and things like that to be able to paint with growth you can put good lots of marches down and I think this show in the state of the trees they've got a nice dark glossy leaf they look healthy and a healthy trees might be more like to get throughout the cold winter so that's the trees and how they're getting on I'll give you more updates perhaps over winter or in the spring when the weather starts to warm up again but I hope you're all well and for all those who want to see the citrus trees this is how they're doing and I'll speak to you soon take it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]", "MGFrzmSm5nA": "okay today it's all about choosing citrus varieties that's up next hello everyone this is Duane with edge of nowhere farm and we're coming to you today it is early morning September 2019 so we're continuing our series today on what varieties we're choosing to put in the ground on the new farm so today we're gonna be focusing on citrus obviously we're here in Arizona and this is one of just a handful of states in the United States that can actually grow citrus on a commercial scale our weather is almost ideal in fact I'd say probably is ideal for citrus so citrus generally does very very well here so what we're gonna do today is we're going to be focusing on exactly what varieties we're going to be choosing to put on the new farm but also just covering citrus in general so that you can make a good choice especially if you're here in Arizona as to what citrus varieties to put in the ground the first thing I want to do is focus on our two priorities that we have here on the farm as far as what varieties we decide to choose on the first one would be productivity we're going to be focusing on varieties that are very very productive and proven producers as far as heavy heavy production that would be our priority number one priority number two would be low maintenance we want to have trees that don't require a lot of input from us we have a lot of fruit trees on this property we have about a hundred on that property we're looking at probably about 150 to 200 different fruit trees so we need to make sure that none of our fruit trees are gonna require a lot of input from us so let's go ahead and get started with oranges which would be the one thing that I think most of us are most interested in first thing would be what you see behind me here there's a group of trees that are named after our state and that would be your Arizona sweet varieties what you see behind me here would be a trivita Orange now there's a few different varieties the trivita is the only one that we've tried you can see the tree behind me here we've talked a little bit about this tree before you can see it's struggling just a little bit I'm confident that that's the rootstock that this is on we're not going to talk about rootstocks today but I do want to talk about the fruit itself the fruit itself is a little bit on the small side so it's not very large however it's extremely sweet so it's a very very good tasting variety definitely takes on that Arizona sweet moniker really really well fantastic sweet fruit next tree behind me here would be a Valencia orange again there are multiple variety options within the Valencia category and this one is a midnight Valencia the fruit is very very large it's about the size of a grapefruit very very big fruit the fruit quality itself I wouldn't say is quite as good as the trevita however a very productive tree there's multiple there's dozens of fruit on here and we really didn't need to do much in the way of thinning so very low maintenance so what you see behind me here would be a blood orange we really like blood oranges this particular tree is struggling a little bit because it's out here in just horrible horrible soil we have this at the front of the house so we really have it more for looks than anything however at a couple years old it's actually very very productive so as small as the tree is it's probably got hmm probably about a dozen fruit on it at two years old in horrible soil production-wise already doing really really well so next step would be a carrot carrot orange we really like this because it's basically a navel orange I'm really looking forward to at tasting this for the first time if we're still here but a very productive tree so again up here in the front of the house horrible soil a couple years old you can see the trees small but it's got I don't know probably a couple dozen fruit on there so have to definitely do some additional thinning on here we didn't realize but a very good variety as well your carrot carrot orange so next category which is very very close to your oranges would be mandarins so mandarins you'll see multiple varieties behind me here mandarins are nice because the trees themselves are more of a dwarf semi dwarf even though a couple of behind me here maybe look a little bigger however they're a little bit smaller so we like to plant these kind of in bunches which is what you see behind me here part of that is because it does offer a little bit of natural protection mandarins are actually directly from China so that's really coarse part of the name would be Mandarin but they really do like that cooler weather so a heat of the summer can be a challenge sometimes with this particular type of fruit however let's talk about specific varieties so first variety we want to talk about would be a daisy mandarin you'll see that behind me now this tree is just incredible now this is the one citrus variety that we actually purchased from read at RSI growers I'll link the video we did on his nursery here that is our go-to nursery for citrus and for almost every fruit tree we're gonna have and this is why this tree it there's so much production it's literally blowing the tree down it's just overloaded with fruit we pulled about 50% of the fruit off here we probably should have actually pulled more it fruited very very young it freed it out a year old and it's been fruiting heavily ever since so a very very sweet just wonderful tasting fruit very very good variety very high production so the next variety here for your mandarins this would actually be your gold nugget Mandarin this Mandarin is actually fruiting for the first time for us this year so don't have an idea yet what the fruit quality is going to taste like however production very very good production on this tree this tree you can see just a wonderful looking tree productivity there's fruit all over the place we got several dozen fruit on this tree and a couple years old production looks fantastic the next step would be a pixie Mandarin you'll see that behind me here now this tree again a couple years old a fantastic looking tree however we don't have a single fruit on this we didn't even get any flowering on this tree this year so this one not a hundred percent sure I think we probably still will probably try it however no production on it yet next variety would be a Noir a Satsuma so now this tree as you can see is really really struggling so it actually has a lot of protection back here it's between our loquat and our Pixy Mandarin here you can see the Daisy Mandarin back here in the background but this tree has struggled from the very beginning now this tree we did get from Costco we've struggled with Costco trees I know the root stock is inferior there's no question about that this is a Noir Esat suma one of the things that we were discussing with Reed at our site growers when we were giving him our list of citrus trees he did say that Satsuma varieties are very very difficult and very temperamental so we probably won't try a Satsuma there only because they need a much higher humidity that obviously we just don't have out here in the desert so this one really gonna be a struggle the next category of fruit we're gonna basically just lump into grapefruit we've got a couple of those varieties here what you're gonna see behind me here would be a ruby red grapefruit we really like this variety it's a fantastic tasting variety the tree itself is just over productive we've had to thin this tree very heavily for the last couple of years it was productive at an early age it's just a very very productive tree gives you nice big red fleshed Ruby of course great fruit but a fantastic producer really loved this tree so what you see behind me here would be a pomelo so this is actually the Chandler pomelo one of the things about our pomelo tree you can see it's a little stunted the the reason for that is our frost so this tree really struggled through the frost in fact we thought we may have lost it all of the leaves died back on this tree we did get a little bit of production so we did get a couple of fellows off of it last year it wasn't really impressed with the fruit quality however it is a very young tree and I think we actually picked them just a little bit late however really struggles with our winters out here in Whitman so once we got down into the 20s this started getting a tremendous amount of die back so this one I think is questionable the next step would be limes and lemons so what you see behind me here would be our Bears lime tree that's brss so the Bears lime the Bears lime is a fantastic variety of lime for us here in Arizona extremely productive this tree is over productive however because of the fruit size you don't need to do much in the way of thinning so it's an extremely low maintenance tree we essentially prune for shape more than anything we have to thin zero because once the tree starts producing fruit you can start harvesting as soon as they're probably about the size of a golf ball so you can get very early production have production all through the summer and into the fall very heavy production very low maintenance a fantastic variety for us here in Arizona so next up would be our Meyer lemon it's gone so we don't have a Meyer lemon anymore this tree actually died back I'll link the video for you here if you want to take a look at it but this was the home of our Meyer lemon tree it struggled from the very beginning I know Meyer lemons can be very temperamental having done some research on it now the fruit itself that the tree itself was actually very productive when it was alive but the tree is now gone so not too sure whether that was rootstock or the variety itself I do know that Meyer lemons can be temperamental so they can be a little bit difficult to grow fruit quality was okay and production was decent so whether or not we'll try this I'm not too sure but what you see behind me here is a Eureka lemon this tree has been just abused we originally had it in the same spot as the Meyer lemon transplanted into a pot in the middle of summer a couple years ago and then finally put it in its permanent hoenn up a home up here the tree is planted in horrible soil right up here in front of the house but it is doing fantastic we actually had to thin this tree about 70% so we took the majority of the fruit off of this tree because it was such heavy production it was pulling the entire tree down it's at the front of the house so we didn't want to have that from a visual standpoint we didn't want to have that happening so we did thin it very very heavily however still producing really really well we have several dozen fruit on here still very high productive tree and very good fruit quality so now that we've covered all of the different citrus varieties let's dig down into the nitty-gritty and decide on varieties they're really for me focusing on the two key priorities of production and low maintenance for me the first thing that comes to mind would be limes and lemons now the reason why I say that is they're very very productive trees they're extremely low maintenance you can essentially let them go and you don't even have to thin for the most part and they're also very useful these are varieties that you can be harvesting when they're green in the case of lemons and of course limes however you can harvest them all summer long and into the fall and winter so you have an extremely long harvest season they're very very useful obviously you can use them in cooking you can use them to make drinks you can use them to make wine for me if you were going to decide on one or two trees a lime and a lemon would really be your go-to we've talked about the Bears lime today we've also talked about the Eureka lemon those would be my two go-to varieties for you here in Arizona so next up would of course be your oranges I think that's is the focus for all of us if I had to narrow it down to one variety I would take an Arizona sweet variety over any other orange tree here in Arizona choose which variety you want we do really like the trevita that's the one we're gonna go with because we have experience with it but you really can't go wrong with any of the Arizona sweet varieties after that if you're a fan of mandarins which we are the Daisy Mandarin hands-down would be your best bet when you're looking at grapefruit the ruby red grapefruit I think any of the grapefruit varieties would be fine we like the ruby red because it has a sweeter flavor than the other grapefruit varieties but again any one of those grapefruits I think you'd be just fine here in Arizona overall when it comes to citrus I think one of the key things with citrus for us here in Arizona is getting the right root stock we've talked a lot about Reed at our site growers but there are multiple nurseries here in Arizona that actually grow their trees here there's one on the east side of town I think it's Greenfield nursery if I'm not mistaken and of course Reed on the central and west side of town would be a great option as far as getting the right root stock if you get the right root stock and you choose the right variety you know you're here in Arizona citrus is one of our

very warming for\u00a0\nthe winter it's packed full of spices as well as\u00a0\u00a0 very rich in terms of vitamin c so it's got\u00a0\ngood benefits in there as well now we are\u00a0\u00a0 going to show you this marvelous recipe okay\u00a0\nlet's begin by adding in six cups of hot water and we have this at medium flame as well so let\u00a0\nit boil so here you see one full orange and you\u00a0\u00a0 see half a lemon sliced over here so this goes\u00a0\ninside so these are the orange slices and then\u00a0\u00a0 these are the lemon slices so this is the juice\u00a0\nof half an orange originally like this so we've\u00a0\u00a0 juiced half an orange and this goes inside as\u00a0\nwell gives it some extra flavor now one star nice two cloves one cinnamon stick now let's give it a\u00a0\nstir whilst it heats up so now we're gonna bring\u00a0\u00a0 this to a boil by increasing the intensity of\u00a0\nthe fire okay so it's come to a boil so now\u00a0\u00a0 i'm going to add in half a cup of sugar this is\u00a0\nslightly less than half but let's say half a cup now let's give it a stir so the sugar um blends in well and the aroma is coming out now\u00a0\u00a0 now we're going to add in one tea bag so what you\u00a0\nwant to do is not to squeeze the tea bag but just\u00a0\u00a0 let it sit in the in the boiling water so that\u00a0\nsome of the flavor is released so let's gently\u00a0\u00a0 stir this first and foremost and then as you have\u00a0\nstirred this we can decrease the flame to low\u00a0\u00a0 and then let's let it simmer now for the\u00a0\nnext few minutes approximately five minutes okay so it's been about five minutes of\u00a0\num simmering this so we're gonna gently\u00a0\u00a0 strain out um some of the oranges and some\u00a0\nof the lemons as well as the tea bag itself and then um we'll just transfer this into a\u00a0\nteapot um to get to the end of this recipe okay you saw how to make this orange and\u00a0\nlemon tea and what i'm gonna do over here\u00a0\u00a0 is i'm gonna show you guys by tasting\u00a0\nhow well it came out so here is my tea it is very good very good marvelous you can taste\u00a0\nobviously the main ingredients in there\u00a0\u00a0 you can taste the orange the lemons you can also\u00a0\ntaste the uh cinnamon in there that we placed\u00a0\u00a0 and the thing is that you can make this more\u00a0\nsweet if you want if you have the preference\u00a0\u00a0 of actually reducing the sugar you can do\u00a0\nso as well and i think the amount that we\u00a0\u00a0 put in was perfect we put in almost half a\u00a0\ncup of sugar i like and my family likes to\u00a0\u00a0 try different teas so this one is a new addition\u00a0\nto the teas that we've had throughout our lives\u00a0\u00a0 and i think that this is one of\u00a0\nthose recipes that we must make\u00a0\u00a0 after trying this for the first time\u00a0\nso i'm glad that we came across this\u00a0\u00a0 so that we can share this with you i'm sure if

episode for you, and once again, it\u2019s time for answering\nyour guys\u2019 questions. Wo what we\u2019re going to do today is answer\nyour questions and have a whole bunch of them listed out here. And if you do want to ask me a question, the\nbest place to get it to me is actually on my YouTube comments page or over the YouTube\nemail system. If you do post a question below the video\noften times I will read them, but don\u2019t have the opportunity to answer each and every\none because I\u2019m so busy with trying to keep my backyard garden growing. As you can see it\u2019s behind me and it looks\nbeautiful, I have all kinds of stuff growing and be sure to stay tuned for an upcoming\nupdate garden tour of what I\u2019m growing currently, which is actually a lot of stuff, easily being\nable to pick my greens for my salad, my juices and my blended smoothies every day with no\nproblem just with half my backyard covered, and pretty soon will be converting the other\nhalf. So stay tuned for that episode as well. In any case, let\u2019s get into today\u2019s questions. First question is Ramur1, \u201cJohn, can I use\npressure-treated lumber to build a raised bed garden if I line it with heavy-duty black\nplastic so no dirt is touching the wood? Thanks.\u201d All right, you can do anything you want. Now would John use pressure-treated lumber\nto build his raised bed garden even with plastic on the inside? I would absolutely not use pressure-treated\nlumber and don\u2019t encourage anyone to use pressure-treated lumber either. Before I even use pressure-treated lumber\nI would actually use a plastic-style lumber, or even better yet just use some landscaping\nblocks or some concrete cinder blocks to build a raised bed. Before even using pressure-treated lumber\nI would just use standard lumber that I treated with a non-toxic stain, and stay tuned for\nanother episode on me using some non-toxic staining to seal some of the container gardens\nor pots, wooden containers that I have. And let\u2019s see, the heavy-duty black plastic,\nthe problem with that that\u2019s going to break down over time, and then you\u2019re just going\nto have plastic fragments all mixed in with your soil. If you did really still want to do that I\u2019d\nrecommend buying a rubber pond liner, not the vinyl pond liners which are horrible. But the rubber pond liner to do that, but\nthose pond liners heavy duty expensive because I looked into all this way back before I built\nmy raised beds and I chose to build my raised beds out of cedar wood, also using redwood,\nand that\u2019s the wood that I\u2019d recommend to you guys out there, and just do the best\nyou can. Next question is from TheRedLiga1, \u201cJohn,\nyou are the garden man, I appreciate your videos, humor, candor, and incredible info\nincluding juicing comparisons. My question is, it looks like your personal\nraised beds are at least three feet deep, why are your raised beds so deep?\u201d So as you can see I\u2019m here in my backyard\ngarden, and most of the raised beds in the backyard garden here I think are about eight\ninches deep, that\u2019s about the size of the raised bed kits that I bought, and in my front\nyard garden that I have, the front of my front yard garden is about waist height. And I did that because it was a design criteria,\nnot because the plants need it. The property is sloped, so I wanted to have\nthe same level of the beds all the way back, so what I did is I started at the back of\nthe lot, and I made all the beds 12 inches deep. And then we took that level and ran it all\nthe way out to the front because the property is sloped, the front beds are taller. Now this is absolutely not necessary, this\nis a design element so that when you look at it, it looks nice, clean, and everything\u2019s\nthe same exact height and level, and just looks a lot nicer than having everything all\ndifferent levels. I don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s the way I like\nit, so it looks cleaner. So yeah, that\u2019s why it\u2019s three feet deep\nat the front of the front yard garden that I\u2019m growing, because it\u2019s a design element. That\u2019s exactly why. Otherwise I\u2019m cool with 12 inches deep,\nand you still don\u2019t even need 12 inches. I\u2019m growing eight inches deep here, everything\u2019s\ndoing really well. So the next question is Bertha Miller, \u201cJohn\nI need to have boxes to grow veggies in, we eat and juice so much food it is costing us\na small fortune to buy all organic fruits and veggies. What are the purple boxes that you use to\ngrow food in made of and where did you purchase them cost, thank you.\u201d So Bertha, so I started experimenting besides\nthe raised beds here, which are a much better cost because actually each one of these raised\nbeds, the circular ones I got on clearance for about 10 bucks, and actually the purple\nboxes that you\u2019ve seen in past videos were also ten bucks. And there\u2019s pros and cons to each one, I\nlike that this is ten dollars and it\u2019s four foot circular whereas the little purple boxes\nare about two feet by one feet, but they\u2019re self-watering, and they\u2019re movable. So depending your space, but what I see is\nthat the little small boxes are kind of good for my everyday salad greens. I planted things close in there so that I\ncould harvest them when they\u2019re young for my nightly salads, and I definitely have enough\nsalad greens just in those little purple Growums boxes. And if I was growing larger and wanted a higher\nquantity of food I would definitely get some raised beds instead of just some little boxes,\nI did have some space where I just had some concrete and I thought for ten bucks I thought\nI\u2019d experiment with them and they\u2019ve actually been working really well. And you can just fit a lot more in a larger\nfootprint or a larger area, and I always encourage you guys to develop and grow as much area\nas you can afford to, because you\u2019ll have that much more food. So they are made of plastic, I believe they\u2019re\na recycled plastic, and I got them at Lowe\u2019s and they were on clearance for ten dollars. That being said Lowes across the country is\nprobably out of them. Be sure to check my past videos, my past videos\nare a wealth of knowledge, over 750 videos now, over 50,000 subscribers so thanks to\nyou all you guys that make me the largest and most-watched gardening channel. Hopefully I\u2019m able to share good information\nwith you so that you can continue to grow more food at home. So yeah, always check my past videos, because\nif you have a question, search my videos first because I probably have answered it, because\noften times I get similar questions over and over again. So other than that you can probably order\nthem online the regular price, I got them on clearance for ten dollars, I thought they\nwere a phenomenal deal, normally they\u2019re 30 to 40 dollars each. In which case, I\u2019d much rather you guys\nget a raised bed, but for 10 bucks, self-watering, especially if you\u2019re in an apartment in\nNew York City and you can grow on a patio, they\u2019re definitely a good investment. Alright next question is from KRR, \u201cHey\nJohn, since you mess with a lot of edibles it sounds like you know a lot, but I\u2019m sure\nyou don\u2019t know everything about every plant you touch, so where do you go for your info\nif you don\u2019t know what a plant is, can you make some reference suggestions for like example,\nthe John Kohler Growing Your Greens Plant Encyclopedia and Identification Guide. It\u2019s hard to identify something if you don\u2019t\nhave a starting reference point. Any help would be appreciated, thanks, Kyle.\u201d Alright Kyle so, you know pretty much I learn\nabout the plants I do by going on wild food walks with somebody that\u2019s experienced,\nthen I can learn from them and I can physically see the plant, and then once I learn it, I\npretty much don\u2019t forget it, or at least I\u2019ll know that it\u2019s edible, I won\u2019t\nknow necessarily the name, and while I do know a lot of plants, I mainly know about\nthe edible plants. If it\u2019s an edible plant, I have no flippin\u2019\nclue what it is, so don\u2019t quiz me on non-edible plants, I probably don\u2019t know. But I know a good percentage of edible ones. Another way I learn is by going to nurseries,\nI love going to nurseries, especially those hole in the wall nurseries, just a home-grown\nnursery, not some big box store, and just wandering through the plant collections and\nfinding out and seeing with my eyes the different nursery starts, the plant starts and how they\nlook, and then I can feel and touch the plants, see how they\u2019re growing, see what they look\nlike, and also I get to know those varieties. In addition another thing I like to do is\ngo to garden and flower shows. I always learn about some new plant at garden\nand flower shows, it\u2019s really cool. Another way I also encourage you guys to learn\nand grow is by free. A free method, this is ingenious, is I like\nto get seed catalogs, especially seed catalogs that have full color pictures, and I can actually\nsee what the plant looks like, what the fruit\u2019s going to look like and the variety name, especially\nwhere there\u2019s so many varieties of some of these fruits and vegetables, especially\nsome of the uncommon ones. So I\u2019ll have an upcoming episode on my 2013\nfavorite seed catalogs coming up really soon. Another way that I really like to learn about\nthe plants and research plants online. Google\u2019s your best friend, you can Google\nand use the Google Images to try and find pictures of plants. Another thing I do also is pfaf.org, PFAF\nis Plants For A Future database, where they talk about all of the different or most all,\nI have found some edible plants that aren\u2019t in there, but most all edible plants that\nhave been on Earth, and that\u2019s a really good online free, cheap, no cost resource\nto use so that you can enhance your knowledge about edible food crops. Alright, next question is Carol RT, \u201cHello\nJohn, thanks for all the time and effort you put into your channel, I was wondering if\nyou bother with crop rotation in your raised beds or because you augment the soil continually,\nit doesn\u2019t matter so much. Thanks, Carol, Prineville, Oregon.\u201d Alright Carol, so yes, crop rotation, that\u2019s\ndefinitely a big subject. So here\u2019s the overall picture, right? I always strive to do crop rotation, I always\nstrive to grow something different every season than the last season, even the last two seasons,\nso if I grew tomatoes in one bed last season or even the season before I strive not to\ngrow tomatoes in that bed. Now you know it\u2019s always best to do crop\nrotation if you have the room. Like if I had acreage, I would absolutely\ndo crop rotation and actually have a season or a period of time where I let the grounds\ngo fallow and just planted some [inaudible] crops, and then would till them under. Unfortunately, in a small backyard situation\nor front yard situation where you don\u2019t have a lot of square footage, crop rotation\ncan be very difficult and challenging, especially trying to work in the crops that you want\nto grow instead of just crops you need to grow because it\u2019s in the crop rotation,\nI\u2019m supposed to grow the roots, then the leaves and then the fruits, and then I\u2019ve\ngot to start all over again I\u2019ve got to grow a cover crop, that\u2019s too much to think\nabout. But crop rotation in my opinion is especially\nimportant if you have some land you just happen to grow on that has not been improved. As you can see all my raised beds are filled\npainstakingly with compost, rock dust, and other soil nutrients to give the soil the\nmost nutrition in there, plus in addition I got the super-charger on, the super-charger\nis the beneficial microbes, fungi, bacteria, and all these different things in the soil\nthat actually make the nutrients in that soil more bioavailable or actually poop out, for\nlack of a better word, more nutrients so your plants can continue to grow. So in that case, while I strive to do crop\nrotation whenever possible because of the disease factor, not necessarily because of\nthe nutrition factor, I don\u2019t necessarily always get to do that. So if you do have some really good rich soil\nthat\u2019s been improved, I personally think crop rotation is not as important as it\u2019s\nmade out to be in many standard conventional acreage gardening. So hopefully that answers your question on\nthat. Next question is from MyReflection75, \u201cHello\nJohn thanks for all your time and effort sharing all your information with us, I have two questions\nfor you if you have the time. One, I\u2019ve noticed that you have shared your\nseeds with your viewers in a few videos, I would like to purchase seeds from plants that\nyou have grown yourself, is there a place where you offer seeds, cuttings or roots for\nsale? If you could make a video explaining how we\ncan get them from you and a brief summary on what climate will work best for them would\nbe amazing. Two, could you explain the difference between\nseeds that you get from plants grown in organic compost with trace minerals and the beneficial\nmicrobes added versus seeds from plants that are grown commercially? In either case I do plan on growing in compost\nthat is rich with microbes and minerals. Thank you again John, words cannot express\nthe appreciation I have for all your work.\u201d All right well thank you. So let\u2019s see, we\u2019ll answer the easiest\nquestion first. Let\u2019s see, is there a place that I offer\nmy seeds, cuttings or roots for sale? Yes I do offer small amounts of my seeds,\ncuttings \u2013 well not cuttings yet but tubers or roots available, and that\u2019s on my Facebook\npage, so you all want to go to my Growing Your Greens Facebook page and like it, and\nalso you can see the little store I have set up there for a fun hobby thing, to get some\nof these seeds and rare crops out to you guys. Now most of the time that store\u2019s absolutely\nsold out because I\u2019ll harvest seeds, I\u2019ll have it, I\u2019ll put them up there and then\nthey\u2019re gone and then I don\u2019t have anymore, because I\u2019m not just buying seeds and reselling\nthem, no I\u2019m selling you guys the seeds that I actually grew in high quality soil. And you know, that\u2019s not my business, it\u2019s\nnot my living, I do that just to get some of these rare exotic seeds out because they\nare so hard to find. Plus I need to pay for my gardening habits\nand my clearance deal runs at Lowe\u2019s and Sears and whatnot too. So yeah, so that takes care of that, and let\u2019s\nsee, so that\u2019s how you get them, go to facebook.com, search for Growing Your Greens, also I think\nit\u2019s growingyourgreens.ecwid.com is the mobile webpage, and if you don\u2019t want to\ngo to Facebook you can use the mobile website from a regular computer as well and order\nfrom there just to get to the store specifically. Let\u2019s see, \u201cCould you explain the difference\nbetween seeds that you get from plants grown in organic compost with trace minerals and\nthe beneficial microbes added versus seeds from plants that are grown commercially?\u201d So about the only way I could describe this\nis by the old adage \u201cYou are what you eat,\u201d I like to kind of change that to \u201cYou are\nwhat you eat and absorb.\u201d So we know that if people eat McDonalds and\njunk food and fast food right, they\u2019re going to be pretty unhealthy. They might be overweight, and their brain\nmight be messed up, they might go on shooting rampages and just all kinds of crazy stuff\nbecause we\u2019re meant to eat a certain kind of food and our food has gotten so deranged\nfrom commercial agriculture and from powers that be and whatnot, you know so if those\npeople try to produce babies, right, will those babies be overweight, will those babies\nhave ADHD, will those babies have allergies, will those babies maybe come out with birth\ndefects, or in the worst cases, will those people even be able to have babies? I mean the rate of infertility in today\u2019s\nsocieties are insane, I mean was there all this infertility when you guys were growing\nup? No, people would make love, have babies, and\nbe happy, but nowadays the food system\u2019s so deranged and you are what you eat, right,\nthe people are not able to have really healthy, vibrant children. So I can definitely say that about people\nand now we just want to transfer that whole concept to plants, right? If you\u2019re feeding plants NPK, which are\nwhat commercial growers for the most part feed their plants and spray them with pesticides,\nright? Yeah, you might get seeds that are duds, defective,\nand you might get seeds that have most of the same traits or genes as the parents, but\nwhat if you fed the plants exactly what they need, organic soil, the trace minerals, the\nrock dust, and also had the microbes in the soil, because there\u2019s a symbiosis between\nthe roots and the plants, and everything going on, so that now they can reproduce successfully,\nand they\u2019ll probably even be stronger genetics, have better traits, and even have more of\nthe desirable qualities. So that\u2019s the only thing I can really say\nabout that is I always encourage you guys to purchase organic seeds whenever possible,\nI mean, I\u2019d rather you guys grow some commercial untreated seeds right, I don\u2019t want you\nto by treated seeds, I\u2019d always rather you guys grow untreated commercial seeds than\nnot grow it at all, like \u201cJohn, I can\u2019t get organic chicory root seeds, so I\u2019m not\ngoing to grow it.\u201d No, no, no, no man, just get some organic\nseeds, grow it in trace minerals, rock dust, compost and the microbes in your soil, and\nthen save your seeds so that you can start enhancing the genetics that are originally\nfound in those seeds. And this is all my personal opinions about\nhow nature works, because once again I\u2019m just trying to model nature, and do what nature\nwould do and not just do some artificial diet of NPK and limited amounts of nutrients that\nconventional farming would do. So hopefully that explains that answer and\nyou understand it a little bit better. So let\u2019s see, next question is from Njinsptr,\n\u201cHey John I love the show, I was wondering where do you recommend getting tree collard\nseeds or plants? I live in New Jersey Zone 7A, will they survive\nhere? Chris from NJ.\u201d All right Chris so yes, tree collards should\nsurvive in Zone 7A, and actually just like last episode actually believe it or not I\ndid have an episode where I was offering tree collard seeds, and I do want to say once again,\nit\u2019s best to get tree collards from the cuttings, because the seeds are probably not\ntrue to seed, meaning you\u2019re not going to get the same exact plant that I\u2019m growing,\nit\u2019s not going to be an identical clone, but it may have some similar traits and you\nknow what? That\u2019s just the roulette and that\u2019s how\nit goes. Other than that I\u2019d recommend a place called\nbountifulgardens.org, they will start offering the cuttings I believe in May, and one of\nthese days when I get off my tushy tushy I might start offering some cuttings to you\nguys, we\u2019ll see how that goes. All right next question is from Mohawk1873,\n\u201cIf I grow tomato plants from seed in a cluster will they choke each other out as\nthey mature or do I have to separate them?\u201d So let\u2019s see, you do not have to separate\nthem. Will they choke each other out and will they\nproduce less if you don\u2019t? Probably. So I have had tomatoes that self-seeded in\nmy garden and came up in a big patch, and you know they produced well for me, I was\npretty happy with it, and you know in the wild, you know in the Everglades they have\nthe Everglades tomato that just grows wild everywhere, well I don\u2019t know about everywhere\nbut just grows wild. And they\u2019re fine on their own, so you know\nI always encourage you guys to divide out your plants, because it\u2019s going to be a\nlot more valuable to divide them out and space them accordingly, minimum I\u2019d do two feet\nspacing on the tomatoes to get the optimal production and give them enough space to spread\ntheir leaves out and their branches out and not get too close because then that can cause,\nif you\u2019re not getting enough air circulation, disease and whatnot. And I always encourage you guys to experiment,\nso I don\u2019t know, try it. Try some seeds in a cluster, let them grow\nwithout separating and then also have a section where you actually separate them out and make\na video about it and share your results with everybody. You know, I mean one way is [inaudible] harder,\none way is easier, and there\u2019s pros and cons of doing it each way. But experiment, try to find out and see what\nhappens. So the next question is from Jameson Knight. Oh wow he has a whole bunch of questions here. \u201cWhat is your profession, if you could,\nwould you make YouTube your profession, would you consider going to school to learn more\nabout perfecting growing your own greens, would you consider owning livestock, do you\nuse your manure, do you urinate and poo for growing any of your crops, do you upload in\n1080p, love the videos, keep it up.\u201d All right Jameson lots of questions, number\none what is my profession? Well specifically I offer the products that\n[inaudible] eat more fruits and vegetables, so I sell juicers, blenders, dehydrators,\nso I\u2019m a small kitchen appliance salesperson I guess is what you could call me. \u201cIf you could would you make YouTube your\nprofession?\u201d You know I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d make it\nmy profession, I do the Growing Your Greens show for a hobby, and I just love doing this\nstuff and I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d want to be like \u201cThis is my profession, I have to\ndo it,\u201d because when you\u2019ve got a have to do something, you guys probably don\u2019t\nwant to do it like, I rebel. My mom says \u201cOh you\u2019ve got to clean your\nplate,\u201d oh yeah screw you man, I\u2019m not going to clean my plate I\u2019m too full I\u2019m\ngoing to stop eating, you know? So yeah, I probably wouldn\u2019t want to make\nYouTube my profession, I like to do it on the side for fun. What would I like to do as my profession? That\u2019s a good question, I\u2019d probably like\nto have a farm and grow a lot of rare exotic crops and varieties and offer seeds and plants\nout to people. I think that\u2019s one of my upcoming professions,\nand I have a lot of ideas about that. Anyways \u201cWould you consider going to school\nto learn more about perfecting growing your own greens?\u201d So you know I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d go to\na traditional school where I go to college and go back to class and all this stuff I\nmean, I don\u2019t know if number one I have the patience for that, number two, I don\u2019t\nknow, I mean I\u2019d probably learn something, which would probably be good but the time\ninvested would not be a benefit to me in my opinion you know? I love what I\u2019m doing now, I learn so much\nby just gardening and growing on my own and you know I\u2019m a pretty good gardener overall,\nI know a little bit. But I\u2019m always improving what I\u2019m learning\nand what I\u2019m growing, so I\u2019ll go to different classes that different people give talks and\nI learn from them and then I can use that in my garden and I can also share that information\nwith you. I also do a lot of research and learning about\nthings online behind the scenes all the time to improve my garden but also to help you\nguys improve your gardens out there so I probably would not go back to a traditional school\nto perfect growing my own greens. I\u2019m not going to say I\u2019m perfect by any\nmeans, but I do a pretty darn good job now. \u201cWould you consider owning livestock?\u201d I guess it depends on the definition of livestock,\nso I substitute \u201cWould you consider owning animals,\u201d absolutely, I have had ducks in\nthe past, and ducks are amazing creatures, one of the best things I ever did was to keep\nsome ducks, they love to eat my snails and slugs and actually, one of the little ones\nwould actually follow me around like I was the mom, and I would pick up little pots,\nyou know black nursery pots with slugs on the bottom and there were black slugs on the\nbottom, and the duck would just see it just poof, and eat it. And then it would wag its little tail, it\nwas so cool. So yes I would absolutely have some animals\nand they would be my pets. The animals that I had on my farm would be\nmy pets, and I would treat them well and ensure that they have a happy, healthy life, and\nI\u2019d be able to utilize them in the way that would be best for me, and also let them have\na great life at the same time, so the ducks would benefit me by eating the snails and\nslugs so I don\u2019t have to deal with them and feed them they love that stuff, and then\nI would get to use their duck manure. So the next question is \u201cDo you use manure?\u201d So I do use a limited amount of compost manure\nin my gardens although I prefer to use a more vegetative food scraps, composted down. Let\u2019s see \u201cDo you urinate and poo for\ngrowing any of your crops?\u201d So I guess he means do I urinate and poo on\nmy crops? So I don\u2019t poo on my crops, I have tested\nthe waters with humanure, and one of these days I\u2019ll have a good video on that for\nyou guys, but that\u2019s definitely a long time in the making, I\u2019m not at that point yet. But I do often urinate on my crops. Don\u2019t waste your urine guys, you guys pee\nin the toilet and flush it down with 1.2 gallons of water if you have a water saving toilet\nand if you don\u2019t, it\u2019s 3 gallons of water. You\u2019re using clean water to flush perfectly\ngood nitrogen-based fertilizers down the toilet and send it away. I mean if you go to a big box store and try\nto buy some nitrogen fertilizer man, that shit\u2019s expensive. So what I do is I just like to come out on\nmy plants and take a leak at the bases. Generally it\u2019s mostly on [inaudible] crops,\nbut I do it on some trees and whatnot, because urine is a terrible thing to waste, seriously. Okay let\u2019s see, \u201cDo you upload in 1080p?\u201d Absolutely not, so I have a small Flipcam\nthat I\u2019m filming on right now, and if the file sizes were in 1080p, that\u2019d be significantly\nlarger, take a lot more computing time to process, render and save, in addition they\u2019d\ntake significantly longer to upload my videos, which I\u2019m not willing to do at this point\nbecause I just do this once again as a hobby. All right man that was a long question list\nthere. Next question is from Aaron J, \u201cHi John,\nI thoroughly enjoy your channel, the best gardening channel in my opinion keep up the\ngreat work. I was finally able to locate and purchase\nsome glacial rock dust at a local garden center, have you ever applied the rock dust via a\nwater solution in order to water the rock dust into the soil, and onto the plant foliage,\nif so, what ratio of rock dust would be appropriate per gallon of water for use on the vegetable\nplants as well as fruit trees and shrubs? Thanks.\u201d All right Aaron, in general I just mix my\nrock dust in with my plants. On occasion I have mixed the rock dust in\nwith water and then watered the plants, but I\u2019ve never foiler-fed the rock dust. A better product in my opinion to do that\nif you want to get the minerals into the plants would be the Sea 90 product, and that basically\nyou just dilute that in water and then you can spray that into the ground any of the\nplants. To me the rock dust is better actually put\nin the ground mixed in with the soil than sprayed in on top. You know I think it\u2019s definitely a synergistic\neffect if you could mix in the rock dust into your soil and then actually spray the Sea\n90s on top of the soil and then actually foiler feed that one, so that\u2019s that I\u2019d recommend\nto you. Next question is from Shane Waldrop, \u201cJohn,\nI want to go completely home garden but I need help. I have a nice start but not sure what to plant\nand arrange them. Help.\u201d All right Shane, so let\u2019s see, number one\nyou want to get a book called Square Foot Gardening by Mal Bartholemew, and that method\nwill teach you how close to plant the plants that you\u2019re growing, the next thing is you\nneed to figure out what you want to plant, so the easiest way to do that is to plant\nthings that you like to eat and plant things that are easy to grow. So that\u2019s what I recommend by starting,\ngetting the Square Foot Gardening book and follow the methods in there and just get some\nseeds or some starter plants which are a lot easier in my opinion than starting the seeds\nand just start growing for it. Yeah I like that \u201cgrowing for it,\u201d and\njust see what happens, you might have a few trials and tribulations but that\u2019s all right,\nplow through them and keep on growing is what I like to say. All right down to the next question, Justin\nHemmecker, \u201cHey John, thanks for the great channel and sharing your knowledge, you\u2019ve\ninspired me and given me the confidence that I can grow healthy food for my wife and myself. I eat a lot of oranges and use a lot of limes\nfor guacamole and margaritas. Are chopped up citrus peels okay for composting,\nor will it be detrimental to the mix? Thanks, Justin.\u201d All right Justin, this is a big question actually\nyou know, back in the traditional days [inaudible] \u201cDon\u2019t add citrus to your compost pile.\u201d And what I have to say to that is hogwash. Forget about all that stuff you\u2019ve ever\nheard, I composted literally 50% citrus, and actually my composter\u2019s sitting over there\nand I\u2019ll have an upcoming episode on that showing you my brand new cool tumbling composter,\nand loading it up with at least 50% of citrus and 50% other food scraps and a good carbon\nsource, and you know so I say yeah, go for standard heat-based composting of your oranges\nand citrus, and if you\u2019re going to do it it\u2019s best to chop them up, but even in this\ncomposter I\u2019ve had, that citrus stuff breaks down really fast, especially a lot faster\nthan some of the other things that I added in there. Now I think where this rumor started that\nyou can\u2019t compost citrus is if you do have a worm composting bin you do not want to feed\na large portion of citrus peels to your worms, they just don\u2019t like eating them. So use that in a standard compost pile and\nif you want to feed a little bit to your worms, it\u2019s cool, but they might not eat it, it\nmight just end up rotting in there which might get nasty. All right, I think we\u2019re down to the last\nquestion here, Dos Uno, that means like two one, \u201cHi I\u2019m in the beginning stages of\nbuilding a raised bed garden, and I was wondering what were your thoughts and expertise, is\npine wood good to use?\u201d So, you know it depends on your situation. Pine wood is one of the most inexpensive woods\nto use and if you\u2019re renting and you don\u2019t expect to be in a place long and you don\u2019t\nwant to spend a lot of money, pine wood would be great to use. Another thing you do want to make sure you\ncoat it with a good natural coating that\u2019s going to seal it and protect it from rotting\nfaster, because pine definitely can rot quicker than other kinds of woods. You know I\u2019d much rather you guys spend\na little bit more and maybe get some cedar or redwood, which is going to last significantly\nlonger. I have my cedar fence boards that I used in\nmy garden I just dug out one of the beds to inspect it, because I was actually harvesting\nmy Jerusalem artichokes, and even after three years now, I don\u2019t see any signs of rot. So you know and I coated it and treated it\nand all that stuff with natural stuff, so you know that\u2019s what I\u2019d recommend to\nyou, but I have other videos where I show a renter that just used pine wood because\nit\u2019s really cheap and inexpensive so it depends on your budget and your goals and\nwhat you want to do. I have used that in the past and it lasted\nmany years before it did start to rot, and depending on what your goals are, you could\nabsolutely use it. And I much rather use the pine wood than a\npressure-treated wood as I mentioned earlier in this video. Well I think that\u2019s pretty much the end\nof this question and answer session I\u2019ll have another one with all the questions on\nthe back of this page. So hopefully you guys enjoyed this episode,\nonce again, my name is John Kohler with growingyourgreens.com, we\u2019ll see you next time and remember, keep\non growing.", "TKDo5V_Kc1w": "so guys well we had no frost last night and I think he went down to four degrees humming for a couple of hours and then around 6 o'clock the Sun was out and went straight up to 10 and yep so I know I know some of you guys probably had frost last night but I'm just walking around to see if we had any damage from before degrees but I I believe four degrees she'll be okay these are almost ready to pick put some insect damage I've only caught three this year this is my moral blood orange go to I've already picked oh my kumquats or two left and you pan over here of course clementines there one looks slightly broughton but they'd be all right looking at the figs these are wrong to the origin deal this one over here is the lab area Brett Oh God the dolphin dolphin is a really excellent fit for our climate and yeah brave uh sir don't go well this year this is the variety called na threat this is a variety of found from a bloke in London he brought it over to the UK from Cydia in Cyprus think it's one of the area where they had a conflict or something this one over here is in Akron we didn't quite well with the prep a crop this year you see it everywhere this one over here the the regard to Dell silento come over here this is my I see a black I see a black and again I see a black this one over here is Adriatic judge I think it's just over a word but I hope I can't really get over there I'm gradually moving on my fixed to the allotment I already moved like 50 ports so these are the remaining ones home I went out with the plot this morning and everything was fine there this one over here is my broad giotto fiorentino this over here is a really rare striped rock and Sano I just don't know much about it but that's what it is if you know what it is this over here it's a beautiful Italian fake I'll marinate oh I just want to show you my victory sorry apple trees red love Calypso absolutely cover it the loss of this year hopefully we shall see some nice clothes this over here I think it's another Mary's or it could be Michael up there we got all this auckland key pictures here lastly telepaths Almaty this over here is colorful blue although I think it's exactly the same as Negroni and you know what there these are some apple trees for their I'll just take you there anyway this is my favorite apple tree it's orange red and this over here beautiful Turkish variety they are so rank this over here is my moguri it's just a black mulberry from Italy that's the name I've no she I'm not sure if there's a variety like that it's just called an arrow but one thing I know it's huge and it's beautiful absolutely delicious Oh Carrie Morello so a lot going on here at the minute talk about 20 feet or 30 victories in the greenhouse yeah more citrus this one I call from the buyer it's a red red lemon red flash lemon the fewer there these ones are coordinating ground and yep they were doing well they need I already gave him some worm castings and a high nitrogen fertilizer so they're picking back picking up as you can see they go fruits coming up for this year hopefully you see some fruits and more production next year this over here if you remember is a peach tree I bought from little about four years ago and it's still in that port and it's going in ground in couple of weeks it's beautiful variety I hacked it because I was getting in my way and I need to move it to the allotment anyway this over here is pressing on variety it's all the for you nice women scouring bottom because they flower quite late so they're not susceptible to frost and it's a good thing for our climate this over here is a variety called chocolatey no it hasn't flowered this year it got some and this over here is a variety called aroma for some reason they all got blossom but we will see if they will come to anything and this over here is I got one fruit of it last year called tipo cocky people from there actually this one with the blossom it's not chocolate arias a variety called Nikita's gift it's a hybrid between American and Japanese Bussmann this over here with no blossom as a joke Latino so it caught a panic or a chocolate flash and this is my flame grape wine there you go few grapes which I might take off but I'm trying to train them along this fence or do I have to be shed like that look this is how - so we nice and productive in this little [Music]", "8BPbejhiPRE": "did I unlock from self-sufficient me and today I want to share with you guys my five top citrus trees to grow and why now I'm a huge fan of citrus trees we've been growing them now for 15 years we have 29 different varieties here on our property and you could say I've got a bit of an obsession with growing citrus and smell for good reason personally I haven't had a cold in about five years seriously I'll put this down to the amount of citrus that I eat I've ranked these five citrus trees in order the last one being my best pick but in truth they're all absolutely awesome success trees to grow so let's take a wander through the orchard and check them out [Music] number one the Washington Naval orange this orange was first planted in California was about eight cuttings I believe and subsequently named the Washington naval orange from there at the same time they are also planted here in Australia and to this day it's our oldest and most popular backyard orange tree to grow it's a fair sized tree if you let it grow and don't print it back it'll get to about five meters high it has a good shape it's quite strong and it looks good in the backyard it produces regular good yields of fruit the fruit is large and sweet with little or no seeds it's an amazing tasting orange like just the best in my opinion it has a beautiful sweet flesh it's not overly juicy so it doesn't make for a great juicing orange however it's a terrific eating orange through excellent for sport like I take oranges to our AFL Footy team for the genius and the kids just love eating them definitely a worthwhile orange tree to grow in the backyard number two the Imperial mandarine now this is actually right next to the Washington orange tree that I just showed you and it's another great older variety this tree in particular is about 15 years old it has a strong frame and an upright type of growth and it too will get about five meters high the thing about this mandarine is it doesn't sprawl out like the orange or other type of citruses lemon trees this one here is a more hourglass type figure and it's not just because I've pruned it that way so it's a really handsome looking tree the fruit is excellent tasting really well balanced it's not overly sweet but it's not tired either it's right the middle there and that's probably why it's such a big favorite across the world and in particular in Australia I mean even my dog scooter loved them it's a medium to large fruit with a very juicy flesh and it's really easy to peel it does have seeds though however they can be easily taken out by just biting the center of the fruit segment and the seeds will come right out you can spit them out now or just swallow them seeding or like my dog does this tree is a really heavy crop like I mean it's ridiculous in fruit but there is a caveat it can be a biannual fruit err biannual means it'll fruit one year and then skip the next year so what we do to compensate for those we grow other varieties and mandarins like gum honey Mercat is a good one and it also fruits after this one so you've got spreading of the season plus the compensation for it being a biannual fruit er if it works out that way number three the Asian lines look at this magnificent tree it's hard to even get it in picture it is so fantastic this is a large tree but you can keep it down to around two and a half or three metres if you want this particular tree is over five metres it's more like about six and a half as you can see it's a beautiful specimen with dark green leaves and plenty of fruit forming on it it always has fruit the fruit are generally about eight ball size or a snooker ball size but they can get bigger like a size of a small lemon also you know that depends on how much feed you give it and also rainfall at the right time of year the fruit are green and can be picked green but they also go yellow when they're fully ripe yellow just like a lemon some people actually say don't let the fruit get yellow because it might rot on the tree but I tell you what over the last decade or so I haven't seen any signs of that happening you know you might get the odd blemish in the fruit but I've let these go right until they're completely yellow and dropping off the tree and even underneath the tree on the ground for several weeks they're still not rotting you can still pick them up and take them inside and do some the fruit does sweeten a little bit more as it gets older this is a truly amazing tree and for us here it produces fruit all year I'm not kidding all year no matter when we can always come down and count on a lime being on the tree and available for whenever we need it it has been doing this for a good last eight or ten years producing fruit continuously number four the Valencia orange what a fantastic name did you know that the Valencia orange juice the squeeze juice lasts longer than any other squeezed orange juice of any other variety yeah true story and speaking of juice it is hands-down the best orange juice you can drink we talked about the Washington's navel orange and how fantastic that is well where the Washington naval orange beats the Valencia orange in eating the fruit whole the Valencia orange smashes the Washington orange in juicing it has that perfect balance of not being overly sweet but just right for good thirst quenching orange juice the overall and real outstanding attribute of the Valencia orange is how long the fruit stays on the tree and what I mean by that is when the fruit is ready to be picked it will stay hanging on the tree for almost as long as you want it to whereas other citrus will drop the fruit when it ripens the Valencia orange will just keep hold of them and that is very very convenient especially for the backyard grower when you only want to harvest as much as you need because if you harvest at all at once you've got fruit sitting in the fruit bowl sitting in the crisper going mouldy and going off whereas with the Valencia orange you just pick as much as you need juice it or eat it and then leave the rest on the tree and I can kid you not we've had fruit on this tree three months after the season has ended so it's a great extension of cropping for oranges you can have your Washington you can have your lanes Lake navel you know you can have your your red scented oranges and you can eat them first and what we do is we leave this tree right to the very last and harvest at at the end so you're extending your orange season well past its it's date the Valencia oranges the fruit isn't huge it's about a medium size and as you can see the tree itself it's not that big either they don't tend to get very large three and a half meters or so tall and also there is now a seedless Valencia variety here it is here is any key and the final and best number five the Meyer lemon if you watch my videos quite a bit you'd know what I think of this magnificent citrus fruit tree this lemon is actually a cross between a lemon and an orange believe it or not but I continued there's no orange in it at all it definitely is a lemon you can't just be eating it straight like that well I can't anyway the tree itself isn't really big as you can see behind me but it does have a spreading type of habit so it's not like the hourglass like the Imperial mandarine we just talked about before this one here likes to spread right out and have loopy lanky limbs and you can adjust that of course with pruning but generally this is the shape of the my lemon tree the fruit probably because it is a cross between an orange and a lemon are quite large especially if you give it a fair bit of water during fruiting and flowering they can get nice and big and the flavor you know it's tart just like a lemon but it's not overly acidic so I think it's got a really great balance and lemony flavor really good for an all-round lemon with the right treatment oh my god this tree can produce fruit like it is probably the best producer of fruit than any other citrus tree that I've seen or tried or have and if you don't believe me just take a look at my video how to grow a ton of lemons watch it after this and you'll see what I mean by how prolific this thing can fruit the other thing is being a lemon it can tolerate colder weather better than any other citrus so if you live in a really cold climate and you want to get a good vitamin C fix and grow a citrus tree get a Meyer lemon grows really good in pots and grouse plenty of fruit and will tolerate the cold more I think it's probably after that we wrap the video up staying in front of this fantastic example of a citrus tree all these varieties that I've showed you today are grafted which means their bits or stems of the tree that have been grafted on to usually aggressive root stock citrus roots pot and that means some of these trees are cloned back to over 200 years ago that's pretty amazing when you think about it keep in mind if you've got a small backyard citrus are perfect for putting into pots you can prune them down or you can get the dwarf varieties with the same names but just on dwarf root stock and they'll grow fantastic in pots and that's my top 5 citrus varieties to grow in your backyard I hope you enjoyed this video if you did it's important you give it a thumbs up and share it

I am Leonardo Pereznieto and today I\u00b4m very very happy because I was just informed that my new book is\nnow available in all the Barnes & Noble bookstores and all the Michael\u00b4s\nstores across the U.S. And if you don\u00b4t live in the U.S.\nyou can order it in their websites or on Amazon. Today will paint a lime. I placed the palette to the right\nof the canvas, so that you could see more or less what I\u00b4m doing. We begin with some oxide\nof chromium green. Previously I had already give in\na tone to the canvas and this one dried. I sketch the lemons. One will be in profile,\nand the other one cut in half. Then with a mixture of burnt\nsienna, which is a reddish brown and a sepia which\nis a dark brown, we begin painting the surface where\nthe lemons are standing. And we can change the tone\nadding some ochre and other colors. The horizontal part will be\na little bit lighter, because it gets more light, while the vertical part that\nis the lower part of the painting will be in shadow. And we also\nplace some shadows under the lemons. The background will be dark\nwith sepia and some touches of cold black. That\u00b4s a blueish black. We pick up again the oxide of chromium\nwhich will be the main color for the limes. The curved line that I painted\nis to indicate more or less where the shade will be. Good! For the areas of light I can modify\nthe green with some light yellow. As you can see I apply the paint\nwith short strokes. I don\u00b4t pick up paint and then extend it\non the canvas as if I were painting a wall. Rather I apply it in very short strokes,\npicking up more paint often so as to apply it pretty thick. This to give\nthe texture of the lime. I would like to thank all\nthe people who downloaded the new Fine Art-Tips mobile App. In fact, this week which was\nthe first week since we launched it, if we add up Fine Art-Tips App and the spanish\nversion which is called \"Arte Divierte\" (art is fun), they were nearly 10,000\ndownloads, but what makes me happier is all your nice comments, because\nI see that you did love it and that it is been helpful to you. So thank you! And if you don\u00b4t have it yet, you can\ndownload it for Apple and Android devices from the Apple store\nand Google play respectively. The lime on the inside is a little\nbit more yellow and toward the center, it maybe a little bit darker. Very good! Using some flake white,\nwe can give some little reflections, so that it looks fresh and juicy. That\u00b4s even made my mouth water [laughs]. Good! I love painting, it is so relaxing and\nfun! We do the shadow, of course\nI\u00b4m doing all of this on one sitting and therefore the paint is still wet. This is good because when I apply it, I can then blend it with the one that is already there. This of course is because I am painting with oil. The acrylic paint on the other hand, dries\nalmost inmidiatly. I darken this area to make\nmore evident the change of plain. That looks better. We give it the last touches\n... and it\u00b4s ready! If you enjoyed it, please give it\na LIKE! share it to your friends and subscribe to Fine Art-Tips. You know where to follow me,\nthe links are below. And I will see you,\non Tuesday :) Subtitled by Grethel Trejo", "QPychSFiz8c": "there are two steps that you need to prune your citrus tree and the first thing you need to do is you need to identify the grafting Junction when you look at your tree you're gonna see a little V and cut and scar that identifies the grafting Junction on larger trees you're gonna see that scar but it's not going to be as prominent we will have this area marked with tape and color on all of our trees below this grafting Junction you should prune all suckers to the base of the tree just cut flush to that area the reason is we talked about how the bottom of your tree is actually a rootstock it's a trifoliate or sour orange it's a totally different tree so if branches come out from this part of the tree it's not going to produce the desired fruit that you want it's just going to take away energy and it can actually over grow the entire tree so it's always very important from day one to identify the grafting Junction and keep an eye on and you will see small little leaves coming out you could just pluck those with your fingers if you like now to actually prune your tree this is your choice on how aesthetic you want your tree to look in general what we like to see our trees grow up and then out so bottom leaves and bottom suckers which some trees love to produce a lot of suckers right at the grafting Junction which are good leaves and will produce fruit they just don't look very good and can give a gangly type overall look to the tree I personally I cut those flush to the base of the trunk then the branches that are coming out whenever in general whenever you prune a tree it's going to incite a hormonal response and stress to the tree and the tree will respond with more branches and more flowering and fruit in the first year that you have your tree your tree is going to be focused on root growth and development and leaf growth and development it will produce flowers once in a while and small fruit that will likely fall off so any energy that the tree is using for flowers and fruit it's really not going to be producing big fruit it needs to have that base of a ton of beautiful leaves that way you can get energy and take that energy and put it in the frig production so in the first year it's heartbreaking as it can be it definitely is not a bad idea to just prune off any flowers or even small fruit when you're doing your pruning you can prune your tree twice a year it's a one good time is in the spring time and another time is in the fall now if your tree is more mature and it's large and it's producing flowers and fruit don't prune off those flowers and fruit because that would be potential good fruit that you could be cutting off but again it's your choice now pruning your tree is quite simple you just find a leaf and they'll be sometimes they'll be a little thorn a little bud Junction but right above the leaf you just cut at a 45 degree angle with some pruning shears your pruning shears you do want to make sure it's relatively clean especially if you're using it to prune other plants that may have disease just put some rubbing alcohol and wipe this down really well prior and then you can do that at the tips of all the end branches of this tree this tree doesn't really need to be pruned but we'll just do this as an example you see there's a leaf and a little thorn and then I just cut it at a 45 degree angle and that's it each time I prune I'm also thinking I'm stimulating new growth on this citrus tree now whenever you stimulate new growth you are you know new flowers and you buds are gonna make the tree a little more susceptible to cold and so if it's if you're having your citrus trees outdoors and it's in the 40s you that's not a good time winter times not a good time to appropriate exactly but sometime in the March region time period and sometime in the fall region time period that's a good time to prune your tree and so you have the two major principles identifying the grafting Junction which will have some tape but again you have to keep an eye on it because as a tree grows the tape can fall off or such and pruning everything at the junction or below at the junction is actually okay aesthetically it's just not very pleasing that's extremely important then for just overall health and aesthetics of the tree you want to prune all of the end branches so you do that in the fall and the spring and that's all you need to do for pruning your citrus tree [Music] you [Music]", "BAM7br8E_CU": "today I'm going to show you how to dehydrate lemons the first thing we're going to do is we're going to wash our four lemons and you want to make sure that you've peeled off all of your labels and stickers on them we're going to cut our lemon into slices you can either do it manually or you can use a mandolin which will help get you nice even slices once you have all of your slices cut you're going to lay them out on your dehydrator trays once you have all of your lemon slices laid out we're going to put the lid of the dehydrator on we're going to put the heat setting or the temperature on a hundred thirty degrees and we're going to turn the dehydrator on you need to dehydrate your lemons between 18 to 20 hours if you have multiple trays you may need to rotate your trays throughout the process so that they all dehydrate once you have dehydrated your lemons between 18 to 20 hours you want to check on them the lemon itself should be very hard and brittle and when you push on the inside flesh it should be dry if you feel any stickiness it's not dehydrated enough it still has moisture you're always better off going longer than necessary just to be on the safe side so that we have taken out all of the water from our lemon the other thing we also want to do is once you've turned off the dehydrator you want it to sit for about a half hour so that the citrus cools down when you turn off the dehydrator it's going to be very warm to the touch and if you put it into your container right away because of the moisture you will start getting mold and your food will spoil for storing your dehydrated lemons you can either just put them into a plastic bag if you're going to be using them fairly quickly or if you want them for long-term storage a glass jar works really well and if you're doing a glass jar I also tend to do a oxygen absorber that is food plain that will help preserve it even better and it will take out all the extra air so that your lemons will last longer make sure that you also label what you have in your container and what date you put them in so that way you can rotate your food", "jKJWGNiwszY": "any good cook can whip up a terrific pasta with parmesan and olive oil but if you add caramelized lemon it just up to the game and makes it so much more flavorful before I caramelize the lemon I'm gonna blanch it it makes it a lot more tender so in order to get the lemons ready for blanching I'm gonna show you the lemon trick this is what they do in professional kitchens to get the most juice out of every lemon you cut the ends off then you have it border it and then this is the cool part you stand up your little lemon wedge and then you cut off this white connective membrane and take out the seeds and it's so much better because you get so much more juice and then you just want to slice them into triangles so what the blanching does aside from helping tenderize the lemons it also takes away some of the bitterness from the pith so it's important to blanch it before you caramelize it so you want to get a pot of salted boiling water and then you add your lemons and you left them blanched for about two minutes now I'm just gonna use a slotted spoon to put these on a paper towel I want to get as much of the moisture out as possible and the reason for that is they will caramelize better if they're drier so I'm just gonna blot these dry the drier these are when you caramelize them the darker the caramelization will be I'm actually just gonna fry them so you could call this pasta with fried lemons but caramelize lemon sounds a little sexier you just need a little oil just to kind of coat to the bottom of the pan pinch of sugar which helps encourage the browning and a little bit of salt you want to basically move these into one layer and then kind of just let them sit because the more you move them around the less brown they're gonna get just take them out as they start to turn really Brown you want them almost burnt but not quite and then leave your pan because I'm gonna add the rest of the pasta sauce ingredients to it by the way the reason that I take these out instead of just leaving them in the pan and adding the rest of the ingredients is because right now they've got a little bit of crunch and they have a really gorgeous color the second they hit liquid they start to lose the crunch they start to lose the color and they're just not as good so I'm gonna make a little butter lemon zest olive oil sauce with a bit of chili in it and that's gonna coat the pasta I'm gonna just let that melt and I'm gonna add the chili flakes and this is lemon zest and I want to cook this a little bit in the butter in the oil before I add the pasta water just to bring out their flavors they call this blooming the spices or blooming the aromatics and as soon as you smell it then you add a little bit of salt first the pepper don't forget the pepper and then this is reserved pasta cooking water and this is the magic stuff this is what turns all this into the sauce I'm whisking it because I want to kind of emulsify it I want to bring the fat and the water together and you just let that cook for like a minute or two just to reduce it a little bit I know I'm gonna add my pasta to the pan now this pasta is about 1 minute shy of being totally cooked because I'm gonna finish it in the sauce in the pan so it's one of those amazing Italian techniques that works so well because what happens is as the pasta finishes cooking it's also absorbing the flavor of the sauce which is nice about my parmesan right here so you want to work pretty quickly at this point cuz you don't want the pasta to overcook and you also don't want the cheese to melt entirely you just want it to kind of start to stick to the strands my lemon juice I'm gonna add probably the juice of a whole lemon I might need to add a little bit more later I know I'm gonna add in our caramelized lemons and now we've got parsley and celery leaves and the celery leaves are really nice they're a little bit unexpected and then now I'm just gonna serve this out into individual bowls and add the final garnish see this is such a great pantry dish and I know that that bowl of lemons looks really pretty on your counter but if you put it in the fridge they'll last a lot longer and then you can make this dish any time you want Oh", "AM-SMegukLc": "hi my name

everybody I'm Noel from Norma social in New Rochelle New York and I'm going to teach you how to cut a perfect lemon wedge what you do is you grab the lemon and you put it on your cutting board cut off both ends of the lemon after that you're going to cut the lemon directly in half so now you have two pieces of the lemon when you have two pieces of your lemon you cut just slightly right down in the middle not all the way those just half into the lemon turn it over so the flat side is on the cutting board and start cutting your wedges then after that you'll have pieces of your perfect garnish of a lemon you", "x_gfYfQhevo": "hi it's Robbie I'm roaming through the garden today and I wanted to show you my Morel blood orange tree it's got a lot of flowers we picked a lot of the fruit already so it's pretty much done fruiting for this year as far as ripe fruit and now it's starting its new crop but looky here looky looky looky isn't that gorgeous I mean you couldn't get any redder than that that one's about ready to come off and there is still some more inside the tree in there and there's some more on the top which is not ready yet they're still orange and they will get even redder but it's got a ton of flowers already so it's getting ready to do its thing again so we should have more oranges as the months go on we've got a whole bunch in the house we've been eating this is a great citrus tree to get for your garden I will say that if you like citrus you should try to find a blood orange tree for your garden it's very low on asset it's very sweet it's got a very different taste to it and some people I've got a friend that cannot eat orange oranges at all he said the asset burns the inside of his mouth but yet when it comes to the blood oranges he has no problem no issue with the blood oranges I think this one's a semi dwarf got this at one of the hardware stores walked in there one day and saw that they had a couple so we bought a tree it's at dormant for quite a few years even though it had some little ones on there it never really did anything so Gary put around there probably about a good foot of woodchips down here and it just changed the entire tree the tree just took off all the trees took off but today I want to just talk about blood orange tree look at that in there isn't that beautiful and it just feeds off the woodchips you put wood chips and you don't have to water it all the time the soil stays nice and damp the tree loves it it's not waterlogged citrus doesn't like to be waterlogged but it stays damp because they do need water if they don't have enough water in the ground you'll start to get shriveled up fruit so you don't want that let's see if we can look under look at that is that beautiful oops there's one on the ground I think I better collect that one oh that's a beautiful one it must have just fell off there's another one under there I'll probably grab that one soon too but it's full of flowers trying to see if I see little oranges yet but not yet I absolutely love the way the buds smell the flowers when they open there's nothing nicer than a citrus tree right out in your kitchen window because it just blows and when there's a breeze and it smells so good but look at that so anyways you know it's this is a good addition to anybody's garden you don't find blood oranges in your regular grocery stores my thoughts on that is most likely because their shelf life is not as good as some of the other oranges they don't like selling oranges that have seeds and the blood oranges they do have seeds to him not too many but you know it depends I have grown them from seed that's interesting if you cut open an orange and it's a very ripe orange you can grow the seeds what you have to remember with orange trees citrus trees when you want to grow a citrus tree from a seed do not let the seed dry out when you cut your orange open take the seeds and immediately put them in potting soil and keep them damp if they dry out the odds are they're not going to make a comeback so when the fruit falls to the ground like that and ends up under a tree it will feed off the fruit and the fruit will rot this is how nature would work in the wild if you found a wild orange trees it would rot into the ground bugs would come eat the orange break it open then it would go into the damp soil and it would set root and grow but they never dry out because they would feed off the citrus on the inside all the water on the inside of the fruit so if you want to try growing orange trees from seed that would be the way to do it are you gonna end up with a blood orange tree I don't know because a lot of these are grafted so you don't know what you're gonna end up with and you know you're looking at four or five years so you get any fruit but I mean it's fun you can still do it and it's not a total loss if you want to take the time and grow an orange tree and the citrus on it is really bad just go find somebody with a blood orange tree or any orange tree that you like and graft it and then you can still use the tree you grew so it doesn't so you're not if there's a loss and that would be a fun thing to do so anyways I'm gonna grab a couple oranges I'm not gonna pick any off the tree right now because I have a whole bunch in the house as long as you leave the fruit on the tree they won't go bad that's one thing I have found so you can leave oranges on the tree pick them as you need them once you bring them in the house you don't know how long they're gonna last for and I don't tend to put them in the refrigerator but you can you can always slice them up if you want to use them produce or something and put some in the freezer too but we leave them on the tree we pick them as we need them and of course if they fall off we grab those and that's one thing that's really nice about citrus you can pick and pick them as you need them you don't have to just pick them and then just keep them in the house because they you know they will start to rot they'll mold if you don't use them within a week or so so I'm not picking any eyes like I said I've got him in the house I've got the one I just picked up off the ground I've got that one down there on the ground and now we can go in the house let's go slice one up but really if you can get some woodchips and I'm not talking about woodchips from the hardware store I'm talking about fresh wood chips that have been shredded off by tree trimmers that's the best thing and this put it all around the tree and they will feed off of that what it is is the top layer won't look like much it'll just look like wood chips but underneath is where it's starting to break down so the top layer will never break down and when you're looking at it straight at it because it's it will tend to get dry but just underneath like even an inch it's gonna start to break down of course deeper you go the more you'll see it turns into soil a compost and that's what the plants feeding on and these citrus really need it because there was a big difference it's sat here for a long time doing nothing we've had it for quite a few years and then once Gary brought in the woodchips and he dragged him all over here and started putting them under the trees the citrus trees they just took off instantly so with that let's go in the house take the citrus I've gone in my hand and cut it in half and let's go take a look and see what it looks like inside so here are the two blood oranges we picked in the yard look at that isn't that beautiful look at them the juice comes out is so pink look at that they're so red and they're so pretty what I usually do is I just take them and I slice them up and you can eat it straight out of the skin this the white of the orange is good for your two so don't worry about if you get some of that and look at that mmm aren't they beautiful mmm so sweet that's what they look like on the inside poem talking with my mouth full now if you wanted to try to grow some of the seeds for fun when you pop them out get them right away into some potting mix and keep them damp and if the fruit is ripe which obviously this is ripe the seeds are probably good and I would you know if you want just put a whole bunch I would put a whole bunch in a pot keep them wet not live you know not waterlogged but just damp and they'll grow now are they gonna grow true if when you know always Premier's from now I don't know like I said you could always graft him that's only if you want to bother with the seeds but you don't want to dry the seeds out if you dry the seeds out the odds are you'll get zero germination on them so that's them if you pick them too early there'll be more orange on the inside but aren't they gorgeous I mean look at that you juice them eat and we just eat them we just slice them up and we just eat them just like that just cut it off eat him and then I compost the skin being that citrus you know Justin break down as fast as a lot of other fruits and vegetables I just cut the skin into smaller pieces when I feel like it sometimes I don't and then just throw it in your compost even if it takes a long time to break down it doesn't matter it makes little homes for all the critters that are there your earthworms they'll be able to get under there but it'll break down so that's it that's the blood orange and I'm I really say it's worth it if you're looking for citrus go ahead and get one of these trees I believe that they don't sell them in the stores because they don't hold up as well as some of the other oranges that they have created that will last longer you know shelf life and that's why a lot of fruits you can't find in regular grocery stores because the shelf light it's not as long or they might bruise easy some fruits but you know these once you pick them and get them in you want to really eat them within a few days but that's it so they're very very pink and red on the outside they do very and what you do is you pull them on the tree if they come right off then they're ready to go then they're ready to be harvested and if you pull them and they don't come off the tree you know you're pulling and it's like that's a fight the trees trying to hold on to it then leave it a little longer you saw one of these came off the ground probably the reddest one and the other one we picked but it came right off so that's it try a blood orange you know check out your hardware stores your nurseries if they don't have them ask I've had some great nurseries that I've asked for things and they've actually gone on their way to find things for me so ask if you're interested and for a quick ending little beans sent me this pod a while ago and I keep it on my windowsill and I've got dill growing out of here and I have a little bit of mint sometimes I make mint tea and I shove the little pieces in there and they grow if you can see all the bright green little leaves in here these things those are orange trees bunch of orange trees I even have peppers growing see what I do this just came out if the oranges the blood orange then just shove it in there it's got putty mix in sits on my windowsill on a little platter and I water it every day and I just shove in the seeds and they grow and they grow that easy this is an orange tree this is an orange tree this is an orange tree there's a whole bunch of them that's an orange tree so they're all through here and I've got some outside even on my deck in pots I just throw a bunch of seeds in there and they grow so that's all you have to do is throw seeds in a pot I keep it on my windowsill he's not pretty she hand-painted this for me so I keep it on my windowsill and I throw all kinds of seeds in there and so you can grow oranges and if I wanted to when I if I decide I could break this all apart gently take them apart and replant them separate later on I do it for fun see there's a seed seat here and just shove them in there into the dirt they have to be shoved unto the dirt because they can't dry out once they dry out they're really no good that's why you don't see people selling orange seeds because you would have to buy the whole orange you would have to buy if you wanted orange seeds from somebody for fun to grow you would have to ask them to send you a whole orange and it wouldn't matter if the orange arrived to you rotten the seeds would be perfectly happy on the inside but you want the whole fruit with the seed and all yeah just take all the seeds and just shove them underneath the dirt and sometimes I don't I drop them in there and they don't grow of course the ones on the top doesn't matter I'm just tossing them out of the way but when they get under there boy they take off and grow sometimes you'll even open an orange and you'll find the seed is turning green and you can see the leaves starting to come out but that's how easy it is so if you want to grow orange seeds for fun or any seeds while you're working in the kitchen put a pot on your windowsill keep it damp and throw your seeds in there and then I can put my mint outside I can put the dill outside there's some peppers coming in here and that's pretty much it that's all I've been throwing in there so have a great day and don't forget to eat what you grow and thanks little bean again for the pot bye bye you", "CmOFL59gsbE": "- right this is Paul and Sal and we're gonna talk about his Japanese yuzu tree lemon tree so it's native to Japan and can you tell us more about its ally but really don't know much about it at all well I've been looking online and I know you can make a liquor out of it yeah I found a recipe for that huh and you can actually make I made a marmalade out of it which seems wonderful but this is a popular with cooking it is most chefs you have to use the skin you can use it again and their pulp for cooking so mainly for the rind and you use the whole fruit for cooking and it's native to Japan yes and this you say that the it's very expensive yeah I found it on online for like $15 a pound that's legit yeah that's more expensive than dragon for you it's a bit more wrinkly kind of drier than I thought then most citrus I would say it's more of a drier type of fruit there are seeds in it right yeah awesome and let's see how it tastes mmm I would say it's more tart than the Seville orange really I would say it ma'am smell wise it's probably the best smelling scent a lemon in my opinion and let's see what Scott says about it let's have him try a little piece here all right yeah think big seeds Wow hmm really big seeds really fibery not as juicy as I thought it would be it's not as bitter as the absolute orange but yeah the finish is smoother it's just more straight sour but it's good Pleasant it's very pleasant smell I am yeah I actually could would like a little bit of juice so I can see using this in cooking yeah it's just like that you you have to use a lot of to get a fair amount of juice mm-hmm and you said you made a marmalade out of it yeah well that must have tasted wonderful I guess yeah um how about growing in Southern California had as this plant respond to the climate well it's pretty good good look at mine yeah great do you fertilize it at all uh you know I don't fertilize a lot of my that much nice shirt huh yeah so Maura just all the natural decomposition of the correct leaves okay well um definitely this is a must try and it's becoming much more popular and as you can see it's an expensive rare citrus fruit native to Japan so this is the yuzu lemon so there you go give us a like and subscribe we'll keep them coming take care dude that's creepy", "mFuNdJoEhq4": "okay Marco and he's Marco it was a victory but for me I needed a type of structure and lemons lemons was a very very easy simple way to break it down that I could understand so I'm just gonna do it super simple all right [Music] Marco you done messed up you may be bring up the s whoa this guy Marco he has just been running rampant disgusting drawings Marco you embarrassing yourself nobody's got the gall to say it I got the gall I got all the gold I'll say it I'll say right now Marco you don't know how to do art you ever think of that did you ever think of that that ever crossed your mind in this video I'm gonna be doing two very simple things I'm gonna be fixing Marcos disgusting disgusting art if I would even call it that and two I'm gonna be hosting a drawing challenge all right that kind of revolves around some of this so listen up for that all right it's gonna be simple we're gonna keep it simple it just so you can kind of alright let's take a look let's see let's see what uh-oh Marcos got here okay okay first of all look at this guy's painting it doesn't even have any color we're happy now user count half tone to the average shadow shadows Plains what is this in Airlines come on man Spurs we've got a conspiracy theorist here y'all alright we're gonna be going over some gesture here some of these gesture forms that he's doing he's getting the gesture down of this character of this pose okay Marco you think you're so cool you think you're so tough you think you're so cool you think you're so tough okay you did your thing alright now I'm gonna do my thing there is a class that I took with Kevin Shen in CDA in Pasadena and in this class he was talking about lemons and this is something I hadn't heard of before and before before that before everybody you know he's talking about before I'd ever heard anything like that I I had seen stuff like this being done which is perfectly fine you know you want to find the gesture yadda yadda yadda you whenever you're you want to find the gesture with this type of you know gesture line like old Marcos talking about here nice guy nice guy Marco and what he's doing here with this flow like he's very flowy with these things that's a different school of thought I did not do this school of thought for one it was lacking structure the teachers that taught this way they lacked structure that I needed to learn this seems to work for this guy obviously if you look at his work he makes it work okay Marco knows what he's doing but for me I needed a type of structure and lemons lemons was a very very easy simple way to break it down that I could understand so I'm just gonna do it super simple all right okay there's there's like two things that I'll be going over in this breakdown one of them is the lemons and the other one is going to be acting out your poses which I'll be talking about in a second but right now let's go over this lemon in Kevin Chin's class I learned that every single thing in the body is a balancing act okay so if you have a lemon okay I've been saying it wrong first of all I should have been saying lemon slice okay that's what it is it's a lemon slice when it comes to human anatomy we are naturally built to counterbalance every other part of our body with lemon slices you can have a very very basic understanding of how the human body is counterbalanced okay there's also this thing called straight to curve you've also heard that right straight to curve and old Marco here or he had mentioned straight to curve in his videos this is where I try to simplify straight to curse to is lemon slices and it's so simple here's the thigh you can see this thing popping out there's the calf as you can see it's very very basic it's super simple counterbalancing parts alright we're not getting into anything flowy or anything like that just yet we're just trying to understand how the body counterbalance itself with straight verses curves all right now let's go move over to a little homeboys drawing here the overall thing to remember with this is that it's not really about making the lemon slice shape oh it's trying to point out is that there's a counter balance between curved and straight keep that in mind does that mean your designs need to have a freaking lemon slice no okay so yes there is the detox or whatever it's called dope but whatever that thing's called there's a bump there but we're not we're not focusing on that alright we're trying to look at the overall picture here what's the overall shape look even this balled up fist has it it's got an arch of where the knuckles go and it's got a fairly straight line of where the the bottom of these knuckles go again there's another straight right there everything has to have a counter balance look even this little thumb little counter balance there even whatever the heck that is it's a little bunch of little okay so Marco here's another thing I don't like about you here you have a character designing series and your kit and you're creating characters from a silhouette no I'm not even doing that I gotta say man it threw me for a loop you're pretty crazy dude I'll give you that alright let's go over whatever the heck it is you think you're doing here Marco mr. cool alright like I said I'm gonna have a drawing challenge thing later it's like a competition thing this is going to kind of tie in to that okay so here was here's what he was trying to do with this he's trying to make a character design so he kind of makes this text first which is which is a really good way to do it he says Vladimir's of blurry I mean a Vladimir is a burly sword wielding psycho he stalks his prey on the streets and fears no man that's a really good way to start out character design really really smart dude this Marco he's got a lot of respect for the guy watch his designing right here though what he does is something that I used to do and it's okay if this is your process if this is how you go about creating characters it's okay of course of course it's okay Marco to make characters like this he's doodling around a bunch look at all these freaking doodles that he's doing and he's while he's doing it he's talking about how what he's doing wrong and what he should be doing better and what he should push the character to be doing I have a way that you can do that but you only have to draw it one time or at least I only have to draw at one time and here's the secret this is what I do all right all you got to do is you shoot reference all right now talk about that all the time and you basically did it right here you got so close look he shoots his own reference right here which is what you're supposed to do but what he was doing was shooting the reference to describe how silhouettes work which is which is really interesting the way he was doing it really smart guy this guy this guy's really cool all I can if you know me if you know my videos what I always say to do is shoot reference what I do is I get into the mindset of this character and I put myself in their position I take photo actually take a video of myself doing the poses that I think these people would be doing I get that mindset and think are their shoulders gonna be bunched up what's their facial expression going to be you know are their hands gonna be here they're gonna be doing this or what's going on what's the posture what's the overall mood for it whenever I look at this character I don't necessarily think psycho that that is to say I don't think psycho as in my type of psycho this could be Markos psycho but that's not my type of psycho so but I do want to say Marko makes it work Marko does the silhouette and then he draws you can see here he's drawing the details inside the silhouette he can do this Marko can do this because he's a big boy he's done this before he knows what he's looking for if you're a student I personally would not want any of my students to do it this way to find the silhouette I think it's cool to study silhouettes but if you're trying to get overall poses I I wouldn't do silhouette again if you're starting out if you're a big boy daddy Pro like Marco then you know you're fine okay so what do I mean by that well as soon as he said psycho I thought of this picture that I took of myself a few months back and I was I got this new fog machine and I was testing it out and I was just trying to see how it would look you know how I would look in action and it looked really really cool so I grabbed my knives and I just acted like a psycho and ironically enough it it kind of fit his profile of this person that he's trying to create in my mind this is what the character would look like a psycho stalker psycho stalkers in my in my mind again this is very subjective this is how my character would look Marco did the way that his character would look okay and he's thinking psycho would be holding something like this I'm thinking a psycho is gonna be shoulders kind of pulled down holding something like you know if I'm trying to get across what a character looks like sometimes I'm even going to consider where the camera would be so his camera is pretty much face on which is cool but I just so happened to take a picture with the camera on the ground and that really sells the stalker thing because if you're a prey you're going to be looking up at this stalker so I would like to draw my care intimidating kind of over the camera okay now that's just the reference you don't have to necessarily trace over this and make the character my same proportions you don't have to that's the thing about references that it's just reference what I would do if I'm trying to make his character or his his character's physique in this type of pose I'm gonna take the same pose and I'm just gonna draw more mass on him boom alright so that's basically it so how does this tie into the character designing challenge that I was talking about basically I want you to do exactly what I just did I want you to shoot your own reference of you or a friend I guess but you know original reference I want you to create a character with two mood words that determine the design these are both going to be going under what and who so the what it's gonna be either aggressive timid depressed confused cocky seductive lazy and the who lover fighter psycho gangster pirate teen hunter alright these are very very simple things typically whenever people design characters they're just using the who column they're just using the home what I want you to do is attach a what word okay and it's like an adjective or a verb or whatever if I want you to mix and match these words and shoot your own reference okay I really like timid psycho like wow he's crazy looks bananas but then you add the word timid to it and it's like how do you design that how are they gonna be holding their posture you're gonna have to do your research you're gonna have to try to put yourself in somebody else's shoes be timid be it Tim and psycho it's like it go grab go in your kitchen and get a knife okay it doesn't even have to be a knife your carrot your psycho character could have like some kind of homemade nasty chemical in a squirt bottle okay they can have like a squirt bottle for their weapon I don't know it's just something psycho and then how is that timid psycho gonna be holding themselves how are they gonna be holding the weapon alright so I want you to mix and match these words create some cool stuff after this video goes up in about a week's time I'll be choosing three winners okay here's what you do okay you're gonna post it on your Instagram account alright and then you're gonna go to my account you're going to see a post that's related to this video okay I want you to comment on that that you participated in the challenge I'm gonna pick three people from that and I'm gonna talk about your work I'm gonna talk about the post that you did and kind of break down all the things that you did right okay Marco gotta say I didn't want to like you okay you think you're better than everybody else you insulted me you insult my dog you know what do you think about Marco you insult me you insulted my dog but you know you really made up for it in the end I think you're a good guy Marco you obviously know what you're doing Marco told me to tell you guys about this new website called Skillshare all right one more thing obviously I destroyed this artist's whole career the whole channel so I'm gonna have to be given back a little bit and one month's time from now I'm gonna be taking all the revenue earned from this video and it's gonna be given back to the artist that was mentioned in the video I destroyed their self-esteem I destroyed their self-respect their channel the revenue they're gonna need all the help that they can get all right so let's go also it [Music]", "Zf72p57_ZLE": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to Sutton's days and the 52 weeks of canning we were gifted a nice-sized box of mandarin oranges and I was trying to think what am I gonna do with them what am I gonna do with them well I'm gonna make some jelly hello this is the mandarin orange jelly it is just beautiful and I think that you guys are really really gonna enjoy this and it's so super easy so let's get started we are going to use approximately I think it's 12 mandarin oranges okay and this should make the amount of orange that we need for this Russell and you're gonna try to peel off as much of the pith as you can get that out of the middle and then don't worry it too much okay there will be a few seeds but mandarin oranges don't have a lot of seeds in them so what I have found is that I can normally pull out the seeds while it's boiling on the stove and I have not run into a problem with it yet now the pith is normally a very bitter part and you don't want a whole bunch of the pith but pith is also very high in natural pectin and so it's not totally a bad thing either and you'll see when we go through the process how it cooks down so like I wouldn't leave that much on there you know I'm gonna peel all that out but I don't I don't stress over it too much this is not like if you were canning you know the slices themselves this this is a little different being that it's a jam jelly kind of now a jelly typically a jelly is made from the juice okay and a jam has more of the meat of the fruit in it so this is like right there in the middle I might be more inclined to call it a jam even though it's not super chunky so we peeled up 12 mandarin oranges and now we've got them in the food processor and we are going to puree these when all is said and done we have about four cups of orange stuff we're going to put in about a half a cup of lemon juice okay half a cup of lemon juice and we're going to put in the four cups of pureed orange now we're going to add the pectin in particularly this time it's going to be sure gel one-box if you're using bulk like I normally do and then you're going to use six tablespoons but I ran out of my bulk and I can't order it right now cuz they're out so I had to run up to the store and get some pectin okay go then I get that all mixed in there real nice we're gonna turn on that we're gonna bring it up to a nice boil we're gonna bring it up to a nice boil and then we'll add the sugar and you're gonna add four and a half cups of sugar to this you may notice as you start cooking it the seeds will actually come up to the top and because these have so few seeds I just kind of wait for them to surface and then snag a much if you are using an orange that has a lot of seeds and you may want to take them out before you begin but I have never run across more than I don't know five or six okay so it's starting to boil we're gonna let it work itself up to a nice boil for about a minute and you're seeing a foam now so you know I don't want you to freak out about that but when I made this when I make this the foam goes away once it starts boiling it goes away so there is no issue with foam in the jars we get a nice boil but if just seeing that foam bothered you about a tablespoon of butter at this point will help take care of it but here let me show you if I can sneak in front of you here there's no foam look no fun oh no foam so I don't think it's an issue okay now we got a good boil going sorry about the steam now we're gonna add the sugar so four and a half cups of sugar so I've got two and two and a half okay now we're gonna stir that down here we go and then it's gonna come back up to a nice rolling boil and once it does that we are going to let it boil for a minute we'll set the timer for a minute that's so good you guys this is one of those jellies okay seriously you could put this on toast you could put it on biscuits life would be good but you take some of this and you braise it on a pork loin or some nice pork chops and put it on the grill oh my gosh I mean this is just heaven in a jar a little tablespoon or so in a in a frying pan with some shrimp amazing it's just a really great condiment for cooking it also it does not have that power of artificial orange you know it's a nice mellow Mandarin and it's just really really good okay so we got to get that up to a boil and then once it hits a boil that I cannot stir down I will set my timer and let it go for another minute and then we'll be back okay so we're at that boil part where I can't stir it down so now we're going to set the timer for a minute and a lot of the solid parts of the orange have actually cooked them so this is not a marmalade this is a jam Jam jelly they call it jelly but we you know who knows anyway so this is just mmm one of those really really good it's a ray of sunshine on a cloudy Michigan day yes it is so good look at that boy good good stuff in the pot behind this is my 16 quart pressure canner and I have my jars in submerged in water in there staying sterilized so that as soon as this timer goes off I can turn off the heat move everything around and we can start filling the jars I just want to show you that's all the seeds that came out of that 12 yeah it was 12 mandarin oranges that's all the seedbed back we're going to pull jars out of hot water and start getting them filled up so you want to fill the jars to an inch headspace I'm sorry grab an inch you want to fill the jars to 1/4 inch headspace I'm thinking ahead of myself here okay so just add a touch more good and now we're going to wipe off the rim because it's almost guaranteed no matter how hard you try that you got something on the rim okay and then we'll get the lid put that on top we will screw on the ring and you want it finger tight okay and then we're gonna put it into the canner and then come out with another jar wash rinse repeat that's what we're doing so I'm thinking that we're gonna get six tanks out of this or three pints however you choose to do it okay make it mess that's what I do okay wipe the rims and then finger-tight and put it in the canner okay so I'm gonna get these all filled up and then we'll be back okay we ended up with seven half pints yes we did so now I'm gonna put the lid on let it come up to a boil process it for ten minutes timer went off I let them sit for another minute stops all the serious boiling from going on and look at these beautiful jars I'm telling you this is just some of the prettiest jelly ever so pretty a great gift a great way to bring a little summer into you know what this would be great for this would be great for Christmas gifts holiday gifts like that because these that's you know remember how you used to get oranges in your stocking I don't know am i the only one old enough to remember that anymore but listen to that these are the orchard road lids and they pop they do not mess around no they don't so yes this would make a great holiday stocking stuffer bring some of that old-fashioned orange into the holiday season it's great for any time of year so so good and like I said it is a mellow a mellow mandarin flavor it's not very um in your face you know what I mean so I hope that you guys will give this a try it's so simple so easy and so very very good until next time everyone please be safe", "XPIVx-aUNMM": "hey everybody livefarmer73 here i just wanted to see with the garden season coming up soon maybe you might want to try to grow something a little different i got for you today our smith red blood oranges do you see the skin on that no it's not going bad that's what it looks like because the inside is so red that it almost bleeds to the outside so this right here is a plant that i got from logee's online logee's garden logee's [Music] low g's now when i bought these a couple of months ago they were pretty small see that that's from the picture we took yesterday y'all know what that is years ago i used to grow blood orange trees [Music] again if you have any questions about um the moral blood orange tree just let me know thank you very much i got plenty of videos of it i used to grow morrow blood oranges and sanguinella blood oranges all right let's see what we got let's get that peeled out here oh it looks good they say what make them redder is cold but in the same [Music] sentence they say don't get the tree in the cold so i don't know but as you can see that's what we got that's what we come out with almost look like a grapefruit let's try it oh that's sweet [Music] really really really sweet it's like orange juice and i got tons of videos of them this this is one that i always wanted and could never find you know what this is this ain't no regular blood orange this is the smith's red and they came in on like a four inch container but they've grown so much over the last couple of months i thought i'd do a video about them so again this is the smith smith red just in case you asked me smith red blood orange from from low jesus oh geez oh geez they still have some in stock you might want to get them while they last now i know you're wondering what's a blood orange some people have never seen or heard of a blood orange before i've been growing them for years but the smith red is one i could never find because i like the skin and the texture on them so we're gonna open one up and see how it goes okay so you can see exactly what you get now i've already cut one to make it a little easier for me the peel is easy to come off i just wanted to speed this up a little bit but as you can see the peel comes off real easy almost like a satsuma orange i want you to see what the insides look like it's incredible but dark blood red on the outside this is what your orange looks like [Music] that's an orange this is the smith's red blood orange the skin is red do you know what that means antioxidants up the yin yang that's how red it is i'm gonna open a piece up so we can get a real good look at it that's what the insides look like right there [Music] so [Music] now you're wondering does it taste like an orange yes it does it tastes like an orange and raspberry mixed together [Music] it definitely tastes like orange and raspberry but it's incredible i just wanted to show you guys the darker the pieces seem like the more rich the flavor of raspberry you get but that's how dark your fruit will become once it's perfectly right [Music] now just to let you know i did not get these fruit off of this little baby tree okay i purchased these so you guys can get an idea of what a smith red orange looks like this is a smith blood orange right here and this is the fruit so if you're looking for one right now and you've been trying to find these and you know exactly what they taste like go over to logee's logee's [Music] and check them out and tell them led farmer 73 sent you you won't go wrong with one of these they have several different varieties of blood orange too but this is a hard one to find [Music] don't be shy i bought two of these so we're just gonna go ahead and pump another hole in it it's all to it use a little bit of this tissue paper cover up that hole don't fill your bucket up to the top because it's going to settle number one and number two uh you want this to be able to hold some water and i'm going to simply do this [Music] set that right there i'm not going to disturb the groove this is all to it it's that simple don't go matching on it too hard because you don't want to tear those roots off the side of this little baby tree somebody said my tree is only six inches be patient most of my trees was just like this and this is all you do don't don't panic you're gonna give fruit in the long run okay it's like a marriage like a relationship you gotta work on it build it up same thing with your trees same thing with your kids don't expect a kid to do grown-up stuff no different with your tree don't expect your baby treat to do grown tree stuff okay you take your time be patient if you don't want to be patient i advise you not grow it then i honestly something if you want something fast grow tomatoes grow cucumbers grow uh lettuce lettuce is the fastest but if you talking about getting down and growing all these fruit trees it's worked it's work to be done okay so don't try to rush nothing but what as you see boom that's it i'ma water this in and i'm gonna let that roll i'm gonna do one more all right here we go [Music] so logies logee's knocked it out the park logee's oh geez i gotta be honest with you [Music] don't be shy you don't came this far you know you don't came that far don't be shy with it so same deal look at that root system on there they did a hell of a job this one has got little fruit buzz on it as well do not cover the top of your tree see i'm just brushing that off let your roots show i'm gonna try to zoom that in a little bit let your roots show okay like that do not cover the top of your tree [Music] i'm pressing this around it that's what i'm doing now i'm going to show you a crazy lead farmer secret it ain't no secret but look y'all seen me do this before though right watch hey let what you fertilize your um what you fertilize your fruit trees with you'll see what i keep telling what i keep telling you you know what that is that's a boiled egg i boiled it so it can break down even slower without getting stanky i boiled that one i set that right there when those roots finally reach out and that stuff break down a little bit of coffee grounds in that sucker and i covering back up dig do the same thing on this side now don't put no raw one in your in your container okay because it'll go to stinking on you something awful so this is something new that i i see i'm trying i did it on my other tree and i never smelt nothing i boiled the egg first so by the time the roots reach out the egg really just be breaking down [Music] throw a couple boiled eggs and that suck right by the roots boom son little coffee grounds on there it ain't dummy wrong yet y'all if i couldn't if i couldn't prove it to you i wouldn't be saying nothing and there you have it that's all you got to do so if you got one of these trees and you just ordered it and you ain't got nowhere to put it and you like oh my god spring ain't gonna be here for another four months go ahead put it in a container and bust him out just like that do you keep the shell on the egg yeah just put a whole egg in there that was a whole egg so that's it what kind of juice blood orange juice right real promise leopold73 i love you guys and i'm out smith red blood oranges smith red blood orange tree logis low g's", "pfsWphEAD7g": "[Music] hi guys welcome to another episode of Lisa's eats and today we are making the honey lemons from Kuroko no basket specifically metal base recipe now first when a basket is a basketball anime and I love it I love basketball since I was little so when I saw if I just became addicted plus Conoco has a really cute puppy and I always just like so cute you have to watch it it's amazing but uhm yes and it even made my friend Warren want to play basketball so that's a really big achievement so good on you football and we are not making recall to coach's version because that nest we're making the good stuff here you can have these just to eat I like eatin the really nice and pleasant you can put it with cold water and ice you pull the soda water as a refreshing drink you can put it with hot water so you have like a honey lemon tea it's really delicious and there's so many things you can do with it and especially I mean if you're playing basketball halftime you need energy tell me I give this lamb dance boy do it so this is what you're gonna need it's not much okay now I'm using four smallish palm size lemons and what I've done I've rinsed all of these under water and with a kind of abrasive sponge have styled the skins just to make sure to get rid of any dirt and it also releases a really nice citrusy aroma and then I've cut these maximum five centimeters thick because basically they point to kind of candy and you want to be able to eat them whole if you have too much rind it'll give a bit of a bitter taste and then I've just got some lovely delicious honey it depends on how wide your container is and he'll be your lemons off but I'm probably going to use about 500 grams of honey so what we're going to do first is get a container well ha I specifically got a blue one - like a 14-3 and yes I'm a nerd I'm accountant and what we're going to do is we're going to line the bottom with a layer of honey then we're going to lay out our lemons to overlap too much so we're going to go honey lemon honey lemon honey lemon honey lemon honey and then once they completely covered in honey we're going to put them in the fridge for about two days okay if they squish up like this that's all [Music] okay now that we've made our layered lemons just look at them so yummy we're going to put our airtight lid on top okay so now we're going to put them in the fridge and we want them to be in the fridge for about two days but every about 12 or so hours just go into the fridge and give them a good shake so about two days that's when they're opting to use because they're nice and candied the juices of the lemons have come out and then it's just like a honey syrup it's whole good the only thing is don't let it stay in the fridge for more than three days at that point I recommend you freeze them I'll show you what I mean this is only half a day later when I shake it it's still very hard and syrupy very much like honey still just you remember to shake every half a day until up to two days and this is what it looks like now it's a lot more liquidy as you can see the honey has broken down due to the enzymes and acid in the lemon the lemons are moving a lot easier and yes amazing so these have been in the fridge for two days every half day I just came and gave it a good shake and as you could see it's become a lot more liquidy it's like a very kind of cordial like consistency so a bit thick but not quite watery and I'm just so excited to eat these because I love these blobby doesn't like lemon so we're going to see how that goes I would usually have these say if I'm training or I need some exercise or if you're playing basketball with your friends bring these along it'll give you energy must be half time soup energy energy I didn't say in paid to a good player just there to get you the energy if you're not going to use these straight away what you can do is take two to three pieces of this put them in little Ziploc bags and put them in the freezer and take them out as you need they can be used as little ice blocks and same with the liquid you can put them into ice block molds and freeze them and they're really nice just with some cold water on a really hot day but right now it's winter for us so I would probably put these with some hot water and make a really nice lemon and honey tea so yeah let's eat but as you can see the rinds actually kind of gotten a bit candied yeah yes let's get you this one looks good okay just bite it you have to eat then they're not sour I eat the rind you don't have to a lot of the vitamins and stuff isn't it I mean I know you hate lemon but it's not that bad but you just hate lemon do you like honey and lemon tea do you like playing lemon meringue honey all right just try the syrup [Music] yep so I just eat these as our I love it I just know them not trying to insult you at all yes hey Lana I loved it I can see how these would give you energy on the basketball court but it wouldn't give me energy chance I will need it I have no energy lemon no no what did you feel that was pathetic face oh I don't you hey guys thanks for watching this video and if you want us to make any other food or recipes from anime manga TV shows movies games let us know comment in the section below message us on social media talk to our faces were pretty friendly something if you want it um but yes so see you next time bye", "_KGV9SZtoIU": "hello fellow youtubers fair prepper here today we're going to cam some citrus I received some beautiful grapefruit from my friend genius in exile just got back from visiting her and her neck of the woods and she gave me some grapefruit and showed me how to get them ready an easier way than I was used to you want to get it as clear as you can without the pith on each end and see I want to do that one again because there's v there in signaling is a really sharp knife and then you're going to cut around the grapefruit don't worry about how much you leave on there because you can use that as juice with your canning you just slicing it around it way I always tried to do was peel it and then cut them out that never works so well then all you do is you take it and you slice next to the vein all the way down to the center and then you should be able to just push it out Wow works so good and then I'm going to turn it let's see I'm lefty so I want to have the empty piece to the way I'm going to cut slice it down and pull and the reason you want to put a pan underneath you because all this juice that goes in there you cannot put in your jars it's that easy and just push it all the way down and pull and pull now you're just skinning it right off of that can't believe how easy this way it is just pushing it right off you have really small ones you can choose not to take them off and you'll just do some and so I have a whole bag of grapefruit and oranges because of course I'm going to do both today and if you skip a skinny one you kind of kind of move the other side off of it be careful you don't cut yourself to you more push it down and pull it off and sometimes if you set it on the table a little easier pull it off in one slide off of there see I didn't cut the top part and so it's kind of sticking and then you'll juice this into your jar but there we go look at that and that beautiful so let me do all these grapefruits well here let me show you an orange see how well these aren't actually oranges they are men are the mandarins yeah mandarins so let's see if mandarins work the same way cut it off cut it off slice it down and around yeah see I'm not getting all the way down there we go we take that off afterwards not a big deal pretty much feels like it's working the same way they're a little softer so all right now let's try let's move these peels off and let's try to see if we get them out sectional oh yeah those are easy really easy I'm not my plans are to do oranges mandarins grapefruit lemon and lime and get them jarred up especially lemon because we're going to need that for canning and I'll do them in probably smaller jars when I get to the lemons and limes to add my asset for my jellies and to be able to use to stop stuff from turning yellow and there's just so many uses for lemons and around here we have seasons where lemons are really cheap and there we go so just as easy to do little mandarins as it was to do grapefruit so I got a couple bags here and I have some oranges that came off the tree I know they're green but they really are sweet and we won't do the same thing with those and you just want to get all that white off so that you can slice them right out I can't believe how easy this is this way I've made my work so much harder than it needed to be I guess I was always afraid of wasting any and so I ended up making it ten times as hard and you know you're not really wasting any you see how I just cut all that white off around the bottom because you're gonna juice it anyways so I mean look how fast that goes just got trusting yourself whoops cut that one a nap biggie and you see what I did there so when you do that I got the skin on this side of the orange so you can just ignore it if you want and move on to the next one or you can go back and fix it so easy all right so what I'll do is I'll get all of these done and then we'll show you how to can oh okay so I've got them all set Minnie and in jars ended up with four pints of grapefruit two pints of nectarine chanteraines excuse me one time of oranges and then I went ahead and layered the here I have oranges and tangerines pineapple oranges and tangerines I think that's beautiful should have done more of those but I only had three of these jars and I'd already put these in and I would have been too low on these to do full pints so but that will be good most of my juice came from the grapefruit it more than covered the grapefruit when a segment in the orange covered the orange and barely any juice with that tangerines so if you're going to do change range you're going to need to make just a simple syrup with water and sugar we're because I had so much juice I was able to do just juice and water so it's eight to one for a light syrup and that's what I want to do because I think I have one jar of juice left over to can and I wanted to show you a little trick of how I determined how much water to put in my pot you slide you over so you can see the pot so what I do is I take one of my pint jars and I put it in the pot and I fill the water up around it and I fill it up until it reaches this wing this ring here when it reaches that ring here it's more than enough water to cover two inches above it that's the easy way because if you only got four jars of fruit to do you're going to use a much smaller pot than if you have 10 like I do so keep that in mind that as long as you can do that and then of course you're going to want to put something on the bottom that pot I'm going to use my pressure canner insert and so we're gonna bring this simple syrup to a boil and then we're going to add it to our fruits and process okay so I poured the juice in and ran my spatula around the sides and then added some more juice till it's within a quarter inches top gram and then I'm going to wipe off the top rim making sure I have no fruit the very top with a damp paper towel turning it frequently because remember this is simple syrup so it's sticky now you can do just juice if you like if you have enough I don't happen to care for grapefruit much so and my kids like grapefruit with a little sugar so I opted for a simple syrup so it's less sugar I have to store to make this edible for them and I was able to get a quart of juice and probably about a quarter pint but I'll drink that and then we take our heated rings lids and rings and I do not heat my rings because every time you expose these to boiling water you're going to cause them to rust so I opted not to I know they're inexpensive to purchase but in an shtf situation it's not going to be all that easy to replace them now I've got my water bath going as you can hear and I'll take these down more when I go to put them in the canner oops you do that just toss it back in because you don't want any of that fruit syrup on your lid because that will prevent your ceiling so I'll be back with you put him in the gainer all right so I put my pressure canner bottom in the bottom of that and you can use your tongs what I'm going to and tighten these a hair as I put them in and you probably should use canning jewel and hand tighten them and then use your hand tool to put a man since this is my fullest batch I'm gonna see if I can't get my hands in there see if I brought the water up enough to do this jar and as you see I am short so this jar is gonna go in a different pot by itself and I'll can man with the boiling water that is left over from this I'll just get a narrower pot and do the last couple Oh and I forget to say you're gonna process these for 15 minutes since they're fines 25 minutes for the court", "6WM_DPUd_kI": "welcome back everybody to Adventures of David and Aaron today is March the 8th 2018 it's about 6 o'clock and today's temperatures about 85 degrees our topic today is our backyard fruit trees so we have three citrus trees this is our lemon tree that you're currently looking at what I'm amazed about is that the amount of blooms that we're getting are some of the trees so early spring and the aroma the aroma is so amazing I wish you get to smell it it's a very nice sweet smell sit your smell so this is our grapefruit tree the grapefruits we usually harvest those guys usually around Christmas time lemon tree you can pick all the way up to a March and and in December and we also have a lime tree now this tree is a really full full of a lot of blooms easy we squeeze a lot of our grapefruits we do homemade grapefruit juice the lemons and limes we'll use lemons for lemon and honey or we do lemon meringue and for our lime trees if you like if you're a big fan of Key Lime Pie it's awesome for Key Lime Pie and for garnishes drinks and cocktails as you see the size of these trees currently back before December these trees were a lot larger they were almost touching the house over drawing the wall and we had to prune these trees and as you can see down the wall edge here we pruned them away from the raw the reason we pruned those the way from the wall was to present prevent the fruit rats from getting at any of our fruit we do give these trees a lot of extra water in the winter or in the summer correction and we water them few in the winter a lot more water in the summer we do fertilize and treat them if you have any fruit trees or citrus trees any tips or tricks you can give me or Aaron would be greatly appreciated please leave them in the comments below and while you're watching us I'm hit that notification Bell subscribe like give us a thumbs up this is a little bit different topic video it's ventures of David inherent so we will be doing some upcoming trips meaning that we're discussing what can we do a topic on this week so we talked about the fruit trees so with that being said please leave us comments questions we'll get back with you I hope you enjoyed this video if there is anything that you think that would be knowledgeable for us about fruit or citrus trees please put it in the comments let us know I will take any helpful tips and tricks that I can get and as always thank you for watching adventures of David in there subscribe like comment give us a thumbs up and have a wonderful day guys it we'll see you soon bye", "i9qAhOc_37M": "over a century ago nuggets in the beds of mountain streams made California famous as the Golden State today more than two hundred years after the mission fathers first brought oranges and lemons to the west colorful harvests of citrus fruits carry on the golden tradition citrus trees have replaced cactus and sagebrush and their blossoms fill the air with unsurpassed fragrance oranges lemons and grapefruit thrive on the slopes which have been changed from semi-desert into a fast garden by waters channeled from mountain streams today Western citrus brings both health and fun all wrapped up by Nature herself in the soft but strong packages which preserve the freshness and health giving elements of oranges lemons and grapefruit until they reach our homes good to look at good to eat though a warm climate is necessary to citrus growth it takes the special combination of sunny days and crisp cool nights of the Western mountain region the fruit it's golden color and rich flavor thousands of acres of groves make citrus a very important part of Western agriculture just look at this the city is moving right into a fine old grove and the orange grower has to move himself and his family out where he has room for today and tomorrow and a lot of tomorrow's to come these groves are located on the foothills of the Sierras which border California's great San Joaquin Valley for many years one of the world's rich citrus areas are two major kinds of oranges in the West so ripe oranges are ready the year round this is summer Valencia's are ripe on the trees believe it or not this is winter the navel crop is ready for market and this is spring Valencia oranges take more than a year to ripen so blossoms and fruit share the same branches and now these two kinds of Western oranges the Valencia which ripens in the summer and the navel which is picked during winter months both get their completely natural brightness from ripening right on the trees it takes from four to five years to bring an orange grove into production just getting the land ready for planting is a big undertaking carried out with large equipment band is cleared and leveled high places are cut down and low places are filled in so that irrigation water will flow evenly all through the Grove in California and Arizona if you waited for rain new young trees would die of thirst before they even got started this is the Ripper with its giant tooth the earth below needs to be loosened so the young tree roots can spread and grow one monster pulls the other pushes a giant tooth breaks the hard ground [Music] young citrus trees start their lives in nurseries where they get a lot of special attention part of this special attention is budding a tiny creative center is hidden in the bud at the base of each leaf these buds are selected from the best branches of the finest trees because the buds determine the quality and quantity of future harvests the bud is placed inside the bark of a young tree called a rootstock seedling itself grown from seed selected to grow strong healthy roots this will be an orange tree by a similar operation we could bud the root stock seedling to produce either lemons or grapefruit a pocket like a kangaroo's pouch already for the new baby their nature takes over from here and in a few weeks see this this fresh green sprig will become the trunk of the full-grown tree the top of the root stock is broken so that the growth energy goes up into the new chute the young trees are finally ready to be set out in new groves this machine was specially designed for the job of handling the young trees so that the soil which protects and feeds the roots will remain firmly in place the burlap sack will decay after the tree is placed in the ground trees are spaced to give each one plenty of room to grow and spread these are much finer trees than those grown in California in the early days they will grow more fruit and better fruit these have been raised with scientific care just as important are the advances in irrigation except for occasional fall and winter rains water comes to the Groves from the winter snows and summer rains which fall upon the West's great mountain ranges the canal supplies the outlets at the upper corner of each grove then the water flows in underground pipes to smaller outlets along the Groves edge water anytime no need to wait for rain the grower can flood these furrows whenever the roots below need moisture sometimes in winter the growers use wind machines to stir up the cold air which might settle in low spots and damage the crop if temperatures fall to lows heaters are lighted to reduce the possibility of injury on the coldest nights the growers work all night snow on the mountains flowers around the ranch house and a Golden Harvest ripe on the trees all at the same time oranges are picked only after they are tree right unlike most other fruit they can remain on the trees in perfect condition for a long time after they are ripe so picking goes on during every season of the year after picking the big job is to get the oranges from the Grove to the market quickly first they go to the packing house with its railroad siding but there's a lot to be done before the cars are loaded these oranges are about to get the bath of their lives warm sudsy water scrub till they Sparkle as they move over spinning brushes now a clear cool shower brass rollers drain off the water and warm air dryers finish the job but being clean and bright still isn't enough sharp-eyed experts look at each orange to make sure that only the best move along to the cartons which will hold the finest grade on their way automatically separated according to size as you see getting oranges to market is much more than hauling them from the Groves to the neighborhood store these are skilled workers and this is typical working speed a packing house turns out thousands of cartons a day and now let's take a look at the lemons lemons are a very important part of a citrus industry the groves protected by wind breaks of taller trees stretch from the shores of the Pacific to the mountain slopes in the mild climate near the coast the lemons grow and ripen the year round so the trees at any time carry lemons in all stages of growth almost every fresh lemon that goes to market comes from California or Arizona in general lemon groves and orange groves are planted and cared for in the same way winter spring summer fall any season is harvest time for lemons lemons increase in juice and flavor after they are picked so when they leave the tree they are hauled to special Lemon packing houses for storage this lemon packing house has three storage floors for the lemons will pass their ripening period in fresh coolness each floor is larger than a football field when ready for market the lemons are brought out to be graded stamped and packed these girls work like a baseball umpire if a lemon can't pass inspection he's out just like that and he might as well not argue after the lemons are separated according to size soft moving belts carry them to the packing cartons this machine automatically counts the lemons which go into each carton now back at the railroad siding we're ready to fill the shipping orders these come in carload Lots the special refrigerated cars each carry about a thousand cartons the cars have ice compartments at each end the fruit stays fresh and cool all the way to market these cars will travel the long steel rails to Eastern markets the tsipras Express will have a special right of way on its cross-country journey throughout the western states big powerful refrigerated trucks go directly from the packing houses to markets in large and small communities but trains and trucks cannot reach the many important overseas markets this is Los Angeles Harbor where each year hundreds of thousands of cartons are loaded into ships which travel the sea ways to ports all over the world this ship is taking on enough lemons to fill a freight train 40 cars long this of course is an American supermarket this is where most of the Western citrus harvest is sold store displays attract the shoppers brother sister mother all with the same idea into the bag next stop will be home and that will be close to the end of the journey for this orange this is the end but this is what oranges were grown for full of flavor and full of vitamin C and full of proto pectins and bioflavonoids these are very big names for very tiny but very valuable health Guardians which are abundant in the meat of fresh citrus fruits health from nature's own attractive and delicious foods and drinks freshly squeezed fruit juices are a delight summer or winter but there are dozens of other ways to use fresh lemons a little lemon adds a lot of flavor to many foods oranges and lemons are like sunshine and winter they make any time fun time all through the year and they are always as close as your neighborhood store in the West oranges lemons and grapefruit ripen in the all year Sun and the fragrance of the groves reminds us of the days when the Spaniards first brought lemons and oranges to California citrus growing and marketing has become a big industry citrus production will continue to increase because more and more millions need more and more fresh healthful fruit everywhere the growers plant thousands of acres of new groves each year they will continue to ship their harvests across the land and across the seven seas beauty and health from a land of sunshine and golden fruit [Music]", "54Hcnb_9VXk": "hey Tracy spice fam welcome back I am here with a video about this virus that's going around actually just somewhat of a I want you to say that it's a remedy I would just say that it is something that worked for me I saw this first going around on messenger and Fran send it to me and it was from Reza Jana or Raza Jana I think it was re sa are either Ras a Jana Y a ma and he he himself said this was not a cure or anything like that for what's going on right now but it's something that's I won't even say all that you that he said because I'm not trying to get in trouble not trying to get him in trouble cuz he wouldn't try to get in trouble yourself but this is just something that he felt that works and I just have to say earlier today I was not feeling good all of a sudden I got a tightness in the throat and tight feeling up here in the chest and I was like oh my goodness you know how thoughts just run through your mind especially lately with everything that's going on thoughts just flood through this the slightest bit of a cough or runny nose or whatever you're like oh my goodness and you do you don't ever want to panic definitely not saying that but you know you always want to be trusting in God and just doing your best to stay well and all that that you can do right so anyway I was had this feeling you know when I was upstairs sitting down watching TV and just felt kind of and I'm not hard to breathe but just a little bit of restriction and then the tightness here and then here I'm like oh no oh no of course I started praying right away and everything ran downstairs I remembered the video that I saw of this man you know doing this concoction or whatever to help people feel better with these symptoms so I had also saw cinetic Crispin she had made a video and she included this in her video she said then she didn't have any symptoms or nothing like that but she she said it cleared up her sinuses I believe it was she had sinus issues and she said it basically like took care of the mucus and stuff that she had had problems with for a long long time and it helped with her mucus you know what I'm doing with her sinus issues and I was like okay and she said if nothing else she said they helped her with that you know cuz it's it's asked to do this just to keep the virus away you know this hot liquid and everything so anything I want to ramble too much but anyway she said it cleared cleared up for her and the mucus and stuff so I was like oh wow and then also my niece and me and my sisters we have been going around we have been talking about what we I saw on the video and I think my niece was doing this to the pot of boiling water but anyway let me tell you what it is let me show you what it is real quick okay so I just showed a clip of it boiling on the stove so what it is is a pot of water and didn't give any measurements or anything like that but this is the size of a pot and I filled it halfway with water started started to boil put sea salt in it now I put about two to two tablespoons or so you probably couldn't do more like I said I just kind of was watching him do it and that's just you know I kind of I'd it did about two tablespoons of sea salt and I cut up onion peels I put onion peels in there cuz I was making some dinner earlier and I had some you know peels leftover in a plastic bag and the part of the onion so I put that in the pot and your main ingredient is actually the for the salt too but the orange peel the peeling of orange and I think you say you could do lime too but basically citrus so he definitely said orange you say you can do lemon and then lime also so basically citrus because citrus helps with all that sinus stuff and you know citrus is a is a good ink for anything especially respiratory to anyway citrus onion peel and you can even put little chunks of onion in there and then sea salt so I did that got you know got a good boil going on and what you want to do is now I did this earlier so that's why I don't have it on now but you want to put it on a t-shirt you want to put on a t-shirt when you're doing this because you are gonna get hot you're gonna be real hot and you tie your hair back with the scarf or whatever you see I have my little house on the prairie bonnet on so you just don't you don't want your hair hanging in the pot you know you might have a gas stove we don't want your hair catching on fire and you just don't want your hair in the way so you just tie your hair back or put something on to keep your hair out of the way okay so you get a towel and you probably can see the steam because I just took it off of the stove top but you see the steam coming but you want to do it over the stove while it's boiling you don't hurt yourself don't because he was saying the hottest you can stand it the better but I don't want any little ones doing this by themselves no no youngsters or anything like that I should always be under the supervision of an adult so this demonstration is just for adults anyway so anyway what you want to do and like you say I'd do it as as much heat as you could stand but don't harm yourself don't burn yourself or anything like that be very careful but you ought most of y'all have heard about putting your face over a steaming you know whether it's a steaming bowl of water or a pot of water or whatever so basically you are inhaling the heat and because supposedly the virus could not stand really hot heat so that is the key is to get steam in your nostrils and to go down and help you know everywhere so that you want to catch this before it gets too far if you can you don't want anything spreading to your lungs so the key is even now while you're well and pray that you don't get anything but just to do this as a preventative thing but anyway like I said I was I started feeling odd and I thought of this you know sometimes you're watching stuff and it's like oh that's crazy that sound crazy that's how crazy not doing that you know that sounds that sounds good so anyway when I with no symptoms game it's the first thing I thought of them so um cuz I had thought actually earlier when I first saw it kind of makes sense you know the heat killing off a virus and stuff so anyway while you're over the stove and the heat is coming off really hot and everything you want to put a towel over your head and you want to lean over the steam and you and don't have your glasses on I just have them all cuz I'm doing the video but don't have glasses on and you want to get over the pot and get over the pot and you want to breathe that in like for 15 to 20 minutes I believe it was I think it said 15 to 20 minutes now I don't know if you're supposed to do it continuously or not I did not because that was just too much for me so I just would go over like maybe a good 10 breaths or so just in and out and then I started just getting too warm and I step away you're gonna come back and do it do it some more step away I kind of did it like that so just do what you can stand and yeah so I just want to bring this to you because you see stuff floating around all the time and as you all know I like natural things so anything when I find something that has worked for me now this may not work for everybody like I'm not a doctor I'm not saying this as a treatment or anything like that I'm just passing along information because you know there's no remedy here whatever going on you know for this right now so this is just something that helped me with the symptoms that I had and this is something that I picked up from someone else I did not come up with this but this did help me so I just want to make that clear I don't mean a ramble but you have to do that when you're talking about stuff like this especially on YouTube so this helped me like I say it so hopefully it would help someone else you may not have any symptoms at all but they said that this would be a good preventative and it just it sounds good sounds good to me sounds good to a lot of other people some people thought it was cuckoo crazy so you be your own judge that all right but like I said I started I hadn't felt this feeling before at all but I started feeling this tightness in here and and this tightness in the chest and look funny you know breathing a little bit and I was like oh my lord came right down here and thankfully I had everything and I felt better I feel better so just wanted to pass it along anything that I find like I said natural whatever and it helped me I will pass it along okay all right B bless you I hope you are being safe knowing that God is your source first of all God is your source do all the things that you can do it that you know to do but ultimately first of all and lastly of all God is your source and rely on him stay prayed up you are I know that sounds like a cliche but keep praying pray for our nation pray for your neighbors your family your friends because yes we are all going through this together all right blessings love you all see you guys next time right back here on trace this place bye you", "cmtQFxNuFJQ": "- Do you wanna know how\nto zest a lemon using the tools and utensils\nyou already have on hand? From a Microplane to a box grater, it's so easy to get fresh lemon zest for your favorite recipes. (upbeat music) Hey, there, I'm London Brazil\nfrom EvolvingTable.com, where you'll learn how\nto make nourishing meals to serve the ones you love. And today, I'll be teaching\nyou how to zest a lemon five different ways. Lemon zest is a secret ingredient for adding a burst of flavor to dishes. From adding it as a finishing touch to roasted asparagus, or mixing it in to some\nlemon muffin batter, everything always seems to taste better with a sprinkle of lemon zest. But what if you can't find a citrus zester or a Microplane anywhere in\nyour kitchen to save your life? Well, you're in luck. Not only will I teach you\nthe more classic methods of zesting a lemon, but I\nwill also be showing you a few more \"MacGyver\" style tricks that will teach you how to\nuse the tools and utensils you already have on hand. If you're ready to get to zesting, then come on in and let's get started. Let's first take a look\nat the types of lemons that are best for zesting. Most non-organic lemons have a wax coating on the exterior of the fruit that helps to preserve it\nand keep it looking fresh. While the wax coating is\ntechnically safe to eat, you might opt to dewax\nthem before zesting. To do this, pour hot water over lemons in a colander in the sink. The hot water will start to melt the wax. Immediately use a vegetable scrub brush to remove the wax coating. Dry the lemons thoroughly before zesting. You could also choose to\nbuy organic lemons instead, which either don't have\na wax coating at all or they have an organic beeswax coating. And real quick, before we get to zesting, what exactly is lemon zest? Lemon zest is a recipe\ningredient that consists of the colorful yellow\nouter layer of the fruit and is obtained by scraping\nor cutting with a knife. When zesting lemons,\nlimes, and even oranges, you'll wanna make sure and only remove the brightly colored flesh of the peel. Avoid the white part or pith directly underneath the peel,\nas this is quite bitter. And as a side note, if a recipe ever calls for both lemon juice and lemon zest, you'll wanna make sure and\nzest the lemon before juicing. Trying to zest halved or quartered lemons can be quite challenging and result in nicked or cut fingers. Let's dive into the five\ndifferent kitchen tools you can use to zest a lemon. I'll be going through these in order of how easy they are to use. A Microplane is hands down the\neasiest way to zest a lemon and my personal favorite. To use the Microplane,\nhold the lemon in one hand and the Microplane in the other. Move the lemon back and\nforth over the grates, slowly rotating it as you go. And pay close attention to\nthe placement of your fingers. The next tool we'll look at is definitely the most common, a citrus zester. It's really easy to use and\nwill give you longer strips of lemon zest. To use the citrus zester, place\nthe fine sharp-edged holes on one end of the lemon, following the curvature of the fruit. Push slightly into the fruit and pull down to the other end. Now we're going to move into\nthe more \"MacGyver\" methods. A boxed cheese grater is a secret weapon that most home cooks probably already have in their cabinet. Place the lemon on the\nside of the cheese grater that has the smallest holes. Move it back and forth,\npaying close attention to the placement of your fingers. Another creative tool you can\nuse is a vegetable peeler. It is a little bit more\ntechnique-sensitive, but you'll still be able\nto get that lemon zest if you're in a pinch. Place the sharp edges of the peeler on one end of the lemon and\npush slightly into the fruit. Pull down to the other\nend, paying close attention not to cut into the fruit too deep. You want to remove as little\nof the white part as possible. Finely chop the lemon\npeel to make lemon zest. And lastly, you can always use a knife. Much like the vegetable peeler method, this is one is definitely a little bit more technique-sensitive, but everyone always has a knife on hand. It's easiest to use a paring knife when peeling citrus. Cut both ends of the lemon. Place the lemon, cut end\ndown, on a cutting board. Carefully cut into the fruit at an angle and remove the bright yellow peel, avoiding the white pith. Remove any white pith that remains. Finely chop until your\ndesired size is reached. A medium-sized lemon will yield roughly one tablespoon of lemon zest. It's best to use the zest immediately after grating or zesting\nfor the most flavor. If you must store it for later, freezing citrus zest is the best option and will keep for up to six months in a freezer-safe container. If you'd like to learn\nmore quick kitchen tips, you can check out these videos up here. Or if you wanna use all of this fresh delicious-smelling lemon zest, you could use it up in this\nroasted asparagus recipe here. Thanks so much for hanging out. I'll see you again soon. (air whooshing)", "bCTEHJ0caIc": "Hello gardening friends, welcome to Backyard\nBasics. A lot of people are growing citrus these days\nand they're finding them at the nurseries in containers and it's pretty nice to have\na citrus plant in your backyard. You get the fruit of course from limes and\ngrapefruits and oranges and Persian limes and a whole list of other types of citrus\nout there. And they're somewhat easy to grow but they\nhave certain needs in order to do it. If you can't supply these needs maybe you\nshouldn't grow citrus. One of the basic needs is protection from\nthe winter cold. These guys will not take deep freezes. In 1983 almost all of the citrus in the state\nof Texas all the way down to the valley were frozen to death. So you're going to need to protect them. Many folks will plant them in the ground and\nif you are going to plant it in the ground you have to have a well draining soil. They get a disease called foot rot. And if they get in a wet soil then they're\ndead, they're not going to make it. And so of course you really need to develop\na raised bed if your soil doesn't drain well, probably a foot deep. Nice and large, as large as you can make it\nand about a foot deep. You know when you are planting them in that\nwell draining soil one of the things that you should do at first is maybe make a little\nberm around it like you see right here. This nice little berm will not last all that\nlong, maybe a couple of months, and you can focus the water in there when you water it. At first maybe two to three waterings a week,\njust the first week. And then the second week you try to get it\ndown to one or two waterings. You don't want to over water your citrus and\nthen after that you will begin to tamper off as the plant gets established. Now they like to feed too, they like some\nnitrogen in their fertilizer program. You don't need to poke holes in the ground;\nit doesn't really work that way. You just broadcast it on top of the soil and\nit will take it into the soil nicely. At first you don't really need to feed them\nbecause they come with fertilizer. There's fertilizer in these containers enough\nto keep them going for quite some time. As a matter of fact if you plant them in Spring\nthe first feeding might be in May. And if you do another one of nitrogen it could\nbe in September. And in reality once they are well established\nyou would do it three times a year, once in February, possibly again in May, and then\nagain in the Fall. So those are very important. Another benefit that could be added would\nbe the use of mycorrhiza. Mycorrhiza on trees and shrubs and any other\nplant is beneficial and it's the same thing with the citrus. They really would benefit from this fungal\norganism that helps them gather nutrients from the area. When it gets to protecting them out in the\ncold even though there are these special types of wraps you can put on them and keep them\na couple of degrees higher it's really not enough. A nice mulch on the crown of it all the way\nup to where the graft is. If you can protect that little piece above\nthe graft in case it freezes back you might get some new growth from right there. And like I said a container plant you can\nsee people buy several of them and put them in containers and maybe move them up against\nthe wall out of that north wind. And finally here's a good look at one. This is a grapefruit out in south Austin that\nhas been there for many years, probably ten years now. Look at the size of it; it's two stories tall. So it's made it through all of the freezes\nby being on that southwestern part of the house. It really does help it. This one hasn't really even been covered except\nin the beginning when it hardens off. This is a beautiful big plant. You may be able to do that in your yard too. And there are many varieties that you could\npick from. Some of them are cold hardier than others\nand that would be the way to determine what you are going to plant. If you are going to put them out in an open\narea in the wintertime you have to protect them. That would be essential. And, but the southeastern part of the house\nwould be a very good part. So a feeding schedule of nitrogen, that's\nthe only real fertilizer that you would put on there, would be key to their success. Promoting new growth on there is going to\npromote some of those beautiful flowers that they have and a nice big crop of citrus. For Backyard Basics I'm John Dromgoole. I'll see next time.", "dmLp6edNPkE": "yeah okay I got he loves on you need glows so you cut the lemon bowl to full take a half a little cut down the middle but don't go all the way through and then you cut slices not too thick it will be half moves my god you're half a slice", "AjOEGQ18F-A": "here's an easy way to get your kids and yourself to eat more citrus fruit without adding any calories or ingredients I'm going to show you how to turn this into this first you'll need a cutting board use one that has a groove to catch the juice you'll also need a sharp knife citrus fruit and a bowl for the finished product watch the freeze of cold clean tap water then wipe it dry begin by cutting off the ends now slice the peel off from the top down following the curve of the fruit rotate and repeat until you've gone all the way around the orange now you can flip it over and do the exact same process on the other side now flip the fruit on its side so its core is facing you take your knife and cut down on each side of the membrane turning the orange as you go once you're finished simply separate the segments and put them aside after a while you'll get so fast to become faster than peeling hmm gotcha this method creates very little waste you can squeeze the membranes in your juicer to make a glass of juice you can cut up the rinds to make candied orange peel or marmalade and finally when you eat fruit this way there's no pith there's no membrane and there are no seeds it's just the pure essence of flavor so until next time enjoy your fruit and happy cooking", "E-rTZ1ltKpU": "rough ride itself is actually the black rat and this little rascal that spread the black plague through the Middle Ages and dumped us into actually the dark ages now we're fortunate that roof rats in this area they are technically disease-free we have three reasons to really dislike professor one they're nocturnal of neophobia which means they're out at night and they're very quiet and cautious so we technically don't know they're there number two they reproduce like mice one female in a Tippi neighborhood unchecked could produce nine hundred to a thousand offspring in one year and number three they're very destructive they like to chew on wires they get into hoses one of the biggest costs are when they get into cars - on the wiring harnesses but they also can get up into attics cut off phone cable lines and do a lot of damage roof rats are very tenacious and they're here to stay they can climb on just about any type of wire line they can go up wood masonry you can give them a place they'll come in what attracts roof rats is a couple things the citrus is always one that is identified and as the nights are getting longer the rats are really kind of start to party coming out of the summertime so you have longer nights it is cooling off and they're starting to look for for those different things to feed on and citrus happens to be those little orange and yellow canteens hanging up in and trees so that provides a really good juice drink for them they're still looking for food and whether that's pet food bird seeds those different things that they're on the prowl for those the information comes out through the county and through the city to know exactly what to do with roof rats and it's really only four things it is seal up in your home and make sure it's in good order number two manicure the property gets the hedges and trees trimmed up and number three therefore you detect rats put out the correct order I mean the recommended poisons and traps and number four you have to talk to your neighbors what we want to do is we want to cut trees that interlock back so that they their canopies do not touch we want to cut trees and bushes and those type things back about three feet from a roof line and then we want to be able to supervise any kind of powerlines any things are coming to the house make sure those are sealed citrus itself pomegranates those things we want to pick that fruit as we use it and then if we're getting hollow fruit on those on those trees then we want to be able to set eight stations at those freezing we've had people say oh you know I don't want rats and they'll cut down the citrus tree but they didn't they didn't remove the rat they only lost their fruit tree so while we know where the rat is at that that location let's set a bait station but it's either poison or trap it and get it off the property and then back those those the rodents off to to our property lines themselves when we determined that there's ruff rats either in the neighborhood or that we have them on the property and the number one thing we want to do is use what we call the pubs this is the bait stations that hold the just one bite poison what this is is a little rat dining room that that the rats are gonna go in eat the poison come back out and then in four or five days they die still the best way in the cheapest way to deal with roof rats is the conventional snap prep $3 snap trap that that you can buy at any hardware store and these work especially well in attics one of the best ways and to protect especially our pets is using a shoe box if you want to cut a hole on one end so the rat will go in the shoe box is a really effective way to use the snap traps and it makes it very safe number one we we can talk about the snap traps number two the poisoning with the bait stations or the house favorite rat zapper the rat goes in gets electrocuted and it's an instant kill no blood no guts anything else they're here to stay but we have ways to be able to to control them and actually keep them off anybody's property when they're willing to do the recommended methods and guidelines that we presented", "DBCJKkDcnVU": "hi Adrian here germinating citrus seed is very easy I have been doing this in the last three years I have already germinated grapefruit seed this is my grapefruit tree I also had many lemon trees but I when I prune the plant back I pulled it too much and it didn't survive Sabby so be aware when you are pruning your citrus trees to not to cut them back too much now this here is an orange tree I have been growing this since the last winter and I also have an another a tangerine three so these three are the ones I have right now and here I have a few seeds prepared now I will show you how you can germinate any kind of citrus seeds I have here a lemon seeds grapefruit seeds but you can also do the same with orange seeds or tangerine seeds if you have any I have some tan green seeds already germinated here I will show you this right away once you have got your seeds put them wash them in under water and then put them into water for a day or at least for a few hours that will help the germination process so that it the seeds can germinate faster now if you look at the seed check how full those seeds are as you can see here these two seeds are very different this one is very very full and rounded this is a pretty good seat on the other hand this seat here is very more smaller it's not as full as this one now this can still germinate but we can suspect that this one is not will not be as strong as this seed so if you have many seeds choose the ones that are bigger and more rounder or fuller than the ones that are wrinkled or sin okay so this is a good see this is a not so good seed now once you have whoops your seeds put them into the water and let them in the water for a day it doesn't matter if you leave them in the water for more days just don't forget about them and change the water frequently I use lukewarm water for the seeds it's better than using cold water because warm water well I can help the seeds germinate faster also don't use too warm or too hot water because that's not good for the seed either now once you have like your seed inside of water for some time it's time to remove them and put them into a container we were using we will be using the paper towel method here so what we will do is get a paper towel put this on the container and I like to half this way and then I use spring model and I spray some water on it and this way I can put the paper towel easily inside the container this is very will place the seeds now before I put the seeds inside the container I like to remove the harder harder shell the outer shell of the seeds now if you see that your cities already germinating that you can leave this hard shell on because you might hurt the little seedling if you are not careful enough so if you see that it's already green somewhere and it has started to germinate then just leave the seed like this it will germinate this will as well but if you would like to fasten this germination process and the seed not yet terminated then you can remove this outer shell how you do is you will use a care fully cut off this part of the seed which is pointing I will show you here with a grip fluid seed as well that here it is the sharper the pointy edge that's where you can start removing the seed itself decider shop so this is how I remove the shell so here is the seed and very carefully I will remove this part of the shell with Mike knife and once you have made an opening here in the shelf at the top part you can remove all the other shell with your fingers if you have longer nails then it's even better you can use that so you can see I was able to start to open it here and from this point on it's very easy to remove it if you are a kid be sure that you ask an adult to be with you and help you with this process be very gentle with your seed during this time because it's very weak and so this is how the seed looks like once you have removed the outer shell and now I will put this seed into the container and I will repeat the process with my other seed too if your seed is very slimy then use your paper towel or cloth and try to remove the fleshy part of the fluid from the seed of its surface so that you can handle the seed better this way you can hold it secure while removing the outer shell so once again I find the pointy edge here that's where there is no seed so I can cut this off okay I will also cut it back here very carefully this side and this way I can peel it off now and I will use my nails here to remove this fully of course the bigger the CD is here it is to remove this outer shell and it's ready to be terminated after you have built of the outer skin the outer shell of the seeds put all of them inside your container on the wet paper towel now I have three seeds here's three thousand seeds and three grapefruit seeds write down the name of the seeds you are terminating so later you will be able to know which one was which one I know which is the lemon and which is the grapefruit seed seeds because the size difference here now I will close this paper towel on them I will also sprinkle water on this close the other half add some water and close the whole container and keep this in a var room somewhere near warm place that will have the germination process and you will see that within a week this will will germinate or at least most of them will germinate here is the seeds I have started recently these are ten green seeds and as you can see they have germinated this one is germinating as well but the other four has bigger roots already this can already be planted into soil when you are planting it make some make a hole for the root and put it inside the pot and add some soil on top of it around it on top of it and don't bury it too deep just add fingers rid of soil on top of the seed that's more than enough and you can see here the outer shell actually fell off from the seed now that I have grabbed it so I didn't remove this because it was already growing inside and I didn't wanted to hurt the seedling and it's pretty nice you can now see how such a seedling at an Green seedling looks like this was the seed itself first the root started to grow and here grows the plant itself the leaf leaves understand so you are planting it with the roots downwards facing downwards so this is how the seeds looks like after week so this seeds germinate very fast it's very quick and very easy to grow these plants once you are ready put them into soil and you can grow your own citrus trees this way I hope you found this video helpful give give it a try and germinate your own seeds it's it's a lot of fun and of course it's nice to have these seeds these trees at your home it's some nice greenery they have a nice looking leaf it's very shiny and it has a nice green color so it looks good in your home good luck and have fun growing your own seeds thank you so much for watching this video and see you in the next one bye bye", "5uxLnJWHjtE": "[Music] my name is Charles Malcolm biologist and Plant expert with ivy organics where we grow cool plants and today we're here inside the house with a Christmas tree behind me the reason being the Christmas tree is covered in ornaments was so or my citrus they're all going into color right now I've got my lemon is my orange is my grapefruits and I've even got some kumquats I'm going to share with you in this video where the colors are just starting to happen the harvest is just beginning and this is a wonderful time to be harvesting your fruit and pruning them at the same time I'm gonna give you some lessons on how to accomplish that with your trees in your garden so I just want to also thank my friend al wilcoxon in Canton Illinois for his Christmas card which he shared with me and my family and I just want to thank you again for the card and within the cardi rights thank you so much for all your help with my lemon trees this year and I'm hoping that by watching these videos you too can learn lessons to improve upon to make your fruit growing experience that much better come and follow me outside so here we are now under the canopy of one of the Meyer lemon trees in the garden and you'll notice it it's just loaded with these yellow lemons that are ready and ripe for harvest but when harvesting these lemons come and take a look a little closer you'll notice and we've got all of these bundles of lemons and you can notice that some of these leaves are coated with the ivory organics and this is um you know some product that was coated on the plant when it was more heat stress as you can see there was some damage at these upper leaves that actually suffered from burn during the summer months and the ivory organics was later applied to protect the plant but take a look what we're gonna do next is when harvesting the lemon if you pull on it I just want to share this real quick your risk the concern I can't believe this happened on my first try of tearing the flesh which is not the right way of pruning and you can see a part of the lemon peel was still attached to the stem the proper way for pruning and lemons is to actually cut them from the plant and what we'll do is we'll remove bunches like so and I'm cutting but I want you to cut more smart than what I'm doing so far in this video when harvesting your lemons think about what is going to be the next best growth areas what are going to be the next best bloom areas on the stems don't just simply cut all of those fruit off the stems the right thing to do is to prune those branches back to where it's going to continue to grow and bloom and support more fruit in the years to come and here's here's the point here the lessons I want to make here you'll notice that when I made that last cut I made a cut over here which is leading to nowhere northern any leaves or buds or anything coming off of it the proper way in a more logical way would be to prune it back to where you see some leaves and I'm actually gonna cut this back all the way to right about here and before I cut it what I'm going to do is remove all of these leaves and all of these fruits and I'm going to encourage the plant to continue growing right at this point right here and I'm gonna cut it out at an angle right near and right underneath this leaf which has got a bud which will ultimately form the new branches which will support the new flowers and we're just gonna cut it like so and now we've got all of these additional lemons as well and then over here there's another bundle of lemons and I want these branches to all continue to grow and hang and support more fruit I'm gonna do the same thing with this bundle of lemons and just prune it like so right here and now what's gonna happen and take a look at all of these lemons that we've got on just this one prune and what we'll do when when bringing them in the house is we're gonna now separate them like so I'm just gonna cut it about a quarter of revenge right above and this will be the perfect way to actually harvest your lemons and then store them and you can keep them in a cool dry place in your house for anywhere from 10 to up to 21 days so about 2 to 3 weeks they'll store but with all the rest of these lemons take a look at how many more lemons we've still got in here they'll remain on the plant for anywhere up to two to four months and still be in good quality condition on the plant so we've just harvested all of these lemons we've got enough lemons now to support my family for at least the next seven days and I want to make sure that the rest of my harvest remains fresh the major concern and a lot of citrus growers always have is when do I prune my citrus they're always blooming they're always flowering and a lot of citrus are actually supporting fruit year-round there's always various different sizes throughout the plant and let me share that with you as well that's happening on these plants as well check this out you may have noticed on some of the flowers that are happening here check out all of these blooms over here as well take a look and with mung these flowers you'll notice that there's some baby lemons that are getting ready to develop and then these here are some blossoms and then they'll develop into these small fruit that will eventually form the fruit that we just harvested and take a look at there's a bee over here just wheat it's just standing still a little bit too cool this morning he's just waiting for the Sun when I makes his way to the other flowers over here I'm under the canopy of my semi-dwarf Eureka lemon tree and take a look at all of the yellow fruit that are developing behind me I've got a lot of yellow fruit and then I've also got some green fruit over here that'll be ripening and another few more months let's go harvest some fruit from the other side follow me so here's a fruit that I'm gonna harvest and I want to draw an example again as well this branch which is coming off of the a larger branch it's not the tree trunk but this branch is supporting this younger branch which is coming down what we're gonna do is prune it because it's pointing in the you know in a downward direction all might suffer the entire branch off but for the sake of supporting the leaves which will ultimately for more flowers I'm just gonna prune it like so you'll notice that I've just shortened it by almost 50% but these leaves will later support either more branches or the flowers which will ultimately support more fruit but it's now a much stronger structure to help support more fruit let's take a look at some other citrus that we have here in the garden as well follow me so here we are next to our Lisbon lemon tree it's a variety that's very similar to the Eureka lemon but the Lisbon lemon which it which defines it as being unique from the Eureka is that Lisbon's are more drought tolerant or more frost tolerant they're much stronger citrus trees and flavor quality size they're all very they're very competitive very similar and very hard to distinguish from the Eureka lemon and again when pruning these let's take a look at this brain structure if you take a look over here we've got some lemons that are starting to turn yellow we've still got our bunches of green ones and the branch structure you can see it's just being pulled down it's it's it's it's coming down and the goal is to make sure that the plant has a structure that's upward you're going to want to make sure that all the branches are either growing to the side or up and never pointing down as you can see with the stake that I've got over here I'm supporting this structure to grow up even though it's got some fruit on it over here that's pulling it down so I might have to strengthen that as well but the goal is you want it to have a continuously upward where is this that's growing down will ultimately create branches and leaves that will be further shaded and compromising the integrity and the quality that these leaves conserve you know create the sugars necessary to support a lot of fruit so what we're gonna do here is again when harvesting the lemon we're gonna bring this branch back to this branch over here we may even stake it in the future but I'm just gonna prune it to this leaf right over here again about a quarter inch above the leaf and that'll be removed and here's another fruit as well I'm gonna follow it back and with this one I'm gonna bring it back all the way to where it came from the branch behind and we're just gonna cut make a nice flush growth right there and cut take a look again at our Meyer lemon tree the tree that we started off with we take a look at it from this side you'll take a look at all of these lemons that are here as well and all of these branches are pointed completely vertically down and these are all branches that will be removed all the way back to about this point over here and possibly staked if necessary otherwise possibly removed all the way back to where it's originating from the trunk but all of these branches even though there have been fruitful will all be removed the energy the flowers and the fruit for next door will be coming from a higher level the the plant was much smaller last year and it was those branches that have created those fruit but all of these branches will be pruned as well as we continuously harvest our lemons over the next couple of months so again this is a wonderful time to be pruning and at the same time the plan is going to be flowering and creating the next generation of fruit they'll be able to enjoy here in the garden one other thing I want you to point out over here is if you take a look at the tree trunk you may notice and we talked at the beginning about how some of these leaves if you even take a look here on this side you'll notice that they're a little bit lighter and these have all been sprayed with the ivory organics Thorian one tree guard in the summer to basically protect it from sunburn is that he was just so intense that a lot of leaves began to burn we've had too many record high heat days to protect it but it's more than just sunburn that is being protected with the ivory getting's product it also has oils that naturally repels insects as well as during the winter if you're dealing with below freezing temperature nights it'll also help prevent Sun scald which is an issue with a bark will crack creating openings for insects that then enter the underlying wood but take a look again at the whitebark and you can see that the paint has since expanded as the plan is growing so we'll be doing another layer of ivory organics in the upcoming weeks and I just want to show the product here's the can over here and it basically reads ivory organic it's a three-in-one tree guard paint we just add water it's a natural tree trunk and branch brayer protection against damaging sunburn and insects and rodents for use on your roses fruit nut trees ornamental trees and shrubs it's and it's a non-toxic environmentally safe and organic product and it reads over here it breeds protects newly installed plants and trees shields pruned and damaged surfaces and our gold label which will be coming out in the later winter and early spring with most of our stores will have this added label which reads registered material for use in organic agriculture and we're very proud about this as well meaning it's certified for or low organic farm use as well which is which I'm proud to share with you as well let's have you visit a few more citrus tree before we conclude follow me so here we are next to our oral Blanco grapefruit citrus tree it's one of the sweetest of all the grapefruit varieties take a look at all these fruit and as you can see the fruit have guns so large we're still going to wait at least a few more weeks bahar before harvesting these but you'll notice that it's just pulling the branches down which is okay but when we harvest it all of the branches that are going vertically down will be pruned back and we're gonna make some nice clean cuts and encourage the upper part of the tree to continue to grow more branches more leaves and ultimately support more flowers that will create the next generation of fruit let's take a look at a couple other citrus follow me here we are next to a kumquat tree you can see that it's grown into a very bushy canopy it's got large fruit as well as a lot of young fruit within it but these will all begin to ripen within the upcoming weeks or possibly a month from now what I also want to point out is if you take a look a little lower you'll notice that this one here was coated with the ivory organics three and one colored green take a look at that so my daughter who just overheard me explaining that the tree trunk of this kumquat is coated in the green ivy organics she's like oh I had no idea that it was even coated she was like I thought that was the natural color but take a look at the protection and the reason it's coated is to protect it from sunburn as well being that it's in the tree form this tree trunk is gonna be exposed to far more Sun than otherwise naturally would be if it was in the bush bushier form would have a canopy to shade these lower tree trunks and branches so that was a reason for coating it was to avoid the sunburn damage to this particular tree let me share one other example with you follow me so over here is another Eureka lemon tree this one is of the standard variety this one will grow at least 15 feet to as much as 25 feet I just installed this earlier this year as a small plant and it's already grown at least 8 to 10 feet and has a long ways to grow in this upcoming year you'll notice in just the first year's growth we've already got a lemon right here if you can zoom in and check this out and take a look as well all of the flowers and little fruit that are in this plant as well let me show you over here are some younger fruit you can see there's a pair of them right there so he can look at those younger blossoms as well right here and right there some more blossoms another blossom and then just blow it the young fruit and another so in this video we're talking about harvesting harvest season is an awesome time to be pruning how much of your citrus tree is supposed to be pruning and the answer is very minimally as you can see with the plant structure behind me and I've done video lessons on this as well the goal is to continuously try to shape the plant we've got all these steaks over here to bring these branches down and the highest branches up there we'll continue to mend them and shape them and frame them in a way that will maximize the amount of light on all of those branches to maximize the amount of sugars that plant can produce to support the maximum yield of fruit when pruning if you see any dead wood there's no right and wrong time of the year if you see the dead wood you got to remove it as soon as you can when it comes to you know any branches that are obstructing your path or or desirability or height or anything else then again you can you can prune generally the goal is to keep your pruning limited to no more than 25% within any given year so your pruning limitation should be very minimal if there are any large branches you intend on cutting winter would be the ideal time as the plant's metabolism is the slowest and the plant would risk far less stress than any other given time of the year the other thing too I want to share with you and the reason I brought you to the front yard is I wanted to share with you all of these seeds these are all California native seeds and we're in California hence we planted California native seeds if you live in other parts of the world find those plants that are native to your area and grow those and what that'll do is attract all of the local biology and we're talking about the entire ecosystem of insects and butterflies and birds and all the other pollinators that exist in your area and bring them into your garden to help also pollinate those trees and the fruits and the vegetables that you've got in your garden so try to find native plants and introduce in your garden I can see that among these plans one that pops right out is I've got these California poppy plants which will be blooming the spring and I'll be sharing those with you soon I'm just behind me over here is the Indian mallow and then to the right of that is the wooly blue curls and that was covered in beautiful blue flowers so we're gonna have our golden poppies with the woolly blue curls and then the yellow Indian mallow flowers and we're just gonna have a diversity of color and the best part about it is they're all native they've evolved over here over tens of thousands and millions of years and are superior to anything can pick up at your local box store so be looking for native plants and bring those into your garden as well to maximize the yields of your fruits and vegetables in your garden the upcoming year so if you've enjoyed this video be sure to like it and most importantly subscribe down below so be connected to all the other

you name it chocolate it celebrates the perfect union of orange and chocolate so what you want to do first you want to trim both sides and then you want to cut your orange in quarter so you want to keep the whole thing except the flesh you want to cut each wedge into strips like quarter-inch thick of course you want to plant them to remove its bitterness I'm going to cover it with cold water point to a boil and as soon as it boils I'm going to strain them rinse them and do it again two times got it I'm going to cook this down for about two hours on very low simmer citrus candied are used in a wide range of pastries cookies ice cream it just enhance the flavor so much under heat off and let cool completely then strain in cook syrup to 104 degrees Celsius to 20 degrees Fahrenheit let cool at room temperature and soak orange peels in and store for months so the easiest thing that you can do you can just cut them in sugar this option offers a long lasting shelf life when I was a kid they were actually a French candy looking just like that called leaflet french fries doll for the chocolate budget so pick up a bittersweet dark chocolate and it has to be tempered I'm gonna show you the easiest method first of all you wanna chop your chocolates or process it quickly so then it breaks into small pieces then you want to melt over of a water bath make sure the water touch the bottom of the ball then what I'm going to do I'm going to put my chocolate in a refrigerator and keep an eye on it until the temperature drops to 27 Celsius so you don't want to wait until the chocolate is completely set otherwise you're gonna have to remount it and then I'm going to reheat it very quickly to 31 Celsius around 88 degrees Fahrenheit you'll recognize the quality of a chocolate when you actually take a bite into it it should break easily and like cleanly and also when you melt it if the chocolate is too thick it's an indication that there is not enough Kookaburra well my chocolate is

general but he's going to be telling us how to grow healthy citrus trees a lot of people don't know how to prune citrus or how much pruning citrus trees need citrus the more pruning that you do the less fruit that you get citrus don't like to be pruned a whole lot they'd rather stay as they are so don't do a lot of tip pruning that will get you a lot of short buds there that will come out but then you've lost the fruit mainly because the flowers come on the new growth from this year now the one thing you do want to watch for it's very common on citrus with older trees to start to have a lot of small dead Twiggy growth so you can remove that at any time any crossing branches or branches that are going back into the middle like you can see this small branch right here you can remove those at any time you will have sometimes larger branches it was probably growing more upright initially last year was so over laden with fruit it's pulled it down now and now it's crushing on top of these lower branches you can come back to right here where you still have a good shoot that's just growing nice and straight and upright you may remove it back to that point you want to go about a quarter of an inch in front of it at a slight 45-degree angle and you'll be all set and ready to go and you want to make certain that you have good sharp pruners so that you can make that is one nice clean cut with one shot you don't want to have a lot of rough edge is left there on the branch afterwards then after you've made that cut and you're going and looking at the tree you can go and see this branch is still growing too much into the middle you can see it interfering with this branch right here which is trying to grow out so instead of leaving it and trying to leave this one chute go up you're better off because you have three branches here that are trying to grow out and do a good healthy job that I would still go ahead and then coming back here to the trunk and removing it now you don't want to try and go straight flat flush up against the trunk you can see where the branch is attached to it if I try and do it right there that's going to leave the largest open wound on the tree if you look right in front of it there's a little bit of a collar where it attaches and it's just a hair smaller so if I prune it right there at that point I've left a smaller wound that has to heal over now for the tree so it will be easier less stress on the tree so it may heal over quicker and better if you keep that trunk trimmed down a lot and again you'll see here on dwarf citrus dwarfs look more like a bush they will not grow up with a single trunk and look like a tree so the more lower down shoots that you have that's going to help shelter and shade protect that lower graph theory of the tree now all pruning for citrus generally is done like late February early March right before the new growth comes out so that you're not removing your new flowering growth which would be your fruiting growth for that year if you have crossing dead branches rubbing branches those may be removed at any time you", "xW4ksA8Mnl0": "Maddie from Betty's harvest right freestylers group on Facebook I've a tray of fresh navel oranges that I sliced and then broke into this sections on the trace they were in there for a 12 hour freeze in a 12 hour dry but they were not done at the end of that cycle so I put them in for a two-hour freeze and a four hour drive I stopped it an hour early and it still went for 60 total hours because it began the first drying cycle again after the free cycle and I went ahead and shut that off after two and a half hours and it went into the final drive for additional three hours the hard slices appear to be dry they feel dry they certainly should be after 60 hours so all I had in there was this one tray of two and a half oranges and a tray of plums and two trays of shredded mild cheddar cheese so I'm not sure why it took that long it's first I've done a citrus if you know wonderful haven't taste a piece of this mmm Wow mm-hmm but it's wonderful as you know foods that are freeze-dried in the dry state have an enhanced flavor when sometimes sweet fruit will take on a tart taste these have done just sad they were totally sweet when they were fresh but now they're it's a little kind of cross between sweet and tart at the same time if you'd

helps comfort and soothe some of my symptoms when I have the flu a common cold or sometimes this might be something comforting and soothing to you should you get sick [Music] so here I have my washed grapefruit I have to to use I also have my peeled ginger pieces my ginger root this is fresh and as you notice I have some lemons that definitely need to be used and I'm going to use them to preserve them in this honey mixture for tea and I also have my fresh actually this experiment but fresh mint works and even if you have dried mint I actually grow a bunch of this and I like to draw it on baking sheets and store it dried so if you've got it use it so let's put this together I'm going to start with my grapefruit and I'm just going to cut it into slices you can use any citrus that you have grapefruit oranges lemon if all you have is lime then you definitely can use that so there is my grapefruit I'm going to place it in a bowl on the side here okay so here are all my leaves now I'm going to take a clean glass jar and I'm going to start filling this in layers you could mix it all together but I'm going to do grapefruit and my hands are clean now I'm gonna take my leaves and just let them kind of fall I think that looks really pretty and I might need more leaves but take a look at that look how pretty that looks and I have several types of local honey that I keep in jars let me open this one I think I'm gonna use this one first this is just a Texas honey use what you have at home and I'm just going to pour the honey right in there this is perfect as you can see as I press and pack in the grapefruit with the honey it creates this really sweet citrusy minty liquid and this is what's perfect for hot teas so you want to make sure that you put everything in here and that's it now I'm going to work on my lemon ginger preserve as you can see this lemon is a little dry but that's okay I have two lemons that needed to be used and I'm going to use them so now that all of my preserves are done I'm just going to store them and with the extra I'm going to make a grapefruit mint hot tea with honey and again these do have health benefits and they may soothe some of your ailments when you have a common cold congestion or just need something hot and comforting so I hope you give this recipe a try I hope you like it and thanks for watching [Music]", "mQcOw2DktQo": "[Music] hi my name is Charles Malky biologist and plant expert with ivory organics where we grow cool plants and today we're gonna be pruning this standard dareka lemon tree that's here behind me you can see how productive it is but it's now measuring somewhere between 15 to 20 feet tall in three short years check that out in this lesson we're going to discuss five helpful tips and the first one is starting off with do I prune my citrus there's a lot of research out there that that recommends not to prune your citrus and that citrus should be more free growing and that the only reason to prune your citrus tree would be you know to basically manage a branch that's growing in the wrong direction but there's other value other than that and in my opinion it's important to prune your citrus back annually at least by five to ten percent per year for the purpose of specifically making sure that the base is stronger and larger than the top you don't want the top of the plant and the base of the plant to be equal to one another but by pruning at least five to ten percent off the top you're gonna have a base that will better support the top of the plant and also result in a better quality fruit on the plant as well now citrus come in all sorts of sizes from dwarf as you can see here in this pot I've got a dwarf Meyer which is also known as the sweet lemon variety and this year has been in the container for about three years so you can see within you know in three years I still have a plant measuring only about a foot maybe foot and a half tall compared to my standard variety of citrus as you can see here measuring as much as 20 and still growing to my left here is a Semite dwarf a navel orange tree if you check this out over here you can see this here is about two and a half going on two three years as well we can see the trunk you can see the shape of it which we're going to discuss shortly but very healthy just started producing through this last winter on just a few pieces but we're expecting several dozen fruit this year so the best time to prune is citrus and we've discussed this in the past about a year ago in fact where we harvest the lemons off of our sweet Meyer lemon variety citrus that we have in the backyard we harvested the fruit and then immediately we'll also then prune the plant back as well so the best time for accomplishing your major pruning of your citrus is gonna be after the harvest of the fruit as well as after your last chance of frost is past somewhere in that window and before you citrus go into the main bloom that's gonna support the main through even on a lot of these citrus that are year-round including this Eureka lemon tree it's important to get the timing right so that you end up harvesting and yielding the maximum amount of fruit which typically for most citrus will be winter time so it's important to get the timing right in order to maximize and not lose on the maximum yield of free you can enjoy for that year here we are now in the middle of April and we aren't going to be pruning the Eureka lemon tree now again ideally this should have been done at least about a month or two ago as our last chance of frost here in Los Angeles California past at the end of January so February would have been the ideal month to do this but I'm just demonstrating this for you and in regards to major pruning major pruning is typically defined as pruning branches that are older than two to three years old in this demonstration all of the pruning we're doing are gonna be on branches that are less than one year believe it or not all of those branches that you see that are that tall or less than a year old we're gonna be bringing it down with the objective of bringing the fruit and the reach all within reach rather than having fruit that all with that you know that are not within reaches so that is the objective right now the tree is measuring about 50 - 20 feet tall the goal is to bring it down to about eight to ten feet so we're gonna be reducing the height by about fifty percent and I'm gonna do so in a very natural-looking way so it doesn't look like I've completely chopped out and we're going to be doing that lesson together momentarily the other important lesson I want to share with you at the shape of the citrus and I told you that I really appreciate the shape of the semi-dwarf navel orange that I've got over here if you take a look real quick and then we'll come back so I brought with me for demonstration this umbrella the goal when shaping your trees and this applies for citrus as well as many other trees is to make sure you've got a canopy that's going to be shading the underlying trunk and underlying branches from the Sun as too much sun exposure can harm your trees in a very negative way I'll actually share a few video links towards the back of this where we visited a property where there was third degree citrus burns on an orange tree we visited even some fig trees that suffered third-degree burns and third degree burns are basically where your citrus tree are out in the Sun on these now not twelve but now approach approaching 13 and even 14 hours of Sun in the spring and summer and what ends up happening is that the trees bark ends up burning without much exposure to light it's important that the upper canopy of the plant shade and keep cool the underlying branches in tree trunk and if they're exposed again for prolonged periods of time what can happen is your first degree burn is a discoloration to the outer bark a second degree burn is now damage to the underlying cambium layers and that's the underlying part of the bark where that transports the waters and sugars underneath the bark and then after that your third degree burn is the underlying supporting wood that's basically holding the tree in place so to avoid that damage what we've done to all of these citrus trees is that we've applied the ivory organics that are in one plant guard product which we're going to be reviewing towards the end and as you can see here we basically coated the plant all the way from the base up to the lower branches so the protection is basically from this point down so we just discussed the umbrella being the ideal shape well let's take a look now the Rico lemon tree if you come in a little closer you can see that these branches have all arch it's actually created the arch due to the weight of these fruit that it's holding so all of those higher branches we're gonna see as we bring them down actually are supporting a lot of fruit that will eventually bring these branches down if you stay there and take a look here to do it exactly the same thing seeing that branches are coming up and they're coming down under the weight of all of these fruit it's quite spectacular and the pattern will just continue repeating itself eventually what's going to happen is that the tree is going to create its own canopy and ultimately shade all of this exposed bark and as you can see there's still quite a bit of sunlight that's coming in and once we open the upper canopy there's going to be even more light into the underlying trunk and lower branches all of which need to be protected and now we're gonna start off with our pruning lesson so let's get started so as I was walking around the standard Eureka lemon tree I was examining to see all the lower branches that I'm going to preserve and and to kind of determine which of the branches that are going directly straight up we're going to bring down so that a lot of the resources within the plant can be dedicated to those underlying branches and and work on fruit production at a lower level however the other objective is well aside from pruning is to consider bending and training some of the branches to create that open canopy and I found a branch that I would actually like to preserve rather than prune and one of the things you can consider doing is actually shaping and bending the branches that are between your one and your three into the right direction so that it can create that open canopy that will accomplish the goals of having a nice open and again you're looking to make sure that none of the branch was also crossing you wanna have very open structure with a nice open canopy that will also provide shade to the underlying trunk and branches as we mentioned earlier so what we're gonna do is I found one of the branches way up there one of the tallest ones that we're gonna Bend in position basically fill in this entire area that's right over my head simply by putting a stake into the ground so we're gonna do this right now so the goal here is to simply take this branch which has quite a few lemons on the end of it as well and that's not what we're looking for is the fruit but I'm just looking at the direction of the level of the branch and I can bend it right in here in this position to fill in this part of the canopy and still keep the plant within about eight feet well now go with our twine when tying a knot make sure you put the knot against the stake and not against a tree and here we go so again you can see that we placed and position the knot against the stake we didn't put any knots against the stamp so though so as not to constrict the underlying cambium tissues and the flow of though again the waters and sugars within the plant and now within the next six or 12 months that branch will be permanently in that position and the tree structure will be based off of or at least for this section off of this branch that we've decided to keep and now train the resulting branches and structure off of that now with that done what we're gonna do is start pruning around the tree follow me so our first lesson is to bring the height down so if you can come and follow me I want to share with you how we're gonna hopefully bring this down the first thing and again even though we've got quite a bit of fruit here and I know this is gonna be hard to see we're gonna be taking it off and keep this in mind by pruning this back it's gonna be that much more resources and energy that's coming out of the plant that's going to support the remaining fruit resulting in a better quality and even larger size fruit by removing all of this excess fruit it's also a good practice again to also thin fruit so if there was large clusters as there are in other parts and we'll get to that we can do that right now it's becoming a little closer you can see here we've got three lemons it wouldn't be a bad idea to remove one of them so as more energy can go into the other two well let's continue on now if you come in this direction here you'll see what we're gonna do is we're gonna bring this entire branch back to this next smaller branch and I'm hoping you can follow this fork in the branch that comes up to this point over here and what we're gonna do is we're just gonna cut at an angle and prune and now we've just shortened this branch like so and we're gonna continue this pattern coming down you're fortunate when you actually have a small branch that's coming out at a shorter distance I can continue even bringing this back further if you can follow me again there's another fork in the branch which is right here there's another little branch that we can cut to so that all the energy and resources that are coming from the branch can go into this branch or you can go back even further to this branch over here and through in like so and now we've brought it back another foot and a half we just removed all of this tightening the plant and keeping it away from our walkway that's over here what we're gonna do now with this branch is we're gonna bring it down you're gonna have the option now we're bringing it down all the way to the source where it's coming or you'll have the option to also prune it at one of these leaf buds and each one of these leaf buds if I prune it I'm going to show you an example on the other side but once you prune it it's going to encourage each of these buds at the base of the leaf to also produce branches as well so we'll just prune like so and we can do the same thing here as well and I'm basically following the Leafs down trying to stay in the general area and depending on which leaf I prune from if we take a look here if I prune it there then we're gonna get branches that are going to go out in that direction if I prune over here it's gonna result in branches going out in this direction so you're always like when you're on this side of the plant let's say we're on the left side you're gonna be looking for leaves that will hopefully push branches in the left direction and away from the center but at this point let's just prune and then we'll moderate and select the branches accordingly as they come out and so here we go if we've got too many branches and this is a decision we've got to make on you can narrow this group of four branches that are coming out to only three by simply pulling one out which I'll so now you can take a look in this area we've simply brought this entire height out and we brought it down my reach is eight feet so we're now down to about six and a half to seven feet tall and I've gotten out got lemons I'm gonna be continuing this pattern throughout maybe you can see a couple more as we go through here if you want to follow here we go I would typically come down and again you can see here's a nice two cluster of lemons if I were to keep it it's a good practice to select from the four which one are your best three which are the here's a good one and a good one this one here are some scar tissues it's also got a little formed shape you would typically prune this one out maybe even take out a second so that all the resources are focused on just those two but anyways we're gonna bring this one down as well with again the goal is we're going to keep most of this plant within the height of about six to eight feet so with that being said let's follow this down and again we can go down to where the next branch is which is over here but again being that this is too low for me and B and I want to match it to what I've done over here I'm gonna try to go across and I'm gonna prune it similarly at this Junction right there so we're gonna have this branch and this branch and you can see over here we've got all of these new buds that are forming flowers and ultimately these flowers will get more developed creating a little tiny fruit and then we're gonna have some more fruit Buster's like so and here's even some other smaller fruit as well right there and another one right behind it and another one right in front of it so anyways a highly productive tree the Eureka lemon is a lot of fun to grow here's another quick tip is when you've got branches that again are growing towards the center of the vase again the goal and the objective with your citrus trees to have branches that are foo cone from the center out but here we got a branch that's coming from the out the branch on going in the out direction that's coming back in towards the center that's this branch over here it may look good but it's not an ideal shape for maximizing the amount of light and exposure to the leaves that'll ultimately support the maximum amount of fruit so this branch is coming out and with this one what we're going to do is we're going to cut it back all the way to the branch and the source that it came from so if you come in a little closer you can see how close we're gonna be pruning this branch out so here we go with our pruners and we're gonna come in here and prune it like so another example here we are you can see and here is I guess the example we'd have to go on the other side you can see that we pruned this tip probably about a month or two ago and since then it's created one two three four five new branches so we've got all of these branches you can see it's going to be a lot more compact it's gonna have about more branches a lot more opportunity more from our flowers and ultimately supporting more fruit and a much reduced height another important tip a lot of you ask also like how low can I go typically with a standard variety whether it's citrus or any other fruit tree you can typically bring it down safely to a semi standard or a semi dwarf height so a plant that would naturally grow 15 to 25 feet tall being standard can easily be brought down to about 8 to 12 feet which would be more of a semi standard size tree and then if it were a semi standard tree you can easily bring that down to a dwarf size of about 3 to 6 feet so if you're dealing with standards you can bring it down to semi standard if I'm semi standard down to about a dwarf height if you try taking the standard sized tree and pushing it down to a dwarf height then all you're gonna end up is with a very stressed tree that all it's gonna want to do is try to grow the goal is you want to make sure that the standard tree has a standard amount of branches and basically a standard number of leaves to then support fruit if you bring it back too far it'll throw it into shock where all that will want to do is push new growth at the expense of fruiting and sometimes at all so again this is going to be a safe height even though it looks pretty dramatic I mean even though I gave you that rule at the beginning a minimum of five to ten percent but here what we're doing is we're beginning the training process of this particular citrus within our garden to train it to be within that range of about 8 to 10 feet tall let me continue so here we are check out all of these fruit that we inadvertently removed and pruning this tree behind me there's still one real cut we're gonna make but all of these people will still be recycled we'll squeeze what we can out of them flavor water will end up do something with that but let's um take a look at this last cut to share with you what we've done within so with this branch that we bent out of the way it's now sticking out just proportionately too far I'm gonna give you a tour all the way around the plant in just a minute but I'm just gonna shorten that so it matches the rest of the tree if you come in a little closer check out all chat what's happening in the under canopy of this tree which will now have an opportunity to grow better than ever check out again all of these little fruit and flowers that never saw the Sun it was always in the shade and there's fruit here and here and here and here all along the stem all along those stems all under here I would say in just this vicinity of about four square feet there's at least another 20 to 30 fruit so when it comes to a fruit production even though I've just cut maybe 50% of the mass let's say of the tree but again all I've removed were branches that were under one year old I didn't remove any larger branches if you're gonna cut things that were larger in diameter let's say about an inch or a half an inch or greater being two to three year old wood or older I would have recommended you wait until after the chance to process past being here in Los Angeles the ideal month being February with that being said let's take a tour around the tree and then we're gonna discuss one last topic so you can see here I measure a six feet tall you can see most of the branches and all of the fruit are all now within reach so here we are so now let's talk about the ivory against products it becoming a little closer this pamphlet I want to share with you that's a PDF on the ivory organic Stockholm website which talks about centuries proven methods one effective and patented formula I've circled in red a couple of important points that relate to what we're talking about whitewashing tree trunks is an old-fashioned but effective method to prevent Sun scald of tree bark from bright winter sunshine Oregon State University whitewash young trees routinely at planting University of California whitewash older trees we can say in this example being this is a three year old citrus tree if they develop sparse canopies are severely pruned it looks like we may have severely done a prune job and it is now more sparse than it was before so there is a benefit now for whitewashing which I'll point out momentarily and then paint the trunk and lower limbs with whitewash to help prevent sunburn and damage from boars and I'll discuss that and painting tree trunks with whitewash help repel adult beetles especially on young trees so um let's now discuss that the ivory organics products what they are is I've got these two cans when you take a look at the whitewash products you'll see some cans are in yellow and all the ones that are in blue the yellow can is the three-in-one whitewash protection against summer sunburn and insects and rodents both products are for use on your roses fruit nut trees ornamental trees and shrubs it's registered material for use in organic agriculture and again with the label on both of them and says protects newly installed plants and trees shields prune and damage on surfaces the main difference between the yellow product and the blue product is that the yellow product has these seven natural garden oils that offer the insect and rodent repellent protections the castor oil cinnamon oil clove oil garlic oil peppermint oil rosemary oil and spearmint oil whereas the blue label which simply reads whitewash instead of three in one plant guard is protection against summer sunburn winter Sun scald which again would be beneficial to apply in this instance as well the active ingredients in here or garlic powder and cinnamon powder as well so let's take a look at what the contents are if you open it up here so if we take a look at the three in one yellow label product but it comes with is the organic base powder which is here and it's also available in colors green and brown this is now color white and then it comes with this bubble wrap oil vial that contains the seven and one the seven natural garden oils and that's right here in this bubble wrap if you were to open the whitewash formula so now if we open the whitewash label it basically comes with what appears to be the same powder the difference is this has the added garlic and cinnamon powder and there's no oil bottle in here the advantages of using the oil product is to now protect against this situation some of you may may remember that we had a branch about a few months ago that was over here that basically broke under the weight of all of the fruit and so what we did is we basically protected it with the three-in-one plant gar color white like so you can already see the whiteness but I'll paint it again at all and I'm gonna zoom you guys in so you can see it but you're basically gonna cope that damaged wood the reason you're gonna protect the coat that damaged wood the reason you're gonna want to coat that damaged wood and that exposed surface is again and protect it from basically all pests and pathogens from entering that exposed wood it'll take at least a year possibly up to two years for that wound to callus over and and heal itself but in the meantime that layer of ivory organics confused what those seven natural garden walls will repel insects from wanting to penetrate through and ultimately bore into the wood and begin to weaken the integrity of the tree so here we've just opened the canopy in in the middle of April a lot of growers and orchards across the country will typically prune their plants again in the summer once they harvest our fruits whether they be almonds or peaches or plums or apples or anything else and they'll prune them one more time after harvest to encourage a few more branches that will support more flowers the following spring but when you open that canopy as we just have followed by some hot summer days or even there's some hot spring days where we'll reach into the 90s and even 100 that can cause significant damage to the underlying tree trunk and branches so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna coat the underlying tree trunk as you can see all of these leaves are also now getting Sun that otherwise never got Sun is they were always in the shade of the upper branches but what we're gonna do here is we're gonna basically take the three-in-one product and continue coating the lower tree trunk and branches like so and you're gonna want to go all the way down to the base as you can see there's quite a bit of light all the way down to the ground level and we're gonna work our way up I'm gonna take my time and finish this up afterwards and the reason you're gonna want to do this with the ivory organics product instead of using a chemical paint product is as you can see and becoming a little closer if you come around maybe on this side you can see that eventually the plant is going to continue growing so this surface over here is coated with the ivory organics just now on this side i coated it about six months ago and you can see with the application eventually the product begins to come off the tree is going to expand and on average the tree trunk is only going to be um is going to be there for about a year to as much as three years on average and the tree trunk is gonna basically come off the tree and it's gonna replace it with the new layer of bark all of that paint if it was chemical paint from your paint store that was attached to that bark is gonna end up again if this was chemical paint in your soil for decades if not centuries chemical paint if it's designed to be on your house is designed to last for decades if not a century or greater the ivory organics product is designed to break down into the element let's even take a look at the inert ingredients if you take a look over here and you can see that the base of it is iron oxide which controls the color lime stone which is basically a crushed rock that's that's you know the consistency of the powder mica which is a clay base milk using milk proteins to help with the binding within the product and then silica which is another word for sand all of these have been broken down into its elements and crushed very fine and proportionally added in a way that it creates a very strong bond that will last on average on your plants for about a year if its young tissue where it's very green and waxy the adhesion to the tree may be less but if it's as in this case where the bark is becoming a little bit more porous the application will last again on average a year depending on your conditions and whether it could be closer to nine months and again in drier climates it can even be longer than a year so on average these products are applied and reapplied to a tree once a year a couple of you asked about my nagamma calm quiet citrus that we've also done a video on where we potted it about two maybe even three years ago and here it is and I want to share a couple of points before I give you the overall look if you come in a little closer I want to share with you where the graft is if I can spin this puck here if you take a look you can see that there's quite a few suckers happening it's important as part of your maintenance and management of the citrus trees is to regulate and monitor these and also remove them if your goal is as it is here to basically grow your your citrus as in this one in a tree form so I've got it in the pot and I want basically all of the branches on this side or any of the suckers to be removed and I want all of the growth to be about two to three feet off of the ground level within the pot what we're gonna do here is and I want to share with you is the graft union is right here where my finger is right at this point if I can spin it let's turn this pot a little bit more and a little bit more to get the maximum amount of sunlight on this so I can share with you if you take a look over here this is the root stalk from this point down is the root that basically controls the number one the height of the variety that's grafted from this point up so on this root stalk being it's a standard root stalk I could have put on here Eureka lemon I could have put a Meyer lemon I could have put some oranges I could have put some limes I could have put anything related to the citrus root stalk on top of it and grafted it to create the height plant that I want if I'm seeking a dwarf tree then I would graft mind egami kumquat to a dwarf root stalk and have a dwarf sized plant if the goal is to have a semi dwarf citrus tree then I'm going to be looking for a dwarf roots talking grafting upon that or at least looking for a grower that makes semi dwarf citrus tree by grafting on a semi dwarf root stalk and then if I'm looking for standard as in this case we went with a standard root stalk and and basically they grafted onto it the Nogami kumquat and here we are what's happening is I want to share with you on this side is you can take a look if I can spin it back in a position you can see here is exposed wood this is important to protect it from boars the beetles termites or any other pathogens that may enter this wood or possibly rot this wood resulting in damage to what I like calling the heart of the tree being the underlying tree trunk the lower branches if there's any damage to this part of the plant then it'll damage the integrity of the entire plant and affect the entire health of the plant however if this damage had a higher position among at the plant then I can cut at a higher position and recreate another plant without compromising the entire life of the plant so I was like protecting the heart the heart being defined as the lower tree trunk and the lower branches among the tree and so what we're gonna do is we're going to reapply another coat of ivory organics number one is to protect this exposed wood and secondly as you can see as the plant is now expanding can see some cracks in the ivory ganks from the last application being about 812 months ago we're gonna reapply so I don't want to share here is these citrus from the root stock down is something different than the citrus from the root stock up being the Scion wood or the grafted selected variety of citrus if you take a look at the leaf structure the leaf structure from below the root stock and here's a sucker that's coming off is not the same as if you can take a look this is a trifoliate citrus meaning three leaves three folia trifoliate so this is a trifoliate citrus variety root stock that they used we're gonna remove it if I allow this to exist it's going to take the energy of all of the nutrients and all the benefits that I'm putting into the soil it's going to go into this undesirable root stock to the detriment of the selected variety of citrus that we're trying to grow up above so the first thing I'm going to do before reapplying a coat of the ivory organics or the tree trunk is then remember to remove any of the underlying suckers especially if it's coming out of the root stock these here which are right at the union between the root stock and the grafted variety I can tell automatically is not the same leaf this here is the Nogami kumquat leaf as you see the shape of it is significantly different than the rootstock trifoliate citrus the Nogami kumquat only has one leaf pattern comport compared to this root stock that has the three leaf pattern so this here is Nogami kumquat but again we're going to remove them to encourage all of the nutrients and energy and strength to go and support the upper canopy and that the tree doesn't create a lazy habit of supporting lower branching to the detriment of the upper branching and the design and the structure we're looking for so we're just removing all of these like so and we've just clean that all up and now what we're going to do is we're going to take our three and one ivory organics color green and let's just reapply another coat to get this off to an excellent protective start for another warm and sunny spring and summer here in sunny Southern California and again I already mentioned this that's a start is it most importantly we want to make sure we fill that in to keep any disease and pathogens and pests out of it one other important thing and for those of the that those of you that have done your research there's a lot of research that says not to apply paint and not to apply tar to those wounds and the reason is is latex paint being latex creates a waterproof barrier tar another waterproof barrier will result in rot to anything that you coat this product as you can see when you apply it is very porous and dry and allows moisture to pass through so again a very different product than latex paint and tar and again the main point as well is that this being organic will break down over the course of about a year maximum two words whereas tar and latex paint are designed to last for decades and as again the bark sheds which is a natural process you don't want to result in a soil that has tar and latex paint in it let me show you now the standard Nogami kumquat finished results if you take a look you can see all of this new growth being here we are now the middle of April it's pushing out all of this new growth all over the top we removed all of the underlying suckers this is what the fruit looks like if you want to take a look this is close to what the sizes it could be about twice as big as well I've got right next to it over here a egg mass from a praying mantis that's the reason I left the fruit was to remind myself for that pretty much that nest is and now take a look we've just coated the Nogami kumquat with the ivory organics color green and again just a reminder it's also available in colors brown too because all of these underlying branches and trunk as we said the heart of the trees defined as the tree trunk and all of those lower branches phones we protect that if there's any branches in the upper canopy that get damaged we can simply prune it and you branch will come out of the heart but all of these underlying leaves and smaller stems have never been in the Sun and to eliminate the risk of any Sun stress to those you can take a product like this which is the ivory organics three-in-one plant guard ready to use spray where you can also use the can and a fault of the directions on the back to basically take the brush on solution and turn it into a foliar spray but this one here is the ready to use it simply spray it even on a little harder to reach branches and stems like this young branch over here we can simply spray even on the young fruit that again have never been in the Sun this will offer protection as you can see there's a nice light white film on the fruit on the leaves and even on these tender young leaves as well which when it drives leaves a very light a very light and white film to basically repel some of that excess sunlight with the heat to keep the plant much cooler hence the name we grow cool plants so in conclusion I just want to thank the many garden enthusiasts out there that have used the ivory organics products in their garden and I am giving credit to all of you in this video by basically placing cards throughout the video of your videos where you've shared your experiences as well as I'm gonna put four different YouTube channels four different YouTube gardening channels that have used the ivory organics products in different ways to benefit their gardens as well so take a moment to view them subscribe there and just enjoy the experience different experience with other garden theseus throughout the country and with that being said I hope you found this video informative and educational and if so be sure to like it most importantly by subscribing below you'll be connected to this and all of our other educational gardening videos thanks again for watching and happy gardening [Music] you", "A3pNMDUZo9s": "this year in our house we have decided to decorate the tree in traditional yule type ornaments so i'm going to be trying some new things this year i'm going to be making pinecone ornaments which i got the cinnamon pine cones because they smell great and i'm going to try making some dried orange slices now i haven't said the fake this is probably going to be a sticky hot mess but i don't know i've never done this and i've tried to watch some videos on youtube but a lot of them are are just people doing it sped up to music and you can't really learn that way so i thought let's try this together so one thing that i've noticed is some people draw them on racks and some people dry them just on pans or on like um some people said spray foil i don't think so i'm gonna try um parchment paper and see if that does any better so i i only have actually one rack that is oven safe my other cooling racks are black coated some black coated racks are safe for oven use and some are not and the only way to tell is the label when you first buy them i've had mine for years so i have no clue if they are oven safe or not so i will not be using that so i'm just going to use the stainless steel one that will go in so we'll try that one and then i've got two other janky old pans with parchment paper and we'll see how that goes but first i gotta get out my mandolin and we're going to try to cut these in like quarter inch slices if you're really good with a knife which i'm not you can cut them that way that was my knee that just cracked but i am scared of everything i'm really bad with knives and my knife is actually extremely dull i do not have a knife sharpener and getting a this is that says thick slicer then slicing one thin slice that is my thin slice mandolins are scary and i am not ashamed to say that i will be using the hand guard if i can get it to stick because i am not about to mess with grinding off my fingers so i think i should put a plate or something down underneath because i feel like this is going to be extremely messy uh [Music] i could put an old towel down let's do it i don't know i'm trying to see this is what other youtubers don't show you trying to figure out the best way to do this stuff i think i'm going to put this teeth paddle down just to catch some of the juices and maybe put my black cooling rack that i can't use on top of it and we'll see if this works so hmm wish me luck i'm not confident in this yet okay i'm sure this is going to show how gross my this towel is but this towel was my clean kitchen towel and i just used it to wipe something that would have dust on it and now it's dirty so it's okay to get okay i don't know i think i'll try to use the hand guard when i get closer too so let's see if how this works oh it smells amazing [Music] see this is this is what i'm worried about like this just kind of pulped out a little bit but that might be good to eat if you get something like that okay this this is what i'm going for this is a beautiful slice but dried orange slices are not just pretty they're edible and they're good in like drinks and stuff so if we get some that are kind of janky like this we can use those in a drink or whatever so let me make a little bit of room here and this if when you get the little peels like this save those and we can make a stove potpourri later on i think it's about time for this okay this is a problem right here this is a very wide orange see i'm having to like almost butcher this to get it through okay i'm telling you a mandolin is so freaking helpful very nice can i say this is the fruits of my labor that i successfully have pulp in my teeth what we're going to do is we're going to put our oven on 200 degrees fahrenheit and make sure my want to make sure my rags are in proper position actually your rack should be in the top upper third you don't want them too close to the bottom so i'm actually going to move them up one so that they're not too close to the bottom technically i guess i should have gone ahead and preheated my oven but at 200 degrees i don't think it's gonna take that long [Music] now some people do say to cook them at a higher temperature but i would rather go low and slow and have it take all day then have some that burn the edges because you do have to be careful you do have to flip them from time to time according to what i have read on the internet so we'll see how that turns out but i'm gonna i'm gonna go ahead and start laying these out because these look actually really pretty let's get these beautiful slices now i do not want them to overlap and i do not want them to touch at all oh that one's got a hole in the middle of it that's all right that's a pretty one [Music] they're really beautiful and they smell amazing guys let's save this one for eating wow i bought a lot of oranges this is actually probably i've got four more oranges to go and i can only actually i could finish this one out with these slices that i didn't think were as pretty but those can be eaten so that's one orange besides the ends and i still have four more of these suckers to go so depending on how many hours i'm probably going to be drying oranges for the next couple of days so i might look different when we finish this because it'll be a couple days down the road probably i mean i'll show you i'll try to know i will finish this with this batch today you just won't see all of them being done but you'll see the first batch and we'll finish this today and go ahead and have them to where they can hang on the tree i'm quite excited i'm ready to put these in the oven and get them to start drying this is this is going in my little potpourri thing i hope that i'm actually hoping that it smells really good in the house while these cook i hope they don't like smell weird drying out i hope they just smell like right now the entire kitchen is an amazing orange oil smell because when you cut into that peel those oils just burst out and so the entire kitchen is like it reminds me of the orange groves in florida where i grew up absolutely amazing so come on hurry up i'm ready to put these in i actually wanted to start this a lot earlier but we just got a tree our tree that we have been using was a nine foot tree and it went the way of whoville it got to where it couldn't stand up straight at all anymore it was leaning you couldn't um tighten it down like where the trunk goes in let's put them in [Music] i'm going to set my timer for about 30 minutes 35 [Music] and when the timer goes off we will come back and go ahead and do the first flip so oh back to my uh tree story anyway it wouldn't it wouldn't stay tight anymore the rain was stripped out and the original lights on the tree had long died we just would wrap our own lights around the tree so it was time to say goodbye to the tree so we actually got rid of it last year and we had just been too busy and with the um containment for two weeks we could not get out and go tree shopping when everybody else did so we're actually really behind in getting this stuff done which drives me nuts because usually our tree is up on november 1st with the inside of the house decorations so this is super super late for us to have a tree and we just got a little six and a half foot tree i would love to have a real tree but that's just not gonna happen i do worry about the dog and i i worry about the fire aspect because when we leave to go look at christmas lights we like to leave our christmas tree on in the window and they're flame retardant and there's just a lot more risk with a real tree than there is a fake one so real trees are pretty i also i feel really bad for them because you could okay i'll probably upset people but you cut them down and you use them for a month and then you throw them away and i'm like that makes me sad poor little trees anyway i know that i know that's what they're raised for but anyway i digress let's um i'm gonna go play a video game the timer just went off it's been 35 minutes i'm going to check on these i may since it's only been 35 minutes instead of flipping them i may just rotate them um this time and flipped in the next time get my little santa claus yeah i'm just going to rotate them this time [Music] [Music] [Music] and i just put them in for another 35 minutes and when we come back in 35 minutes we'll go ahead and flip those over it's really strange because i was actually expecting them to be like a gooey mess like especially the ones on the parchment paper since there's no air to circulate underneath them i thought maybe that they would start oozing everywhere but so far they're not i'm not saying that they won't and when i flip them i may find out they have but it's not as messy so far as i thought it would be which is good the timer is fixing to go off so we're going to actually take these out and go ahead and flip them over so they've been in there for an hour and 10 minutes so far oh i don't have to do like flip one then i don't have room on my stove for all of these so i really thought that these were going to be super sticky but they're not okay there is juice on the parchment paper but they're not only one of them kind of felt like it was i don't even think it was a sticky i think it was just that it pulled it up a little bit put these back in okay you see it lifted up the paper just a little bit but i wouldn't really call that sticky okay i'm going to put these in for another 35 minutes the second hour you want to start making sure that you keep a close eye on it so if you just did it for an hour the first time and then flipped them instead of doing them in 30 35 minute increments like i'm doing you might want to start doing it in smaller increments the second hour so that they don't burn so i'm going to do 35 minutes again and we'll be back the timer just went off again i'm hoping this is the last time i have to flip these from what i've read when they're done they're supposed to feel almost kind of leathery and hard so hopefully that happens soon on the ones on the parchment i'm actually going to move to a little bit cleaner spot it's not it didn't ruin the parchment or anything like i said they haven't really leaked that much but i'm trying to take it away from any moisture so that it can finish drying and i am noticing the edges are starting to get a little darkish and i really i really want these to be done soon because i am starving and i need the oven for part of my dinner pop these bacon i'm going to go ahead and feel this yeah it still has moisture in it i can tell these might take about two and a half hours they were really juicy oranges so who knows the ones on the rack i feel like the ones on the rack are probably going to get done quicker another 35 minutes and i will say um the smell of them drying isn't fantastic it's not you know i describe this the scent of the oranges in the air after i sliced it and stuff like that that is gone um the smell of them drying is it doesn't stink it's just got a bit of a funk almost like an old orange or something you would not want a candle made out of this so if you see i mean i know they're supposed to smell good like once they hang on the tree and stuff like that but i don't know they smell just a little funky to me but maybe it's my oven maybe it's like some cooked on oil or something i need to clean off it could be that i guess when i take them out i'll give them a final smell i don't think to me it seems like they wouldn't really smell much at all unless you sprinkled like a cinnamon on them or something but i think it would probably be a little late for me to sprinkle cinnamon on them now i don't know this is why we experiment and figure things out so i'll be back the timer just went off and i'm gonna go ahead and just rotate these i i don't i think it's probably gonna take like two and a half hours because there was still just a little sticky not not sticky like tacky but a little bit of moisture i could feel it the last time so i'm just gonna make sure these aren't burning i think [Music] i'm just going to do these for another even 30 minutes so so far it's been uh last time it was an hour 10 minutes no i'm losing track of time we're in the second hour 30 minutes 30 minutes how many times have i turned these four i flipped them twice i've rotated them twice so 35 30 an hour hour 13 so that'll be about 2 hours and 50 minutes i think total or 40 minutes i don't know um i think the next time when the timer goes off i'm just going to go ahead and pull them out and then i'll just let them finish air drying for the rest of the night because i am really hungry and i need the oven i'm i'm starving guys but i've been productive i got presents wrapped so we don't have many presents this year it's been a difficult year i'm sure it has for a lot of people but what we have uh i've gotten wrapped and so we'll be back and pull them out and finish this vlog up in about 30 minutes the timer just went off and i'm gonna go ahead and pull these out hopefully for the last time tonight because i need the oven so i've just pulled these out and they are they've got a if i really press them they've got a little moisture but they're not sticky or anything i mean i'm doing this to see if my hands are sticky the edges are real dry um i i wanted to show you how i was going to finish these i'm just going to put some twine through it and make a little loop to hang them on the tree and i was going to show you that but i think what i'm going to do is i don't know if i should end this video here or not because i am going to make other things for the tree and i would rather just show you the tree with all the stuff on it that i'm gonna make instead of just like one thing at a time but i mean this is how to dry oranges so i guess that's done i'm just going to like some of them already have a hole in them but you can get like an embroidery needle or something and just put a little hole through and then just pull the twine through but i'm actually going to finish drying these for the rest of the night not in the oven i'm going to um now that i don't have to worry about the black rack being in the oven i can i'm gonna wash it off dry it and then use it to put the ones that were on here this one's wow this one's real dry this one's almost crispy so i gotta be careful with that these are definitely done um it's a very it's a it's hard to describe smell it's not like whoa citrus it doesn't actually much smell like an orange anymore to be honest so i'm gonna actually i'm just gonna leave i'm gonna put all these on this rack the ones that really need it there are some of them that don't need any more but i'm going to finish these overnight in the air that is where i'm going to finish this vlog but i will that was well that is where i'm going to finish this vlog but i will show you uh once i get done with my other decor i will show you the tree or me putting the stuff on the tree but that is how you dry oranges it actually is effective make sure it's 200 degrees fahrenheit i don't really know what that is celsius um but google has a thing where you can figure it out these are really kind of cool and they're they're pretty look how like it preserves the color really nice it's almost like um when you you know when you blanch vegetables and it preserves that color so these are really actually very pretty and i'm going to make i'm going to make more like i said i've got four more and the prettiest ones will be for the tree and then these janky ones will be like for potpourri's like this or for eating or whatever i don't even know i don't know if i want to eat a dried orange but it might be good in some alcohol so that's it that's how you dry orange slices in your oven at home both on parchment and on the rack they both turned out actually exactly the same so if you don't have an oven safe rack don't worry about it just put them on parchment paper on your regular baking sheet and put them in the oven just i would do the every 30 35 minutes like i did so make sure that you rotate them and uh flip them i think i've flipped them to flip them once or twice now i don't remember but just do it tell me so that's it thanks for following me on this adventure if you like this kind of stuff give me a thumbs up because it does help um i hate being like one of those give me a thumbs up smash that subscribe but i don't like doing that but if you give thumbs up it really does help youtube in the algorithm it helps them notice my stuff so that it helps move me a little bit farther up so maybe more people can see my channel and that would help me a lot so i appreciate it and i'll see you for the next project goodbye okay i'm gonna put these in for another 35 minutes my phone's ringing [Music] oh", "VOOFWgxaN9c": "hello you to their farmer selling through here I was just doing a quick update on a tree that I had a video on last year and that it never really produced anything this year the Morel blood orange tree has produced I got up here on my patio did a lot of growing I did a lot of chopping it it was it was going south it was going bad real quick so I chopped off a lot of dead stuff and trimmed it up and next thing you know look at what I got here I got twelve blood oranges starting to turn now is that beautiful or what everybody was wondering they comment and let me know they wanted to know everything about this tree I'll be honest with you about as much as you do because they don't do any videos on this kind of stuff on YouTube so I'm just kind of winging it and I'm pretty much growing them the same way I grow my Meyer lemons and Eureka lemons and all the rest of the citrus I have so here you go I got some more at the top here why don't I do your favor put in some legwork and get up here got some more at the top here you know I got all kind of stuff going on here that I need to take care of but right now it's the last thing on my mind and we just moved a couple miles away we were able to finally own a home purchase a home the last house I had I was a leased purchasing it when that fell through I was finally able to purchase a home and here we are so now I can do whatever I want to do with my home and just a quick update you guys if you have any questions on the moral blood-orange I can tell you everything I've been doing oh I can't tell you they are still in the big black buckets from my last videos and if you can see here seems you to see that you know what that is that's a scale that's a fish scale from a carp I figured out a cheap way to feed my trees at least the ones outdoors anyway as you can see plenty of them and now I have plenty of limes this is a bear slime over here I have plenty of see that it's time to do something about that but those are my Satsuma oranges funny what you see when you come outside and actually pay attention anything but uh anyway friend of mine was fishing it gave me an idea so now that I have a lake in my backyard if you can see that now when I go fishing and the parts of the fish that I don't eat my family don't eat I grind it up and I just pour it off and pour the water and the juices off into my plants outside and they are growing like wildfire so free fertilizer free fishing motion so there you go all right thank you quick update again sorry oh oh by the way just in case anybody wanted to know what my dragon fruit was doing here it's still growing it started here and started with this little stump jammed it down it's composting here you go that's about two and a half three feet long each one of plenty of tentacles coming off over so we'll see what happens next year all right thank you that's the end of this video but again if you have any questions about the moral blood orange tree just let me know thank you very much Laird farmer 73 and I'm out", "bWytWvCJkVE": "greetings gardeners today I would like to continue on with some of the crops that are good sustainable items here on the Big Island of life next to apples and corn which are two of my favorite crops on earth my third favorite crop is citrus 25 years living in California I can't get it out my orange my blood is half orange juice at this point and citrus grows really really well here in Hawaii behind me I have an owari Satsuma which those of you have been following me for time you know this is one of my favorite citrus trees I just love worries that suma if only I could bring the aroma onto the video for you man the smell of citrus flowers it's almost worth having the trees in your yard just for the perfume cuz oh man the memories it elicits for me when I smell this stuff right now the citrus trees have been blooming heavily all across my property we have Eureka lemon and we have two yishun lime here I've got a War II Satsuma Morrill blood orange Mineola tangelo Valencia orange and so on and I plan to add many more actually citruses on my list to do and to begin collecting all the varieties but the owari Satsuma is one of my favorites easy to peel no seeds sweet juicy never to acid high yielding the looks of the flowers we have on the tree this year is spectacular in my absence my trees had declined a bit while I was on the mainland but since moving here full time I have begun feeding the trees steadily I've been applying all of my kitchen garbage compost under the trees and so on this one got an excellent dose of fishbone meal Wow the fishbone meal made the flowers just go boom nothing like a little bit of phosphorous to stimulate a plant to to grow in flowers like this phosphorous promotes both proper rooting and good bloom in trees and so it's a it's a real valuable nutrient here in Hawaii because of the kind of acidic soils and high rainfall we usually have phosphorous kind of binds up it gets locked up in the soil there and it doesn't want to release and so sometimes your plants will grow you're throwing fertilizer on them but they're just not blooming right and so periodically a dose of a phosphorus fertilizer in this environment and a little bit of limestone to kind of raise the pH will help bring flowers on the trees like you see on this that suma here over here on this side I just happened to have a Tahitian lime Tahitian lime is completely everbearing in this climate I don't believe there is ever a day of the year that the Tahitian wine isn't producing some fruit a lot of people like their limes green I personally prefer them when they're about this yellow color because they're juicier easier to juice out but the Tahitian lime is a spectacular crop here in Hawaii limes have a very good value at a person in Mountain View could actually go into commercial production of limes in this area if this is what you thought you might want to do me I have the one tree it has so many limes on it that I'm already in commercial wine production with a single plant this tree behind me is about seven years old um and so that's how long it takes to get a line plant from a baby in a pot to a full producing tree here the tree has been producing for a number of years already so it's finally started raining again and so I'm not gonna wander out in the field to show off the flowers on the rest of the citrus trees today they're blooming things are looking good here there's a mosquito so as far as sustainable crops on the Big Island of Hawaii I would put citrus up high on the list citrus is definitely a good crop locally here totally recommend it as something that you might want to put into your orchards here on the island below low and loose and happy gardening", "oVmWrJykT_E": "Lemons are often overlooked for their health\nbenefits, left instead to garnish our dishes, flavor our water and brighten our rooms. However, they contain so many health benefits,\nit is time to give them their due. Today\u2019s video will discuss the lemon and\nhow freezing them will provide additional benefits. Lemons are very powerful fruits that detoxify\nthe body. However, many people consume lemon juice and\nthink they are reaping benefits. This just is not true. Lemons must be frozen to preserve their full\nmedicinal characteristics. The rind, or peel, of a lemon can strengthen\nthe immune system, fight inflammation, detoxify the kidneys and the liver, regulate blood\npressure, treat depression, fight cancer and prevent asthma. Research has shown the lemon\u2019s ability to\nfight cancerous cells, while positively affecting the healthy ones. It has been recommended that instead of juicing,\nmake smoothies out of this powerful fruit so that it will contain the rind. To properly freeze lemons, first wash them\nwith apple cider vinegar to remove toxins. Rinse and leave to dry overnight, then place\nin the freezer. In the morning, grate the entire lemon, including\nthe rind, fruit and seeds. Place back in the freezer and use to add to\nsmoothies, desserts or dinners. Let us know, were you aware of the strength\nof the lemon? Will you be adding frozen lemons to anything? Let us know in our comment section.", "ag2v9MjtOo0": "[Music] hey guys this is our harvest for today we've got meyers lemons dancy tangerines satsumas and white dunking grapefruits so stay tuned as we harvest more this season we're just getting started hey guys and welcome back to the treehouse urban farm today we have a navel orange and i wanted to show you guys how we harvest citrus here on the farm this is our navel orange tree it's about 12 years old and i planted it when i was a teenager and it's right next to the garden as you can see this garden really enriches these trees even more with good compost and fertility and the tree blocks the wind from the garden a little bit to help with any frost damage that we could get from fast winds moving through the garden so i like to use some nice shears or pruners because sometimes if you just pull the fruit off it will damage the fruit although this one came off pretty nicely and the stem came out of the top here what i usually like to do is clip it off so there's just a little bit of that stem left and that'll help the fruit last a little bit longer make sure it doesn't get damaged and i'm trying to get these bottom fruit first because as you can see they're in the dirt a little bit and this one has been negatively affected so we'll put that in the compost and i try to get the branches that are pretty weighed down take some of the stress off the tree but most of these fruit are great it's okay if there's a little blushing of orange at this point a little blushing of green and then you can see how loaded these branches are so we'll just want to take some of the stress off these branches because i have had branches break this season and as i'm going along i'm really trying to get the oranges fruit um sometimes i will get a little bit of a greener one but the ones that are greener they will continue to ripen so i'm really going for the ripest fruit right now [Music] so we're going to fill up this whole basket but this is what we have so far and you can see these oranges are huge most of them are fully orange i'll try a few of the blush green ones to see if they're as sweet but we're going to go ahead and take a lot of this fruit off so the rest of the fruit can ripen a little bit more here we have bergen harvesting ring pur limes they're orange wine and she's just using the nippers to cut the fruit as close to the fruit as possible cutting the stem and you can see this tree is just loaded i love these orange rangpur limes they're a cross between a mandarin and a lime i believe and they are just prolific they're more cold hardy than the limes we've grown in the past that have died from frost and um what we do is we just cut it right here and just make sure that the lime is mostly orange if you have this variety otherwise with limes you just make sure they're kind of squishy a little bit just a little soft and they should be good to go limes and lemons can be harvested a little bit earlier of course and here we have meyers lemon tree just loaded down i'm going to have to trim it some of these lower branches are just getting weighed down so much this year so those are our lemons and limes next we can check out the sweet stuff here we have dancy tangerines so these are a really easy to peel tangerine and you really have to clip these off because the top will come right off just like that and you see there's just a hole in the top so that won't last but like three days and then it'll start rotting so we really have to clip these off when we sell them or when we want to keep them longer or give them away but if you want to just eat them right away you can just tear it right off the tree otherwise i highly recommend using a pair of shears or even a knife which is a little more dangerous but if you're good with it you can harvest with a knife as well so yeah dancy tangerines they just peel apart here we have duncan white grapefruit what i recommend with the grapefruit is you wait for it to get yellow and a little soft [Music] some people like the grapefruit super soft which is when they're the sweetest for sure but we're already eating the grapefruit and they're delicious super fresh so we're going to harvest a bunch of these today that one just popped right off and you have to cut it and like the other citrus i'm just trying to take some of the load off of these overloaded branches and i'm also trying to get the most yellow fruit which is usually where the most sunshine is hitting the tree so i'm really working in the sunniest place right now i tried to hold two in one hand but they're too big out the rest of our harvest over here so here we have a basket of each citrus we picked today [Music] so here we have our harvest from today we have meyers lemons fancy tangerines they ripen a little bit later than our satsumas but they're both really easy to peel and then we also have the dunkin white grapefruit so this is what we have growing on in our 15 year old citrus orchard it's only on an acre and a half in town and we grow all the citrus so even you in a small backyard can grow a ton of fruit [Music] you", "Goe3pb9d7W8": "hi Phyllis here from southern frugal comm you know it's late Saturday probably six o'clock now and I've been doing peaches today but when I went to the farmers market I also bought oranges so I'm going to have to go ahead and breeze these also and then that will just about fill up my freezer so I was able to get a pretty good deal on the oranges and these are Valencia and they're quite big and quite attractive now I love the Valencia and I do peel them first before I freeze them anyway let me show you what they look like I've already washed them and I did get a whole bushel and these are grade-a and as you can see they're fairly large so I'm going to get the camera moved around I'll show you not freeze them sorry about that okay I want to show you how I peeled these oranges just to make it easier the Valencia now have a very thick peeling on them and they do occasionally have seeds but not many they're usually just the little ones but sometimes you run across a large one so the first thing I did is take both ends off with a paring knife then I just score down those sections all around really you don't need it about four anyway once you've got it scored then the peeling comes right off there my dog stealing hush right now hush they like to bark I think they hear the little thing on the camera I cut it on but anyway all right now I do peel some of those little strings off now now that I've got it peeled I usually just put my thumb down right in the middle of it try to break it in half as much as possible then I'll break it into quarters just like that now let's do one more and then I'm going to show you one that's frozen and how I use some all right cut it top off cut the bottom off this time I'm just going to store and make four sections so you just score it you'll learn how d2 by the way it won't take of it a couple of times to know how deep to make the score on it with the little paring knife let's see make one there let's see if we can't get that off with just four little scoring's and just put you know just peel it back with your fingernail look at hand then just put your thumb in between the orange and appealing and pretty much they come right straight off very much like a navel orange and any little strings that are sticking out I kind of take off all right now from the top side just put your thumb right down in it like that and try to separate it in the middle if you can sometimes you really can't then a big oops we'll break that one in quarters and I usually just go ahead and take that little center section out if I can a little thing and just break in quarters again and I don't do them in no single unless they just come off and I'm going to show you one I'm going to get one out of the freezer that I froze last night so I could demonstrated all right there we go this one is one quarter of you know pulled apart in quarter sections and it is surprising pretty solid now what I do and this is just to make sure that there are no large seeds in there I just use my paring knife and you can do it very easily when it's frozen say just take that top section off and if there are any large seeds you'll see them then through that the wrong side right now I'm going to get a little Bowl now if I'm going to use these for smoothies what I do and by the way if you want to take this the pith off of it this is the time to do it not before you freeze it but afterwards now oranges just freeze extremely well I have been very very happy with all the oranges are frozen now if I want to use it as a tout of salad topper what I do is just slice it this way and by the time you've got your salad ready this will all be thought out and you'll be able to top your salad with some little orange segments and again this is the time to pull that little white pith off that's what they call that white a little pit after your your you have already present them and are then going to get ready to use them let's see there's all sections and you know they work fine okay now to go in as smoothly all I do is just take the section cut that little middle out and just use a little paring knife this is serrated a very fine serrated little knife and I just throw it in like that and if I want to take any of that pith off now they say the pith on the orange has as much vitamin C as the orange does but you can just pull it off very easily once it's frozen and if you want those little strings off like that it's also the best time to pull the log soon good is one more and this is just one segment and it looks like that might have a seat in it but let's find out now it does it I thought it did but it didn't I usually run across a big seed maybe every 3-4 or inches so now what I would do on this is just cut it like that or if you wanted to just take that peeling off completely you could just cut it right into and I promise you as soon as it falls out it's just like a fresh orange I mean I can't tell one bit of difference in oranges uprising and those that I've used like this not one bit of difference all right so I'm going to finish doing my oranges now and I'm going to do a few more and I'll show you how bag them up all right we'll be back in just a minute all right you're ready to put these oranges in a little law freezer bag and you do want to make sure that you get bags that are specifically for the freezer they're actually a thicker plastic and your food will keep better now these are in little core sections for the most part now they really will not stick together or if they did you just pop on the part and what I usually try to do is get at least two oranges in a bag if I can of course these are rather large oranges but maybe I can get them in there now in the past I have placed them in a little plastic earthbound containers but I've already used all those containers freezing all this stuff so they're going to just press that as much air as I'm going to get out of the bag and I don't really worry too much about the air because I have a zero temperature freezer now that means is I have to defrost my freezer maybe three or four times a year now in this bag when I want to use one for smoothies usually I use about an orange and a half when I put them in smoothies along with other stuff and I just take out the amount I need and they will absolutely freeze solid now I was trying to see if this is thought out yet it's still not completely thought out maybe it's running with us alone there it is stalled out tastes just like the fresh alarms you'd never know the difference anyway there you are these are Valencia and I really about oranges whether I get a good deal or not of course getting with the farmers market you always get a better deal than you do in the grocery store and that is our state farmer's market in West Columbia South Carolina but I mean if you're in Florida or you're in California you know buy directly from the farm or you'll be a lot better off anyway that's it I've got a lot of work to do on these and we will see you next time", "pqRvu8wVgFg": "hi it's Stephanie from a food dehydrator calm here to dak dehydrate lemons what I've done is I've washed off my lemons thoroughly and then I dry it and keep the skins right on there because I'm going to use this for my famous lemonade and then I chop off the ends and then I take it over to my mandolin chopper very easy to do I'm going to take up a half and I have all these beautiful lemons that I'll place on my dehydrator sheet nice thickness this is about a quarter inch thickness you don't want to go too thin on the lemons because then they'll get stringy but what I'll do is I'll show you how I made how I make lemonade with my dehydrated eleven so you can pull some out have a friend come over and see how easy it is to entertain this spring and summer but I'll come back with the results and happy dehydrating please see me at a food dehydrator calm and I'd be happy to answer any of your questions and we also feature the full line of excalibur products as well as other accessories heavy dehydrating and I'll put that on for about six hours or so I don't like to go past 125 130 fruits and veggies have a great day happy dehydrating hi it's Stephanie from eco dehydrator here to dehydrate oranges I know I've done this before but before I kept the peels on this time I'm going to peel it and it's so easy to do peel back these and then I'm going to go over and when the peel is off I'm going to slice each one in small slices but this is how it's going to look so my kids will love it they love oranges already I know they're going to love these dehydrated oranges then you know what I've done I've actually put these in with my lemons and because they both have a strong citrusy taste I think it'll turn out fine but I know my kids will be the test and I'll come back with the results I have a whole nother tray and I have a bunch more oranges so I'll keep keep peeling and I'll let you know how they turn out this one's nice and thick they'll be interesting to see how it looks dehydrated thanks and happy dehydrating bye bye hi it's Stephanie again from eco dehydrator I wanted to show you another way that you could take off the peel and then you can actually have visas treat and then dry them on your dehydrator that way I just took out a tray above that but I'll take all these neat little orange chunks now put them up on our trays and then I'll be hydrate them that way but I'll show you the results in a little while thank you so much for watching have a great hi it's Stephanie from a food dehydrator calm back with the results of my lemons my oranges and my orange chunks they actually turned out really good it took about 15 hours or so and they look really great and then here my oranges they that really terrific I know the kids are going to love these or I can just vacuum seal them but here are the little chunks they turned out super bleah and the kids have already had some this morning and they absolutely love it so go get yourself a dehydrator and dehydrate something today see me at any time at a food dehydrator Calm we have some great tips and the articles and discussions and we hope to see you soon thanks", "veWU_zuE8i0": "[Music] today we're going to make a candied orange IPA and here's how it's done all right ask I'll brown with Clymer supply this is my buddy Tommy Tommy has a background in the culinary arts sup disclaimer Tommy he's never brewed beer before but doesn't have a problem on the strongest backgrounds and culinary arts you have so what we're gonna prove today is it's another summer beer so we're going to use some Citra hops we're going to use some lemon drop hops and we're actually going to [Music] so we had six pounds of Malta to row a pound of oats a pound of wheat in corn this is not we're shooting for a beer that's a bit sweeter and it has a bit more body just because this is gonna be a lower alcohol beer it's gonna be a more of exceptionable beer you were mentioning it 160 degrees which is kind of on the higher end of the mass spectrum yeah buddy we're making some beer while we're mashing will process the citrus assume you're feeling fruit dry it you want to get his suit if that's possible you can do this in other ways I use this TP or some of them are mark there's different sizes one two you can find it only inside here you want a low number because that's going to take west of the tip of the orange with it and to be less bitterness so we're gonna bring this to a boil the water needs to be cool when you start and then turn it off strain it and then start again fresh so you don't want to let this boil you don't want to let them know what their well the reason you just want to bring it to a boil is take out some bitterness the process the fruit at a boil it's going to bring out one hander now we're going to do the women you I'm doing separate so ladies get all mixed up sweet lead breath and then your pip is going to be nice and soft really pliable we're actually gonna candies here in just a little bit [Music] [Music] we're gonna bring this kennel up to a boil and while we're doing that we're going to work on these Candida lunges so you want to use the parts when you're making your set the syrup we're going to use this sugar in the raw cuz this is dark it's going to kind of give you a little more Carly notes so you want to wait it out 50/50 yeah so the fields will just fit in the for about 45 minutes after that we will basically dehydrate them so we'll bring this up to a boil to make sure things dissolve and it will cut it down to kind of a soft simmer and then we'll add our zest so now that we have dissolved all of our sugar created our simple syrup we're gonna add our peels so now that we've added our assessed we're going to simmer this for about 45 minutes you can't want a medium simmer so the kettle is up to a boil and now we're gonna add a quarter ounce of Citra hops so our citrus is done being candy if you want to come look at it here most of the citrus is kind of gone translucent all the moistures been cooked out of it and this is exactly what we want so now we're just going to strain out all the simple syrup here and this is kind of what your end product should look like here translucent really sticky now we're going to dehydrate these st. earlier you can oven you can just like leave your pilot on and put them in overnight that will work it certainly helps if you have a nice dehydrator though you want to keep your fuels separated as you can just so they have a chance to evenly kind of all dehydrated [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so we're done with the boil we're going to cool this thing down to 165 and our hops and hops so now that the work is cooled down and 3 ounces of drops and we're going to add one ounce of these lemon drops so now that we've added our hops we're going to take our orange syrup and add it to the wort we've also heated up a little bit of hot water on the side just so that we can get the last oh go ahead and stir that around so we were only at about five nine quarter gallons that's why we add in our water it looks like we're almost at about five and a half gallons now if that additional water now we're going to add in California ale yeast here package is telling me we need to just cool it down to the 65 before we add it so I'm gonna dump the sanitizer out of the carboy and then we're going to transfer our work so it looks like we have about I know just over five gallons so we'll be back in three four or five days to dry out this and add our candy citrus 1046 alright so we finish this beer up like a week ago we are ready to dry hop it we're also gonna add some candy two inches which are done really delicious really nice and sweet oh yeah totally dried out Oh but pulling out all the moisture hopefully that's going to add a lot of flavor into our door beer gonna just like hit my hands with some stars and let's go out do you want to grab the hops maybe yeah sure out of hedge smells good it looks pretty gross I guess the plan with the oranges is I'm just gonna add like a little bit of vodka we'll try that there alright so the idea is this hops are anti microbial so probably not anything gonna be growing on those that's gonna impact the beer this candy the orange has been just chilling out in the office for like a week not so sure about it we're gonna soak it in some vodka not much I mean we're adding like a tiny tiny bit of alcohol so hopefully if there's anything girls going on here it will be killed by this vodka so we got we got one else here we're gonna do two ounces of secre we only have one ounce of sitri apparently you're gonna add another ounce of lemon Jeff alright so now I'm gonna add our oranges to our bag we're going to do this over Neath our our beer just in case the vodkas pulled any flavor out of the oranges alright cool perfect all right woman JPA is done for many we've kicked it up carve it up and

that you can make your own dried oranges that you can use in all sorts of things just in time for the holidays so to start out just cut up some oranges in about 1/4 inch slices like this pretty easy and then what you're gonna do is take out some of the juice now you don't want to take out too much you just want to get them a little bit dry cuz they're gonna take a little bit less time in the oven if they're a little drier to start so just kind of squeeze out as much of the juice as possible and then you're just gonna lay them out on an oven tray like this so just lay them out so that they don't touch each other just put them out there about two oranges is gonna fill up an oven tray like that just fine put these in the oven for about 4 hours at 150 degrees so think low and slow and when they come out they'll be hard like this but still beautiful and you can use these for all sorts of things like I'm gonna do a little arrangement here with some Seckel pears and oranges and this would look just beautiful on your Thanksgiving table pretty cool huh you could always use ribbon on the outside or you could put them on ribbon like this use them as ornaments on your holiday tree or tie them around things like this and check this out you can use them even as napkin rings so I've got my silverware in here and I'm just gonna roll it up like that and I love rolling up silverware because it's so easy it's just grab and go especially if you have a buffet table and just tie it around like that and there you go doesn't that look pretty and it's customizable you can use different ribbon you can use different sizes of slices of oranges it's a nice way to add a little bit of nature to your holiday table and there you go who would have thought that a nice fresh orange could be turned into something so beautiful thanks so much for watching I am Yvette Rios here on eHow food happy holidays you", "97K84Bv5ljM": "[Music] how to keep rats out of citrus trees Groo frat and citrus rat are alternative names for the black rat the black rat Rattus Rattus used to be the most widespread species of rat and is the one that carried the bubonic plague throughout europe now the black rat has been superseded in European and North American homes by the Norwegian or brown rat Rattus norvegicus but the black rat still flourishes outside in gardens and on farmland it is also the most common rat in Florida this rat likes fruit and is an excellent climber if you own a citrus tree you may be less than delighted to discover you are sharing your crop with local rodents fortunately it is not particularly difficult to rat proof a tree things you'll need pruning equipment tape measure sheet metal wire pliers scrap wood prune all branches and twigs that touch fences walls the ground or anything else these form bridges allowing rats easy access to your tree measure the circumference of your tree near the bottom purchase a piece of sheet metal about 20 inches wide the length should be the circumference of the tree plus 2 inches ask the supplier to punch 5 or 6 holes in both ends bend the sheet around the bottom of the tree and use strong wire to secure the ends together this forms a slippery guard that rats can knock on remove off root immediately after it falls to discourage rats from staying nearby encourage natural predators such as snakes and small mammalian carnivores by piling up scrap wood and twigs in an undisturbed corner of your land minimising the use of outdoor lights at night encourages owls natural predators keep rodent populations under control [Music] you

bitter orange and lemon\nthey're best known for lending their flavor to Earl Grey tea and their scent\nto the world's perfumes but they also make a fantastic Moroccan style\npreserved lemon bergamot orange citrus condiment and that's what we're going to be doing today It's my least favorite season here in\nParis those long bleak weeks that draw between the end of winter sales and the\nfirst budding of the plane trees out on the boulevard fortunately it's also the\nseason of two of my favorite things from warmer climes: mimosa flowers and bergamot fruit bringing either of\nthese home is like bringing in as many tiny suns no matter how gray the day but\nbeing able to preserve the fruit as a condiment this is brightly flavored as\nit is colored is an added bonus the recipe, or maybe I should say technique, couldn't be simpler all you need are bergamots, and salt because we'll be salt-curing bergamots whole\nyou'll want to find organic fruit there are several varieties the ones I find here\nat the organic farmers market are yellow, round and fairly smooth skinned also, if you're wondering what to do with lemons or if you can't find bergamots\nthis recipe was originally intended for lemons so while they won't have the same\ndistinct flavor they'll still be delicious Meyer lemons another hybrid\nare a great substitute also make sure you have plenty of kosher salt on hand\neither rock or sea salt just don't use iodized table salt which\nwould ruin the fermentation process on a grooved cutting board to collect the\njuice start to quarter a bergamot or lemon taking care not to slice all the\nway through sprinkle it liberally with salt then turn upside down over the jar trying to\nspill as little salt as possible and splay it, I'm not sure how else to say\nit, on the bottom continue filling the jar as snugly as possible pressing down as you go leave a little space at the top of\nthe jar hopefully as you've been filling and pressing\nthe salt has already started to draw out the juice and you have enough to cover\nthe citrus if not add extra juice I used seven bergamots for a one-liter/\none-quart jar and the juice of one more to cover I'm also using a glass pickle\npebble but you don't really need one I like to use French Le Parfait wire bale\njars because no metal ever touches the contents salt and citrus juice corrode\nmetal lids in no time and I can't imagine it's healthy I'll put a link for\nthe parfait jars below incidentally, Moroccan style preserved bergamots and\nlemons are lacto-fermented if you'd like to see how I ferment other foods using\nthese jars let me know in the comments leave the jar somewhere out of direct\nsunlight for about a month before you use it you can turn it upside down from\ntime to time and open it to tamp down the contents to keep the fruit submerged if you need to but really that's all there is to it So to use your bergamot lemon when it's ready--the wait will be long but worth it you'll want to pull off a quarter scoop out the pulp and, unless you're a real salt fiend, rinse it I would gladly have demonstrated, but last year's supply is long gone and by the time this one's ready, bergamot season would have been over anyway you can slice the\nbergamont peels thinly to toss in salads or chop into larger pieces for use in\ndishes like tagines and even crush them into a paste for use\nin marinades or soups when mine are ready I'll post more ideas so be sure to\nsubscribe and hit the bell to be notified when I do and let me know how\nyou end up using yours in the comments below in the

bursting with flavor and sometimes even though they're available all year round they're quite bitter if you purchase them when they're not in season even if they aren't season from afar in another country they are usually picked when they're green and the the actual lemon will never mature to be as juicy as it is in season so we're going to dehydrate the lemons because you're going to use them in your favorite stocks soups you can even add them to some tea beautiful way to flavor your food in fact it's been used for hundreds of years in areas like the Middle East Turkey even the southern Mediterranean so for this recipe your ingredients are going to be lemons of course some aluminum foil you're going to pre-heat your oven to 200 degrees and you're going to thinly slice the lemons almost a paper like thin consistency because you really want them to dehydrate evenly make sure all the seeds are removed and place them side by side and dehydrate for about say an hour and a half to two hours until they produce this beautiful glazed like consistency that's lightly browned you can definitely enjoy these all year round really flavorful and if you'd like to have a cocktail from time

Pin So, last week I'm rummaging through the comments and found this gem of a pin left by CRAFTYAMY, A bunch of you liked it up, it's these brightly dyed, beautiful, colorful, lemons. Let's see what the Pin-O-Meter has to say about this That's what I figured. Let's get started. I got myself some lemons, two varieties to be exact of differing brands Scored some food dye and busted out this horror movie sized syringe Which is really just a meat flavor injector First up I'll take on the blue dye and fill up the injector Now I'm just using straight up food dye, no dilution, no water, no nothing Now, due to the laws of nature there is absolutely NO WAY that this lemon can possibly turn blue due to the whole yellow and blue make green color scheme thing With the first lemon, I picked a nice soft spot, stuck the needle in until I reached the center of the lemon and slowly, very slowly, began to inject the dye Seems to be going pretty well here, and then-Oh, what the..? Woah, hey, oh, stop, stoppit, stop exploding! Well that is just a *BLEEPING* mess Awesome. Alright, lemme try this again. I got another lemon and figured that if I could first maybe squeeze some of the lemon juice out, then maybe there wouldn't be as much pressure So I stuck the needle back in and this time, it was a little easier, it took the dye a little bit OH *BLEEP* YOU *Bleep* Alright, this is just... *BLEEPING* Stupid.. Alright this first brand isn't working, on to the other variety Now I did the same thing as before, pierced the small hole and began to fill up the lemon with the dye Surprisingly, this variety is actually taking the dye in a lot easier maybe the solution depends on the type of lemon you use, I dunno Still a little messy, still kinda squirting back a little bit, still pressurized, but definitely not as bad Onto the next lemon. This one..this one sucked This green one was a little bit better Oh you *BLEEEEEEEEEP* Oh yeah, and by the way, I just ruined my cutting board. Sweet. Once this horrible, HORRIBLE process was over, I left the lemons to sit for two days Now, to my surprise after only about 12 hours these lemons were taking on the color of the dye Way more than I expected This lemon is actually turning full on blue, this one green, this lemon is turning red don't know how that's happening but it's kinda crazy I even added a couple more drops into the puncture holes of the lemon to speed up the process a little bit Two days later my mind was blown, the lemons had turned full on red, blue, and green The other brand lemon however didn't take the dye the same way, but Oh, oh wait, hold on, oh yeah, ok, let me turn off that filter first. Oh. Ahhh, ok, I see, this is how they really turned out Yeah...Yeah not so much. Alright, let's cut em open, let's see what's really going on here Mhm..I see. Maybe this one....No. Maybe-No, no. Maybe not. Nope. Negative Hey, you know what they say, when life gives you lemons.. Mmm, lemonade! Have you got a pin that needs debunking? Maybe one that you ran across that you're really excited about? Let me know about it in the comments below, and hey, if you've tried any pins recently and maybe you've got some questions, be sure to hit us up in the brand new ThreadBanger Man Vs. Pin forum over on Google+ I'm sure there's gonna be maybe a link in the description or an annotation floating around here somewhere Regardless, check it out, drop me some new pins, and I'll see you

trees are now showing hints of orange as fruit ripens on the tree the traditional Louisiana citrus season has begun and it is expected to last for at least three months this season you know it's just kicking off the Satsuma they're coming in the neighbors are gonna be coming in so they all have citrus till probably those January into January 1st of February last year severe winter damaged many citrus trees and the number of growers in the state has been declining Terri Brewer grower in Terrebonne Parish lost nearly 1/3 of his trees last year but he is determined to remain in business hopefully what we have now will be enough to generate enough income so I can I'm looking at Clinton about two or three hundred more trees bro is one of the last major producers left in the area freezes hurricanes and the hard work involved with citrus have filled the decline it is labor intense you have to have the desire to do this you really do and I don't think people have the desire to do this like 20 years Burrell has a good crop of satsumas and navel oranges he believes his navels are sweet enough now to pick but he's waiting for them to get even sweeter consumers should start to see navels around Thanksgiving many homeowners have planted their own citrus trees which allows them to enjoy fresh fruit Jeffrey L says homeowners should leave the ground bare underneath the tree to help radiate heat for freeze protection and should not leave large amounts of fruit on the tree they'll have a Satsuma tree with 500 satsumas on it and you really don't want to leave all that on there that fruit needs to be taken off because it is expanding it you know using the energy for that tree to produce so if you're a fan of citrus take advantage of tree-ripened fruit now with the LSU AG

open the lemon and pour some salt sugar inside place the lemon in a bottom of a clean jar and continue process with the remaining lemons I met a large amount but of course this recipe can be cut in half or third pack the lemons into the jar and covering each layer of lemon with the salt and sugar mixture refrigerate the lemons for at least two weeks but they are best after three months and will keep for up to one year three months have passed and this is what you've got if you have used a large container like I did you might want to divide lemon confit into smaller batches and making sure though that each container is covered with juice seal them and keep refrigerated to use lemon confit remove the flesh and scrape the remaining white part keeping the peel only rinse it well or blanch

never heard of before so follow me i'll go and check it all out okay over to gavin all right here we are back again after kim's little uh rosemary tree it's just there you go right this is for kim's first time as camera person by the way so we'll see what it looks like anyway we've got lemons and kim tells me that a lemon this is well there's a lemon this is called a eureka lemon um it's got dimply skin not like a maya lemon which has a smooth skin uh she says that these retail on the shops at the moment for 70 cents each but these are organic uh and a little bit bigger than your average lemon so i think they're probably worth 1.50 each would be reasonable so we'll pick off see and see how much money we've got [Music] [Music] if they know that yeah get the right ones because there's still some um there's lots of some green ones on there i'm not picking green remember the lemon trees have spikes on them too no don't prick yourself this tree is covered in bees here this bush which one it's rosemary well get some close-ups please yeah yep okay it's not until you actually stop for a second that you can hear all the humming going on spot the bees so beautiful all right back together how you going there honey no i can't see any yellow through the tree hey mrs pods did you enjoy that watermelon that i gave you yesterday yeah i bet you're looking for mr gavin aren't you eh has a voice she says hello mr govind how are you today mr gavin always makes gavin laugh because i'm a bit bit nutty they probably back again whole bowl of lemons can we can see that nice now just come over to the tree and you'll see that next season's lemons are already coming okay yeah there's lots of them it'll flower again uh it's nearly spring about three days from spring so it'll flower again soon alright so i'm just washing them in the sink one two three one two three 21. 21 lemons uh at a cost of a dollar a lemon 30 dollar 50 yeah there you go so just wash them just make sure there's nothing that's all you need it's just a little bit of warm water funny you should say that kim is that we're going to um slice them up and freeze them we'll use some well i suppose the nice cleaner skin ones in drinks and stuff like that but we'll slice them up freeze them uh and uh preserve them for the summer for drinks and because they'll kind of make like an ice cube as well wouldn't they yes they'll be a nice ice cube in the drink and a nice lemony flavor if you're into that sort of stuff i am i know you are right yep so kim wanted me to cut him in thirds because she thought that uh quarters would be a little bit too big what i'm going to do with these is freeze them i didn't know until the other day that you could actually freeze lemons so kim saw them online online shopping hopefully they don't add anything to them i doubt they would think it's essentially citric acid i think that'll do that's what's in the bag [Music] nice there they are in the freezer bye freezer oh it's a fish follow me this way so past the chucky's house we've got lemonade fruit now these are across between lemons and i think it's oranges uh they're slightly sweeter than lemons they're quite nice citrusy tart but a little bit of sweetness so i'm gonna pick some of these for kim as well um before they go rotten on the tree there's heaps there i don't know what the cost of the market i've never seen them in the shops and this tree is always fully laden with [Music] them [Music] i'll leave some on there because they they they stay fresher when they're on the tree you pick them then you gotta either freeze them or put them in the fridge [Music] nice big bowl of lemonade fruit lovely so kim's just slicing up some of the lemonade fruit and she's going to freeze some of those in slices as well yeah because these are just beautiful in really lovely cool glasses of water or if you've got a cordial or something like that yeah they're good for juicing too yeah full of juice so i don't put these ends in because there's too much pith on them but the great one and the good thing about slicing they just pop into a glass and i don't like pips floating in my drinks so these gosh there's not very many seeds in these ones there's probably about three or four in each fruit and then she goes up to number five nice there we go there's some lemonade slices and kim's going to put those in the freezer in a minute so we've got a that's the lemon tree over there is the lime tree just just starting to flower now so i need to pick some limes on the ground there i think you can see it's the chili bushes so i'll pick some of those up now and uh we'll get those inside and i'll have some in some cervezas soon that would be nice just you know in the top lime in the top of the bottle very nice not as many as i thought because i have been picking them during the winter so i've got a few they're tahitian limes so they go ripe they turn that color and when they're just just before they're right that's what you see in the stores that color there but they have no seeds in them whatsoever so they're really really nice so that's our lime haul not many there as you can see but there's enough they'll be good for drinks there'll be some more growing soon as you saw there was some flowers on the bush so on the tree not a bush uh so that'll be fine so that's small enough to go down the cerveza yeah yeah cool that's what i'm thinking yeah you're gonna freeze them too yeah all right cool yeah so they're the they're the limes ladies and gentlemen kim says don't fear them notice they're having they haven't gone there you go there's not there's no seeds in it in the limes you'll notice in the tahitian limes anyway which is fantastic that's why we don't um uh don't hesitate to putting them in the neck of bottles of drinks isn't it yeah cerveza you know like corona and not coronavirus but corona beer anyway anyway that's kim slicing limes very exciting stuff here on the vlog channel today very nice yeah yeah well we've never done this before with uh fruit so yeah it's good so there you have it ladies and gentlemen there's my garden with the fruit trees those uh citrus trees i planted in 2007 so they're 13 years old still fruiting which is fantastic they're in pots um as you can see big pots there uh next to mrs potts they're still whinging over there um but uh yeah and they they're fine i top them up a little bit of topsoil every year put some fertilizer scatter some blood and bone fertilizer around and they really do grow great it's nearly time probably next weekend i'll put some more fertilizer in there and put a little bit more topsoil and that'll help feed them because citrus trees are surface root feeders so a little bit of fertilizer there not too much because it'll burn their roots so just be careful and yeah you get a nice crop and the the trees are looking really healthy so we do have one tree that doesn't really fruit that much this one here it's a mandarin tree i think we've had mandarins on it three times so not the best plus we've got a couple of other citrus trees here these are blood oranges uh that one and that one there uh they need a little bit of tlc a bit of water you're starting to get the tips going a little bit yellow but i wouldn't the other day but yeah i need a little bit more attention but yeah they're there as well so lots and lots of citrus we love it here in drinks so we'll be planting out the uh spring garden in probably two or three weeks time we're trying to get some seeds but because of lockdown here in victoria we found that just about every seed shop everything's closed all the nurseries are closed there are some marlwater seed companies so we're going to try and track down some some seeds there so we'll see how we go and uh get growing some seedlings or plant some direct from the ground depends on what plant they are anyway that can be the subject of another vlog all right thanks for watching today on our lemon and lemonade picking and lime picking escapades uh and show you how we store those for the summer anyway thanks for watching everybody and we'll see you next time [Music]

two months however long we've been in self-isolation because of covid i know this is a very stressful uh time a lot of people worried about what the future brings and all that but i will tell you one silver lining for me is it has allowed me to get back in the kitchen and make a lot of things i'm cooking more i have more time on my hands and i know you do too so hopefully you've been enjoying these little episodes i've been putting together these recipes i know that since i posted one of my first recipes i've getting a lot of comments asking for my lemon curd recipe well today is the day because i'm going to make lemon curd for you guys as well as a few other citrus recipes because i went to hamburger mary's uh the other day and i was checking on things i noticed we had a lot of citrus fruit uh that we had just gotten a shipment right before this whole outbreak came and so we had all sorts of lemons and limes and oranges uh you know we get this for the bar and also for the kitchen and yes you know citrus will last a long time but it does start to go bad after a while it starts to discolor and i was thinking well i need to do something with all the citrus fruits so today i am going to show you a recipe with lemons oranges and limes three for one today okay so let's get started the first recipe i'm going to make for you is lemon curd now wipe off that sour look on your face because even though lemon curd has a funny name that rhymes with turd it is actually a very scrumptious delicious spread it is sweet and tangy and tart citrusy and it's so good on so many things biscuits scones pancakes muffins pound cake put a dollop on some vanilla ice cream it's delicious now i first heard of lemon curd when i was in london now you may not know this but i was a flight attendant for a few years and i used to go to london often on trips and i heard this lemon curd and i was like what the heck is this i tried it it was delicious and i've loved it ever since and it's really easy to make let's go over the ingredients you'll need you're going to need three quarter cup lemon juice that's about four to five lemons one tablespoon lemon zest a half a cup of butter that's one stick three quarter cups of sugar and eggs now i have combined a few recipes together some of recipes i've seen have called for whole eggs and some have called for egg yolks so what i've done is split the difference so i've got two whole eggs and two egg yolks so let's get started all right let's get started now one of the tricks to making good lemon curd is keeping the eggs from curdling now i know lemon curd you might think that it should curdle but that's not a good thing you don't want scrambled eggs in your lemon curd so um the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to heat up my lemon juice with the lemon zest and we're just going to heat this up not to boiling but just so it's nice and good and hot now meanwhile in a separate bowl i'm going to whisk my eggs with my sugar eggs sugar [Music] just gonna whisk that up [Music] okay so my lemon juice is nice and hot it is not boiling so i'm going to turn this off and the next thing you want to do is you want to temper the eggs because you don't want eggs with a bad temper no tempering eggs is basically adding some of the hot liquid into the eggs while you whisk it that's going to bring the eggs up to a higher temperature without shocking them and scrambling the eggs so you want to do this it takes two hands so while you pour a little bit of this hot liquid into the eggs you want to be whisky you don't want to pour it all you just want to pour a little bit so [Music] give that a little stir so i put about half the liquid in and you know what i'm just going to go ahead and add it all because now that my eggs have been tempered it's less likely to curdle and scramble so now that this is all mixed up what you want to do is you want to add it back into the pot with butter so here we go back in the pot [Music] we'll add our butter and now we'll bring this back up you don't want this to boil you want it the butter to melt and you want it to thicken up and it's going to take about 10 minutes and you need to stir it constantly because if you don't stir it constantly then those eggs at the bottom will scramble i've got this on about a medium heat so after a few minutes you'll start to see the butter melting and it's going to get all rich and creamy and delicious oh so good now once the butter is melted you're not done because you want to keep on stirring this until it's nice and thick like i said it's going to take about 10 minutes constantly stirring it now if you happen to have a double boiler that is super handy because then it's a little less likely that your eggs will curdle and scramble because you've got that separation between the the heat the water and the curd you could also make a makeshift double boiler with you know just put a pot of water boiling underneath and then use you know a metal bowl or even a glass bowl on top and that will provide that separation so that you don't have the direct heat on the curd but i find that you know if you just constantly stir it it usually works out just fine and it's one less pot and one less bowl to clean so win-win all right i am starting to feel it thicken up oh yes [Music] all right i think this is done and there you have it you saw how simple and easy it is to make lemon curd all i have to do now is for this to cool a little bit and then i'm going to put it in jars and seal it up so i can keep it for later use in the fridge it'll last for a good couple of weeks [Music] okay so next up at that it's i'm sorry if i catch it it'll be great okay next up is oranges so we're gonna make orange marmalade real lady orange another super simple recipe but it does take time and there's a process especially if you're gonna can it what we have here is five navel oranges that have been very thinly sliced and quartered about an eighth of an inch and while you're doing that you want to pick out all the seeds because you don't want the seeds in the more blood we have the juice and the zest of one lemon and we have eight cups of sugar eight cups of sugar it's a lot of sugar because we're making a lot of marmalade now in the pot i already have six cups of water i'm gonna bring that to a boil with all of these ingredients except the sugar sugar you add later i've got my oranges [Music] and my citrus my lemon juice and lemon rind so basically i'm just gonna give this a little stir i'm gonna wait for it to boil i'm gonna cook it down for about 30 to 40 minutes it's gonna take a while [Music] all right while we're waiting for the oranges to get all cooked down and tender i'll go ahead and show you the next recipe and it's with the lime so what's best thing with lime margaritas so we're gonna make our own margarita mix and it's so easy we're gonna start with a cup of hot water this was just boiling i'm gonna add a half a cup of sugar let that get good and dissolved takes just a minute all right now my sugar's dissolved and i'm just going to add to it a cup of lime juice this was about five limes but sometimes slimes aren't as juicy as always so it may take five to ten limes to get a cup so that's it easy peasy margarita mix i'm gonna pop this in the fridge so we can cool down and we'll be able to make margaritas while we're finishing up the marmalade [Music] okay so this has been going for about a half an hour and it's definitely softened up but i think it's got another 10-15 minutes to go you want the the rinds to be really really soft because if you think about like when you're eating orange marmalade you don't want to bite on like a chewy hard rind so you won't let those cook down and this will depend a lot on how thick you cut the slices so the thinner the slices the faster it'll cook we'll just have to wait and see okay so i think it's about done it's been going for about 45 um remember to stir it very very frequently so it doesn't stick on the bottom and what you're looking for is for all of the rinds to be really soft and cooked through so now it's time to add the sugar and like i said this is eight cups of sugar it's a lot of sugar oh and there it all goes yes all right so we're gonna stir this up bring it back to a boil and cook it down for another 15-20 minutes then we'll be about time for a margarita okay so while the marmalade is finishing up i thought i'd go ahead and make my cocktail and so a classic margarita you start with tequila obviously so you can measure it out but why bother i like mine strong now normally you put some triple stick in it i'm out of triple sec i didn't realize that when i started the video but you know what i do have oranges triple seconds basically orange the cork so i've already put a little extra tequila in it just need a little orange and then our homemade margarita mix [Music] tasty oh that is good so the only thing left to do now is to finish my marmalade and then i'm going to put it in some jars and seal it up really good if you want to know how to do canning that i recommend going on youtube and following some tutorials because it's too much for me to explain right now especially after i finish this margarita [Music] after spending all day in the kitchen i have worked up an appetite so my lemon curd is nice and chilled and i'm going to spread a little bit oh look at that amazing i am going to spread a little bit on top of this beer bread that i made now you may be asking what the heck is beer bread it is bread made out of beer oh my god it has like only a few ingredients super easy to make and if you want to know the recipe for it i have it on our drag for fans page i'll share the link if you love lemons and citrusy tart sweet things lemon curd is just the best and like i said you can put it on just about anything it's so good one more bun now my orange marmalade is setting up very nicely one thing you'll want to do while it's cooling in the jars is turn it occasionally and that will make sure that your orange rinds don't you know settle at the bottom or at the top and you want them evenly dispersed in the marmalade now i did alter the recipe after the fact because when i finished it uh it just wasn't thick enough so i ended up after i'd already put them in the jars took them out put them back in the pot cook them down a little bit longer to evaporate some of that liquid and then re-jarred them and now they are perfect so you'll see that the recipe now says five cups of water instead of six and i think that will solve the problem as for the margarita perfect i hope you've enjoyed these recipes we'll see you next time in the kitchen", "w7RrZflEwig": "you", "RFGt1nuqR6c": "alright this is my first tutorial on how to cut lines and lemons what you want to do is cut off the ends so I have my line here and it's like so now we're going to want to cut the slices or the wheel that some people refer to them but before we cut them up take your knife take your knife and make an incision in the middle like so not all the way but just slightly this will allow you to put the fruit on the glass on the rim of the glass and you'd be and then you want to do is cut the food into quarter-inch slices there you have it first slice", "XbYlfW8-yQw": "hello everybody i'm just a bird among the trees and last time you saw this lemon tree was a little over a year ago and it is now three years old and so for this video we're taking it all the way back to when this tree was a sea following a stop action animation time lapse showing the full three years of its crew i hope you guys enjoy [Music] uh [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so i hope you all enjoyed this video i got to have a lot of fun making it and the coolest thing that about the last video for this lemon tree was for me was actually the comments i got to hear so many stories from you guys about the citrus that you are growing and some of your old hats at it and some of you are planting your first seed and just trying it out and i just thought that was the coolest thing and i got a lot of questions from people asking about how i grew my citrus and i try to help out as best i can anybody who's been on this channel very long knows that i do like to reply to comments if i have an answer to them and even if i don't have an answer to your question immediately i do try and go and research the answer to it i don't just spout things i try to make sure that what i'm saying is actually correct and any of you who are old hats at it and have been growing citrus for a while go down in the comments see if there's somebody who needs a helping hand needs an answer to a question that you have the answer to help them out uh we're a community here we help each other out and i don't know i think that's pretty cool so if this is the first video of mine that you're watching welcome to the community it's pretty awesome here and hang out i don't know people here are pretty chill and if you are old hats here stick around it's awesome you know it and i will be seeing you in that next video bye", "00FBH7kvXIA": "[Music] good morning YouTube live for my 73 here it's a rainy day here at Columbia South Carolina so I have to get up and get out here and harvest these lemons while I got a pocket of sunlight and stop for a while but it won't be stopping for long got a 100 percent chance of rain today so what I plan on doing is going out here and harvesting autumn Emmons and oranges off of Linda not end up Lillian the lemon no to lift the lemon tree and down lemon lane so that's what we're doing but right now I'm gonna show you this is one example of they are all fully ripe in there they went from yellow and now they turn orange out there on the tree I'm gonna show you that in a minute and we've already harvested a lot for the holiday season and this is just one jar which is gonna go on a plastic bottle so I can freeze it but right now I've been using it so to get my morning tea popping no coffee today only fresh organic honey down in that sucker so we gonna head out here and we gonna pluck all these citrus off of these trees before a to labor because I don't want them to freeze and if I leave them on the tree while it's raining this hard what's gonna happen is the fruit will explode because it absorbs so much fluid so much juice they'll explode I've had that happen before and it's not going to stop raining no time soon so I better go get them right so come with me let's go pluck these limiters off that's it right there fresh organic lemon juice fresh organic honey and teeth let's go all your check think I'm not finished just we got a break in the weather so we go hurry up and get this done cuz I don't know how long it's gonna last okay so let's get this bucket and get rolling that's her right there I'm gonna set this tripod up I'm gonna go over there and get them oranges to once we done with this so let's get this going start from the bottom of course cuz it's easier so this is gonna kind of be brutal I'm not gonna be as careful as I used to be now that this tree isn't mature so I'm gonna start cutting these off like grapes in a minute and these are the ones just been laying on the ground all year visitors and as you can see here got some ants look at the size of this just like a grapefruit look at out that's a big one [Music] [Music] just Big Branch back here cuz I hate [ __ ] back here and I'm cutting off the whole wench so we gonna pick that up we'll be talking about that right there is just from kitchen compost all Meyer lemons this big look at the size Meyer lemons now let's go take that big branch off over there that's gonna be a doozy just the one I keep putting every every video this big manager mahir we taking that whole branch with us trust me it'll grow right back I'm taking this whole thing I hope we can see this you see I want to make sure that we can see this whole thing coming off that's that that's the whole thing right there full of giant juicy healthy Meyer lemons put the size of that put that string down there three moon in my tree at the same time that I'm harvesting all of this pressure is gonna relieve this tree and let it make it through the cold of this women it helps taking this whole thing off how many onions well no it's only two lemons on that one I'm gonna take that okay we ain't gonna butcher this one with only four but the huge weighing all that down I know a lot of people but a lot of people really do look at that that's what we talking about that's from just plain old kitchen compost you guys ma'am look at that score look at the size of them I'm taking this whole branch it's too big to be on the ground look at that taking this whole thing I'm going to turn a lot of these into more limit trees taking cuttings got plenty of this stuff meeting balls look the size of that monster good good so we got a full bucket its overflowing and I still got tons more to get off so I'm gonna come back to you when I get them all I'm trying to hurry up before a rain but it look like it might cut us a break so I'm gonna just keep it going this is a special spot here because this is actually a whole branch I don't know if you guys can see that I'm gonna try to bring it in as a whole branch just leaned over that was going up much this is one big giant branch that's heavy come on here show you what this is looking like that's what that's looking like like a bunch of grapes Meyer lemons that's how you do it right there shrink that bag down that's how you do it you guys right there Meyer lemons at his best offer linear that's three four five six seven eight nine nine limits right there we make sure that's not too yep nine limits like a bunch of grapes the bucket is almost full already it's hard for me to get in here and then it was stuck here's another bunch right here did I need to figure out that's coming up for this side branch and I'm also trying and being careful because what can happen here these limits are so heavy that I don't want one of these branches to slingshot me in the face after I cut it off that's how heavy they are once I get old wiley coyote going on now I gotta get deep down in the jungle now cuz I'm not exactly sure see that thorn right there I don't know if you can see that that sucker is lucky but Dad I'm gonna cut that off that's just waiting to store somebody's here if you got thorns just cut them off you ain't gonna hurt nothing at all yeah that's that's the branch I've been looking for yeah with all that's heaviest year that was one long branch before I cut it one big hole solid branch I'm about to take this suck off right now so there we go he's gonna get these robes on the ground all right you guys so that's about it let's go rack it up see how we came out can't leave my oranges wiry Satsuma and as you can see scale is on the peel this wasn't like just just a week ago when the seasons change dramatically like that what I've noticed is you get a lot of pest infestations Oh nearly bugs scale all of that stuff so the food is still good all you do is just rinse that off rinse the scale the scale come right off it's just a insect like any other insect so that's the old water Satsuma we're gonna open those babies up and give them a taste now we've been eating them we actually clean the other tree off over there this this tree here we'll all of these aren't trees is dedicated to princes me because my baby planted these trees when I hurt my back she took care of this for us this past spring this is my baby true the first year this tree was put in the ground doing this so what I'm gonna do you guys is I'm gonna come back out here tomorrow when it's not supposed to rain and I'm gonna spray me my oil all over this tree you get rid of these pests and to keep protecting it through the winter because I do not want nothing to happen to these trees and they literally will suck the life out of your truth they don't really harm it instantly they just slowly your tree all right small harvest put a harvest nevertheless there you go got a nice little mana or water satsumas this little baby oh it's juicy oh man definitely juicy and the smell on goodness I

guys something here's the cuttings that I took off my bears lime look real close and tell me what you see these are cuttings again cuttings root structure coming out here look at it this is just cuttings that I just took not too long ago a couple of months ago and we already have fruit blooms it's time to get these guys in another pot this is little Cara all of the lemons on this one and this is for my friend to ask me about they wanted to see the fruit production and the stages of the air layers that I took and you know when I did that air layer and as you can see this is the same year same season just a few months down the line loaded with fruit so this is for my friend that was asking me about that in that video just recently this is that same air layer as you can see you can identify little Cara the same pot I put it in everything and the roots have spread down there but this is that one so this tree will get huge and loaded full of delicious Meyer lemons all right you guys I hope you enjoyed it I sure did and I'm glad I got it out of the freezer for it was too late look at that that's that's a Meyer lemon that ain't even a grapefruit here's the grapefruit right

with me but this was pretty much the last harvest of this year for me now it's time to start putting tarps on stuff and getting things protected so thank you so much for all that you do keep on gardening you guys all right there from 73 I love you and I'm out happy holidays [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "zSRX2g8pZs4": "right in the backyard it's late afternoon after work passing by our measly fig tree here this guy's been around for about a year and a half this is the second opportunity to grow the season but I'm going to be going to this guy he's a dwarf orange tree is about six feet tall this trees been neglected for a couple of years so for the past past two years I've been watering it fertilizing pruning it trimming it just trying to keep an eye on it trying to keep down some of the pests and it's pretty cold right now in springtime and so instead of depending on the bees what I'm going to do is go around with my trusty little q-tip whoa key chip with a little pedal on it anyway with my q-tip and I'm just going to manually pollinate this tree pretty simple stuff you just got to be like be like the bee and just move that pollen around from blossom to blossom really like doing this last year this tree bear bore five whole five whole oranges it was pretty pretty bad crop in fact it was almost a nothing crop but like I said I've been taking really good care of it for the past couple of years I'm trying to bring it back and I'm hoping to get fifteen or twenty or maybe even twenty five good good oranges out of this little guy this year so anyhow this is the deal it's not rocket science super simple when you see an open blossom put the q-tip in there move it around see if you can get some get some pollen on it and come back and hopefully in a month or so get a bunch of little baby oranges growing that we can enjoy after the season flushes so there we go say goodbye to our little orange tree for now", "EKqufLNbiD4": "[Music] one of the best 11 variety to grow in the UK is you Rica lemon it's very similar to lemon loon Oreo they both all season lemons meaning you will get fruits throughout the if you look after them properly the benefit of these varieties are that they flower throughout the year so if you feel loose one set of flower in early spring or for whatever reason you'll always have chances to catch up as you can see this free code medium-sized lemons this will swell up a little bit more however this won't be the best lemons coming from this tree we had the best harvest in November this is an orb in the tree and the fruits are all over wintered so they had they had to go through the cold spell and therefore you can see a little bit of yellowing on the leaves now I haven't fertilized the tree at all throughout the winter citrus trees are evergreen and they do require fertilizer at a minimum work like a really low dose but if you all fertilize it then the tree won't take up the nutrients because the temperatures below 50 degrees Celsius the tree simply can't take nutrients up and the salt will build up in the soil subsequently killing the roots and then you have leaf drop which will eventually kill the tree the other most important thing is that to prune the citrus heart - a brunette hard means I mean you have to prune it really hard this tree was cut back last year and I'll show you where I cut it back so this tree gets cut back here and all this foliage you see the new growth we have plenty of fruits last year you and these were grown in a protected area outside till November and since the first frost it's been sitting in the greenhouse and unheated greenhouse with with minimal watering all I did was in November I gave it a half dose of slow-release cosmic fertilizer it's a high nitrogen fertilizer it's very gentle and every time when you water it it will get a minimal amount of feed although it it won't be taking up the nutrients but when the temperature goes about 15 degrees in the greenhouse it will have a little bit of something for it to keep on going throughout the winter and that will keep your tree healthy and that's all you need to do and I had zero die backs and none of my citrus died or suffered but I will show you the reason for using a special potting mix for citrus the other most important factor the most important thing is to not bury your citrus trees you will have to expose the field and roots above the soil line every time you feed make sure these roots are about well about this soil line and in the UK it's not advisable to March your citrus because we don't get the Californian heat over here citrus likes to feed around the soul surface not deep below so don't bury your citrus because they will die or they won't do well when it comes to potting mix most important thing is to select a high porosity potting mix meaning when you water the water just need to sit down straightaway but you will need to have ingredients like copper coil or stagnant peat moss perlite vermiculite perlite will give good drainage vermiculite out our cup coil or peat would keep holding nutrients for the tree therefore you would never all water them and it won't be sitting in water which will eventually lead to food wrote so high pores or high porosity potting mix is really important multi-purpose compost manure these are no excellent potting media they they good for garden borders and yes as a soil conditioners but they don't they're not good for container growing if you put them up in a multi-purpose compost they will grow and they will flower through the summer but if you leave them wet in mentor chances are the your trees will die so always use a high porosity medium and I will do a citrus important video soon now I will take you outside I have pruned all my setters except this one because we need to pick these fruits in couple of weeks they just need to sorry my battery died earlier so you can see the rest of my citrus trees are sitting out those simply because I want them to clam dies - the outdoor conditions and it's overcast for next few days and then we'll get some sunny spell so it's perfect", "hLhjPmm3QRU": "yeah you can't set other

outermost surface of the citrus rind is loaded with aromatic oils that boost the flavor and aroma of everything drinks two desserts two main dishes before you zest a piece of citrus wash your fruit thoroughly and no cutting it's much easier to zest citrus before you cut it open there are many ways to zest citrus fruit we'll show you how to create flavorful zest with or without special tools meet the citrus zest er this specialty tool was created specifically for zesting it features very small holes along the top that scrapes shallow ribbons from the surface of the citrus peel here's a little fruit anatomy lesson just beneath the yummy zest is a bitter white layer called the pith since you don't want to get any pith with your zest removing the zest and nothing but the zest can be tough scrape the peel like this to make long thin flavorful curls to garnish drinks or decorate cakes if your recipe calls for minced zest make a little pile of long curls then use a sharp knife to cut them into fine pieces meet the microplane grater this tool makes very fine zest shreds use a light touch because with these sharp edges you'll go from zest to pith in no time you can zest a whole lemon or lime in a flash keep moving the microplane around the fruit until you've removed all the zest the box grater this tool works in a pinch but zesting with the box grater tends to make the zest lose too much of its flavorful oil the basic paring knife and veggie peeler you don't need special zesting tools to zest it up a sharp knife or vegetable peeler can do the trick here's how remove the peel then turn it over and scrape off any white pith use your knife to cut the zest to the size you need here's a zesty money saving tip if you're juicing lemons or limes for a recipe freeze the empty citrus

my favorite when I was this morning there was a sushi restaurant nearby and I could like smell it we can angle this but I gotta watch this bowl so it was amazing frosting gonna get a little out with my zodiac sign I'm a Gemini I'm an Aries do you not really as I don't any I don't want to read the things I be like oh yeah that's me you're Rising Sun in your Start button I don't really know what that means but I can express like write it out for me she was like because you were born here at this time here's where all of everything was at the exact moment you were born right above you and that one was fairly accurate to me but everything that was just like doing artwork behind so good it's very shows that because I'm trying to I yeah I loved encore a super-fun and I've watched presents with musical the series and it's just it's fun it's a fun show the only show i watch on busy bus is madness [Music] whatever big wasn't really fun they don't make this really fun I'm happy just like you're like fun time I think Schuyler sisters was really fun too you guys are willing to learn I think those who are the top probably a lot cause you know why it's pretty fun yeah anything where it wasn't like frigid outside was pretty fun dismiss or I mean help sometimes very work fun but they were also very stressed evil and it was hot so very stressful was very hot let's get some cocoa miracle yes he was everyone is her video my favorite play is it's hard I don't know that me please see how they run is see how they run is totally good yeah it's a great comedy I really like to tell my convert as well yeah I suppose I really like waitress I really like I kept it a favorite secret garden is up there for sure to Oasis over there I don't want to drink anyone to go watches I'll see the worst experience this video we've made is probably first infertility price what's the coldest it's definitely the coldest I can decide if that was overall worse then let it go it was like I was more miserable during for the first time in forever reprise it was for a short amount of time let it go was like hey I could potentially have a baby yeah so anywhere past 37 weeks is [Music] like what she like the best human I thought she would be like my favorite character right that's what that's why I'm trying to decide it's like who my favorite character is because she is the best you do the night mopping it it's pretty fun pretty amazing and on that same note how much time you guys found on a music video a lot of time so first we go record which I'm gonna record for a music video on Friday and he gets is what it is first and then we'll film it which takes a day or two I would say our shortest videos like we filmed all this found in a couple hours plus recording in the studio but that one was all in one location and just really stop different shots you need some food so usually it takes a good day for record it wasn't me recording when making stuff for hours but Sony usually takes an entire day or for multiple days and then there's the ending process which can take like Oh Louise yeah Robbie will spend days I don't mean like literally days like probably could spend up to 48 hours yeah how's magic in it that's a another identity because our VFX guy has to make the effects and then send them over to us for approval and all that jazz [Music] hmm for me to come here because I like when a candle yeah but like in a spring of this summer I'm gonna want like a fresher country and where is Mexico it is like Mexico and Canada for us or the leisure world foreign countries but so yeah Mexico is where I've been cameras been to Europe so I went when I was in college I did stepping abroad we went to London and Paris so I'm in English England and France and then my husband and I had clears go went to Ireland and - so that was I really want to go back because we went to Dublin which is really fun but I want to go back to like rural Ireland where it's like small towns and sheep if you could catch yourself in any movie or TV show what would you cast yourself and the truth is I wouldn't want to cast myself in something that's already been made yeah like a genre or like a type of me I think did you mangy movies would be like so fun to be a part of like something like that so I was gonna catch myself in any kind of movie I really want to someday I have a stream okay good we'll stop the timer' of making a series out of this book series called the Amelia Peabody series which is about a female Egyptologist at the turn of the century and it's delightful see I want to turn the goose-girl into all those but I don't want to be and I don't know that I'll be in it either but I have you managed yeah yeah anyway so I I think that everybody must be like in the Marvel type of movie but not I also would love to play a character like Ray yeah I've seen Jumanji the newest ones yeah I love them so I could carry around house we're actually like funny but she also gets to be like and I think so far I don't think that water is wet like water isn't what you get wet from what makes things where it isn't wet but it's also not dry it's just liquid it's a liquid okay video we've got a few new videos in progress coming soon coming soon studio here you is anybody in this crowd old enough to remember when you like turn on the DVD player as a kid and like blasting through the speakers coming to you like a run and turn down the volume because it was spoke loud there's everybody here too young for that they write you I guess it doesn't matter if you got all the photos you're lagging a little bit it is a little if you have older siblings that like let you watch cool movies and my cool movies we need old movies everywhere Batgirl but like really good what's so good that are so good and some of them what is it listen to these how about touched you emotionally little women [Music] I was watching Alan oh hi hi Alice um okay guard future sister-in-law was what honor she still is she was watching our feet oh yeah I'm actually been significantly unemotional since I'm pregnant interesting yeah I've been blessed so I'm unfair to each prior normally okay I don't I just watch fuller or full house I started it and I just couldn't really good I think that's one of those shows that you have to be in the right it's like you to know and it's like nostalgic that people who watch the old one yeah hey boo boo how many cups is four ounces for us blue announces is equal to 0.5 us cup favorite actress and outdoor figure actress it's really tough I am a third from it Emily Blunt I love enemy Blanche you set me up there surrounding them I like but I think they're like Emily Blunt more than search aromas she's a little more versatile no no my favorite actor is our actress I mean I love the classic so it's like an Austin and the Thompson see I love Emma Watson as a person but she's definitely not my favorite actress I don't know I think she's I think he's good she's bad but I don't think she's new Camry in my opinion someone who would like impresses me as an actress as someone who will transform with every role yeah Emma's Emma in every role which isn't a bad thing that doesn't mean that she's right not a good actress but yeah if you would see a would be nice I know she done other stuff too but she yeah I watch it I don't want to watch it but she is delightful in Little Women and so good so good I was laughing so hard I think like Kristen Bell I was gonna do too much for what I've seen her and I really like favorite actor the one that comes to mind right now is Benedict Cumberbatch he's three also Emily's husband he is fantastic see I like him I see him but I think he's getting more opportunities that are lying there like show off the skills in house and he's like dude I got to step it up cause my wife is incredible yeah when you're married to Emily blonde are you kidding but it wasn't our okay spirit animal carry down I recall this my Patronus I've used my spirit animal I know it's not but I do really feel like it's my screwed out of all lucky number 4 did you know 40 times my lucky number - either records just my favorite number we are approaching or Swift favorite superhero film hi Incredibles any advice for people who are just starting out in theatres just fight work hard work hard and if you fail a lot don't let that discourage you it's what it is and if you have a lot of success at the beginning don't let it get to your head because it goes so oh yeah it comes and goes they'll be times when you're booking a lot of things and getting past a lot of shows everything yeah and the only thing that consistent is that if you work hard you're going to be able to do cool things eventually probably fresh raspberries raspberries like from your backyard yeah but probably like really good strawberries I love the horns we both play very very basic piano all right I have taken them except the graduate ok guess you're worse than I am the awesome folk can play like a few chords on a guitar but I'm not bragging here were you guys SP of the nice cool yes yes favourite drink dr. pepper do you want to I don't think that either of us it's like a dream to be on Bobby the course would be like so cool and if the opportunity what came up yeah I'd do it but it's not something that I am like think I'm not gonna go move to New York right now so I can go yeah it's not like a life dream even though it would be awesome so cool and I would absolutely do it and new that will change for me the future it's nothing that I can need to do before I die [Music] normally do you mean greets accepted cbx we can commute as the CVX which we do it every year young my answer for every number of way is I have I thought that's what I wanted to do like that's when I started acting I'm at this property remotely what I was like I'm gonna be on problem and I'm gonna be wicked I have basement zero desire like I've not seen that I never would but if somebody right now was like Paige we can offer you a role in a Broadway show that's not what I want to my life I mean I'm having a kid see why right now if they said right here's a moment I believe yeah okay and when I was your age I would say thing but now at this point I just like that's like I'm not married I don't have I'm not a student uprooting my life and going to New York to LA so my my dreams have shifted from being a moving to LA and moving to New York to creating things like I loved creating the videos that we do when we want to produce movies and things like that I still wanna activates don't want to be in things like that but we need all of it not necessarily in the traditional path but we have talks about we both saw Hamilton live it get toward here oh it's so good favorite Broadway show if you're acting are seen on Broadway is waitress probably but I have there's only been one show that I have not liked on Broadway and it was advance visit and it won the Best Musical but I'm sorry I did not think it was that good you guys agreed but you put this in back I can't read now yeah but we have to mix frosting so we're going to I am sad that we just disclosing I haven't seen the first child but we've read it but I think that is the cursed child from what I've heard is one of those rare instances where the script is terrible yeah what's your favorite part of it I want number five right now character I mean I love yeah yeah and then all you do is I'll like take turns you're just trying to layer these in so I did last time sorry what I'm showing are ITA's with colourful banners that we have I think that if you like this but and we can both be in it's not gonna point down no time okay so what I did lots of invited pink ones I think each one just got one scoot what's up room but they need to be upstairs [Music] this is you guys I mean what we're making today is from a box the best frosting recipe - you're like what but it's this really any frosting recipe it makes it so that like I don't like I don't like other case now you don't like other cupcakes because they don't have this frosting on sometimes I do labor but if it's like a red velvet actually the most great example I don't know there's like if you can get a flavor cookie okay so I'm at my device blue frosting and four bowls cuz those are the colors that we have we have four different food colors they're neon so now I'm going to drink some drops which is fine like walking around all day does not sound my one of my lifelong best friends in there it's in the dishwasher because it's clean anyway one of my lifelong best friends who I've been really good friends with since kindergarten called me what I'm also pregnant and she stood one month before me is not fun and actually taking the batter and so slowly let's lower this well I could nose puppy before last one was extremely slow but the one before that wasn't quickly there there's just no need to do it slowly that's why I'm walking at it because have to be careful about it [Music] hey I want to know I think most of you who are watching this are in my high school junior high early college are any of you have any tips for me the answer is it doesn't really matter you saw me put the same color on top of each other oh it looks less cool here let me give you guys a close-up of what our doing a know this is working because I'm not looking at the other side of the camera so you spatter the the dials when I've done now it's not like a mistake it's just I had done layers of activities instead of these cupcakes since I already ate the bottom off this one it's not this part I'm making it much harder than it needs to be I'll tell you I'll tell you what but go on now Camry [Music] [Music] [Laughter] it's very good Inari it's actually really tiny bit more yellow okay so now we're using our very fancy decorating bags aka ziplock bags we're making a mess here okay it's taiga you can do whatever you

tutorial we're going to cut some fruits show you how to cut fruit for the barber start off with our sharp knife and our lemon give her two containers here so we want to first cut off the ends okay one cut up all the white stuff off the end again on the other side step one step two sitting like this and with the newbie cut end facing down you're going to cut it in half okay two slices two halves now very important you have to make sure that there is a cut down the center here or else it doesn't fit on the glass so you want to go about halfway down okay spread a little bit of pressure here as you're cutting and just cut about halfway down halfway and now I'm going to turn the boat back over okay put them together my fingers are going to come down like this because I don't want to cut myself right so I want to use my fingers to guide the nice blade and I'm going to cut one two three four people five for each half again two three four five cuts and then to pick them up slide your knife underneath all pick them up and put them into your container okay so there is the lemon when the line is cut differently so you'll notice that the lemon that we just cut has a nice little break in it okay right here so that you can slip it on the side of glass easy right okay if it doesn't have that break it is very difficult to get it on the side of the glass so you need to have that cut-rate net Center", "a4NnXm0hniw": "welcome back to how to kick it I'm Yolanda winter is coming and you all need a dose of vitamin C so this week I caked citrus fruits lime lemon orange and grapefruit to make these cakes I prepared eight pounds of my ultimate vanilla batter and then I dyed them according to the citrus fruits I was making and now I need to really carve these cakes they're in the right shape but I need to trim away all of the caramelize ation am I just blending into the chair this is an old t-shirt I wore this t-shirt to the field where I found Walter do you remember that this is where the vitamin C comes in I'm not just gonna simple syrup these cakes with regular simple syrup this simple syrup is so easy to make it's just a combination of sugar water and then freshly squeezed juice like my lemon orange grapefruit boil together it's amazing lemon simple syrup for the lemon cake lime suppose in for the lime cake orange simple soup for the orange cake and grapefruit simple syrup for the grapefruit in my opinion citrus is one of the best things to put it is delicious so squeeze helped me of course as usual Gus's job speaking of Sur squeeze you can pick up a Sur squeeze along with my cake book in our book and bottle bundle on sale right now at how to kick it calm click here I could tell that he felt a real connection with the citrus service honestly I had to tell him and the lemons and the limes to stop talking being squeezed everyone's always squeezing me once my simple syrup has soaked in it's time to fill these cakes with Italian meringue buttercream and I want you to know that I've read your comments and I just want to say I'm sorry cause I'm never giving it up this ever no oh you know what you know what I realized the lime and the lemon both have like a little thank-you you see they have this here lemon hump I always tell you guys save your cake humps I used the tiny cake hump from a green cake I actually just use like a round piping tip to cut a circle out of that and then I glued it on the top and crumb coated it into the rest of the cake and then I did the same with the yellow dyed cake for the lemon cake eyes it's cold season so share this video with someone that you love give them a dose of vitamin C remind them to get their daily dose of vitamin C so share this video daily now that my crumb coat is chilled it's time to ice these cakes again and chill them you just want to ice the cakes as smooth as you can and for the lemon and lime with their little Peaks just ice around the peaks you don't want it to look like you added something you want to tip if it's one punch that's it it's settled while my cakes are chilling I'm going to roll out some fondant first thing I need to do is roll out some sheets of white fondant and that's what I'm going to use to cover the flat sort of what will be the face of each citrus tree then I roll out a little bit of each color fondant that I've made for the inside but the cross-section of the fruits after I roll out each sheet of colored fondant I want to try and add some texture I'm still stuck on how I'm gonna make the texture of the inside of these citrus fruits so I thought I would try using I have a piece of like it's like a net that you're supposed to wrap around a would take the net and press it down by hand and switching the direction I'm not super happy with the texture I don't think it's quite right so I'm gonna have to deal with that later my iced cakes are chilled or on is literally sitting here smelling lemons and limes I'm not joking my cakes are chilled so it's time to cover them starting with my lime cake I roll out the green fondant nice and thin and then before I drape it over my cakes I want to texture it with my shelf liner otherwise known as the turkey skin eater carefully pick up the fondant by placing your hands underneath drape it over your cake and then carefully smooth it onto your cake with your hands being sure not to rub out all of that texture you've created trim away the excess fondant at the bottom of the lime cake and if you find that you have erased some of the texture use your citrus rind skin either and sort of press it into the cake in those areas we have another new member of our cake community this week Michelle is getting ready for Oktoberfest with her beer stein cake check it out right here on how to cake it step by step or click the link below I'm covering each cake in the appropriate color now the only limit what's not tricky but the grapefruit even though it's pink inside a pink grapefruit isn't really pink on the outside it's kind of like a golden yellow and it's blushing bits of paint whoa see what I mean like it's yellowy pinky right are you still stuck in 2015 using a turkey skin eater well join me in 2018 and get yourself the all new improved citrus rinds ca\u00f1edo just look at this it's incredible it is not the same it is all new and refreshing it's one eight five five seven to one HTC I believe me you'll be thankful you called once all of your fruits are covered it is time to paint them I've decided to paint the rind of all four of my cakes with dust colors I just want to enhance it and make it they're realistic for my line I'm using a lime green dust and a dark for dust and I'm just using soft dry brushes to brush it on here and there and create like texture and color variation the lemon will change the least cuz they're pretty pretty solid yeah they're pretty smooth I did use a really golden yellow dust that I had and another yellow a combo of those two Rushton all over the surface the this is not more for the orange my fondant was actually on the dark side so what I used is a golden yellow to brush it over the fondant and tone down the orange a little bit this one looks like a pumpkin it looks like a pumpkin yeah this orange is confused orange is a tricky color when it comes to food coloring because it's always really light so I just wanted to take away some of that brightness and finally my favorite the grapefruit I used pink and a little bit of an orange a pink dust to create these sort of blush areas things grapefruits Riley's blushing yes grapefruit is my favorite when making the nub for each one of my fruits I used my ivory gum paste to shape a nub for each one of my citrus fruits yes Jocelyn I'm still using ivory ivory is winning I like to use different tools like sculpting tools paint brushes round piping tips so I just looked at each fruit each time and created the appropriate nub and then I also wanted to paint those nubs to give them a bit more life so I'm using again some more of the dust colors but I was using a little bit of clear food grape alcohol to make them look all realistic I know you guys are always asking in the comments where's joseline joseline is working behind the scenes and she'll come here as often as you can and by the way what's wrong with orhan yes yeah I mean other than him like smelling lemons on set thinking that pop-tarts come in mushroom flavor what's wrong the next thing I need to do is measure the diameter of the face of each fruit so we're done this portion you have to work on the inside now remember those sheets of white fondant that we rolled before and chilled we're gonna pull them out of the fridge and we're gonna cut them to the exact right size that I need now I have force this is not for now I have I do that all the time now I have four circles of white fondant that are the right size I'm going to create the pulp of these citrus fruits so I'm going to simply use a sculpting tool and tediously create the texture by hand first thing I do is mark a circle on the surface of my colored fondant making sure that that circle is the same size as my cake then I use my sculpting tool and I just simply go back and forth it's like think about like brackets curved curved curved curved right and I'm going from the outside edge of the circle down to the center all around it like and no it didn't take forever I want to add some life and a little more color by painting each one for this I'm using well I used a combination I use some gel food coloring some dust color food grade alcohol and I just painted the surface of each one to make it a little more vibrant and lively and shine I have to let these sheets of textured and painted fondant try coming before moving on in the meantime while the fondant he just picked up two more levels you have a problem while my painted fondant is drying I'm gonna take this time to make myself some paper templates of sort of triangles or pie slices and I'll use this to cut all my segments of the citrus fruits I used some mathematics include the footage I love next week's cake I love the next week's cake if you think you know what I'm talking about leave a comment below and if you don't want to miss it subscribe to this channel and hit the notification bell because you're gonna love next week's cake I've completed making templates and now what I need to do is one at a time cut all of the segments for each room I decided to make eight segments per fruit the grapefruit technically should have more but I wanted them to all be even I'm sorry I just that's how my mind works actually a grapefruit hands there's always one always the next thing I want to do is glue all of these segments to the appropriate white circle so I pull out the tiniest white circle of fondant I flip over all my lime segments brush on some clear piping gel and then line them up on the circle then I repeat this for the lemon the orange and the grape and make sure to leave and even it doesn't have to be a perfectly even but you want a similar-sized border of white all around you know what that way protocol that is called piss piss and I need to do them onto the surface of each cake I spread a thin layer of royal icing onto the face of the line cake and then I carefully picked up a circle with the line segments and place it on top and I just smooth the rind around and the circle everything matches up then I repeat this process carefully turning over the lemon put it on the face of the lemon turn over the orange put on the face of the orange and turn over the grapefruit and place on the face of the bakery to apply some shine and Sheen to the surface of each one of my cakes I simply dab a brush in clear piping gel oh I used to clear piping gel again and brush it over just the pulpy segments of the fruit when you've cut open a lemon or a lime or an orange or a grapefruit it's juicy inside or at least it should be there's nothing more annoying than a dried-up orange why didn't I put googly eyes on these foods I feel like such as fruits honestly or too sophisticated for that yeah that's what I feel like yeah classy yeah and they're a bit sour they don't thanks for watching guys and don't forget to get your dose of vitamin C before winter gets here also check out Michele's beer stein cake over on how to take a step by step right here and check out my pop-tart mega cake right here even though Cody and Orhan ate all the pop-tarts you", "S8bSMShbzMo": "if you weren't planning to have a party at your house you sure will be after watching this video this is an amazing party food it's very impressive and it's so simple to make let's make some orange wedge jello shots on the one pot chef 5 ingredient desserts first things first we need some oranges now I've got some decent-sized oranges here I've got four of them and we're going to do is cut them in half with a nice sharp knife next we're going to take a spoon and we're just going to scoop that flesh out of each of the oranges but we don't want to break the skin what we want to end up with is an orange skin bowl that we can fill up with jelly so just gently go around the edges with the spoon it helps if you got a fairly big spoon and just scoop it out into a bowl you don't have to be too fast idiots with this it doesn't matter there's still a little bit of orange at the bottom doesn't matter because it'll actually make it a little bit more so to orange looking when we put the jelly in don't waste the flesh that we're scooping out here because we're not going to be using in this recipe but what you can do is put into a snap lock bag and freeze it and next time you are making a smoothie you've got something perfect to put in the blender we've got our hollowed out orange halves and what I'm going to do is I'm just going to sit them in the holes of a muffin pan now the only reason I'm doing this is because when they go into the fridge later we want them to be stable we don't want them to move and roll around because like just look at that so we'll just pop these aside for a moment while we start working on our jello into a heat proof jug I'm adding a 170 gram packet of jell-o crystals using orange today and we're adding in two cups 500 millilitres of boiling water from a kettle and we'll just whisk that until all the crystals are dissolved once that's cool we can add in our vodka I'm putting in two cups or 500 mils of vodka you don't have to use vodka you can use any white spirit you like you could use some white rum or something similar to that or of course if you don't want to do alcohol just make it 2 cups of cold water and just whisk that together we've got our scoop that orange cups back so all we got to do is pour our jello mixture straight into them these are ready to go into the fridge for about four to six hours or until the jello is set and through the magic of YouTube here's some that I prepared earlier now I actually did two colors this time I did orange it I did red so here's the trick with these what we do is we take one and we're just going to slice it into make sure your knife is nice and sharp cut it straight through and you've got two cool little wedges and it looks just like an orange wedge but it's jelly on the inside or jello rather how cool is that time to have a taste of one of my orange wedge jello shots now this is probably the most undignified part because this is going to be a very slurping noise but I think it's the best part hmm YUM definitely does a vodka Rina it's very very sweet and orangey and you also get sort of the natural oils from the skin and the rind of the orange which makes it as extra flavorful YUM done about here but I think I'm gonna have a few more of these", "IRlCXa5k5V8": "[Music] being the season that it is I think it's time for my Labradors to try different citrus we've got grapefruit oranges lemons lime and of course

this is john kohler with discountjuicers.com to have another exciting episode for in this episode we're going to determine once and for all what is the best juicer to juice citrus fruits whether you want to use oranges grapefruits lemons limes or maybe even pomegranates right you will learn the best juicer you guys should be using in this episode today so you know the most two common types of juicers for juicing citrus are number one a reamer style so we have here the tribest citrus star this is a citrus tree where I like because it's actually quite durable and backed up by a company that's been in business effort over 30 years making healthy living easy and it basically has a stainless steel strainer here all the other parts are all bpa-free plastic and how these work is you literally cut an orange now if you put it on here and it makes that sound and all these reamer styles work fairly similar basis they have a motor that spin and you have to plug this in so if you don't have any power you know you're not using your citrus reamer the other thing is because there's a motor and all this kind of stuff this machine may break you know and a couple years I've broken inexpensive citrus reamer that actually bought at department stores previously in my life before I actually got some good branded ones so this style has its own set of pros and cons you know for example when you're juicing like a lot of public it's stuck on this little strainer here which makes Hoggett the holes in addition after it goes through the strainer here then it goes into this bottom bowl which then has to go through this little hole which then comes out you know into your collection of glass in the bottom this hole may also sometimes get plugged as well also this machine is louder than the one you'll learn on a minute Express so generally I don't like personally using this style machine over on this side we have the M Co and this is the extra-large citrus juicer known as the Olympics and this is the one I use in my very kitchen I probably have this for over ten years now I mean these things are built to last I'm like this one has a motor they fail over time this machine provided you never drop it it's gonna literally last a lifetime and probably your kids lifetime and even beyond that right because it's just all metal solidly built and how this works this works something different right this has a little lever action so you got to pull this lever up here and then you pull it down and what happens is the produce is literally crushed and squeezed and literally the juice is pressed out you know out of the citrus into your glass so I mean there's pros and cons this diverse thing this one takes some effort right if you don't have a lot of strength you know have a lot of good leverage you know this is not give me the machine for you this little bit easier to use all those this requires more grip strength like you got a grip in order to put it on there and rub it in there or is this one you just kind of need some downward pressure to kind of push in you know if you are maybe not as strong you can stand up on a bench or a stool or something like that and I get better leverage to work this down machine this one doesn't need like grip strength like this one would also on this machine unlike this machine which has some plastic contact to your citrus which I'm not a big fan of because surgery cause citric acid in there that may erode dance a little plastic on this machine basically all your citrus is touching the parts that touches the juice is 100% stainless steel so plastic will never touch the juice that you're creating in this machine that being said although this on this machine this part here might look like it's metal it isn't metal actually it's actually aluminum but generally the juice does not you know touch this aluminum it is all generally directed down now I saw the name brand this is this machine started out as the orange axe made in like South America think Brazil many years ago and then got bought out by amico who's been making this machine solid for at least 20 plus year or ten plus years not free and how many years now but this is good solid machine since that time there's been been many knockoff machines come on the market right and so while though the machines may look like this you know the main difference you're gonna find is number one how the machine operates I've had some of them or they just don't line up properly things are not properly you know pressed and the juice is not pressed properly I've had it where they block and bind up in this talk area that's a really critical crucial point where they have all these little joints that have to work properly and then that little press thing that comes down I've also had it where some of these units will break some like the bottom plate or this plate you cannot put up with the little bit of stress of all the pressure coming down in Tyrell actually break over time some of those chrome-plated ones from China I've actually had that issue and the other issue I have with a lot of those expensive imported machines is that they're not using good quality stainless steel some may be actually not even using stainless steel I mean look like stainless steel but they're not stainless steel they're maybe it's like a nickel or some other kind of stainless steel or what they say is stainless steel which may end up arresting over time you know this machine I've had for jesus ten years maybe I see zero rust on my stainless steel strainer because they are using proper stainless steel the other thing to know is that this machine is NSF certified what does that mean that really doesn't mean much to you if you're a homeowner but it means a lot if you're you know restaurant or juice bar this is a machine that they can use you know because it has been Health approved helps helps standard approved by the health department's two views insert commercial kitchens right those inexpensive machines out there are not gonna have that commercial certification their prime not gonna pass you know due to the inexpensive materials they're using to create them so whatever you machine you buy I want to encourage you guys to get the right one for the right job all right so while this machine is great because it actually has two different cones you could even like you know juice smaller things like lemons or if you have bigger fruits like oranges or grapefruits you give you the larger cones that's one of the pros one of the cons on this machine is that the cone is one size so if you have like super huge grapefruits which you could put on this machine which would kind of work this machine it's really knocking our work so if you have super huge Greek roots then you have to kind of cut a minute quarters to kind of put a quarter on this machine at a time and then press it out the other thing about this machine that's good and bad is that when you press this down say like these but the my hands are like this is the bottom piece at the top ease down pressing on it there's always a little gap in between there so if your citrus peel is super thin right you'll have some juice left inside the citrus when you're juicing it and this guy over here the press right if your citrus rot is too thick when you press it you will press out some of the bitter oils you know when juicing if you're not paying attention right because that's a predefined spacing you know that it presses out every single time so I have some ways to rectify this so if you have this citrus fruit that's thinner then what I like to do is I have to come down and then come back up and then come back down and get like a double pressing and make sure I get everything the other thing you can't do is once you you know have juice that you could take it out and then fold it over on itself and then put it back down on here and press it out again so trying to get some more the other way I like to do is I take it out and when I take it out there just squeeze it together just squeeze it over the collection cup which I'm able to squeeze some juice and then it just goes in and then I compost the peels and so that's how to deal with thinner ones now I'm thicker one to be up something with that thick you know skin like a grapefruit right when you're juicing I want you two guys to come down and feel the resistance right you're like oh I feel resistance that's because you've gone through all the flesh to get out the juice and now you're hitting the skin so you know if you're like I'm stronger if you're make it go all the way down yeah surely you could push it all the way down those masks that is harder you could but then you're gonna get some of the bitter skin oils right if you just kind of come down and feel the resistance you're like alright I'm good enough you're gonna come back up and when you come down a little bit more just to make sure I got it all then you're gonna avoid getting all the bitter skin oils now one of the reasons why I like this style machine the press style over this machine is because this machine will also juice pomegranates pomegranates our antioxidant rich foods and one of the most important fruits that we should be eating on a regular basis actually good combination is actually oranges with the pomegranates which is what I like to do so the makes pomegranate juice actually taste good so you could kind of pomegranate half put it on here squeeze this down and literally it's gonna squeeze all the juice out of the pomegranate which is quite amazing and you guys can't do juice of pomegranate on this top machine it's just gonna make a mess playing a little the aerial pod things everywhere right so that's why I really like this guy better so between these two machines right it's up each one's are prone to con this this machine here is two to three times more expensive than this guy right here but this guy is gonna last you a lifetime right so it kind of depends on what you want and both these machines well well you know people think of this as making orange juice when you use an orange in this machine or this machine it makes an orange juice you know when I was taught by Jay Kordich who's known as the juice man he says these guys really make orange water because really what you're extracting from the orange is literally the the water or the the water from the orange without much nutrition so in a minute what I'll be doing is I'll be actually cutting these citrus fruits in half like as even as I could get them and we're going to go ahead and weigh out two bowls of just citrus fruits that I'm gonna juice and this guy and in this guy we're gonna time it so you guys can see how long it takes and either these two juicers to juice the same amount of citrus and how much yield we get out of each machine also you'll see how much pulp and whatnot was created what I do want to show you guys is actually my favorite way to juice citrus you know I know I mean I own both these machines I may use this one more but for the most part I don't even like either of these machines to juice oranges because they just get the orange water what I preferred status to use our vertical single auger juicer right while these machines pretty much only do citrus and this guy could also juice pomegranates they're not really effective at juicing any other produce items so I always want you guys to get a multi-function machine that'll do more than just juice the citrus so that's why I like this guy over here and this is actually a multi-function juicer actually it's probably pretty much the same price as this guy over here and this is actually called the shine vertical cold press juicer and this one works a little bit different this one could juice oranges but get also juice juices that are even more valuable to me than simply orange juice which hate orange juice is great it's better than a drink in a coffee or soda or you know many other beverages that people drink Gatorade these days but you know I personally would much rather have a vegetable juice you know a vegetable juice made of 100% soda actually I have that this morning for breakfast you know that to me is a much more beneficial than having an orange juice or you know I can make cucumber juice you know which is another fruit not so sweet and if you want to do mostly cucumber fruit with a little bit of orange to make a little sweet you guys could do that in a vertical cold-pressed juicer now I'm showing the shine today just because the price comparison to this guy is pretty similar but the the verticals can get quite expensive be sure to check my videos on the you know on this YouTube channel to find the right juicer for you since I have you know tested almost all the different juicers out there anyways outline this machine because this one makes more than just orange water like these two guys these will make a real orange juice when I consider juice because when I consider juice I want a juice that has those missed nutrients as pause because the reason why I'm drinking the juice is not just for a sugar rush or sugar hit I'm drinking the juice for their phytonutrients that I may not otherwise be eating so you guys know when you have an orange right you'll sit there and you'll peel the orange and you'll eat it but the problem is when you do that you're pretty much getting more nutrients than if you were to juice it because at least you're getting some of the pith and whatnot in there but most of the nutrients are in the pith of the orange so let me show you guys what I mean there so ain't it Orange I've taken these oranges I've literally cut off the orange coloring right and you guys can see especially on this one really it's just white pith and you know the majority of the nutrients in an orange is right below the skin now the skin has indigestible chemicals that we don't want to be eating they may give you gas or flatulence you know so we don't want those in oranges tangerines and grapefruits but our lemons and limes those oils are edible for us so we can't put lemons and limes whole through a vertical slow juicer and so yeah so I appeal I basically just cut off the coloring so now I have these guys here and what I'm going to do for you guys real quick before we get into this regular demonstration is I'm gonna show you guys how easy it is to juice these oranges in the shine and what we're gonna make here is we're gonna make a real citrus juice you guys may have never seen this before in your life but I want to show this to you guys because this to me is how I like to end prefer to juice my oranges right and so super simple super easy we're gonna go ahead and turn this machine on that's a nice slow juicer so it's quite nice and quiet and just gonna go ahead and cut up these oranges into little segments and we're just going to go ahead and dump that in and we don't even really need to use a pusher in the shine we're just dunking those oranges through and as you guys can see before you know it the shine is really refreshing and squeezing and extracting all the nutrients out of that orange and you guys can see on this side literally all of our left with is the bulk and the seeds that are being ejected here so to me this makes a more full and complete nutritious orange juice that has a lot more vital details because we are actually juicing and I'm getting some of the nutrients out of the white pith there and this goes relatively quick now I do want to let you guys know you know today I am juicing Valencia oranges and actually honestly if you're using a slow juicer like this you want to try to choose the navel oranges because those generally have a thicker you know white pith on there the rind and so you will be able to get more nutrients from those the Valencia's though are better for juicing when you are just simply squeezing out the water so in the case of the press or the citrus star you know that's the kind you would normally want to use here so as you guys can see I mean pretty much in no time you're able to juice in the shine and the cool thing about the shine is that you don't have to just stick to Warren shoes like these guys will meet you - pretty much for juice or citrus juices this one else a lot of you programs but literally no time at all we made a glass of orange juice with the shine but we can also add carrots and then we have a carrot orange juice we got some plant out in there pineapple orange juice we could have you know celery celery orange juice we could do cucumber cucumber orange juice we can do kale and orange juice a no better healthy leafy green to eat then can alright and so you could do all those things that it's done so I really would encourage you guys to forgo purchasing one of the dedicated citrus juicers to get a machine that will allow you to make the best quality highest nutrition citrus juice but also allowed to juice other fruits and vegetables in marketing a lot more beneficial than even the almighty orange all right so we're just gonna let that sit there and drip a little bit but what I want to do next for you guys is we're gonna go ahead and get these oranges all prepped up and we're going to do a weigh-in so you can see we have even quantities of citrus that we reduced in each of these guys you can saw it guys can see the process how long it takes if this guy or this guy is faster and also you're going to learn how much each juicer yields alright so now we're ready to do our citrus juice juice off using the EMCO Olympus and these tribest Center star first thing is I basically took oranges I cut them exactly in half to the best of my ability put half on this plate out on this plate so we're literally going to juice the same oranges as one half or the other and they're actually even weight so I'm going to go ahead and give you guys a weigh-in to ensure we have a fair fight alright now I want to show you guys the weigh-in and make sure we have a fair fight two plates of Valencia organic oranges over on this side looks like we have 606 grams all those nice delicious oranges ready to get juiced up and over on this side more nice delicious oranges and also looks like we have six hundred and six grams so it looks like we have six hundred and six grams all in both scales yes we have a fair fight so now that you can know we have a fair fight we're gonna go ahead and move these scales out of the way clean up the table a bit and what I want to do is actually time this process before you come up often wondered actually you know which one is faster this guy or this guy I like to use this guy because I think it goes pretty fast but hey people that like this guy might think it's faster so we will be sure to find out in this test let's make sure I could put this where I could access the access it easily without impeding my progress of juicing all right here put it over here all right we got the stop box it up here we got the oranges there and we got the juicers here we just need to get some collection cup so I'm using some measuring cups today so we can measure and see how much juice each juicer produces as we did weigh out the exact produce I guess the next thing is we're just gonna go ahead and I'm gonna start juicing here we'll use the citrus star first start button and we're gonna go for it alright one two three go alright so we'll probably speed this up for you guys so it goes will make quicker [Applause] [Music] alright last orange is the citrus star here that's taken actually about a minute so far alright we're done let's hit the stop alright one minute 14 seconds it took me to juice now let's see one two three four basically five oranges that were cut in half and we made approximately I don't know 10 ounces of juice so far so next let's go ahead and use the press and get up set up apne here I'm in a little bit different weird position here we're gonna hit go hitting the reset so remember one minute and 15 seconds all right on your marks get set go so we're gonna speed this up for you guys show you guys the process once again I mean I think this goes really faster I'll just basically push it down go up and down a couple times then pull it off and then oh yeah we'll speed this up for you gonna sit you got some time [Music] alright now was the last word went in to the Olympus here we're gonna hit the stop button look at that that took under a minute so this was definitely faster took fifteen seconds less let's see normally I basically just pull these guys out after I went up and down a couple times the other technique I would say is you could go in and like squeeze each one as you take them out and these oranges are pretty much a nice size so that really there's not a lot of juice maybe like see like five or six drips left because they have actually the right thickness of the skin there so they did pretty good I want to show you guys actually the differences of what happened between the oranges and actually also what was left more importantly in the machines so I mean on a reamer style machine if you guys could see this I mean literally these guys are reading out clean I mean they're pretty much clean in there there's not much left left in there and on these guys what your guys will notice is that you know there's still all pulp in there right and you know touch this is still a bit wet inside these guys it's a lot more dryer you know could you squeeze it out more I mean the other technique I want to show you guys earlier if you just put this in half and kind of put it on the side here and then come down on it basically you're gonna squeeze a little more juice out I don't necessarily do this or recommend it actually so yeah that's how that worked oh and then also like in so in this machine we're gonna go ahead and spin this guy off and I like to always take this guy off there's always a little bit of juice left in there so we're just like tip it and not get the seeds and never get any kind of leftover juice in there oops once you flip out and I wanna show you guys what's in this screen here that now you will have to clean this takes me literally under a minute to clean because literally just two stainless steel parts you can see there's like three seeds like in there one two three four maybe six seeds in there and if we pull this out you can see there's like a little bit of Pulp in there there's a few seeds in here this is going to be super simple super easy to clean just rinse this out underneath the sink you know maybe brush it a little bit you are totally gonna be good to go and then over on the citrus star this is a little more you know difficult for the cleaning here we're gonna go ahead and pop that guy up and on here you can see the reamer here you know there's a little bit of stuff left on the reamer there but in this little container here there's all this pulp some of it may have been getting stuck in the screen down below so you will have to be cleaning all that you know in the case of the reamer there's nothing here but it's all in here and in the case of that machine it's basically all left and the peel so cleaning it a little bit easier and then furthermore in this little bottom tray that collects it all you know there's a still a bit of juice in there so see if we could just tip that and get it to pour in there but yeah this is relatively easy to clean if I have to say one is usually clean of course the press is just there's a lot of parts to clean and less residues left but most important thing let's see how much yield each machine made all right so we're gonna go ahead and put these up right next to each other and we're gonna go and closer for you guys on the comparison alright let's do a comparison of the yield so over on the citrus star it looks like that one yielded about right around 10 ounces I'm gonna say right between 8 and 12 and over on the press actually you've made a little bit above 8 ounces I'll call that maybe like eight and a half ounces so clearly right we have a winner for yield anyways it was the citrus star alright so you guys just saw that the citrus star beat the Emeco olympus in sheer yield so that to me it was super impressive the machine also cost less on the on the flip side of the AAMCO or the olympus is gonna be easier to clean and took less time so it all depends on what is more important to you out in time or this is not a yield test between the shine because we didn't actually weigh out the produce and it wouldn't really be fair because this one didn't have peels but what I want to do for you guys actually just compare what the juice looks like on all three of these juicers in the glass here once again this is not a yield test so do not take it as such so here's the juice from the Olympus press right and then here is the juice from the citrus star going right in and then finally we have the juice from the shine now this one has to settle a little bit let me see if I could Esther that up with my finger here I want to stir it up for you guys you guys can see the difference alright so once again this is not no that's good this is not a yield test but I want to show you guys the difference right you know I want you guys what I want you guys to look at specifically in this segment is actually like if you can see through the juicers right if you have a glass of water here you guys could clearly know that you could see through that right so you took some water you put some red food color I did this when I was a kid you put some red food color in there right you can put a little bit of food color in there so that you can still see it see through but if you put enough food color in then it's going to get dark enough so that you can't see through the juice in my opinion you know the more the juice you cannot see through it the more nutrients are in the juice and this actually what I want I don't want simply an orange water that is only the water from the orange and all pressed out machines will make more of an orange water including expensive Norwalk presses they generally just press out the liquid that is in the food and may not be getting all the nutrients in my opinion based on studies I've seen and testing I've seen so we're gonna hold these guys up and I don't know you guys can't really see that see the difference on these I'm here right in Fred this is an HD camera I could personally see that the citrus star juice looks more nutritious to me because it's not quite as see-through as the press style here but then of course if we compare the best you know orange juicer the zipper start to the shine literally I see that the shine has a much more deeper color that you definitely can't see see-through and also it has more of the that you know the white influences from you know that pulp you know so in the shine I mean literally this was all that was left you know wasn't even like this we literally extracted and it literally ground up you know all this pulp here that I could hold on if I squeeze his palm right you guys see the juice squeeze it from my fingers I don't even see any drops of juice here I just see pulp i can't squeeze anything more because it's much more effective in my opinion then even this style is leaving a lot of pulp here or this style that you leave in a lot of wet pulp in here and that's why this one yielded less right so you mean clearly in my opinion the winner for sure is the way that I normally juice which is in a vertical slow juicer for juicing oranges you know I will say that I'm quite impressed on how well the citrus star did for its price point if you want a dedicated orange juicer this is probably it it definitely made a higher yield than that guy only took 15 more seconds a little bit more difficult to clean but you know and it does use electricity a little bit more louder but overall I think it made it definitely a more nutritious juice than just the press I like the press because it took the least time and it's gonna be the easiest to clean but I saw that you know I'm wasting a lot of produce when I use it in the press so good thing I did this video because the last one I get any maybe like six years ago and I thought the press was pretty good and I liked the press for what it does but I'm a much more convinced now than ever that our vertical slow juicer to juice your citrus as well as other fruits and vegetables is definitely the way to go now if I don't think I want to do for you guys in this episode is taste test so we're gonna go ahead and taste test the Olympus here mmm I taste a little bit of pulp in there actually that's quite good taste the citrus star mmm Wow big taste difference going from this does not one this one kind of tastes more like water it's I mean it's sweet but there's not a whole lot of texture to and it's good but when you taste this like you've got a scale from zero to a hundred taste this is like 14 you hit this one yeah it's like a 60 now we're gonna go for the shine this is the full body juice with all the white pith and everything mmm Wow so here's the interesting thing in these guys I pretty much got sweet notes like this is sweet it's watery sweet this one like more complex but also pretty sweet and then when I would drink this juice which is the same exact cordage as they came in a Simmons diabetic for the same exact organic farm I drink this it's really not that sweet I think you guys are drinking orange juice for like a sweetness you love that sweetness right you don't want to use this machine but if you guys think that the sweetness in the worms juices maybe not the best thing but you really want the nutrients that bio 500 things are gonna help your gums make your skin be bright because now you can produce your own collagen because of the vitamin C in here you're gonna want this this is not sweet that's because it's diluted by all that white piss stuff that really mellows out the flavor so it's actually not that sweet and in my opinion more nutritious for you hey the best deal might be like mixing both mix like half and half you can't pop the good stuff plus half the sweetness let's go ahead try this one mmm I think that'll be more agreeable than most people that expect that orange juice out of the store that's just super sweet right in my opinion we need to kind of move away from these super sweet drinks oh sweet super sweet orange juice is still healthier than Gatorade or soda right we really want to move towards drinking more vegetable juices and so that's where the shine really can allow you to get more fruits and vegetables in you know juice of cucumber with your with your oranges right and have a cucumber orange juice I think that's an excellent way to do it so I guess in the end of every video I have to declare a winner and I guess between the winner between these two guys I mean as much as I love the present it's still gonna sit on my counter right I'm gonna have to become the winner the center star it did make more yield the juice was more healthier in the end it only took 15 more seconds and actually cost a heck of a lot less than this guy over here and then but that means that if I have to compare all these three machines which is the best citrus juicer out of all these three now the the dedicated citrus or this guy I mean I don't have to say the shine hands-down wins this guy has a three year warranty it allows you to juice more than just citrus including kale and leafy greens and spinach and carrots and beets check the links down below for videos I did with the shine actually the shine here even though I used it as my home juicer today it is my travel juicer stays packed in my bag so I could take it when I'm on the road so I can continue my juicing lifestyle it only weighs like I don't know six pounds or something it's really light compact eats for travel but also perfect for the home if you want to make less than maybe even the 48 ounces of juicing juice in one sitting so yeah I mean that's pretty much it for this episode if you guys enjoyed this episode encourage you guys to support me more that's the most important thing you guys could do that helped me out if you guys like that I'm taking the time to use a bunch of oranges cut them up way up and prepare them and get this all set up make the video edited get it uploaded publish it for you guys so that you guys can know the truth about what's going on out there instead of me just try to sell this machine save it's the best or so in this machine I show you guys the options so you guys want the easiest cleaning the fastest time use this one if you guys have an orange orchard and you don't only care about you know getting every last drop out but you know if you have to buy your oranges then you know may I get this because it's gonna get more this pulp was this was drier than any of the other machines I mean still letting a lot of wet pulp in there right it's the most efficient if you just want kind of like regular orange juice and you want a fairly efficient and you wanted to spend not too much money on a juicer get this one right and that's why I do all these videos to share the truth you guys because there's a lot of rhetoric out there I proved it by showing it to you guys so you guys enjoyed this enjoy the process please purchase your juicer from me at discountjuicers.com

electric one before and you might find out I'm that this may actually be easier to juice with a manual than with a electric if you have the right manual I'm going to show you two different kinds here we had a electric one and it broke so let me go ahead and also um we have star fruit in our yard you have a star for tree and I might go ahead and just do some these for fun but that's quite so how many oranges do I have here I think it supposed to be three pounds so I might save a couple of these let's see here let me do three with each and then have an extra three left over and then you want to do something with am something else so let me go ahead and show you how this works The Dude's comes down here here's this this is it appears to be stainless-steel orange X comes here and it goes down like this okay pretty simple now some people may have a problem with this this is looks like a luminol so some people might have an issue with that okay so let's go ahead and start and see what happens here now you might know the juice other stuff besides just this okay so let's go ahead and start so put it here and this looks like I do I'm bigger than this but let's go ahead and push it down and it should come off the bottom and it really um it's kind of easy to do with like if you have an electric one you might need to come like squeeze it kind of on the thing or use actually maybe even more effort than this so um it might work a little bit easier if it was a bigger one this may be a little small but you can see it's not it doesn't take a lot of effort so this might be really good like if you have an orange tree and you're already you can just kind of like have fresh-squeezed on the shoes and maybe um rinse it off I would recommend rinsing it out pretty quickly with the probably get kind of sticky later so this is not bad what is that 303 inches already and maybe I'll do star fruit okay so here we go see what looks like that looks pretty good um let's go ahead and put that here so with this it has a removable thing stick that in this is try it might need to cut it up more about this go for it now it would be nice if they made this in stainless steel what's nice about this is that it's lighter but also maybe harder to do so that may be something to kind of factor in it may take more effort just like the way it's designed but it does work though you cut it up somewhat in my tum a little different in less you might want to like yes so but if you don't care about the aluminum if you don't whatever it might not bother you and it's pretty small and probably easier to rinse off the other one it's nothing on so that one made it and they both made we have here one two three four five six one two three four five six so that's not bad I wish I had a scale right I have a scale but I would actually need to probably have the same cups just to be more precise so anyways okay so I got a scale house reports per cup okay let's go ahead with the Sun and see what it is okay this has a 170 grams so let's go ahead and pour this in here okay there might be a little bit of residual but how much is this a hundred seventeen grams but they may be in a little bit so they're both pretty good but I do really like it let me go ahead and do something that's cool as well now this may not work out as well as an orange because it's not really probably designed for this well let's just kind of go ahead and see what happens if we just try it this is a part of a star fruit so it does work Wow that's pretty amazing so but it's not I don't think it's really designed for it but it appears like it works pretty well my it's worth warning all right so here's show you this so we've had we have used the electric one and but if you have the you might find that one of these is actually easier then let's go ahead and do this and stop this and do what alright and like this take that stem off probably juice the stem okay ever try try aren't you damn how's that it's actually pretty good so let me know what you guys think if you have a better one please put in the comments below I like it am i doing for this but um I love you all you're amazing god loves you you're special thank you so much for watching god bless you", "PzZONqUmOy8": "well here is what they call on lemonade lemon actually it's a pink lemonade is what they call it look look at the fruit on that can you see that it's striped various different stripes they have they're all different now we haven't had this tree all that long when they say that it's probably been about six years I'm really bad on time because it's so hard to remember when we got something but it was a really tiny little tree it did have a little bit of fruit on it when we bought it see how some of them when they stress and they don't grow right they turn yellow during the drought but anyways we got the tree I think it was Home Depot and I thought it was really really interesting so I wanted to get the tree and we planted it and even though it had fruit when we bought it it really didn't do good so he kind of wrote it off and thought well we'll just you know watch it boy it smells good me get in there mmm blossom smells good but anyways so we figured well whatever it didn't matter we'll get some little lemons on it and then when Gary put the wood chips around it really changed and looked look at it it's a dwarf tree so it's quite you know low to the ground this one but it really is nice it's kind of a sweeter lemon it's pink when you cut it inside so the flesh of it is pink so it doesn't have the bite of a regular lemon but look at that and wood chips did make a difference because we'd get a little bit in of lemons but we never got an abundance of them and now in the trees loaded there's probably a hundred lemons on there all the way around and it's flowering again I see some of them for whatever reason the tree stressed and when it stressed the lemons went yellow okay you know what I'm gonna say wait a minute that branch is yellow and that branch my action you know what it did not stress look at this you and I are discovering this together because I haven't been down here to check out the tree and get this out of the way look at that branch the branch that all those little yellow lemons are growing on is yellow so it's kind of like an albino branch and that's the only one that has the pure lemons that are yellow on it like that so we could either leave that branch and have some yellow lemons or we could cut it off but you know what a lemons a lemon so I'm gonna leave it because the normal branches that are green and it is a variegated plants as well look at the leaves so it's a variegated lemon tree and that's why it has the striped lemons on it but that is really interesting are they beautiful that's interesting because I really haven't taken the time to walk down here and now I see that this particular branch is yellow and it's throwing yellow lemons we'll have to take some inside and cut it up and see what's inside cuz I never paid attention to that just don't come down you know far into the yard usually down here I don't pay that much attention to lemons Gary pick some brings them in and I use them and that's it so we'll take a lemon off of here and we'll take some of the striped ones off and we'll compare them and see what they look like because that is interesting see the whole branch down here chill look at that in there can you see that the branch is actually yellow so it's missing the green pigment completely cuz like I said it is a variegated lemon trait and the lemons no matter what size they are as Tiny as they are starting look at this tiny tiny they're yellow they're not green they're yellow from a very tiny age to see hairs Morley's variegated leaves here's more see how beautiful they are so it's a variegated leaf and then the fruit is very gated as well but all takes them off and cut them up inside the house and see what the different color lemons are as far as what they look like on the inside the flowers are white purple buds so they're pretty much like any other lemon tree so yeah let's take some in the house cut them up and see what the different colors look like and then we can decide should I remove those branches and let the tree do its thing what it's supposed to do or should we leave them well I'm gonna go trim some off and then we'll decide later all right we're back in the house now and I've brought the pink lemonade lemons in these are the normal wings they have the stripes and then these were the yellow ones on those white yellow branches they're kind of like oh my no it's not getting any proper feeding let's see what these look like these are supposed to be pink see that it's a very light pink kind of a yellow pink let's see what the other one mmm smells good I almost have a sweet smell to it let's put that here it's interesting there's pink on the skin to the outside of the lemon looks pink too maybe these aren't ripe enough but these are pink also you really can't see they're pink I don't think but the are pink they're not yellow and then here's this one I don't think this one's right none of these were on the ground so they weren't ready to see also white pink so I I think they were pink or less I left them on the plant longer but they are definitely paint they smell really good they have a they're nice tangy not as strong as a regular lemon we're gonna always almost just eat it just like that now these are the ones that came off the branch they have no stripes so I don't know what color they'll be inside oh well they're pink too let's see that one's pink and this is pink so even on that branch that's no good and they have no green to him let's see this teeny teeny one see they're yellow right from the beginning instead of being green on that branch that's not supposed to be growing like that isn't that something they're pink when they're tiny so they're all pink so they're even pink when they're solid yellow and they don't have stripes yeah these are still even though they have the green stripes and they're supposed to have green stripes I think they should have been on the tree a little bit longer now I think I'm making pink lemonade tonight so all these cut but I wanted to share this with you and show you see I don't know if I can get really close or nuts so I don't think you can see the pinkness let's see well I don't think the lighting will pick it up it's yellow it's pink around the edges and it is definitely pink I mean you can see I can see it's pink but these are the pink lemonades and they're fun they're fun to grow so tonight I'm making pink lemonade maybe I'll put in a little bit of mint I'd be good sometimes I like making lemonade and then adding it a little splash of grape juice a good grape juice but this will be fun I'm gonna make some lemonade maybe I'll put some stevia in it instead of sugar or a little sugar and a little stevia so I know you this much sugar so I wanted to share this and I'll probably do some more citrus I've got other citrus trees growing around here and if you're interested you don't ask any questions and hopefully somebody won't get a pink lemonade because of this it's a fun plant it's not a really big tree they're kind of a dwarf type of citrus but I think it's fun to grow all citrus they're fun to grow so with that have a great day don't forget to eat what you grow and please like and subscribe if you like us and if you and if you don't that's fine and you know some

lemons I'm making these candied lemons to go on top of a cake that I'm making and they're great for decorating or you can just have them as snacks in themselves so let's without further ado to show you how to make glazed or candied lemons so here we are guys firstly of course we're going to need a nice fresh lemon that the skins been cleaned and prepared and then you're going to need sharp knifes now you know whether you use a long knife like this one they're gonna mean neatly shafts so let's put an edge on the knife now we're going to take about a centimetre in just cut the end off of the lemon and then from there on out we're going to be cutting the thin slices of lemon approximately about a millimeter thick okay and we can discard when we get to the Pips we could just remove those from from the lemon so we're just cutting through and keep going until you see that that is pretty thin about a millimeter thick and keep going until you've got all of the lemons sliced so then we have a guys we've sliced our lemon up now you'll be able to pick the pips out he's a paper-thin just not use a little knife or use your fingers to draw the pips out of each of the slices we don't really want those in they're quite easy to separate the pits once you slice them now we're gonna have to take these lemons over and we're gonna blanch them that's used to plunge them into boiling hot water so I've got a pot on the stove now coming up to boil we're going to blanch these in and then we're going to take them from the boiling water just over just about 30 seconds in the boiling water and we're going to pop them into this bowl which I'm going to have ice water in to calm down immediately so here we are over the stove with a boiling water sucked to boil now and we're just going to take our lemon slices and we're just going to pop them in here just quickly we're just blanching these in the boiling water we want to leave them in there for about 30 seconds or so so you can see here guys I've got ice cubes in here the water is ice-cold take these straight out and pop them into the ice water just to firm them up again [Music] so back here over at the snow we're just going to turn that on I'm going to place one cup of water and one cup of sugar I've used icing sugar or powdered sugar in this instance but you can pretty much use any sugar so we've put our sugar into the water now we're just going to eat that warm it through until it dissolves completely and goes clear and then when it's brought up to the to the boil we turn it down to a simmer we're going to add our lemon slices in here and simmer them don't boil them mind you we don't want to agitate them too much and break the lemons to pieces we're just going to simmer them for about 45 minutes to an hour so you can see here now the water is just starting to come up to a boil I bring out the lemons that we prepared earlier they're still in the cold water here and they're nice and chilled and we're just going to drop these lemons into the boiling water into the boiling sugar water bear in mind the cold lemons will bring the temperature down very quickly you can see now it nearly put them all in and the water's stopped boiling so we do have to bring that back up to a boil so you can see now the waters come back up to a boil I'm going to turn that down nice and low and then we're just going to let those simmer through on there let's say 45 minutes 50 minutes an hour at the most and they should be prepared and we'll take them out and show you what to do next so they've been cooking now for about 45 minutes and you can see if i zoom in maybe you can see now that the the lemons are virtually translucent and the sugar and water has reduced down to almost a syrup now we're just going to keep cooking those for another another 10 minutes now there you can see they've been cooking for about 50 minutes and I'm fairly happy to take those out now they've gone to a completely translucent and because I've been simmering gently the structure of the lemons hasn't broken up so we're going to take these out now and put them onto a cooling sheet so here we are below a grease proof sheet here and I just had to take gently lift you see that just going to gently lift the lemons out and lay them down on the sheet to calm down see they completely translucent almost and still in their entire shape I'm just gonna pop these down here now to cool off you see that lemon there now is virtually translucent from the sugar water is almost like a syrup so it popped those down on the side here believe him to call now if you look at this video here you'll be able to see what I actually use these lemons for in another video or if you look over here at this video you can see a more decadent use for your candied lemons once you've made them well there you are there's the candied lemons they're all dry now and you can use these for all sorts of different things they're great as the snack as they are and I'll put a couple of ideas down in the description bar I made these lemons particularly to go with a lemon cheesecake but there's some other little ideas down there as well so thanks very much guys that's all from Steve's kitchen take care till next time [Music]", "rTa8p0sha0g": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

show you some little snack ideas can be levels we're going to make chocolate coated candy lemons look down here and see what you need so I've got my candied lemons which I made earlier take a look here at the video of the candied lemons if you don't know how to make them and will in it we're going to take a little bit of chocolate in this case I'm going to use a caramelized crystaled Lindt chocolate and we want a little ramekin just to melt our chocolate in I'm going to pop the chocolate into the ramekin and melt that down in the microwave so just take the chocolate and break it up into the ramekin and then you just go it has to be a microwave proof dish just take that over to the microwave and 10 seconds at a time not too much guys you just don't want to burn the chocolate until you've got your chocolate completely melted so there you go my chocolate is melted down I've still got my caramel crystals in there just going to pop that aside now take one of our candied lemons and I'm just going to dip it half into the chocolate and then let it drip off shake off the excess because don't want it too thick maybe you do and we're just going to take that there and lay it down on some greaseproof paper to dry take another one just dip it down into the melted chocolate say about half of the lemon and just again let the chocolate just drip off and lay it down on some greased paper so there you have it that's the last trip there there's the last two here's another one now when I'm taking the candied lemon I've got a hole in the lemon now I'm taking that side and dick knitting that side into the chocolate and that's the last one there pop that down and leave those to call and you'll see the final topic cupboard candy lemons and there we have the completed chocolate coated candied lemons they're absolutely delicious to look at and they make a great gift idea you can make little boxes of these up maybe we take them to a friend Mother's Day is coming up so they're a great gift idea for Mother's Day or Christmas and I suppose a better try one that is absolutely delicious but nicer than anything you could buy in the shop perfect gifts guys take that see you next time I just want to go out a little bit at the end of this video guys I tell me you know when I tried these there surprised myself they are so delicious this is possibly one of the nicer sweets I've ever made give this a try make some comments down below say how they went for you you have to try these they're wonderful", "JeNmlmelVcQ": "look at all these oranges and there's still more on the tree what's up guys adam here from backyard gardening and cooking in this episode i'm going to show you guys when you should prune your citrus trees and give you some tips along the way so let's garden on so with most trees you're going to want to prune them in the winter time that's the time of year where diseases and pests are gonna be less active but more importantly most trees go through a dormancy period in the winter so that's gonna be the best time to prune them to have the best opportunity to recover for next season that's not the same with citrus trees you actually don't want to prune them at all unless you absolutely need to so if you prune them in the winter or the fall you're actually going to have less flowers next season and only 10 of those flowers will produce fruit so by over pruning you're going to have less fruit for next year but that being said if you do need to prune them for example if your tree is getting too big and you need some extra space you should prune that tree in late august to early september and be careful not to prune too much because it could limit the amount of fruit you have next season so the next must-know tip about pruning sister trees is to make sure that your pruners are clean that's especially important if you're going to move from one tree to the next the best way to clean your pruners is in a one part bleach and nine parts water

soil conditions if planting in a container choose a well draining soil and make sure your container has plenty of drainage holes use any standard potting soil and your tree will be perfectly happy if your soil is still not too heavy try adding hardwood bark chips to the mix to increased amount of airspace the ph levels should be around 5.5 to 7 of soil as this plant prefers slightly acidic soil to neutral soil the next point is ideal temperature range for growing lemons in the backyard the best temperature range for growing a successful lemon tree is between 21 to 25 degrees celsius lemon trees are well grown in warm weather because it is typically coupled with sunny days for optimum fruit production as a result of warm temperatures and ample sun foliage and limbs grow steadily for peak flowering and pollination prospects the next point is humidity for growing lemons since there are native to the tropics lemon trees need a relatively humid environment households are often incredibly dry due to the central heating or air conditioning so providing a supplemental source for humidity is essential place a humidifier or mister near your tree or stick the pot in a tray of pebbles with

planted trees sprinkler about one by four pound of a six to six is to six is to two fertilizer containing six percent nitrogen six percent phosphate six percent potassium and two percent magnesium on the ground under the spread of the trees branches and slightly beyond do this every three to four months gradually increasing to one pound of six is to six is to six is to two fertilizer by the end of the first year for mature trees sprinkle three to four pounds of six is to six is to six is to 2 fertilizer under the spread of 3 branches every 4 to 6 months also spray with a foliar spray containing zinc or iron to the tree sleeves two to four times a year management of lemon tree in your backyard water your lemon trees regularly about once a week it is better to give them a deep watering rather than short drinks more often mulch with compost or age manure several times during the year to retain soil moisture and keep down with growth fertilized lemon tree to encourage good tree vigor give mature citrus 1 to 1.5 pounds of nitrogen each year apply nitrogen three to four times a year first in mids or late winter make additional applications every six to eight weeks until the end of summer test the soil if trees are growing poorly don't apply nitrogen around the lemon tree in autumn it can result in tender growth sensitivity to frost allow growth to harden off before winter lemon trees aren't particularly huge but a little pruning can help it maintain its shape and keep the height to a reasonable level if frost is predicted cover the plant with large row cover or clear plastic sheeting make a mini greenhouse by setting a wooden framework around the plant then cover it with clear plastic you can also place a string of lights inside the frame to keep tree warm paint drunk

leaf miner  bowl fits trips etc to control all this insect pest visit your nearest horticulture department and discuss with experts from the department now one of the most important part that is harvesting of lemons lemon will usually be ripe enough to harvest about 4 months after the blossoms came out on the tree the fruit color will be a deep bright yellow with no green remaining big lemons when they become fully yellow left too long on the tree they will lose flavor and acidity and become peachy the best way to tell if lemon is ripe is to pick one and taste it color alone is not the judge of ripeness ripe fruit can remain on the tree for weeks and even months without losing quality fruits can be harvested as soon as it is pump and juicy even if the rind is green the lemon that is not fully yellow will be more acidic and store longer once producing at full capacity each tree can produce two to three bottles of lemon each year for the average family this is more than enough since they are not usually eaten as whole fruit storage of lemon you can store your fresh lemons out of room temperature for about 2 weeks they will keep closer to 6 weeks if you keep them in the fridge if you only use lemon for juice you can freeze lemon juice for convenient use freeze juice in ice cube trays and then back up the cubes in a large ziploc bag the juice cubes will last for several months when frozen that's all folks for today hope you enjoyed the video please like and subscribe to this channel and please ring the bell button to notify you whenever new video is uploaded

those notes because i was crying at the same time but lots of practice ooh they'd all finished watching the video um my friend just texted me who watched the video and she was like that was so great no my friend karen oh um and she's she's like can you teach me how to make a pie in three and a half minutes and i was like yeah when i was when i was writing out the av so the av is like uh the lyrics next to what you're going to see on the camera so i was technically the director on this one so i was writing out the av and my notes were like suddenly apple slices are magically all sliced even though we've only seen her cut into an apple or apples are magically all peeled pie is magically assembled because i wanted it to go in the oven by the end of the video also i don't know if we have any behind the scenes um of us making the pie but the pie that i end up putting in the oven is in fact a dish towel with some apple slices on top of it because we needed to build up the pie enough so it looked like it was fully made i did take some promo shots with a with a real pie that was delicious but um sorry i just saw amanda taylor's coming i love you amanda um anyway well it's there's a there's a dish towel in the middle of the pie that goes in the oven in the video yeah ari why don't you tell us about your um belly my belly okay i'm not actually pregnant we have some video

you okay robbie's trying to fix his audio since you can't hear him which is weird because we can hear him so i don't know why you can't but we're on the actual meet with him anyway um our belly we went to walmart and we got a big plastic ball like you know those balls that the parents never want to lock their kids by because their kids will grab them it was one of those balls and we took it and we deflated it enough that it like fit to my belly my real belly and then we got some pregnancy underwear and they go up to like right under like they go up past your belly and so you just put the belly in there and it takes a lot of like smoothing and maneuvering to get it to look good but once it's in it's like done it's perfect what really here did anybody hear the name of robbie's favorite pie pumpkin spice um yeah and i when we first saw pictures of ari's belly they were sending them to us the night that they before filming and at first i was like um that's probably too massive like maybe it's too big and then i looked at pictures of the end of my pregnancy and i was so freaking huge i was like oh no wait that looks real okay we're good we did it just definitely takes lots of like figuring out we had to deflate it a little bit more we push it lower push it lower we have to figure it out um but it was really interesting because the belly because it's filled with air it would like breathe with me so i it felt very realistic they still can't hear you robbie some people say they can hear you really quietly it's fine robbie's just here to uh run the technical side of things he's just our tech support and he filmed it um oh okay weird now i'm seeing a presentation of our faces there we go yeah okay just let us know if you can hear robbie and otherwise if you have

cooler than ari i was like yes she is absolutely i'm not a cool person i also said that you're right you're cooler than i am he is cooler than you are no he's not there he's invisible um i'm secretly an 85 year old woman guys i'm not i'm not cool i'm not i'm a 95 year old woman yeah here's what i'm currently working on which is a giant blanket that i'm crocheting so if this tells you how cool i am you are a grandma i'll tell you what i fixed it katie bridgeforth just said why are the younger sisters always so cool my theory is and i think this is real that they get to learn from having older siblings so like robbie and i just had to figure out the growing up and social thing on our own but our younger siblings got to learn from having older siblings to interact with and learn from and they got like hang out with our friends that were older yeah so i always say my siblings oh everything to me which will be true at all times all of ari's acting talent you're welcome it's from me um okay someone on our patreon of christopher christopher asked ari did you have a particular inspiration or preparation to get into the mindset for such an emotional song um filming emotional scenes is really interesting um and i honestly hate filming emotional scenes it's really cool to be part of this project but we've always kind of laughed because for some reason i keep filming these really emotional scenes and camry loves to do emotional scenes and she's not the one filming them which is kind of i never got to um lots of it there's lots of preparation that goes into it i i saw waitress on broadway in 2016 with the original cast so i know the story really well i went back i watched the movie i just wanted to make sure i knew um jenna's surroundings her life everything like that um lots i make sure i'm hydrated because i feel like i can never get i feel like your emotions definitely are affected by how hydrated you are which sounds kind of silly but it's true and i don't know you just have to kind of put yourself in that situation and we have to be really careful on set camry is really good at yelling at anybody on set who's trying to be funny when we're trying to be serious because otherwise it takes you out of the situation and it's harder to get back in and in real life if you're going to be upset about something you're upset about it once and then you move on when you're filming a video i have to be upset about that thing for four hours and um so we just we usually get any of our wide shots are not quite as emotional and then we get a couple shots where i just kind of let it all go and break down a little bit and we make sure we get really close on those ones and yeah you just have to put yourself in those shoes there's not really a good method or someone asked which sorry turn up my volume someone asked um do you actually sing when you're acting or do you act singing later both yeah um i can show them i might show them the uh one of the rough rough cuts yeah you can do that so free usually when we're doing videos we most of the time we'll record in the studio first and then sing along with that sorry um then we'll sing along with that while we are filming in which case we're still singing and acting but we're singing to our pre-recorded voice but for emotional videos i wanted ari to be able to like act out her emotions and not have to be matching what she sounded like so we filmed her first yeah we let her sing live and then she matched that emotion in the recording studio aka anton's bedroom yeah which is a tip for anybody if you're wanting to do like tick-tock videos or music videos on your own youtube channel it never looks realistic if you're not actually singing people can tell if you're just mouthing the words if you're making a video and you want to look like you're really singing you have to actually sing and just make sure you're not recording live audio um i'm going to show you guys aren't being able to see it except if you watch the live um i'm gonna show them real quick some of the rough audio and you sound really good considering camera mia doesn't mean the funniest snapchat [Music] putting stephen to bed that's weird they can't really hear the sounds oh really it must be because it's in premiere i'll keep that in mind for future things um i'm sure we'll post a video for some behind the scenes later that you'll be able to see kind of this is good good test test run i'm gonna try something else camry just ran to put steven to bed so she will be back later at least i'm assuming that's where she went she just walked out yeah she does that she'll get stuck can you guys hear that i'm gonna try something one more time for kicks and giggles they said they could hear that a little bit so you just put music on in the background and sing to it i know you're behind the scholar sisters you couldn't hit that last note um that early so it came out funny yeah so uh we have someone on set for the speaker and they just sit on the phone and they they press play when robbie calls action and we sing along to ourself with the speaker so it was really interesting in the little mermaid because we were filming underwater that i couldn't really hear the music so we had to have a really really loud speaker right above the surface of the water we tried to put one underwater but it didn't work very well but we just have to have a speaker that we can hear and sing along to it uh real quick i'm gonna test it one more time they said they could hear [Music] to bring back [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] she is messy but she's kind [Music] she is alone most of the time she is all of this mixed up and baked in all right so i uh also like it's sometimes great just using the live audio uh just because like it's i mean it's kind of easier for ari to be in it no it definitely is easier to be ferrari to be in it but then recording in a studio and not like feeling all the emotions of it all uh but both sound really good but there's something there's something really nice about um the emotion of the live audio um also when we were filming what was it oh wait what it where is it this it was this scene i was which one um it's just when you're really emotional i was holding the camera and i was like crying and like trying to trying to film in like oh gosh so beautiful um that scene was actually kind of an accident wasn't it where we um we weren't planning on continuing filming we were gonna we were gonna cut right after this part but everything was just kind of working together and we were like i mean i didn't know i was acting but they just like never called cuts so i kept going and ended up being really emotional and then after that we decided to go into the really emotional stuff but even after that like accidental cut we like stopped and you look around their room and everybody is just crying it's true me robbie my mom camry chelsea was there i wasn't even watching really or like from the camera she was just listening listening all right uh we got a couple of comments uh our your hair is beautiful it's so good you guys never fail to amaze me um how oh real quick raise of hands did anyone see the snow in the background it was like it was like flower i feel like and there were big big snowflakes with some beautiful snow that day we did not plan that as as always i i like to say god plans our our uh our shoots in the weather which is really nice um so okay there's one oh how do you overcome stage fright um well this is a little bit different because it's not live so it's a little easier i feel like i get multiple takes i'm not going to mess up on the first try um but for stage fright lots of it is just going and doing it again i've auditioned for things a thousand times it gets a little easier but i still do get stage fright um but you just have to tell yourself that you're not scared you're excited because it's the same feeling when you're excited you get those butterflies in your stomach and when you're scared to get those butterflies in your stomach and it's oh it's good to be a little nervous because it means that you really care about what you're doing yeah people really just have to keep doing it but it's not a bad thing to have some stage fright yeah it's uh yeah you have to have some stage fright it makes it better i mean we've all been acting for like 14 years now which is by the way gross but um because you're so old because i'm old now but we still get stage fright it doesn't matter how long we've been doing it or how much we've done i still get stage fright um someone asked who played gaston in your cover of bell it's a news anchor um and he just knew camp k and he wanted to be in the video so we used him um who who's your favorite character you've played as that's tough um obviously being a mermaid underwater really cool super dope love that um but jenna is a dream role of mine i would love to to do a full production of of waitress or if you guys want to keep watching these videos and donating to patreon we can just do more songs from waitress um so we can do that camry can be done [Music] i'll keep being prego jenna so jenna you know she's she's hiking up to the top but i maybe still have to say ariel just because i got to be a mermaid underwater which is so cool cameron what was your favorite role you played for working with lemons yeah um what roles have i played elsa laid elsa she's not my favorite spoiler alert angelica no eliza i do like eliza is probably my favorite i did like being sally though she was fun yeah you're belle too yeah belle was fun but i think that eliza was probably my favorite well especially i mean we got to do like a little concert um kind of production of more of the songs of hamilton um and i think that was really cool too so then you got to do more of the story yeah yeah that's fine um ask me what my favorite is robbie who's your favorite person uh the my fit um see that's a hard one because i've played so many um i feel like uh let's you know i feel like it'd be elsa that is probably your best role that's my favorite that i've seen you in i know yeah it's um it's time to invest work who's seen me as elsa raise of hands if you haven't seen robbie's elsa you need to watch it because it's way better than me as elsa for sure it's way better as i did than i idina manziela's also for being honest easy it's the best i've ever seen thank you you guys are so kind um where why is it not falling up i'm freaking looking for it did you put on lemon slices it's on um it's on working with lemons we didn't have lemon slices back when robbie released that video no we didn't any new videos coming up someone asked the camera i don't know if we have anything really planned yet we have some of them like works that we'll probably start doing once weather is good yeah um but when you 30 million views baby hey i had some something to bring up um we are thinking of doing another so this video i don't know if they already talked about this while i was gone and if you don't know our patreon supporters voted for this video um and we want to do that some more i think it's really fun to have you guys have input on the videos that we make so if you want to be involved in future voting make sure you're following us on patreon you don't even have to be a paid supporter to know when that's going to happen um we do limit voting to only those who are paying but like if you just want to know when it's coming and then support us during the voting and then stop then that works too um but we are thinking of next time letting you guys choose the video and cast the video so this time we had you guys choose the video and then we cast it but i think would be fun for you guys to do both and we're also going to be talking about merch over on our patreon page because we want to get you guys some good merch carrie that's a cool sweater that you're wearing um i mean yeah it is cool but um but we actually want to make you guys some more like broadway and disney themed merch and we want to know oh cool huh ari well thank you um we want to know what you guys want so we're going to be asking because i had to freaking run oh my gosh i'm sorry it was like the end of my bed it was at the other end of my bed but look at my cool hat i honestly want one of those still i love this hat i mean i haven't worn it in months because it's winter but i literally looked behind robbie and i was like what is that cool table like i don't know robbie had that was the same thing it's not his house it's someone else's green screen if i will attempt to burn from hamilton um probably someday the thing is she's supposed to be like 40 in that video and so i kind of want to wait till i'm older or until we get good enough at subtle aging makeup ari that's your job yeah um okay so we do have a merch shop but it's currently just working with lemons merch not like working with lemons broadway merch yeah or specific we haven't done any specific like robbie where's your merch it's yellow did you run off looking for your shirt i couldn't find it i have my shirt in my closet but it's i don't know if it's a shirt that we saw i have my baseball t-shirt we do sell one very similar to that not the exact same but i'm not going to get out of bed again okay i don't know i'm just gonna say guys i like having you here on the google hangout i usually do lives by myself it's fun to chat it's nice i probably have like 15 more minutes before i need to um get ready for work i'll probably have less okay so only a little bit more it's okay we just plan on this being a shorter talkback um so i guess um if you guys have questions be sure to ask them because we'll probably only be on for a handful of minutes more yeah let's give it so we just give it how much more time you guys said limits i know what do you guys think um asking the fans what do would you prefer lives kind of more like this um and we kind of watch some of our old videos or or would you like both what do what do you guys how do you like this um what i was gonna say that we are planning on our patreon page robbie we kind of talked about this and i've talked to some of our patrons about it on doing some like director's commentary on videos so robbie your finger's disappearing oh no [Music] so if you like these kind of videos let us know and we're going to try to offer those more through our patreon page and every once in a while through not our patreon page probably anyway what else were you going to say robbie they have can we do something from haiti's town oh yeah mention that on patreon because i think that was one of our options to vote for wasn't it it was we had a couple yeah um yeah and then people wanted hamilton which you know vote for it on patreon we can maybe do it depending on which which one it is um there's some we just can't do uh how it should be done this is what i always tell people someone's requesting battle of yorktown which like believe me we would love love love to do but for us to do it justice we have to have a big a fairly big budget for that like we need an army we need yeah we need we need us we need a big field we need yeah um so what i always say is if you want to give us the money somehow we will happily make that video and maybe we'll be able to make it some day in the future anyway but we always have to balance like the cost of the video based on how much it could potentially bring in based on how much money we have at the moment which is not a lot um so we're happy to do those big production things but it just has to be the right time yeah with the right funding yo someone just asked if i could do a booklet exit go for it i'm from i'm from brooklyn so he can't so the answer to that question is no he can't accents aren't hard someone start talking like it and then i can probably if i can get one sentence it'll help i'm trying to think of like a newsies line me too there's my cigar go steal another hey look it's bath time at the zoo yeah i know it's not great but that's the only thing i can think of yeah also like uh little shop of horrors is brooklyn right a little sort of poor there's more new york than brooklyn because they are slightly different but i don't know what the difference is like audrey's like kind of brooklyn yeah that was my intention you just wondering new york yeah okay how do you guys decide what upcoming projects you want to do is it based on resources and time or on suggestions i knew some okay it's all the above um this is from katie ultimately like if there's something popular that we are also interested in like frozen and or hamilton um then we plan on doing those like we knew we were gonna be doing frozen two videos when frozen two released um so we planned those videos otherwise we usually try to do based on what people want to see combined with what we want to watch there are some things that people want to see that we just don't want to do so we don't do that um but if we don't have anything like that on our agenda then we kind of think okay like what's a video that we want to do that isn't going to be too expensive that we can do well and that people are going to be happy to see um i'm trying to think of videos that would fit in that category more that we've done uh even like sally's song was a little bit like that like we knew that people like to watch nightmare before christmas but it's not like super live stream popular robbie i don't even see anyone else in your room who are you talking to i'm on youtube right which in turn allows us to make more videos so there are some projects that we do that we are not making any money on because we paid so much money for making the video and all of that and we already know that it was just a passion project we just really wanted to make it ourselves anyway and we're not going to be making money on it and there's other videos that we know people want to see and those ones are easier to do so we always want to know what you guys want to see because it helps us make more videos yes totally how long did it take to shoot she used to be mine four hours uh five hours five yeah we were there part of me thinks we could have done that whole thing in a one shot and i know talked about it not if we magically made the pie we just show it not in in the shot you know so we just would have had to set up props really specifically um i'll actually well i won't be able to i'll show it sometime but it's it's the uh it's the pr we filmed one whole take kind of just blocking it out like a oner basically do you remember that camry it was just a rehearsal take um and there's some cool like there's a nice flow to at least the beginning the flow is really nice um yeah katie says if you just put if she just puts she used to be mine on loop and watch it a bunch of times would you do more waitress let's see robbie what's our what's our income how many views do they have to watch to earn us one dollar you have to watch it a thousand times to earn a 70 cents um so a thousand three hundred we'll say is a dollar a dollar so thirteen hundred views for one dollar it costs us this video since we did most of the stuff ourselves cost us a couple hundred bucks yeah and obviously this was like a very low budget video most of our videos cost much more than that and if we had more money i'd actually pay ari for her work yeah someday so many people will actually get paid too i mean we've paid people in the past we have it depends on the situation depends what how youtube is treating us at the moment which you know youtube has actually been great like it's it's crazy that we're able to do what we what we love and have you guys watch and and just by watching you guys are are helping our channel grow so it's like a win-win for everybody um what was the hardest part of making the video probably pretending to be pregnant because i don't actually weigh as much as i would if i was carrying a nine-month baby in my bedroom so all the time camry and robbie would be like ari you have to walk heavier than that you have your hand up heavier than that you weigh 40 more pounds than you are acting like i mean obviously the emotional stuff was pretty hard we already talked about that so i was thinking about something else and probably pretending to be to be pregnant yeah i think the hardest part was um well for well i think actually one of the most difficult parts is making a small house with um with not much like it looks really great but there's only like so many locations in the kitchen that you can shoot like i'm making it interesting enough yeah so i think we did a great job if i do say so myself uh blocking and um of of making it interesting um so someone asked why does youtube not pay you as much as other youtube channels so a real quick lesson about uh youtube money from our experience a lot of youtubers make a bunch of money because they are vloggers so their videos don't cost them very much to make if anything or you know maybe they pay an editor to edit their videos so their cost is really low they are getting sponsorships that they can incorporate more easily because they can just be like look at this cool apple pencil blah blah blah and they don't have to like incorporate it into a music video and they can put out a lot more videos so they have all of that going for them all that's bringing them more money but also they're not paying for rights so like for every video we do for our waitress video we are paying part of the money that we make to the waitress copyright basically which is good like of course we want to pay those people who created this great thing but it means that we only get a cut of that so that's why our youtube channel is less lucrative than others um someone asked who made the pie uh our mother is a master master and uh but actually the pie that you see what are you talking about i made that pie yeah um there's a there's a towel in in the pie like a rolled up towel to kind of give it a height yeah so that it looked like it was full of apples because we didn't have time to slice all the apples and fill it up yeah so as good as it looks it's not a real pie but the blueberry pie you see in a promo picture is real and yeah um okay we probably have like two more questions so they they asked will there be more our house videos yes um once covid is over so we thought about filming it during it but we're currently filming like our house finale we're not planning on doing another season sorry um unless you guys want to fund it which is always our answer um but since we're kind of trying to wrap it up we want to make it really good so we want to be able to bring all the characters that we want in together and with koba that was more complicated so we want to do it right we are waiting until things are more under control so that we can do it justice and not just throw it together who's the baker of the family is ari a real baker ari doesn't really bake um my mom and i both bake and love to bake and taylor likes to bake too a little bit yeah i'd say taylor's more of a cook but she bakes sometimes i don't cook or bake i love baking it's definitely carrying my mom uh excuse me i've i'm a cook right sorry i forgot to mention robbie robbie i make his smoothie every morning and you're really good at making cowboy caviar so yeah and i make a mean cowboy caviar which takes me like four i want to go camping i want to go camping so bad right now um that's all i want one more question chris asked are we creative enough to create original songs to work around the copyright so chris if you if you have been on our channel you may have seen our jelsa song find a way that was a song that we had our sound guy make for us which was great and that one earned a good amount of views because it had elsa in it the problem is with original songs people aren't searching for those so people aren't going to be typing in the search bar waitress original fan song or spin-off song they're going to be typing she used to be mine or if you wrote a musical with original music it's just harder to promote it because no one's searching for this musical called whatever i'd name it you know so so yeah that is an optional an option an optional that is an option but again it doesn't bring in as much money in the past and we prefer when we're making original content we want to do scripted stuff more that's where we're more inclined to put our original ideas rather than in musical stuff yeah but we always see we're always looking for more videos to do we're always looking for kind of what's going to be popular at the moment so just you know we always see the suggestions that you guys are putting out there yes we see the songs that you want us to do we're just waiting for more people to suggest those songs so always keep suggesting and maybe someone will see that and be like oh my gosh that video would be so cool to do and then they'll start suggesting it and we'll see that that video will is possible and then you'll be searching all right but i think it's time for us to sign off it is okay thanks for joining guys this was fun we're going to be hosting more of these this one was public we'll probably do some more public ones um we'll also be doing some that are just for our patrons on patreon um even if you can't pay on patreon you can follow our page to get some updates um and be sure you're following us on instagram thanks for watching guys bye bye guys ending stream and", "S6qq2I2SHAM": "[Music] hello today we're doing another cooking videos but today we're doing some candy candy from the orange peels and lemon peels what we call candy citrus peels there's a little bit story behind this for years I will buy the candied orange peels and they're very very good and but they're very expensive hard to find here in the States and when I make mine at home mine they don't turn out as good as the one commercially so finally I find a beautiful recipe which is works and guess what the one I make at home they are even better than the one I buy commercially and they're healthier because I have organic raw sugar honey water and organic orange sitter's so that's a good one but the problem with it it takes ten days to make this candy you don't cook for ten days by the way it's just five minutes of every 24 hours what you do you boil the water with sugar with the the citrus peels and that's it but it takes 10 days and the thing is they turn out better than the one I buy commercially so I'm going to show you all the process where do we need the citrus peels well the first one I like to use them in Lakehead Suzette the famous Italian panettone the Christmas brioche bread by the way the syrup from this recipe it's beautiful because it's it's something you can use to brush all your desserts so we're not going to throw it out and there is no waste here it just it takes up to 10 days you may do it in seven days but 10 days I get a fabulous fabulous result so let me show you how it's done gather your beautiful citrus I have three big large oranges and two lemons they're fresh and organic and we're going to use two method for tearing them I personally I prefer the vegetable peeler because I can get very thin skin with hardly any citrus slash in it no white layer very clean I don't have to do anything and don't worry about the size or how they long to come out because we can turn those pills later once they all cooked so you can see they are perfect and I'm going to show you that we can use the paring knife but you have to do some work later if you have the citrus and you not already to make this recipe you can always peel your origins and lemon and you keep them in a jar with cold water in the fridge then you change that water every day until you're ready to make this recipe actually that's how I do it you go here I'm showing you the difference between the take peel and the skinny peel the different methods of doing it now we're going to peel the lemon now we're going to move to the most important step of this recipe we're going to weigh the pills so we weigh in the orange peels first then we're going to weigh the water it should be three times the orange peels meaning since we have 100 gram of orange peels that mean we have 300 grams of water then we go to add 300 grams of sugar we do the same thing here we have only 50 grams of the lemon peels that mean we're going to weigh 150 gram of sugar then 100 150 gram of water so basically is three times the weight of the citrus peels and now we're ready to go to the next step now we start preparing the orange peels for this process by pouring cold water in a pot with the peels in them and we're going to bring it to our boiling point the moment it get there we have to remove the pot from the stove without draining the peels and repeat the process meaning you start with a cold water again after draining the peels then we're going to do their three times this process will remove some bitterness from the peels and I will recommend you to do it three times instead of twice like most people because you really give us a better result [Music] [Music] [Music] now we're ready for the second would third step maybe I will also pour the water the sugar in a large pot over medium heat we want to dissolve that sugar we really don't want to see any sugar in that water and before adding the peels so we're going to wait until it starts boiling then we add the orange peels be adding some honey to the boiling water to prevent the peels from crystallizing then we go to add the peels and we lift them boiled just for a few seconds maybe 30 seconds the most then we take the pot off the heat immediately and we let it sit at room temperature without inner lid until it completely cooled down and we're going to do the same thing for the lemon peels water with sugar we wait until it's completely boiled we add in some honey and then we add lemon peels and we going to let them boil for few second and then when it it cool down at room temperature we thought in a lid the reason because we don't want any moist coming back to that syrup so now we have the two hot pot without to wait until they're completely cooled down and go to cover each one of them with a lid and leave them at room temperature you don't need to put them in the refrigerator for 24 hours until the next day and you go to check the pills they're not ready yet [Music] a small trip what to do with your oranges once you remove the peels that you can remove the white layer and slice them to use them for your breakfast or your salad but for the lemon you just squeeze the lemon juice from lemons and you can use it for your salad dressing or drizzle it on anything you want [Music] 24 hours later the next day we don't to check or orange peels and you can see they're not trendy idiots so we need to keep going and go to the next step [Music] we're going to place the cold pot on the stove and we want to boil it once it gets to the boiling point we wait for few seconds and we'll remove the pot from the heat and we let it sit down for a couple hours until it cooled down without the lid then we cover it and then we wait until the next day 24 hours later and we'll repeat the same process [Music] and they later the syrup is take it's sticky it feels like honey and the peels they are translucent so finally I get a good result I'm happy with that and I think achieve my goal so ten days of work was it so we're done all year to do now store them in a jar which title it and make sure they are covered with the syrup to keep them moist and you can store them in the fridge for many many months forever [Music] [Music] when you need them get them out with the out of the jar cut them any way you want here I'm cutting them in a very tiny little strip or just eat them the way they are I'm enough social media like Instagram and Facebook find me there ask question I shared small stories over there and you can ask questions and I'll be happy to answer them by the way I always leave the link to the recipe with the full details like the ingredient the temperature on my websites chef Rashid Khan please check it out you can leave your comments over there there is anything I miss I can always change the recipe on my website it's difficult to go to the video and change the device if I skip an important step so go back to my site and leave that comments and I will definitely update the recipe if I have to and I will ask you a question hope you like this recipe and I hope to see you soon thank you", "VDtQE4i9xtE": "hi and welcome to otto and sons nursery my name is scott clinch and my wife and I own the nursery and I'm here to talk about citrus today this is our citrus orchard here and we have about seven acres of Valencia oranges something unique to Valencia oranges is that it takes almost 18 months from flower to harvest for the fruit Valencia oranges flower in spring you might have smelled the wonderful fragrance of spring and then produces the fruit and the fruit are these tiny little things right here see you right in there that's the fruit that'll be harvested next July a year from this July all right whereas the street currently has fruit on it right now these flowered in gin in spring March March of 2019 so their harvesting will harvest these in July this year so about eighteen months so for about two month period the tree will have both small fruit and large fruit and it's kind of unique to Valencia oranges Washington navels the mandarins they all flower in spring and you harvest later on usually in the fall or winter of that year so something unique to the citrus anyway so I want to talk about where to plant citrus in your yard in your garden they like full Sun full Sun they don't put if you put them in the shade they just won't do nearly as well and that's a the best place for them you want to protect them from the wind if you can put them on next to a building or a fence or some sort of wall or another tree or something like that they're protected from the wind what happens with the wind is you get scarring you kind of see right in here see this when there's out in the open air it's got a bunch of bunch of scars on the on the rhein here it's all it's all cosmetic it's all on the outside but it's it's makes it not as attractive so if you can avoid the wind it's good here's there's one right up here like this was Brent just from there from the wind right there see it's scarred right there but again the inside will be just fine you know it's just a cosmetic concern so protect from protect it from the wind is good protect from frost anything below 28 degrees Fahrenheit the trees going to get damaged there's actual cells inside the fruit will collapse and it will you'll get damaged if some ways to control the frost is - you could have it in a pot and move it inside put it in a greenhouse for the winter those kinds of things have been done I've seen people take and put Christmas lights the big bulb type not the LED type of course but the big bulb type Christmas lights on the tree hook it to a thermostat so it turns on when it gets to 30 degrees and that way that little bulb will create enough heat energy and will keep the tree warm if you're in a you know a marginal area otherwise you're gonna get some damage if you get below 28 degrees so that's the way we look look for frost free areas if possible there are you'll hear the words standard semi dwarf and dwarf talked about that depends on the rootstock that is used with that tree all citrus is grafted or budded and they'll be depending on which root stock they use will determine how large the tree will get its eventual height so a dwarf root stock is one often called flying dragon that they'll use and that will reduce the tree down to 20% of what it normally would do so it's a big constriction just slowing those nutrients down just going up into the tree so it just reduces that tree from from growing and you'll get a slower growing tree so it doesn't grow nearly as fast but you're keeping that stature down so it's only gonna get maybe five six seven feet tall at maturity so it's a nice sized tree for a for a wine barrel some sort of us small planter small pathway area so the dwarf trees work really well in those areas the next size up which is when we mostly grow a semi dwarf so my drawer fruit stocks are like the c35 and it creates a smaller tree it's about eighty percent seventy eighty percent of what the tree would get it is natural size so like a Valencia orange it's only gonna get about fifteen to eighteen feet and it's mature size and there are standard root stocks which some trees will get 20 25 28 30 feet tall so if you have a large area you can go to stand root stocks so that's that's a different root stocks you can use there our citrus do grow well in containers be sure to use a good potting soil you want to mix that up and put that in a large container larger container the better I would not go smaller than a wine barrel size large is better in that case planting in the ground I always think the ground is a better place for citrus because you've got the more soil to work with more soil environments the watering is not as critical it's still important but not as critical as in a pot pot you're gonna watch the fertilizer you've got to watch the moisture all the time so whether the ground you've got a bit of a leeway there you want to a dick a generous hole I always say do a hundred dollar hole for a ten dollar plant you know so you want to make a generous hole you wanted to have twice as wide as the the pot you have and half again is deep you're gonna mix that extra cell you've put on the side you're gonna blend that with like the harvest supreme over here I like the harvest supreme it's got some chicken manure in it a bunch of nutrients it's a good organic product to use and it's so you'll blend that about 50/50 with your soil of course you'll backfill in the hole because you've dug it too deep and then you'll when you go to plant it you want to make sure the level of the pot the current top of the root ball is equal or higher than your current soil actually higher is better one inch if you're gonna make mistake and make it too high don't make it too low because what happens if the the pot is too low the the soil will fill around it and get moisture get moist soil against the trunk and that could cause a rot and cost the tree to suffer so make a little high is good even on a little mound is a good thing to do a lot of the commercial guys out here in the in the Ventura County area are planning their citrus on rows that are about 18 inches off the ground big old furrows and so they're planting them to get better drainage off the top of the tree let's see when after you finish planting it you're gonna make a mound around the outside probably 18 24 inches out from the trunk you're gonna make a mound maybe the four or six inches tall and that mound will help hold water into the area so you can initially water it fill that up at least three times initially and so the water gets down deep so you saturate the entire soil in the whole area all right and you'll leave that mound there and that's how you water for the first year is keep feeling that that's that that the whole up when it comes to irrigation frequency you want to water it as much as needed which is hard to say in your climate and area but taken scratch the cell service take a look at it if it's if it's moist hold off a day or two and give it some more water but you're probably talking the first year you'll be watering it about once a week okay I'm filling up that dead mount that that basin of water fill it up at least three times each time in this orchard here this is a well-established orchard we've had this some of these trees are like 80 years old so they're still producing fruit and we've watered this orchard once every three weeks and but we water it in every three weeks we water for 48 hours we have micro sprinklers that put the water on so there's no dirt no runoff the water just goes down and goes deep so I encourage you to water your fruit trees deeply don't if you've been watering yours every week and now you want to switch to the guy on the phone the computer said do it every three weeks you can't do it right away you've got to transition your plants from one to the other and it may take a year or two before you can get to that point so the roots have to grow where the moisture is placement I don't think fruit tree fruit trees in general but citrus especially do not grow well when they're by a lawn because a lawn area requires watering like three times a week and you're only watering you know that the top profile about 2 or 3 inches whereas the roots on these go down four feet and there's as wide as the lighter than the tree so you're going to want it you have an incompatibility there between growing a citrus and growing the grass you're going to the grass three times a week and this three once every three weeks so one of them is going to suffer either you're going to have a nice lawn and a poor growing tree or a good lon a good tree and a poor growing lon so you might take your sprinklers and rearrange them somehow and carve out areas of your lawn area so you can have your tree be isolated from that sprinkler system so that you can irrigate it appropriately so that's one method of doing it of taking care of the irrigation let's see what's on my notes here let's talk about fertilizing there's a number of fertilizers out there we I like the the citrus fruit tree and fruit tree one it's an 8 for 2 fertilizer this in this particular bag on a tree this size full size tree you'd probably use a one bag of it one whole bag of this every through every three months I think I put on my notes here every April and June okay so that's 12 pounds of this 12 pounds of this fertilizer this is a four pound bag you'll use that three times three times a year and do it in it's really late winter spring and early summer so I think I put on here where my notes February April and June the bags all have direction certainly you can follow directions on there it'll tell you how to do it smaller trees use less of course larger trees you use more so that's take a look at that also sometimes you'll see on the leaves you'll see a yellowing between the veins that's usually a micronutrient deficiency usually zinc manganese and so you'll want to put it or iron and so there's our full-year fertilizers you can put on there the sometimes those nutrients are too hard to suck out on the ground for the roots so you put a full-year fertilizer of those products on the on the tree that'll help alleviate that yellowing let's see mulching I always liked I think obviously in a commercial grove we can't do it here but in a home garden I think it's an excellent way to do is to have mulch and put a good two to four inches of mulch on the soil having mulch does a number of things one of them it holds the moisture in it as it breaks down it feeds your soil microorganisms and those are what's releasing nutrients to your tree it helps keep the soil cooler and with our hot summers it's a big difference having a cooler soil and then also it helps with weeds any weed seeds that come flying in might get might grow in that mulch but they can't get established too well because it's really easy to pull them out so I'll reduce your weeds it generally and it will also take and any weeds that do come up are easy to pull out at that point so mulching is very good trimming not a whole lot of trimming to do on the trees but the main thing you want to do is you're going to trim out dead branches so sometimes you'll see dead branches you'll just you'll go through and and trim them out obviously you use a printer because that's causing your scraping and scarring of the fruit so trimming is good just removing the dead wood and kind of opening up a little bit I think it's always good to skirt the trees skirting is where you take in the bottom and you just remove about 6 to 12 inches of branches that are hanging down so not touching the ground so otherwise the citrus will go all with the ground the reason I - because if they're always the ground that's a lot of places where insects can crawl on the ground and crawl up your tree if you only have one point that such as the ground the trunk then that's the only point that insects can go to and go up into the tree so I like to have a discouraging it also helps with air circulation under the tree it could be an issue in the wintertime when it's cold and so the so go through and and you can do that and let's see sometimes you'll have water sprouts it'll shoot up in there in the citrus tree just a it just goes up and go straight on up really fast it doesn't fruit that's a it's not a sucker generally but it's just called a water sprout you want to follow that on down and trim that off where it is it has attached okay so we're gonna talk about pest and pest control now and plant protection citrus can get a lot of passed so there could be a lot of issues you might see along the way but most of it is all cosmetic you know the Ryan gets damaged or leaves get curled primarily it's not a gonna be a problem for the fruit or the juice on the inside that rind but I'm gonna run through about a few of them and just so you'll see them you know what they are I'll give you some ideas on how to control them one thing that you'll see you're a Fidesz like to suck on the brand-new foliage and then they'll curl the foliage it'll get kind of twisted up and then as it's curled of course a spider can get in there because that's a nice place for them to hide spiders are actually a beneficial because they eat aphids and other insects so that's you'll see those around if you have a lot of them one way to control it just by water just use water here's a one of my favorite pest control tools here is a nice watering wand get underneath and wash get on top and wash sides you want to wash the whole plant I'll get inside the tree itself and just wash it down that washes the aphids off washes any insect eggs insects that might be there cleans the foliage so just washington washington plant off is really a good way to control a lot of pest issues if you have a real bad situation there are oils you can spray the neem oil or the Monterey horticultural oil that all works really well the only way the oils that don't use them on a hot day if it's over 80 degrees I don't recommend that use any kind of oils because it will actually suffocate the tree and you'll get some leaf burn we don't do that so that would be used on a cooler days ants ants can be a challenge earlier I mentioned about skirting the trees where you trim the branches on the sides so there's only one point of contact with the ground that way the ants can't go up the side they can only go up on that trunk so you have one point of contact and this ant bait I have here call this grant's ant kills ants killer bait it's a bait that you put around you shake it around the area the worker ants will click that bait they'll take it back to the nest the queen will ingest that and it will it's like a birth control and it will slowly kill and reduce that ant nest doesn't happen overnight takes a couple weeks but you'll see the ants slowly go away so it's a really good product for that for controlling the ants leaf miners so I have a sample of leaf matter here let me show you this here leaf miners are a little insect that gets inside the foliage itself and it creates a little mind you know you can see right in there a little little little tunnel kind of between the layers of the leaf and they'll create a little line there and as they make that of course it curls the leaf and you get this leaf damage and Distortion you like this here see it's all kind of curled up in there you know you see that nests in the sunlight there and leaf miners again cosmetic this new foliage is not it doesn't have it just this older foliage when it first came out and got it and four leaf miners you can control it using this organic product we carry called monterey garden insect spray this is our organic product you spray it on the tree and it won't fix the leaves that are damaged but it will protect the new leaves as they come out alright and it's a topical things you spray it on the new foliage and the leaf mozilla miners won't be able to make a nest in there i'm scale insects sometimes you'll get a scale is actually a insect that crawls around it will find a location and it's it settles onto a stem or onto a fruit and kind of makes its home right there it can be oftentimes a red or black could be bulbous on the stem I've seen pretty bad infestations of those again the oils work really well neem oil the horticultural oil those work well too for control your scale pests let's see what else here list snails snails can crawl up the trunk and they'll come in though they'll scar up the fruit they'll put holes in your foliage real nice way to control those would be using the the Sluggo product slow goes actually a pasta that they even in they've had incorporated an iron fertilizer into it they discovered that snails and slugs are actually iron the iron is actually toxic to snails and slugs and that will when they ingest that it makes them kind of sleepy and they kind of wander off someplace to hide and they'll die at that point it's the snails and slugs really good product it's good for pets I mean pests won't bother it unlike the previous snail product they used to have this is a nice good safe product and it's only iron fertilizer and pasta Gophers go for traps I like the McAtee trap myself this is my favorite here the MacCabe trapped you find a tunnel you remove the the soil try and find if I work your way down the tunnel you take this trap you set it once you put it inside the tunnel I always like to put a bit of greens behind the trap here so when this go fur comes along it hits this trap it gets stuck you're trapped right in there and suffocates and then when it's you come back later you shake it off of here and then I like to put it back down inside the tunnel and kind of bury it as the carcass degrades it will keep any other Gophers away from that tunnel for a while so it's a good way just to get rid of the Gopher just to put it back in the tunnel that works really well and it's the any other pest I'm concerned about right now oh that's about okay that's that's that that's it far as pests I wasn't going to cover today if you have any questions please mark them in the comments below or give us a call take care and thanks for watching you", "2EycQnV57Vk": "(airy music) - Hi, I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. (calm piano music) Today, I'm going to show you how to make candied peel of citrus fruit. Very expensive in the\nstore, and very easy to do. I use the vegetable\npeeler to take long strip. This is a grapefruit,\nof course I have orange, which mostly, I do\nusually with the orange. And as you can see with this, I'm taking only the top part of the skin, and that's relatively important. So I have like a dozen one,\nyou can have lemon as well. And all of that, I will put\ninto boiling water to blanch it. It has to be blanched. Otherwise, it gets very bitter. Now, you don't want to take\nthe thick part of it because if you take the whole part here, where you have the white piece underneath, it's not that you can't do\nit with that, but you have to blanch it at least two to three times. Otherwise, it's bitter,\nbut it is in that part that you have most of the essential oil. Do you see that? I have some of the essential\noil coming out of it. And this, again, in the\nlemon the same way too. And this is where you\nhave most have the taste, in the top in those essential oils. So this boiled for like 10\nsecond, 10, 15 second, usually. And I will drain it. I will drain it in the sink, normally. (liquid splashing) And you can already see\nthe color of that water, and I would drain that out, but you don't have to, back in there. Now, I have about three\nquarter of a cup of water, half cup of sugar, and\nnow, this is going to cook. Okay, as you can see now, it's boiling. It's boiling nicely and the\nsyrup is still very light now. So now, it's going to take probably 10, 12 minute at least to go where I want it to go before we dump it in sugar. Okay, now you can see the bubble. Now, it's cooked tender to a break stage. So I'm going to stop this. And it's yeah, nine minute. (beeps) Nine minute, so what we do now. With this, you want to\nlift up those things and put them in sugar. Okay, one, two, three, because you want to saturate them with sugar.\n(dishes clink) You can see, for example,\nthat this is the grapefruit. And it have a slightly\ndifferent color than the orange. And this is... That's it. You have a syrup here left over, and you could use that syrup, of course. Keep it to do a cocktail with it or something else, but here it is. So what we want there is to saturate that in sugar, on each side. Here, there. Here, there. Then, flat. Okay, here we are. So here, I did it a couple of times. So now, I can use my finger to really... It has to be saturated, totally, with sugar so it doesn't stick anymore. We do that for Christmas. Very often, I do it to give it to friend. In 10, 15 minutes, half an hour, they're going to be hard\nand you cannot even keep it. If you keep it like this outside,\nit get too hard right on. So what you do, you put it into a little, plastic box like this. And then, you can give them for\nweeks, in your refrigerator. Now, you can even make it a bit fancier. You would wait until it's hard, because it is not hard enough now. I have some chocolate here that I melted and you would, for\nexample, the orange peel, dip it maybe half way through. Put it there to cool off. Well with the lemon, let's say\nyou could do white chocolate and it'd be different. Okay, now, if you do\nit with the chocolate, you can't keep it as long in your box that you would keep it without, but you can still keep it for like a week. So here we go, see very easy to do. And I can put that in my\nrefrigerator for a few minutes. That's it, about half an\nhour in the refrigerator, but you can leave it all\nday, it doesn't matter. Notice that I put it onto\nnonstick aluminum foil. You know the part of\nit that this is shiny? No, the un-shiny part is the nonstick one. So here is how you can\nsee, probably even hear it. It's hard, now. I love to do that for the holiday. Christmas, Easter,\nThanksgiving, or whatever. I love, for the holiday,\nto do chocolate like this. And here, another one\nhere, and you can see, it's beautiful with\nchocolate, white chocolate, dark chocolate, milk chocolate,\nany one of that is fine. And there's a beautiful dessert and a great gift to give to your friend. Happy cooking.

background is my water tank filling up I don't have running water in my greenhouse so I'll have to fill up a water tank and I have that in progress right now but anyway while I'm doing that I thought I'd show you my Ponderosa lemon this tree I've had it for about Oh 15 years or so and it produces positivity the largest lemons you're ever gonna see look at that massive lemons now when I say lemon it's kind of a misnomer this tree is not a true lemon although the fruits are shaped like a lemon see here shaped like a lemon may look like a lemon smell like a lemon and tastes like a lemon they're not a true lemon this is actually a hybrid tree between a pomelo and a citron now pomelo is a grapefruit-sized fruit and it's kind of flattened looking on the top to the bottom almost like a grapefruit that's been kind of flattened out it's a hybrid between those I don't know what these taste like I've never had one since I'm not a big grapefruit fan I figured well it's probably something like a grapefruit so that might not be wise but anyhow and the citron is a forefather of a lot of our modern citrus fruits it is kind of a bitter fruit it kind of has a super thick skin to it which actually these fruits here also have a thick skin but anyhow they tend to be using candied peels and stuff like that they're not a very good fruit they're kind of insipid and and acidic tasting so well they don't tend to use them just you know like an orange or a lemon or something like that they're used in hybridization of a lot of simple citrus fruits as I said and like this one here it has some of the characteristics of a citron thick peel not as thick as a citron but a thick peel lots of seeds and the tree is stout like a bush much like a citron citron is more of a shrub than it is a tree sound like an orange tree or lemon tree citron is more of a shrub and this thing has some of the other characteristics also these long thorns seems like everything I like in my greenhouse is kind of thorny isn't it and yellow this tree produces a one crop a year it usually ripens up around January to February and then about a month or so later it'll be about late February or March this will start to form flower buds again on it and bloom again and they have great big white flowers that are lemony scented very nice as you know citrus flowers smell wonderful now you notice some of the leaves are gone from it it's a kind of thinning leave that's partly deciduous it does this every year when I bring it in the greenhouse lose a few its leaves and by spring and summer it'll all be back but anyhow I just want to show you my lemon tree because it is quite an impressive fruit when you see one and that's huge big lemons kind of feel sticky right now they're getting ready to come off

cookies would get too pasty and we want to keep it nice and crumbly alright so I'll show you guys what this looks like so once you get to this consistency it's just like a nice cookie crumbles we're gonna add a couple more things and this is going to be the basis for our pie dough so I've cut the butter into cubes and that's going to make it a lot easier to incorporate in your dough so you want to add the butter right into your food processor and we'll pulse this again and the last thing they want to do is add our liquid ingredients which is going to bring everything together so you can actually put the top on and add it straight in through the full one egg yolk right in through the top and we're going to add some heavy cream but we're gonna add this pretty slowly so we want to make sure that we don't add too much what I'm looking for is the dough just start to come together like a bowl all right so I'm gonna turn this dough out onto a piece of wax paper right here and I'm just gonna use my hands put this right here just like this it already smells so good cuz it's sweet and it's it's Girl Scout cookie and then we'll go ahead we're gonna wrap this up in wax paper or parchment paper and then in plastic we're gonna put this in the refrigerator for at least an hour it needs to chill and get really happy with itself before we roll out this dough all right so next up we want to make our lemon curd which is our filling we're gonna start with seven egg yolks so I've already put the seven egg yolks right into a small saucepan and then we're gonna add about a cup and a half of sugar so I'll go ahead and add that in there and then this recipe calls for 3/4 of a cup of lemon juice plus a couple teaspoons of lemon zest so we'll go ahead and dust that right into our saucepan so now we need to get 3/4 of a cup of the juice so we're going to start with three lemons and we'll see what that is perfect all right so here we are we have exactly three quarters of a cup of juice we're gonna add this right into our saucepan head over to the stove and I'll show you guys how we're gonna whisk this into a really nice curd so you want to stir the curd continuously for about five to seven minutes then we're gonna turn off the heat completely and slowly add the butter until it melts finally we'll put it in a bowl and cover with a piece of plastic put it in the refrigerator for at least two hours okay guys so our dough is ready remember you need to refrigerate this for two hours but you can actually do both the dough and the curd up to three days in advance but what we're gonna do is we're gonna roll out our dough I've got a little bit of all-purpose flour here as well so you can see that we're just gonna dust our board with a little bit of flour just to prevent it from sticking and we'll dust our rolling pin with a little bit of flour and we are gonna roll this out just enough to fit into our pie dish so here we are and I've got these extra pieces you really need to just use your hands to get the edges it's not gonna be a pretty crust but I promise you it tastes so good okay so here we go we're gonna put this in the oven at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes just until the crust is golden brown okay so we are ready to go our pie crust is ready I've allowed it to cool for a little while just to make sure that it doesn't melt our lemon curd our lemon curd I've taken out of the refrigerator so you remember that we put a piece of plastic here just so we wouldn't create sort of like a skin and we're just gonna whip this now just to get a nice thick consistency this is so good like literally it smells like cookie and butter and lemon and then we're gonna go ahead and pour that right into our high so this goes back into the refrigerator just to set we're going to add a little bit of lemon zest right on top for that extra punch of lemon flavor and I'm gonna show you guys how to plate this up I've got a few quick tips to making a great cheese board number one mix up your cheeses soft semi soft hard cheeses goat cow and sheep's milk cheeses number two make sure you have some fun things on your cheese board we've got dried fruit nuts a variety of crackers and number three bring your cheese out 45 minutes to 60 minutes before your guests arrive bring the cheese up to room temperature it's gonna taste that much better enjoy alright guys so I've got a couple really great drink recipes I don't know about you but it's a little bit of warmth and sunshine has got me full into spring fever so these are my two favorite recipes for drinks for spring and summer I want to show you the first one it's a frozen mimosa so it's a little bit of a twist on a froze a but also kind of like a mimosa I'm gonna predict this is gonna be the newest drink for summer so we're going to start with sherbert we've got a rainbow sherbert here you can also just use orange so for those of you that always want to know what is the difference we'd like a sorbet and a sugar sherbert actually has dairy in it so sorbet is completely dairy-free it's just made with fruit juice and sugar and it's frozen but this actually does have a little bit of dairy in it so it gives it that smooth consistency so I'm gonna put about four scoops because we're looking for two cups okay so you've got our server and then we're gonna add right in there some frozen mango so the great thing about the sherbert and the mango is that it's really nice and cold and we don't have to add any ice into this it's gonna make our drink frozen without adding all the extra water so the next ingredient we're going to add is fresh tangerine juice you can use orange juice but if you can find tangerine it's just that much better so we'll add that don't worry these recipes are in the description for today okay so now we're going to give this a blend you put this in your blender you want to start off slow and then take the speed up a little bit [Music] all right so we are perfect this is almost like a slushy smoothie consistency I'm gonna add some champagne some rose a champagne right in about a half a bottle and then I'm gonna give it a stir I'm not gonna turn the blender back on I'm just gonna give this a stir and that is it you are ready to go we're gonna pour these into our glasses check it out such a beautiful color and it does have that little bit of sparkle from the champagne plus all the flavors from the mango and the sherbert and the tangerine juice so you can garnish this with some fresh mint there you go we're calling this van throws a mimosa all right so up next we're going to be making a summer sangria so easy let me show you guys all right so we're gonna start with the carafe I filled it with some ice this isn't so easy first let's add our liqueurs so we have both orange and peach flavored liqueur I'm going to add a little bit so it smells so good you love the peaches so we're going to use a combination of fresh and frozen fruit because this drink is really spring going into summer right now the peaches that I have are frozen and they're delicious once you get a little bit further into summer you can probably find these fresh really nice but we're gonna add some frozen peaches and we're gonna add some fresh cantaloupe melons [Music] and then we're gonna add our citrus so we're gonna do some lemons and some oranges I'm gonna slice it and then order it back so we'll go ahead and do the same thing with our orange just add a few little wedges in there the great thing about sangria is that it almost tastes better the longer you allow it to like really sit with itself so if you want to make this the day before you're having some friends coming over just let it kind of hang out in the refrigerator overnight it's gonna be that much better so now we're going to add some white wine you can choose like a standard solving young blonde or Pinot Grigio whatever your favorite white wine is fill it up the rest of the way just like that you are good to go so right here we're going to take this one and put this in the refrigerator overnight just a couple of hours works fine too and we'll come back and pour this into our glass all right so like I said I'm pretty impatient I'm gonna go ahead and taste this now you can put this in the fridge overnight or a couple of hours we're gonna go ahead and pour this right into our glass and it's great if you get you know some bits of the fruit in there and then another thing that I really love you can find these online are these really cool metal straws they're just really fun and go ahead and these are so yummy I hope you guys love these white sangria and band mimosa froze a alright now take a look at this week's conversations with Christian I do this and I don't know all the words [Music] [Music] do you need drinks I just won thanks so much for tuning in today's episode it's been so much fun making these shows and getting all this wonderful feedback from you guys so I want to check and see the questions that we've been getting so Rachel PS 21 sent me a message on Instagram and she wants to know what is my favorite pan for heating things on top of the stove and then going into the oven and I make such a big deal about this we've only had a few episodes but even when I'm watching it I can see I'm always telling you guys your pan should be really really hot so I love cast iron and the brand that I use is called Lodge it's just really great it's not too expensive and it's perfect for heating your pan up really hot and you can cook on top of the stove and go right into the oven okay so my next question is from Eric Kelly life in Brooklyn and he wants to know if I really make this food at home or is this something that I just make on the show and the truth is that obviously I make more of these things for the show for you guys but I absolutely cook at home I would say at least four days a week which i think is a lot and then just like every other New Yorker I love to eat out so about four days a week I really do cook at home and I really enjoy it alright guys thanks so much for tuning in this week remember to tune in next week we have a very special episode I'm gonna be heading out west and I'm gonna take you guys on my adventures with some meetings and some fun stuff so I think you guys are gonna enjoy this one keep sending me your questions you can send them to me on my Instagram page at Vanessa con table or right here on the show page in the comment section thanks for watching see you next week bye [Music] you [Music]", "opGOAlIowgg": "[Music] okay green thumbs welcome back to my Channel today I'm going to show you how to clone a lemon tree your favorite lemon tree now my favorite is just over there and it is blooming but you need to do this before it fruits so here's what you do you choose the freshest happiest ones and preferably no thorns that is about one and a half hand spans tall I'm going to get rid of the leaves on the bottom snip them off like so all gone so about that much of it is gone and then going to put a nice little 45-degree cut in there so I've got my cutting like that and I've taken off the bottom leaves like so you know the remaining leaves all you got to do just snip them in half yeah looks brutal but trust me it's actually good for it it'll encourage more vegetative growth and will prevent stress and those leaves so that they don't have to try and get nutrients all the way up to there and then sweat out the fluids at night so all that water retention is going to come in handy because we've got no roots on this yet so just snip leaves in half like so just get the Crown's of the leads off [Music] and there we have it so we've started off with something similar to that we've got something like this now what to do once you've got that what do I do because I'm a lazy gardener I get a pot plant that's already got something growing in it and then in one corner I just poke it down like so you're gonna tap down give that a water and watch that come to life so that's pretty easy I'm gonna show you one that I did previously so there's the there's a chili plant with some weeds growing in the bottom that's how lazy I am and all I did was just poke this thing now you'll notice the top leaves have been shaved off but this thing has now got a root system now I planted this about three months ago so if it hasn't dried out in three months it's in good Nick now let's just have a quick look down the bottom oh yeah that's that's that's in good Nick that oh yeah that's not coming out that's very solid so when I'm ready to relocate that I will get that out of the pot but then the new pot or put it in the ground somewhere and away it goes so that's how you turn your cuttings into plants easy as all right thanks for watching I hope you guys enjoyed it don't forget if you got any questions or comments leave it at the bottom of the video give us a thumbs up or a like and I will see you guys on the next one and as always mayor your trees before thanks for watching okay viewers that's me for another video now you'll notice that there's no advertising on my

your host, Matt Taylor. Today, I'm going to show you \nhow to make candied citrus peel, in this case, \ncandied orange peel. Did you know that you can eat \nthe people of your orange or lemon or grapefruit\nmost of the time? You probably peel that orange \nand then throw it away. From now on, \ndon't throw it away. You can make a\ntree out of the peel. Isn't that awesome? It's really easy to do. If I can do it, you can do it \nbefore I move on, make sure to subscribe to my channel and hit \nthat notification belt so you won't miss out on\nany of my new videos. Let's get started. And down below and \nthe description, you'll find a list of the ingredients \nand the amounts. But it's going to be pretty \neasy to remember this. And this method works with \nwhatever citrus that you want to use. Like I mentioned in this case, \nI'm going to be using oranges and I washed my\noranges and these were fresh. I just barely picked them off \nthe tree a little while ago. And we want to peel\nthese funny enough right now. We want to peel them and you \ncan use whatever you want to use to peel them. I just kind of come in here. My little wedges out of it just \nmakes it a lot easier. However, you want to \npeel them, just use that method, OK, and try to \nkeep the peeling as much and intact as possible. All right. And then I'm going to\nsave that and eat that orange. And then we're just going to \ncome in here and cut these into strips. OK, and we'll keep him kind\nof the same size, close to the same size. You can't just eat the pill as \nis typically the orange peel, lemon peel, grapefruit peel, lime peel. They are a little bit too too \nbitter to eat the way they are. So we need to cook \nout that bitterness. Oh, right. So I have my orange peel cut \nand slice into little pieces and now we'll just take these. And put them inside this pot \nhere and then we want to add some water so that\nwe can boil this in. And let's take this\nover to the stove top. All right, I have this pot with \nwater now, three cups of water in my sauce, pot with \nthe orange peel. And we want to\nbring this to a boil. And once the water starts \nto boil, it won't take long with that amount of water. Once the water starts to boil. We want to boil these\nfor about eight to 10 minutes. And that's going to take away \nthat bitterness and also soften up these peels. And I want to note that I am \nusing filtered water because my tap water tastes gross and you \ncan just come in here and occasionally stir the peels. All right, after about \n10 minutes, I'm going to get rid of this water and put in \nsome new water, so I'll just put this in my calendar. And after a dream, I\nwill add in more water. And then I will replace the \norange peels back in there. And if you were to taste one \nof these, there's still a little bit of bitterness \nto it. And so I'm going to just repeat \nthe process and will take that away, if you like, \na little bit of bitter, then you can leave it as is and \njust go on to the next step and skip this repeat step. Again, what we'll do is we will \nonce it comes to a boil, we'll let it cook for \nanother eight, 10 minutes and you can go up even \nhigher than that. 12 to 15 minutes. Oh, right. Time is up. I'm agreeing to remove this \nfrom the heat and drain it. And then now I'm going to add about a cup of water and we're \ngoing to just turn that heat down to medium. And we want to make \na simple syrup. So equal parts water to sugar. One cup. Of water to one cup\nof sugar, again, I'm using. Filtered water, so let's bring \nthis to a boil so that water can dissolve that sugar. All right. And once that sugar\nwater comes to a boil. I'm just going to let\nit boil for about a minute. And that's going to ensure that \nthat sugar has dissolved. Or after about that minute, \nI'm going to turn the heat down to low and add in \nthose orange peels. To that sugar water, and then \nwe are going to let this simmer low, medium, low heat \nfor forty five minutes to an hour and 15 minutes and just \ndepends on the size of your orange peels. And eventually, a lot of the \nwater will evaporate from the simmering process and you'll be \nleft with this awesome syrup. And. What you'll see is I don't know \nif you can see this on camera, but the orange peel looks \na little translucent. You'll be able to see\nit in person for sure. And these are ready to go now. And what I want to do is I'm \ngoing to remove the orange peel from the syrup. Don't throw the syrup away. This is a wonderfully flavored \nsyrup that you can use in a variety of things. You can use it in a drink if \nyou want, or you can add like strawberries to it and make a \nnice strawberry syrup that you can put on pancakes or \nsomething like that. But just don't throw\nit away because you spent time making it. You might as well use it. Also, that water that we used \nwhen we boiled the the the peel, when we boil to peel \nin that water, you can save that water also and use\nthat in drinks and whatnot. Brett, extra flavor also, I want\nto point out, if you want it to Candy, a little \nquicker than you could do, a ratio of two to one, two cups \nof sugar to one cup of water. But if you don't want to use as \nmuch sugar in a liquid, then do a one to one ratio. And then what I'll do is I'll \ncome in here and grab these. I'm going to put\nthem on this wire rack. So I'll just use a. Spatula or like a \nspider ladle, and we want to put these on a wire, Iraq\nand I have a sheet pan here, we want to make sure\nthat they are not sticking. All right. And then the syrup that I'm \nleft with, I'm going to save that once again. Don't throw it away \nbecause it's awesome. And then I'm going to let these \nsit and dry for about an hour. And then after they have sat \nfor a while, I'm going to grab them with clean hands. They'll be tacky and then roll \nthem in your sugar. Like that, put him back \non the rack. And you don't have\nto roll them in sugar. You could depend \non chocolate also. Or just let them dry completely \nwithout rolling them and sugar and have them like that once \nyou are done rolling them in sugar. We will just let them dry on \nthe wire racks here for four to six hours. And once they are done drying \nfor that four to six hours, you can store them in a \nairtight container in a cool, dry place, and they will be \nthere will last for at least a couple of weeks,\nup to a month. Pretty awesome. You want a taste here? Yeah. Mm hmm. So good, so good. And that is how you make \ncandied orange peel and then you follow the same steps with \nwhatever citrus peel you want to use. Really easy to do. Simple ingredients, if I \ncan do it. You can do it. I'm Matt Taylor. This has been another episode \nof In the Kitchen with Matt. Thank you for joining \nme as always. If you have any questions, \ncomments or requests, put him down below and I'll get back to \nyou as soon as I can. Thumbs up down the corner. Push it. Don't forget to subscribe to my \nchannel and check out my other videos. Take care. Time for me to\ndive into one of these. Oh, yeah. Mm hmm. Uh. Rehame.

far so good it's ah May right now so hopefully it grows bigger um for some reason this is a peach tree that we got for some reason all the leaves are gone then we think answer taking the leaves I'm not sure because we have two couple trees and the leaves are there in the morning and then when we come home for work there's no more please and then we have these ants right here so we think they're eating the leaves you know please let me know we got these at this lemon tree at the same time we got the Satsuma and it has tons of lemons on it didn't even have all these on it when we got it and as soon as we planted it it would just got them like crazy it just grows so good not sure why it has so many in the country doesn't this is my first time with these and there's a lot of some that just turned yellow and died off so look at all those buds so we also got some jackfruit seeds and we planted them over here so hopefully they will grow thank you", "UJCNKIFJiKU": "[Music] to get started I will be using three lemons I will also be using local honey now this next ingredient is optional but I have some fresh ginger that needs to be used before it dries out so I'm going to add it but again just with the lemons and the honey can make this preserve and another tip I am actually using lemons that were given to me from a friend's tree so these are pretty organic they do not have wax on them but I did trim off some blemishes that I might need to do as well later but if you're using store-bought lemons you want to make sure you give them a good rinse and the scrub with maybe some sea salt or kosher salt to remove any of the wax that's on the lemons so now all I'm going to be doing is slicing my lemons and ginger [Music] okay so now that all of my lemon and ginger slice I am going to be using a twelve ounce mason jar and now I am simply going to layer the lemons with honey and ginger and by the way this is a sterilized jar that I boiled in hot water with the lid you want to make sure you're working with clean hands clean jar and I'm actually going to be using a very clean spoon to push down some of the lemons into the honey later but ultimately all you're doing is just layering your honey and lemons and of course I'm adding ginger which is really good in this type of preserve but if you don't have that you don't have to use it just with the lemon and honey very simple and very beneficial to your health so here we go [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in total I use probably around a cup to a cup and a half of honey and I actually managed to squeeze all the lemon slices in but you don't have to fill it to the top I just did not want this to go to waste but here it is and I will store this in my fridge for at least two days to allow it to marry together and this jar will last up to a month in the refrigerator quite honestly it only last me about two weeks because I love to have a cup every day and this is how I do it I take one cup of boiling hot water and then I just add a couple of slices of the lemon with a couple of tablespoons of the liquid that the lemon and the honey create in the jar and it is delicious and it's so good for you and as always the ingredients and measurements will be listed in the description box below [Music] I hope you give this recipe a try I hope you like it and thanks for watching [Music] hey guys you can click on the

I knew you would try to see it is she ugly or something she's as beautiful as an angel I just don't want you planning our wedding yet when can I meet her when she's officially my girlfriend what does that even mean officially haven't you kissed her yeah we kissed doesn't make her my girlfriend I still have to ask her I do not understand these dating rules just make it quick I'm dying to meet her there's a threat level increased yes she's gone from not only posting pictures of us at public events but she has started taking pictures of everyone in their everyday lives check this out this is Porter walking to class last week and just a few days ago she posted a picture of Anson leaving the grocery store are you sure these weren't taken last year dad look at Anson sunburn this is current I really think we need professional help yeah I agree I'll give Dave a call Dave the guy he arrested me on Halloween your hands you know he's not a real cop right yeah but he's taking online classes hey Dave it's not a night I'm gonna ask when to be my girlfriend and I got her something special that I know she'll love it back of the day guys would give their fraternity pin to a girl to show that she was his girlfriend I'm not actually in a fraternity but I know Boyd loves old-fashioned stuff as much as I do you know my mom's really excited to meet you actually the whole family is I'd love to meet them uh-huh do you know that it's like 11 of them right how bad can it be well the whole family will break into song or dance at some point they'll start a hundred different conversations and finished none of them and my mom goes a little crazy when one of her boys has a girlfriend is that what I am I mean I know we haven't dated that long and we just barely had our first kiss but I like you and I like where this is going Gwyn will you do me the honor of consenting to be my girlfriend yes I got you this old fashioned pin you're giving me your pin it's not my pin I'm not in a fraternity but it will help you think of me I love it [Music] guess I have a date later today which I'm kind of nervous about I mean she's a cute girl but my last four dates were such a disaster that I might rather just stay single forever I guess they would have gone better if I hadn't schedule them 50 minutes apart but Ari said this one up and her methods have no semblance of a scientific approach I just can't see how this kind of willy-nilly dating could possibly lead to a positive outcome I'm glad the spring goes in it hit us while we were swinging hey you're wearing my PIN then so I'm gonna see you tonight okay bye go any penny gave one your PIN so when do I get to meet her you were listening I couldn't help it over here dinner tomorrow night I guess just promise me you won't talk about weddings I'm not promising anything okay here's what we know she's a good artist she has been to some of our events and she wants to marry one of the brothers are we sure he's even a she and not a heat well in the drawings she is depicted as a girl so we can assume that she is a she with reddish brownish hair also based on the location of the photos we know that she either lives in the area or frequents the area so you think it's someone we've seen before probably but I don't think we would recognize her can you guys think of anyone you may have seen that fits the description of the stalker there was that one girl from the frozen yogurt ate Lindsay yeah and she would definitely have reason for revenge except I haven't seen her anywhere but on that date there is that fan club of Anton's it could be one of them don't they live an hour away true but they can probably drive by now and who wouldn't drive an hour for a piece of this look we don't know if lemon squeezy is a threat or not we just need to take precautions that she might be so that's why I invited Dave over here to give us some safety pointers he was a fake cop thank you folks this is textbook stalker behavior in my internet safety for online police class I've learned a few valuable things number one never divulge your location be don't post about your plans and finally don't tag your whereabouts stalkers can be identified in about mmm four different ways binoculars oversized camera lens shifty eyes or trees that's what I'm going undercover I'm sorry what I insist Dave you really I need this for my final so just let me do it and that's why none of you are allowed to go anywhere alone and you need to make sure your location tracking is on seriously what am i three oh right you're exempt because you're still grounded all right think that's as good as it's gonna get what if she doesn't recognize me us was recognized her just a gator profile more time I'll be fine wait a second this girl looks kind of like the stalker what you're going on the date with a stalker absolutely not I'm sure she's not the stalker besides the biggest threat that the stalker poses that she might marry one of the boys and seeing as we don't live in Las Vegas dad I can't happen overnight is your location tracking turned on yes you want to come with a date with me dad that's actually good well that date went better than expected conversation was good I talked to her about my research project and she actually understood me the only bad part was that Dave the fake cop was following us the whole time and not sort of screed Lee I guess he hasn't taken the online classes on trailing suspects yet anyway I'll probably take her out again she's pretty cool maybe I'll take her out after the whole stalker thing is blown over so we can actually go somewhere without supervision I think I found her date no no she checks out I filed her home not her dog but she wasn't an area we're targeting oh so from my assignment for class we had to search somebody up on social media naturally I chose lemon squeezy I looked around for hours but I finally found photo that she's tagged in on insta I don't have a name yet but I'm back seeing over the photo hi [Music] hey guys thank you for watching season one of our house be sure to follow us on Instagram so you can get all the updates as we work towards season two stay tuned it's gonna

"K_Nz_ahS4ag": "looking for something to do with all that leftover citrus peel that you end up with when you make a citrus salad make candied citrus peel I'm starting from scratch but you should definitely do this anytime you peel a citrus cut the peel and pith from any citrus that you want when you're removing the peel you're going to end up with a little bit of the fruit you'll probably want to remove that before you blanch your citrus peels so remove all of the peel first and then you can go back in and cut that off you can leave a little bit of the pith on that actually adds a little bit of heft to the pieces of citrus once they're cooked so you don't need to remove all of it then you can cut the peel into whatever width you want I'm going to do about a quarter of an inch wide this recipe calls for the peel of two grapefruits two oranges and two lemons I would say about three or four cups of peel all together I have a pot of boiling water over here and I want to cook this until some of the bitterness goes away and it gets tender so just add your peel to the boiling water and then let it simmer for about five or ten minutes it needs to get tender and some of the bitterness will go away so now this has been simmering for about ten minutes everything is tender strain them or drain them and put them on a wire rack just to dry out a little bit it really doesn't matter because you're going to put them back into a liquid very soon and now make a sugar syrup you need a cup of granulated sugar and a cup of water to make your syrup this syrup is going to be flavored by the citrus peel and will be great in drinks like a little bit in some vodka or in your lemonade instead of sugar delicious now that it's simmering add your zest and then you want to simmer this for about ten minutes the zest will get infused with the sugar and the syrup will reduced just slightly and get a little bit thicker okay this is simmering and you just want to turn it down and cook it at a simmer for about ten minutes when it's simmered and reduced a little bit you can see that the peel is now translucent and kind of jewel-like and that's exactly what you're looking for put it right back on to the rack and let it drain what you want is for this to dry out and get a little bit tacky so that the sugar will adhere when you roll it in the sugar so let it sit for about one hour now all that's left to do is toss your candied zest in sugar if you wanted to take this and then dip in chocolate you could take a little bit of chocolate and dip maybe one end in there so just keep rolling in sugar a great little treat a great gift so delicious and a fantastic and thrifty way to use up all of that extra peel you have lying around you Oh", "imlampOUZ0g": "capacity 34 ounces

can actually pick fruit from it trees guys so anyway today I'm gonna be showing you guys how you can actually get all of the fruits in its site of roblox Skyblock following these simple steps okay so in it this brand new update just released now there's a couple of things in this update that you guys might want to know about so I'm gonna be going over that right now so right here it actually says update log on June 26 they said the Edit fruit trees each player has a native / unique to their Island okay then they said autocrat food with the new food processor so now there's also a new food processor crystal ice gold selling food to the baker is now much more profitable finally and then they said I am some longer collided with each other blah blah blah blah okay guys but anyway we are here inside of the server and okay inside of these new things you guys can see here these new trees now you guys can buy the machine for the avocado tree inside of the hub over here but you guys are probably wondering like wait why can't I get any other thing there's only avocado here I want apples I want oranges I want lemons I want all of the fruit okay so guys in this video I'm gonna be showing you guys how you guys can get all of them okay all of them alright so if you guys actually want to go over here and you guys can see we actually have a lemon tree so a lemon tree was my original like fruit for my island so each island actually has their own fruit like you guys will like get rewarded a fruit inside of your inventories absolutely for free mine was a lemon tree okay so I believe all of the fruit does sell the same but also you guys can buy the avocado tree inside of the shop over there but then we should all have apples and oranges left so if you guys are wondering how you guys can actually do this okay I'm just giving you guys a little details about this and that how you guys can get it each person has their own fruits okay guys so if I were you guys and you guys wanted to get the other fruits I would have first of all if you guys do want to just trade up she like straight up trade always the video just you know say hey bro I'll give you my lemon sapling for your apple sapling and I can we can do it from there you guys can find people inside of the sky block discord server order by even joining public and you guys can trade from them there because guys they are they even said inside of the changelog that you guys have to get these fruits by trading so guys I'm gonna go ahead and show you guys a little bit more of this I'm gonna go in and go to a public server right now so we can go ahead and do some training so you guys can see I'm inside of a public server now and I'm going to see I'm actually gonna look to other people's bases I personally like my lemon Sheree I'm not going to give it away but this is like for an example of how you guys would actually do this so yeah I'm gonna say uh anyone have apple tree or orange tree question mark guys literally today I figured out that orange juice grew from trees so that is actually very very interesting but anyway when people actually invite you to their Island or you know if you invite people to your Island you guys can do those trades there okay it's this guy said I have an apple tree I'm gonna say can you invite me to your Island now guys you don't have to trade your tree for it you can also trade items for it as well or even money inside a Skype look like for example I would buy like a tree off somebody I mean I don't really know what's a good price of them because I haven't sold them yet but honestly let's go ahead and see how much the lemon sells for lemon sells for 20 coins okay alright so it's not bad it's not bad but I'm gonna go ahead and go to this person's Islands here I'm gonna see what they have I'm gonna say what to tree do it you have so if you guys like don't know like the game automatically rewards you a treaty or inventory because each island has their own okay and literally all you have to do by getting this is like wait I'm gonna ask him I'm gonna say what tree do you have he said he's new so I'm gonna ask him what tree do you have and he said I just joined your game oh my gosh well then we might as well drop me in Sri you might as well okay he said I don't have what way he should have well I don't know why I got a sad one everyone got rewarded a tree so anyway let's go to this person space they said that they have an apple tree and you guys could see what the apple tree looks like right here I'm gonna say I'll give you at 90 K for it oh my goodness guys I don't really know if that's even a good price probably not but I mean this is like the only way you guys can get apple trees orange trees or the lemon trees is from it trading you cannot buy them inside of the shop that's all they said sorry I just got it it's completely understandable so guys these items are actually to be quite rare and I cannot wait to see how many people actually get trees so anyway guys that's basically going to wrap up the video there all you have to do is like trade these things but guys do not get scammed with these because you can only get these things from a player's guys so you cannot buy them in the shop at all so I just want to tell you guys that to save your trees I would wait a little bit longer do not like make any trades just yet unless you see like a really really good trade ok but I mean personally I would not sell my tree for more than a hundred thousand or no for less than a hundred thousand because I do know that these streets are gonna be quite rare cuz only there's only one per person inside a sky block so I mean yeah anyway guys that's basically it so if you guys go ahead and trade these things up you guys will eventually get them if you have millions of coins in sky and sky block you can get these things easily you could just go up to new players and just say yo I'll give you a hundred thousand for your apple tree or you know your other tree orange tree whatever and then they'll give it to you probably because you know hundred thousand coins and you're starting out is really really good so if I were you guys I would go for the starter players because that would give them a nice like coin boost and also you could probably get them you know I'm though I don't want to call it it's not really scamming because you're literally giving them a huge boost when it you're like when you're first starting out guys in game a hundred thousand coins will literally get you guys a ton of stuff so I mean I really call out scamming but anyway what are they gonna do sell their lemon for 20 coins I mean they're making a ton more from your 100000 than they would have the whole entire tree itself so anyway that's what I would do guys cuz it makes the most sense go to the new newer players and just say yo dude I'll give you huge money boost for your tree that's what I would do personally because they're not even gonna make it more than a hundred thousand per their tree so anyway if that makes sense guys let me know in the comments down below but yeah guys anyway basically how you guys collect all the fruit is you guys just have like a ton of coins or you know you can even trade like washers or stuff like that rate your fish for those trees so yeah guys anyway let me know in the comment section down below of this video did help you make sure you drop a like make sure I subscribe to the channel and it's infusion or RBX glitches and I'll see you guys on the next video peace out and good bye", "JpObwXPwjPA": "hi I'm Joan and this is Leslie and we're with main snap-ed today we're in our local grocery store to talk about fresh frozen and canned fruits and vegetables so Leslie we have a beautiful array of citrus here can you tell me about some of the different varieties sure we actually have some clementines a grapefruit some limes and lemons and then tangerine and your traditional orange so my kids love to snack on clementines what's the difference between this and a tangerine so a tangerine is a little bit larger than a Clementine and it also has seeds so it's not really a great option for small kids clementines are a lot easier to peel and great for packing and lunches and how about you know in terms of what's good for you and what's not or any of these better nutritionally than others nope all citrus fruit is high in vitamin C so my advice is actually to vary what you eat so one week you can pack clementines the next week you can slice oranges or you can have grapefruit I would be cautious packing lemons in your kids lunches so now how do I tell if they're ripe am i looking for the darkness of the skin the smoothness like what am I looking for you're actually looking by weight so take two of the same size fruit so we have some tangerines and you're actually gonna see which one's heavier oh yeah this one all right and that's how you tell if citrus fruit is right so we're in Maine we don't grow citrus obviously I love a good deal and a good sale when are these on sale usually when are they in season somewhere sure so in Maine you can actually see the price for citrus dropped right after the holidays the first of the year is when citrus makes its way up to Maine and goes on sale when it's not you know the offseason or the summer months you can actually buy citrus in canned or jarred and you want it in a hundred percent fruit juice so well thanks for those great tips on citrus absolutely for more tips on healthy eating on a budget follow Maine snap-ed on Facebook you", "xm7j0NjymHY": "hey guys how's it going so I'm up here in the front Sun porch and I want to give you an update on our citrus plants because I've got three of them up here they're doing really well starting with this Meyer lemon this one I had a couple more lemons on the front of it I posted a picture on Instagram and Facebook just recently and so you could see the extra fruit but they were ready to harvest and I've been waiting patiently for these fruit to ripen so I harvested those you can see a couple more down here and they're starting to feel a little bit softer like they might be close to ready to pick there's another one on this branch down here and then there are five more toward the back which are just working on coloring up right now then I've got a lime tree I just counted eight lines on here we've got the first one right up top there's another one down here this one is feeling really good and the smell like just even when I touch these limes the smell is so intense that I can smell on my hands for a while afterward here's a third one that one's feeling pretty nice there's three on this branch a very productive branch here and then I've got two more right here oh and I just noticed there's a little bud do you see that I haven't even looked on this plant four flower buds but that's exciting and then in the back here oh and there's buds on this one two buds on the lemon right here I've got another lemon tree this is called a pink lemonade lemon I have never tried one of these like I've never tasted one but I've seen them for sale in the grocery store I chose this plant because it's pretty I mean the leaves are just gorgeous look at the colors it looks like green camo so there's like three different colors of green and then cream around the edges and I just thought it had such a beautiful soft appearance to it and then the fruits gorgeous so yellow with green striping and this one is clearly very happy because it's been blooming and it's setting new little fruits oh there's one there one here and you can look all over there are little fruit and there's a whole bunch more buds which is so exciting that they love this spot so much so I really wanted to show this one like the most because I showed it to you in a video this summer it was all about how to have success with containerized citrus plants and i repotted this meyer lemon into this pot in that video and I said I'd give you an update so this is the update at this point and I wanted to talk specifically about what I've done to get these plants to this point if you are interested in growing citrus in containers I would recommend that you watch that first video because it is loaded with details not things that I necessarily want to talk all about in this video so anyway we will link that down below so I do want to go over basics first of all repotting and what kind of pots you choose and soil so you can see I have most everything in terracotta I prefer that I think plants prefer that as well because it's a porous material oxygen can go in and out through the sides of the pots and it keeps the roots of the plants really happy in the case of using terracotta with citrus I just used regular as FOMA organic potting mix because I feel like the ratio of like moisture retention with the exchange of oxygen is really good it has a really good relationship with each other you can see like I pot most everything in terracotta I've got the Eugenia topiaries in here in terracotta as well if you're choosing plastic which are definitely lighter weight easier to move in and out if that's something that you're doing I would use the Islamic actus mix because it helps facilitate drainage facilitate water movement citrus don't like to be sitting in water for a really long time plastic retains more moisture so I feel like that's a really good blend the plastic with the Catholics cactus mix also when I repotted with my fresh potting mix I did add in a fertilizer so I did a slow release rather than a liquid I use the citrus tone I like this method better because it's a slow feed to the roots of your plants and you don't have to do it as often the liquid type which is available for citrus it's just more of a quick shot of nutrients and you have to do it a little bit more often like every couple of weeks I think it is as opposed to two or three times in an entire year so I put some of this in the pot when I repotted I'm going to be feeding these again probably about February again in June and then probably again in the fall so that'll be my third application if you live somewhere that it's mild outside and you don't have to bring them inside necessarily I don't think I would do the fall application of fertilizer because it will push it'll help push extra foliar growth like you can see new growth on this lemon right here and you don't necessarily want that if they're going to be in a position where they could receive colder temperatures because this tender was tender new growth is much more susceptible to winter damage and the next thing is watering you can see that the moisture level on top of this lime tree is fairly damp still i watered a day before yesterday I think for citrus you just want to make sure that you don't keep them too waterlogged you want to make sure like the top inch or so of soil has dried out between waterings and it will be different for everybody it'll be different depending on if they're outside inside how much wind they're getting if you have a small floor heater running near them which I do when it gets really cold and that dries them out quicker it depends on what type of pot you use what type of soil so you just have to kind of learn like you learn over time what that specific plant will need and I know I have to come out here into the Sun porch about once a week to give them a little bit of water and the last thing actually the second to last thing I wanted to talk about was kind of environmental stuff so temperature how I transition mind from inside to outside so first off we are in a Sun porch that's hooked to the south side of our house it's unheated it does absorb a lot of heat during the day if the Sun is out it's overcast today but it retains quite a bit of heat usually we have colder winters than we have this year we've gotten really lucky so I left my my citrus in here this is actually going to be my transition spot I was going to move them from outside to here because this emulates a little bit of inside and then I was gonna put them in like to the inside of our house where it's a lot warmer but it's been warm enough to just leave them out here and I think that they're so much happier because it doesn't get so hot and it's not as dry as it is inside and I think that's why a lot of citrus plants do foliate they tend to not want to be moved anyway so you might get a little bit of leaf drop when you initially move them anywhere even if you're moving them from one spot outside to another spot outside they might drop a little a few leaves but typically when I move them like if you were to move them straight from outside right to the inside you might experience quite a bit of leaf drop and I think that's totally normal but when you have a transition spot it eliminates a little bit of that so if you can emulate something like this I think it's really really nice because you know these plants we're forcing houseplants to be to do something they don't do citrus plants ferns you genius they're all native somewhere they want to be growing outside with the conditions that they like and here we are putting them in pots and making them do something that they don't normally want to do so it can be a little bit stressful especially when you move them inside when they're outside for the summer they do really really well so if that's something you can plan on doing keeping them outside when it's nice and then bringing him in that's the best thing to do sometimes like in our old house we didn't have as many opportunities like I didn't have a room that was so bright I didn't have a place that was you know like halfway between outside temperatures and inside so my citrus they just struggled through the winter and I tried to give them as much light as I could and you know they'd struggle and then the second I put them outside in April usually end of April beginning of May they would start to flourish again so don't get too discouraged if you can't emulate you know quite what they need you just want to find a spot that is as bright as possible as much light as you can give them inside the better if you have to provide supplemental lighting do that you know grow lights there's clamp lights you can point straight out their foliage if you want there's pendant lights you can drop down or just a really tall grow light system there are like ballasts you can hang from the ceiling they also prefer a little bit cooler spot so don't put it right next to a heat register or in a room that stays you know really warm like we have a room at the fireplace that one naturally stays a lot warmer when when we're burning fires so if you can find a spot that gets a lot of light that's a little cooler that's the best also make sure that there's some kind of air circulation that helps keep populations of insects down especially like spider mites so make sure that there's a fan going nearby so anyway that's kind of my tips on that I'm gonna be watching these throughout this winter if the weather turns for the worse I might have to move them inside but for the time being I've got this little heater here and I just set it on usually I have it on max right now just so it was warm enough for us but usually I have it set about right there and it only pops on when it gets down to a certain temperature and it got down to 9 degrees this fall outside and I just had that on in here it took the edge off and they all lived through that night really well and we haven't been that cold since that night I mean I guess another option would be to construct some kind of greenhouse if you if that's something that you wanted to do if you can position it in a spot that gets a nice Sun that's protected like south side of your house is the best for those types of things because I typically get the most amount of sunshine plus their snugged up next to a structure that can kind of protect them for more wind but again you may have to run some kind of a heater I know like these right here probably would not be happy in our bigger cold friend because we don't heat that at all and it's too big of a space to try to heat just for a few plants so maybe a smaller greenhouse structure would be better because you could maybe regulate temperature a little bit better anyway the last thing I wanted to talk about was pollination because obviously right now there's not a lot of pollinators out we don't have butterflies or honeybees rolling around and there's not a lot of airflow there is air flow in here but there's not like wind and a lot of pollination happens either from stronger winds outside breezes or from pollinators so inside you want to give them a little bit of help so you can use a paintbrush or a q-tip and we're just going to do a little hand pollination on this lemon tree over here so we've got a bloom right here and you can see there's a couple different parts that you want to be mindful of the part in the center right here that's called a stigma you can see like that more like bold spot right in the center that is where the part of the flower that accepts the pollen and starts the reproductive process and then these parts on the outside these are called stamens and so you can see like little filaments holding up and what's called anthers and the anthers are just little sacs of pollen that you want to just rough that pollen up on your brush make sure it gets you know put on the stigma as well and then we're just going to go from flower to flower and do that and you want to do this often I mean this is what honeybees are doing and butterflies and things like that that are moving around our plants in the summertime they're just basically going from flower to flower and delivering pollen and that's what helps our fruit set now this plant though isn't really having a huge problem setting fruit because I'm seeing you know little fruit that have formed since they have been in here but your crop will be much better if you can do a little bit of hand pollination like this these are all self fertile varieties most citrus are there are a few ready that aren't so just check the tag self-fruitful varieties means that you don't have to have multiple varieties of a plant in order to get fruit like I could just have this lemon tree right here and I think this himself I'll have to double check but most of them you just need the one plant and they'll still produce fruit you don't need to have multiple plants but that's something to definitely read up on the tag about I can't remember on this one so anyway I think that was all the points I really wanted to cover he just the basic spotting and watering fertilizing hand pollinating I hope this video was helpful to those of you guys who maybe have thought about trying to do this just seeing some of the things that we do and the success level work having so anyway thank you guys so much for watching this video and we will see you in the next one bye", "3PGS4TB74yw": "Are citrus fruits good for constipation? Yes, they are! Although with one caveat All citrus fruits are good for constipation? Because it is clear that oranges and tangerines\nare good for constipation But what about lemons? Are lemons good for constipation? They don\u2019t! Indeed they encourage it, because lemons are\nastringent fruits When it comes to eating citrus fruits, do\ncitrus juices have the same effect on constipation? Not at all! They do not have the same effect What has a better effect to combat the constipation\nis to eat the whole citric fruit, of course peeled, but with the segments and the fiber\nthat that fruit has Why? Because this fiber has lignin, and the citric\ncontains many organic acids And these compounds, both fiber and organic\nacids, irritate and cause the bowel to move a lot, which is great to beat constipation So we should take at least one piece of citrus\na day And that piece would be a whole piece, peeled,\nbut not in juice And although it is not a citrus, let me tell\nyou about another fruit, the plums, which are fruits that everyone\nlink with a laxative effect, which is good for constipation It is true? Well yes, they are very good for overcoming\nconstipation because they have dihydroxyphenyl-isatin acid, which is a very good natural laxative\nto move the bowel and make us go to the bathroom So you see, if you want to overcome constipation\ntake at least one piece of citrus a day, except, of course, the lemon And also take plums, which have natural laxatives With that ... goodbye to constipation!", "yXBKShOtC1g": "welcome to my workshop in this video I will show you four ways to dry citrus fruit and how to make shapes out of peel these circles were fast dried in the oven these ones are also from the oven but snow dried these were dried on the radiator and these ones in the oven but dehydrated in advance wait a little and I'll tell you how it's done first let's cut the fruit cut of the orange top to the place where you can already see a beautiful pattern cut circles three to four millimeters thick it is the case where one millimeter does matter you can use oranges lemons grapefruits Aranea the citrus fruit at hand they all take different time to dry but let's watch this I believe this shot is instagram-worthy so option one spread the circles on the sheet of baking paper on the baking tray and send the tray into the oven the oven must be heated up to 150 degrees Celsius in convection mode set timer to 15 minutes 16 is also okay once the timer goes off open the oven see the tops of our oranges have already dried a bit now we need to turn them around and send them back into the oven convection mode 150 degrees 15 minutes once again see what we've got oranges look quite dry some even a bit burnt the lemons look drier than the oranges everything is going fine so far turn them round take off the burnt ones lower the temperature down to 70 degrees and leave for another hour after one hour we've got some excellent absolutely dry oranges now we can collect them version to the radiator cover it was something waterproof spread the citrus circles and forget them for a few days once they dry a bit you can just put them straight on the radiator depending on the radiator temperature the drying can take up to two or three days and now the third my favourite version I cover the oven grade with a piece of baking paper to ensure proper heating from the bottom spread the circles on it set convection mode at 70 to 80 degrees and leave it overnight in the morning I wake up to find wonderful perfectly dried orange circles the guys on the baking tray below are also doing all right the fourth way requires dehydrating the circles in advance put a circle on a paper napkin or towel cover it with some more napkins and press all the juice cells with your fingers like this this way we remove most of the moisture and thus reduce the drying time almost by half then dry such circles in any of the ways described above so let's compare the results these circles were fast dried in the oven beautiful dark pulp and dark peel this circle was slow dried in the oven its pulp is lighter the peel is almost the same color this one was radiator dried its pulp and peel are the lightest of all as compared to the slow drying in the oven and these guys were dehydrated in advance they also look nice but to me the disadvantage of this Way's that it leaves the pulp pattern a bit blurry look the oven dried ones have a nice and clear pattern while the dehydrated ones are not so clear at the same time I've also slow dried some apple circles too they have very nice middles where the seeds were and last but not least let's deal with the peel take a large orange cut it like this remove the peel with your fingers or like that with a spoon flatten the peel on a cutting board and take some cookie forms and press them into the peel with the help of a hammer don't forget the safety rules and mind your fingers you can also make holes in the larger shapes using smaller forks once you've cut out a shape use a needle to make a hole for a thread the peel dries much quicker than the circles it took me two and a half hours at 80 degrees Celsius just amazing materials for festive handmade to see how I use it for garlands and Christmas tree decorations click on the link

yeah we're rats baby snobbish [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "VPgp9yZoRkY": "today I am dehydrating some oranges we've got an abundance of oranges we're not eating them quite as fast as I'd like to so we are going to slice them up and dehydrate them I really love to use these for teas and things like that they make when you dry them up you can store them in jars they last forever once they're dehydrated and they are wonderful when you make a nice cup of tea to add a little bit of the orange flavor so we're making some of these up today we're going to go ahead and get started you are going to need some oranges whatever kind of oranges you like these are navel we've got some cuties all kinds of different oranges you're gonna need a bowl with some water in it and a little bit of lemon juice because we want to preserve the color so they look pretty and so let's go ahead and get started bowl and we're gonna put we're only going to put a couple inches of water in it we just want to get some lemon juice on these oranges what we're slicing them I like to do just a couple caps of lemon juice in there you can use a lemon if you have one I don't have one on hand today so just use of this real lemon juice you can pick up at the store pretty much any any supermarket or whatever is going to have lemon juice so we just want a little bit of water and cut our lemon juice in there and it is can't really see it but it's just enough to help preserve the color of the oranges so as we slice our oranges we're gonna put them right in this bowl we're just gonna slice and thin because where they're gonna go in the dehydrator and we want them to dry fairly quickly and we don't need really huge pieces for this so this helps preserve the oranges and saves a ton of money they're great for teas for whatever you can rehydrate them whatever you decide you want to lose them for but I will just take them once we get them sliced then put them right in that water sitting there for a few minutes it ends I'm not gonna [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we've got all our oranges sliced and they're soaking in eleven juice we're gonna pull those out in a second I just want to let you know these little pieces that we cut off that we're not going to be using these are great for like a natural air freshener we throw these in the freezer in a little baggie and then when we want them we take a cinnamon stick and a handful of these and throw them in a pot of water on the wood stove or you can cook them on your stove in the kitchen and it just really helps it smells so delicious and you're not wasting anything and this freshens the air up really nice and you will just Lauren just sliced and we have them all in the lemon water which is just kind of toss them around make sure everything gets a little bit of that lemon on it so it's just going to help preserve the color that's all if you don't do this step then they're just going to kind of turn brown but I mean they're still good but they just they're not as appetizing looking is when you use the lemon juice so we're just going to drain these out [Music] real good and then we're gonna lay them out on paper towels and Pat them dry just to get all the excess water off before we pop them in the jars paper towels all ready to go we got big fans here my son and husband are big Star Wars fans so we're just going to take these and lay them out each one these are hand-cut so they're not all exactly the same so some may take a few may take an hour or so longer to dry than others but they're usually they're all done at the same time they're pretty close in thickness so they will work wonderfully for teas or whatever you decide you want to use your dehydrated oranges for that's mainly what I use them for we don't always have these so we're getting really only one quart left in the pantry so I'm before these go bad make sure I got these dried up so once we get these all laid out on the paper towel we're just going to take another layer just kind of go across the top and suck up any of that water get that out of there okay so we have laid our oranges all out on our trays and we're just loading them into the dehydrator and then we can turn it on I just have a small for tray xcalibur you can use any kind of dehydrator for this some people do it in the oven but it makes our house way way way way way too hot so we're just gonna turn this on on our fruit setting which is about 130 degrees and we're gonna let it do its magic so we're checking on our oranges and after about 6 hours you can see they are really dry we're gonna pop these in the jar they're done that's all you have to do put them in a jar label them datum so we know when they were made and we like to use up our oldest ones first so but that's it it's super simple and easy to do and you get these beautiful orange slices when you're done and crate for make a teas or whatever it is that you want to use them in thanks for watching if you like this video please click the like button subscribe and we'll see you in the next video bye", "W6BnAb-5x_4": "hey sorry I lost my tripod that holds my phone normally so I'm trying to figure out how to situate things so that it works okay I'll call that good for now cool really quick as always when I start the life I have to go share the link over to Instagram so give me one second but while I share this I'll tell you guys that you should go to the link no go to yep go to the description there's a link there and that is where I'm going to be reading the questions off of so if you have a question that you want to ask then put it in the description because I'll try to read comments but comments get all scrambled up and it's a lot easier to kind of filter the questions through if they're in a Google Form so go to the link in the description not the patreon link although you should go to that one too but the link for the questions is the first link in the description I believe okay one sec also so sorry that we forgot to go leave last week you guys oh we're so terrible and when I say we I mostly mean me I mean technically it's everybody's job but I'm the one who heads up the lives typically and I was on set so I forgot all about it forgot to have anybody else to do it and I got home in that night I was like oh shoot we forgot to go live [Music] we're live this week and hopefully next week and hopefully capture okay sherry the link to Instagram you guys follow us on Instagram if you don't follow us on Instagram follow us at working with lemons real can you stop licking your paws might dog all of his wants to lick her paws which is okay she does it every once in a while but this is me taking a picture for Instagram you're welcome that y'all got to see that all right we are posted I'm hopping on my computer now so I can read your questions also I'm just worried about the if the phone falls over I apologize if it really could at any moment it's pretty precariously stacked on some books guys I'm in my nursery in case you didn't know I'm very pregnant we're getting our nursery set up so now I have this comfy chair and I come in here all the time it's nice okay opening the questions um but first I want to tell you guys I wanted to give a huge thank you to our patrons and when I say patrons a lot of you probably like but what does that mean we are on patreon right now which patreon.com slash I think our website is which basically is a site where if you guys like our videos and if you appreciate what we do if we've brought joy into your life or whatever then you can chip in like $1 a month or however much you want to support us and making more stuff and we just really appreciate those who have been able to do that and if you can't do that then that's okay but if you have a dollar a month that you want to throw our way to help us make more videos then that is so awesome and we love you we've been fulfilling some of our pledges and like the rewards that they get and soon soon we will be sending out our lemon stickers so if you are a patron and you haven't sent me your address to mail your lemon sticker you need to do that so that I can get those sent out so whoa 23 responses here we go we'll start on the bow just kidding not 22 oh there we go sorry I'm so sorry you guys I think this is being really weird okay the first question is are you having a boy or a girl I'm having a boy and we're very excited we both I mean we would have been excited to have a girl but my husband especially wanted a boy and I've always kind of wanted a boy first because I grew up having an awesome older brother Robby he's pretty much the best out there so I was thought it'd be cool to have a boy first will there be another Beetlejuice video on it the other channel um I don't know maybe I realize I'm so far away in this life I think my face should be closer the answer right now is that we don't have any current plans to do another beating Beetlejuice video but that definitely doesn't mean that we won't guys I'm gonna scoot the phone over oh okay okay we're a little bit lose you know reminder if you have questions that you want to make sure I see I will try and look at the comments every once in a while but the best way to ask those is the link in the description so Beetlejuice video there might be one we don't have any planned right now but I do want to ask you guys about video ideas later do you know what the capital of Europe is does Europe have a capital isn't Europe a continent right like there are so many countries in Europe that I don't know that there's like a capital country am I crazy oh do your things are shifting around are you going to do more Hamilton it's the same answer as Beetlejuice we don't currently have any plan but Hamilton especially like we have all the costumes and people love it so I wouldn't be surprised if we did I would love to do a really awesome version of the Battle of Yorktown and release it for the 4th of July I think that would be so cool but we would need like a whole troop of soldiers and a whole so we probably need to hire like a reenactment crew to get costumes and stuff but I think that one could be really cool I'm so sorry guys I'm so tired I've got like two months left her pregnancy and I feel pretty good for the most part I'm just sleepy all the time why did my phone does get dark no did you just get darker for you or was that just me hope it's not dying ain't nobody got time for that it's supposed to be charged okay I think Robbie okay have I heard that they're making a movie of Hamilton yes it's so cool so they recorded in case you guys didn't hear back when the original cast was doing it like with lin-manuel they recorded it and so Disney bought that I think was Disney bought the rights to that recording and they're going to release it and we can all see the original Broadway cast recording which will be so fun if you could have a different job what would it be I feel like that's a hard question because I sort of have my dream job but I would just like to have it in in its future form if that makes sense so like I already work as an actress and I already work as a filmmaker and I'm already gonna be a mom and those are like the things that I want to do but in the future I'd like to be working on like more feature films as an actress and creating more feature films and having more kids so I feel like I've kind of got my dream job and if I had to choose a different job hmm I also do acting coaching like I teach private students so I'm kind of already doing that cuz that would be fun as well maybe if I had to choose something different I would want to be like a costume designer because I studied costume design in college along with musical theatre and I really enjoyed that oh gosh guys my phone is dying let me go get a charging cord I'll take you with me although I may never be able to get my phone setup again I swear my phone was at like 70% when I started this live so apparently it just can't handle streaming very well um is there a charging cord in here someday and I'll probably never I was I was about to say that someday these lives would get less chaotic and will actually be organized with them but probably not we probably won't be it'll probably always be a little bit crazy just bending down to unplug my phone charger it's fine so I wasn't crazy when my screen went darker I think it was trying to save battery okay oh no I need my laptop charger too cuz I'm gonna plug this into my laptop huh okay I got the charger we're in business just got to plug it in wow that's overexposed this is the hearts plug it ever plugged in okay I need to get a new phone I mean I don't need to which is why I won't you oh oh oh gee is it okay now how are we doing did we survive is it fixed Oh guys isn't working there's anybody here I think it's back okay it's fixed I'm gonna start answering some more questions then alright what do you think about the new in the heights movie I think it looks so cool guys I'm gonna try and no pro which one sec it's cuz my computer's trying to connect to this was not time for that I'm like chop why is this happening okay the new when the heights movie looks really cool guys I unplugged it from my computer and I plugged it into the wall so let's see if that's any better I'm really sorry we're losing viewers they're dropping like flies okay I'll try to answer them as fast who's the can because apparently we don't know how much time we're gonna get on this video mmm what's your favorite character played so far on working with lemons oh dear my hair is getting staticky if we're just going to 13th lemons characters probably Eliza she's pretty cool okay um best project we did it for working with lemons best or my favorite I think one of the best ones we've done [Music] maybe dear Theodosia or a million dreams I think both of those are just really beautiful videos but some of my favorites that we've done both of those definitely but also the Hamiltons stuff has always been really fun okay I'm sad that this is like king hello does anybody still there oh this hasn't happened for a long time you guys I think our videos used to lag all the time and then I got better internet because of that and they're better now but obviously not today how did I meet my husband he worked at our family game store my parents hired him and then I was there working and I met him when I was like oh he's cute do you watch stranger things yes I like stranger things a lot um yeah I love you Camry do you love me I don't know who you are but I love you when is your baby due in April but I don't like the end of April do we have any names for the baby yes potentially but it's a secret so you'll just have to wait and see you should do the sound of music I would love to do the sound of music I love Julie Andrews anything that she does I would love to do do you have a tick tock our we have a tick tock called working a Clemens I don't have one I don't really understand tick tock but Clemens has a tick tock how many months are you I am whole lot let's see how many months am i I think I'm like at the end of month seven so I just got two more months to go [Music] what is your biggest accomplishment that's a big question I don't know what my biggest accomplishment is maybe I don't know doing working with lemons um what is your favorite movie I really love the movie Brooklyn with Saoirse Ronan it's beautiful where do you want to live probably we'll live in Utah our whole life unless something changes but I would also love to live in Europe like in Austria or somewhere a quaint little town would you ever consider doing hairspray songs yes absolutely and the Bonners you guys know the Bonners in our videos they've asked us many times they're like what are we gonna do hairspray but I don't know how that would work because they all want to play seaweed there's only one seaweed what was your first acting job in theatre my first play that I ever did was Seussical but the first job that I ever got paid for was a laundry detergent commercial where did I go to college Weber State University what's the story that was very embarrassing at the time but now you can look back and laugh um I don't really get embarrassed so I don't really have one of those why are the comments for your video is disabled now YouTube's disabled them on a bunch of family channels so we just can't do anything about it which is sad we miss hearing from you guys on our videos how was your day it was good I took a nap irie registered my car so just you know business stuff guys it's just spinny circling on my screen so I don't know if you guys are even seeing this that I'm just somebody asked how they join working lemons you just typically you have to live in Utah because that's where we do all of our stuff and most of the people that are on our crew are just like friends that we've met through the acting world and like through film and theater some of them are recommendations from other people and every once in a while we'll have auditions for roles which we post about on our Facebook page and then like our crew people are mostly people that Robbie met in film school so I guess how you join working with lemons is you just know one of the family members and you're good at what you do and then we want to hire you [Music] so the remakes of the musicals you have done have you gone to most of them like have I seen the musicals that we've made videos up mmm not I haven't seen like you're of enhancing ever or Beetlejuice I have seen Hamilton so some and some not what's your favorite color orange when is your baby's due date April 25th okay I'm gonna try to read some comments cuz I'm I turn off my internet on my computer so the questions stopped loading cuz I was trying to help this video um so there's musical instruments can you play none very well I could just sing yeah but I can plunk out some songs on the piano and I can strum some really basic chords on the guitar and I can play one song poorly on the violin so if I could be in any musical what would it be probably mmm maybe she loves to me maybe light in the Piazza maybe my fair lady any of those soprano e songs let me sing those I love those okay I'm going back up if you guys have questions try to ask them on the link that's in the description just reminder because that is where I'm whoa we got some more okay can you set this down for a sec and try to read some more of the questions okay um oh goodness they got all shuffled up why is that happening I'm so confused okay I'll just try to scan through and see cuz I know in your family play a musical instrument um Arie and Nathan are taking piano lessons my mom plays the piano a bit and she plays the violin quite well and most of us don't really play musical intruments I know Anson's been like learning the guitar some so several of us kind of dabble but we don't none of us are great at musical instruments do you have a job outside of working with lemons so outside of working with lemons I do acting work like all audition for commercials and films and sometimes I do please I don't do those as often because they take so much time and I'm busy making videos but and then I also teach acting lessons which is really fun what do you oh we already asked that okay let's see did I go to college yes I majored in musical theatre jazz hands my favourite book there are too many to name you guys I love these are some of my default answers that I give that I've given for like my whole life which is the Harry Potter series Ella Enchanted Pride and Prejudice I also love the Amelia Peabody series we my husband and I are currently reading the Mistborn series we're on the third book in the Mistborn series and that's really good the goose-girl series the books of bayern i don't know there's so many good books out there okay well you ever do this on congratulations from Hamilton maybe Ari would really like to do it the thing is not everybody knows about that song and in order for our videos to make their money back we have to do songs that people search and so what I would like to have happen ideally is in enough of you decide that you want to become patrons on our patreon page if enough you become that you can help fund an actual video like you can pay for the expenses of it then we can just have you guys vote on a video and it doesn't matter if it's gonna make its money back on YouTube because you've already paid for it but for us to be able to keep making videos we kind of have to try to do the ones that people are gonna watch so that the views bring in some money because obviously it like it's not we we don't make that much money some people I think would assume that we're like super rich youtubers because our videos have a lot of views but we pretty much just make enough money to pay our bills and to continue making videos so but we have to be strategic about the videos that we make because if we just put any video out there we could just be dumping all of our money into making videos that aren't bringing any money back if you didn't make any cartoon come to life what would it be [Music] [Music] there's no group maybe except even would be so scary in real life how was your date oh I think already answered that one my day was good okay I'm just scrolling back up and we're gonna reload these and see if there anymore whoa oh my goodness somebody posted a bunch of Hamilton lyrics how is the family the family it's good hey here's my I'll give you a quick update on everybody Robbie's editing like crazy and we're trying to pitch our house to a couple of places meaning like TV which would be fun me I'm growing a baby and getting everything ready for that which means I feel like I've been neglecting working with lemons not from like I still post on Instagram and I still try to do the lives I remember oh my brain is just so full and I feel like I've been slacking off Porter is going to school and he's getting married so exciting so he'll be getting married next month Ari is done with hair school and she's working at two salons right now so she's busy busy dancing just finished his school play puffs have you guys ever heard of that one it's pretty funny it's about Hogwarts but from the hufflepuffs point of view who's dr. Anson I guess Jordans technically before Anson Oh Taylor that's who I missed Taylor still has a cute baby boy Easton and horses so many horses so she's been doing like barrel racing stuff which is fun Jordan going to school doing horse stuff Nathan just had a birthday yay also going to school everyone's going to school except for the older kids Mia is doing once on this island right now and what's on this island Junior she's busy with that and dance company did I miss anybody my family's really big so sometimes I forget people doesn't mean I don't want them I love them I just forget them okay um guys I thought these Google responses would just like put it in order but it doesn't put it in order it seems like okay here we go let's check this out could you sing a small part of is it's the start of something new this could be the start of something new it feels so right to be here with you I'm sad that song a long time I think I got something else wrong so sorry that's started something new what is your dream house my dream house is like a cute little European cottage with beautiful garden in Europe and be so cute okay and like playing video games and if so what's your favorite game and console yes and I mean I'm not like a huge video gamer but I definitely like it my favorite game is dr. Mario on the Super Nintendo but I also love overcooked on the switch and I like a lot of games in between so like Mario Party on the Nintendo 64 that's really fun we've been playing soul blazer I've been playing my husband a little bit that one okay I figured out how to sort through these questions you guys if you could go on a trip somewhere in the world where would you go so probably the next trip we want to take with me and my husband is Austria because we have family that lives there so we can stay with them and it's beautiful there so maybe we would go to Austria in Italy we also want to go to Thailand I want to go to Greece I want to go back to Ireland I want to go everywhere everywhere what is your fear um I'm scared of clogged toilets and I'm scared of alligators and alligators don't even live in you dock and I'm kind of scared of raccoons and chickens so that's my fear those are my fears I guess oh my goodness I can't stop yawning favorite Hamilton song hmm maybe the Reynolds pamphlet it changes was it easy to film into the unknown no but not as hard as some of her other videos it was just cold mostly because we had to film a night time in the winter because it's Utah so there's like snow everywhere so and what was hard about it was that I was pregnant so before every shot I had to like try to tuck in my belly as much as I could and I would like to stick my butt back so that my belly would tilt back so that it looked like it wasn't pregnant I think it worked though I think it worked so and I was significantly less pregnant then because I was like three months ago that comes out so it was kind of tricky how have you had pregnancy brain yes mostly I had horrible pregnancy brain during the first trimester I lost my wedding ring I have no idea where it is not a clue I've lost I lost like a nice watch that my husband got me I was just losing everything and forgetting everything and I feel like I got better during the second trimester and I feel like now in the third trimester I'm getting pregnancy brain again so pray for me I can't lose all my stuff hmm would I rather go 100 years in the past or the future um do I get to come back because if I just got to visit I think I'd rather visit the past go to the 20s yeah that'd be cool one of the ponies it steals some vintage clothing and come back with it ah reclining do all the songs from frozen - mm maybe I mean yeah kind of we'll see we have to wait for spring time to film some of them at least and there may be a couple that we don't do but I think eventually we're planning on doing pretty much all of them what Hogwarts house are you ravenclaw what age did you get your period fourteen I think interesting question hmm okay answered those do you do skincare and if you do what is it um I do but my skin's horrible now that I'm pregnant there's like nothing you can do there's so many products you're not allowed to use on your face when you're pregnant so I just use some stuff from this place called Paula's Choice and you go in and you tell them what kind of skin you have and then they suggest products so right now I just use like a basic wash and I have a nighttime moisturizer and a daytime moisturizer and some eye cream that I use sometimes were you ever obsessed with any teen saga you mean like Twilight because yes I was embarrassingly obsessed with Twilight you guys cuz it came out when I was in junior high so there was no hope for me I was obsessed with it and now I haven't even seen all the movies so luckily it died off and I I don't even like think about it anymore but I never saw the last movie I maybe never saw the second last movie but I was so obsessed with the books high at Christie and this Christianne 'this would you go to Spain someday yes I'd love to go to Spain I'd also like to go to Portugal I'm learning Portuguese except I'm learning Brazilian Portuguese but you can speak both is what I've heard just like British English and American English do you teach acting a prisoner could you do it online in some form another I could do it online I haven't really said anything up like that so at the at the time right now I'm just doing it in person there may come a time when I offer online lessons it's just a little harder online obviously because you've seen the connection issues that happen so maybe somebody LTG online um yes ayo fala portugues poco who is your favorite sibling I can't answer that question most of because I actually can't answer that question because it just mostly depends on who I what is working if lemons working on now our house so we have an episode of our house coming out on Friday I think now we'll have to release one cuz I said it I'm pretty sure we have one that's coming out on Friday and we're just

slices that are full of citrus flavor you can also add them to marinades and savory dishes for extra citrus flavor and they are a product of Thailand okay let's give it a taste test hmm okay its moist

direction shoot hold on hey guys how are you i'm tired i'm gonna hurry and share this link over on our instagram page so sorry i'm ignoring you for just a second okay just a minute multitasking here also my baby could wake up any second so i might have to go get him all righty going to youtube finding the link come on oh there it is there i am next to my yoga with adrian video do you guys do yoga with adrien it's the best i'm sure i have to make this face so that i can take a screenshot of it very important now if you go to our instagram page you'll see that face that i just made in our story guys i don't know what's going on the past couple days but my eyes are so tired don't touch your eyes everyone don't do what i just did okay almost got the link up sorry i'm a little rusty on the live vibe it's been so long since i did one swipe up to join the live also i'm gonna post uh hmm i wonder if i can still do that i don't know if i can edit the video but i might be able to edit it and post the link to a google form where you can post your questions so that i make sure i see them all because when they're in comments i try to look through the comment questions but sometimes it's hard when they're all being scrolled past okay let me see if i can update that and then i will go and look at what you guys have already posted um i'm logged into like seven different youtube accounts on my device it's cool okay i don't think i can edit it oh maybe i can ask your questions here let's see if this works i'm posting the google form link which i now have to go find that i was not very very prepared you guys are like it's fine we're used to it whenever camry does the live it takes like 10 minutes to actually get going because i'm always trying to figure stuff out okay okay paste okay tell me if the link posted in the description for the google form and i will start reading through some of these comments real quick and we're just doing a q a today i don't have anything like exciting going on because i'm just at home and i didn't want to plan an activity because chances are i'll have to interrupt this q a to go get my baby so we're just doing a nice little chit chat and where did the chat go though oh there it is all right all right here i go scrolling up thank you i cut my own bangs in quarantine because it's 20 20 you know and there are acting jobs happening right now but i'm not auditioning for any of them because i'm being like extra cautious because i've got a new baby so i don't want to take any chances so for a long time i didn't cut bangs so i was like well what if they're terrible and sometimes they're a little crazy but it's okay i like them overall they're fun um i was afraid to cut them though because i was like what if they're terrible and i have to try to do all these auditions and stuff and wait for them to grow out but i was like dude i'm gonna be stuck in my house probably for at least a couple more months before i'm like out auditioning for stuff so now's the time to cut things and i'm glad i did ari came over and i have these glass doors that she came and sat behind and then i sat on the outside of them i sat like out here she sat in there and she helped coach me on how to cut my bangs it was great um okay we'll be posting a new hamilton video this friday i think so i'm pretty sure i'm supposed to know this stuff because i run instagram um if i remember correctly we are posting one on friday but i could be wrong and it's gonna be good because yahosh is in it and your hosh is so good um he's going down through comments my baby is good he's so cute you guys and he's like the happiest baby except for probably now that i've said that he'll be fussing as soon as he wakes up when you all see him if you all see him maybe he'll sleep the whole time but he i think is one of the happiest babies to ever exist which is really good because i'm stuck at home with him all day long so if he was a grumpy baby then i would be in big trouble can you do burn as eliza for music video ah maybe i don't know we'll see i love that song personally it's intimidating to me to do a video and also eliza is supposed to be like 40 in it so we'll see um why can't we touch our eyes they just tell you not to because it's a way that you can spread disease so you if you're trying to avoid getting corona you're not supposed to touch your eyes but uh there's a pretty low chance that i have corona or i've been exposed because i never go anywhere so i'm not saying that i should touch my eyes probably none of us should ever touch our eyes but um okay so we did contact our winner for sing for switch competition it is oh what is her username i want to say melania pejico if you go look on our post you'll see who it was it's the person who commented a bajillion times so they won the switch congratulations we'll be shipping that up to them soon thank you for everyone who entered and we'll be doing probably some more giveaways we also have something fun uh coming up on our patreon page i'm gonna talk about it in a minute so help me remember to talk about patreon um because i think this activity that we've got coming up i'm excited about i need to figure out all the details but i think it's gonna be really fun okay can you see my baby if my baby wakes up during the live then sure if not then i'm not gonna wake him up for you guys so he's napping right now if you want to see him though you can check my instagram at bagley fox i post pictures of him um okay i'm gonna move over to the google form if you have questions ask them in the link that's i don't know why i pointed up here it's down here it's in the description so if i didn't get to your question in the comments feel free to post it again in the forum i might go back to the comments at the end of the video but i want to make sure these questions get addressed goodness i'm a little lost on my ipad okay rue do you want to come up here we have roo joining us hi honey it's me girl i love her all right here are our questions first one is why did you want to have a baby um i you know i've always wanted to have a baby i don't know i came from a big family as you guys know i've always been kind of the mom of the family i mean besides my mom you know but i'm a a motherly person so i've always known that i wanted to have kids i kind of already want to have another one obviously i'm not going to get pregnant right now my body's still recovering but i want to have a handful of kids so i didn't have one right away my husband and i have been married for five years so i definitely wasn't ready like as soon as we got married but i've always known that i wanted to have a baby because i want to have a not necessarily a huge family but a decent sized family um what was your worst on stage mishap or one that you have seen uh the worst one that i've seen which probably everyone has seen was on a youtube video so that doesn't really count uh but it's the peter pan gone wrong you should watch it i'm not gonna tell you what happens because it's gonna be funnier if you just go watch it uh probably my worst on stage mishap i always forget about this one because it wasn't in a play it was during a dance performance but um i fell on my face twice if i remember correctly and i was always at the front of the stage because i'm short so we were doing like these kicks and i just biffed it straight on my face and just like hopped back up and kicked again and then i think i fell a second time i could be lying to you but if my memory serves me i fell on my face twice in one dance number in front of everyone favorite color my favorite color is orange i love it there's like no oh there is some orange you can see if you look back there my little towel orange except it's just such a happy color it's lovely um do i enjoy being a mom yes i love it it's the very best it's hard but my baby's really easy so it's not that hard for me i know it can be really hard for other people and the beginning was very hard because you're dealing with all these hormones and you're dealing with recovering from giving birth which is intense um but i absolutely love it it's super fun what is the coolest part of working with lemons okay this is a three-part question the first one is what is the coolest part of working with lemons um two things probably i love working with my family which i haven't done in so long because i'm staying inside so i haven't really been working with them lately it's depressing it's the worst part of this quarantine um so that's the first part that's awesome about working with lemons the second part is just like being able to bring our creative visions to life and we've only done that a fraction of what we want to do eventually so eventually we want to be making like series and films and things like that and turning our favorite books into movies and doing really really cool stuff like that also i just started reading this book that my good friend gave me it's called the language of thorns so far it's really cool it's like kind of dark fairy tales and i now want to turn them into a mini series so go read it and then tell us if we should make one and if we should do a crowdfund for it crowdfunds are exhausting you guys they're so hard um okay uh-oh i think i'm going oh dear i think i'm going backwards because they're popping up the other way i'm gonna start from the bottom now what was it my first pet my first pet was a cat named stripes that my mom did not want but that we let into the house one day and then the cat stayed and i was very happy and then rue oh and we had a bunch of fish those didn't really count that was probably actually my first pet but i don't remember any of them so and then when i was in sixth grade guys i asked my parents for a dog my entire life until i was 20 and they finally got me one um but they would not get me a dog before that but in sixth grade my mom decided to get me a hamster that would break out of her cage and run all over the house which was not desirable oh i hear a baby let's see if he's actually awake um do i like playing elsa or eliza more uh eliza ellis is cool and especially in frozen 2 she's cooler than she was in frozen one but i don't know i think i like looking like myself a little more and eliza's hmm is that true i was gonna say eliza's songs are easier for me to sing that's probably true because i do not have an indiana men's cell voice really i have like a julie andrews golden age voice but nobody does shows like that so i don't get to sing the stuff that my voice actually wants to sing because modern musicals don't cater to that um oh okay oh shoot i'm getting so lost what's happening guys these questions are just like exploding i'm sorry i'll try to get to all of them um do you guys enjoy fan mail yes and i have a bunch of letters sitting in a box over there that i need to reply to because that's my job so if you sent us fan mail hopefully i'll be getting back to you soon i need to buy more envelopes um it's super fun favorite song i've done a cover of it totally changes one that i've been loving lately is our dead mom cover it's so good if you haven't watched our dead mom video it's maybe the best video we've done ari kills it as lydia and the cinematography's great which is funny because robbie filmed it himself not that robbie's like terrible but he's not our go-to cinematographer but it's just a beautiful video yes i had the baby i just saw a comment if you want to ask questions go to the link in the description to make sure that i see them but someone said did you have the baby yes thank goodness there's not a still a baby still in my belly because it's been a year since i got pregnant um what musical do you want to do next uh we have some ideas i think it'd be fun to do some into the woods there's a musical that i really love lately which is called daddy longlegs it's very charming i think that would be fun but nobody knows about that one um i'd also love to do she loves me someday that would be fun oh my gosh i'm so sorry these questions they're not coming in any um organized option organized uh manner opinions on the hamel film hammer film ham hammer film and attempt wrapped guns and chips i loved the film version of hamilton i cried it was beautiful very powerful um i'm taking this horse by the range making redcoats go to the blood stains blow fire and i'm never gonna stop until i make a drop and burn up and scatter the remains and uh watch me escape and um nope watch me enrage and i'm escape and i'm i lost my spot i go to france for more funds i come back with more guns and ships and so the balance ships okay so that was kind of terrible but there you go um why was i named camry it's not a very interesting story my mom just heard the name and liked it so that's why i'm named camry what's it like having a new baby during covid it's hard it's tough because like most of my family only my parents have held my baby and they've only held him i think my mom has come and watched him twice and everyone else has held him once so that's tough it's really hard i wouldn't wish it on anyone um because we're just trying to keep him extra safe and so like my siblings haven't held him they've come and met him through windows and stuff but i would like covet to go away so that they can hold my baby before he's four years old just kidding i'm sure they'll be able to hold them before that i'm being dramatic but yeah it's it's been kind of tough um why did you i answered that one okay are you close with all of your siblings yes very close i love them i miss them um yeah i love our family they're so fun how have you been doing since you had the baby good good uh yeah i'm good the first couple weeks were a little rough because my delivery was a little rough so my body had to recover and by the first couple weeks i mean like the first couple months um but i'm good now i feel good and it was good anyway it was still like such a happy happy wonderful time um how's it going with you and your baby i've kind of answered that it's good baby's good we're great who in your family enjoys acting or singing the most hmm that's probably kind of impossible to answer but if i had to guess like the person who maybe has their soul filled the most by it is anson maybe he sings like constantly at home um i did major in musical theater so i do love singing and acting acting more than singing um everyone in our family obviously loves it but probably me or anson the most or ari the difference is i think that anson like is primarily interested in acting and singing where i also find a lot of fulfillment in like planning the creative side of videos and designing costumes and things like that so i don't know skipping baby questions because i've already answered them my favorite musical soundtrack that's impossible lately i said i've been listening to daddy longlegs which is fun i've also just been trying to find music that's not musicals because it's been a long time since i listened to normal people music um somebody said they also had babies twin girls cute how exciting babies are the best i have a number i have a bunch of friends from high school that all had babies kind of at the same time as me so it's been really fun we've got to like message back and forth um okay favorite dear evan hansen song because i've only listened to the folder of enhancement soundtrack once oh sorry i'm a a fake musical theater fan i'm not really but i i've only listened to the full soundtrack once but i love you will be found i think it's really powerful that's probably my favorite one favorite waitress song probably when he sees me it's so fun i keep saying things are so fun because they are not a question but on the live can you sing part of oh part of what he sees me from waitress and part of waving through a window from dear evan hansen um we'll come back to that if you go way way back actually i don't know if that's posted anywhere i did sing when he sees me somewhere okay here's a question and i don't know if it will actually determine our decision if we ever make these videos but if we ever do waitress ari and i are curious um because we've thought of it both ways we've thought that i could play dawn and she could play jenna or that i could play jenna and she could play dawn so technically i'm older than ari and also technically i usually uh um lend myself more easily to like dramatic things but obviously ari can totally do that as you've seen in the videos um just like our typecast is ari usually gets more typecast in the comedic roles i get more typecast from the dramatic roles so how would you cast it would you cast me as jenna and ari as dawn or ari as jenna and me as dawn let me know it may or may not have an impact on if we ever do those videos um i guess i'll just sing a line real quick uh i just forgot the whole song i just forgot when he sees me i stick with real things usually facts and figures when information's in its place i minimize the guessing game guess what i don't like guessing games or when i feel things before i know the feeling how am i supposed to operate if i'm just tossed around by fate like on an unexpected date there you go um learn to slam on the brakes before i even turn the key before i make a mistake before i lead with the worst of me there's waving through a window how's your family doing today i don't know my my little family that lives in this house is doing great my husband's at work steven's sleeping the rest of my family probably good i haven't seen them today so i don't know ah i have to go faster these questions there are so many questions when will y'all do congratulations i don't know maybe never maybe someday we'll see the thing is congratulations while it would be fun to do as i've said on a lot of videos the songs that we choose to do are largely impacted by what we can expect to get views obviously we want to do songs because we want to do them but in order for our channel to keep going and to keep making revenue people have to watch our stuff so we kind of have to determine the songs that we do based on what people will search and not a lot of people are going to search congratulations because they don't know it exists also i'm sorry if you see long hairs on my couch i'm going through the postpartum hair loss phase and my hair is everywhere i actually usually wear it in braids so that it falls out less but i'm letting it down today okay if you could start over would you change anything if so what no i don't think so that's a big a big question would you change anything and i you know we've had some hard stuff in my family's life but i wouldn't change it because it's made us who we are today it's strengthened us and brought us closer together so what's the best way to start a repertoire do you mean like i don't know what that really means like a resume you want experience if that's the case just start auditioning for whatever you can have you seen your family since quarantine or since you had your baby i've seen them i haven't touched them um and mostly i've seen them through a window i did go to my first socially distanced family gathering for earnest 50th birthday so they set up a little table away from everyone else then i brought my stroller and me and steven just sat jeremy was at work so he didn't come and we chatted with my family from a distance so i did actually go to that thing but i just can't wait to give them all a big hug day hopefully soon any tips for stage fright it's gonna happen the more you perform the less it will happen and also the more you can get in touch with your character and try to not think about the audience the better so if you can get into the scene more get more engaged um acting wise then you're not going to be as concerned about your audience and just more rehearsal helps with stage fright but it happens to everyone i mean maybe not everyone it happens to me it happens to my family what is your favorite book too many i love the harry potter series i love it so good we also just read the mistborn series my husband and i and that was really good um i'm currently reading the language of thorns that one's fun i'm also listening to i am malala which is really good so far i really like pride and prejudice i really love ella enchanted i love the goose girl series so there are if you ever want book recommendations just let me know because i've got a bunch also the amelia peabody series books are great you guys how dare you someone says that's their question sorry your favorite things to do in the morning on a good morning i love mornings when i wake up feeling or do my physical therapy exercises for my crippled shoulders um okay moving to utah any advice um go hiking we've got lots of great hikes here oh my friend amanda asked the question how dare you i love her um go hiking and try not to be too weirded out by utah's weird culture not that it's like super weird but if you are not lds or even if you are lds it can be a little overwhelming to be moving into this intensely lds community i love it it's great i'm lds um but just be aware that there are some weird things that come with that so um how old is your son he's just a couple months old whoa did you guys see it get darker in here am i crazy or did the lights just flicker you just joined patreon yay someone just joined patreon that's great you're painting i just saw someone's comment they're painting you should paint a picture of my dog roo she's a black dog though so it's kind of hard to paint black things because you can't like show the features as easily i don't know i'm not an artist maybe that's easier than i think do you enjoy being outside yeah it's fun i don't like getting ready for elsa what the heck it's like my power maybe just like no clocks are still on google's listening in um can you do who lives who dies who tells your story or quiet uptown we would love to do both of those both of those require kind of a lot of cast and location so we for sure won't be doing those during the pandemic maybe someday we will hi connie why are you a big nerd because being a big nerd is the best it's so fun don't be too cool you guys don't be too cool being too cool is boring you want to be able to be dorky and nerd out about things life's more fun that way can you do another super cut yeah i think we probably will i think that it was super fun to do our last super cut so super super super um i definitely think we will in the future do you have any advice for beginning performers be patient you're going to experience a lot of rejection that's like the first thing that i tell everyone which sounds depressing but it's just true you need to learn to not get discouraged when you don't get cast in things because even the very best of performers who have been performing for years only get cast in like a fraction of what they audition for so don't worry about it if you don't get cast in everything or if you don't get the roles that you want just keep trying keep working hard and if you are a hard worker then you'll keep getting cast and things eventually how long does it typically take to make the music videos it totally depends so like elsa stuff always takes a long time because we need like special locations we have to record the song i mean we record all the songs in advance um but typically like the elsa videos will take a couple days of filming because we'll film part of it on location and then because of the magic we some times have to film part of it in a green screen studio and then it takes like days weeks for our vfx guy to get the effects in and to get feedback and then change things and so those videos take a long time but other videos we can do in a day it just totally depends on the video another person joined patreon or maybe it's the same person i'm thrilled either way dream role um i'd love to play amalia and she loves me i would love to play in in the film world i would love to play amelia peabody in 10 years when my family makes it this series that's my dream um are you a soprano or an alto i'm a soprano i can sing alto stuff but my soprano range is definitely where i'm happiest dream acting role that's kind of i just covered that another one is uh drusha abbott and daddy longlegs would be fun jerusha where are you from i'm from utah but i was born in georgia okay answer that answer that what have i been doing to stay sane oh i don't know some days i'm not saying some days i'm i spiral into insanity and thinking that the world is ending and then i tell jeremy that we need to plan something fun the problem is that i'm not i'm like mostly happy being home even not during a pandemic i just stay home a lot and hang out with jeremy so that's great um but after doing that for months and months and months like we've been doing i definitely hit a wall sometimes so we try to we'll do like campfires in our backyard i started playing breath of the wild which is really fun guys if you haven't played breath of the wild it's fun um and i'm not usually like a zelda gamer person but i've been playing with my husband i mean i've been playing jeremy just sits next to me but it's very fun so i guess those are the things i'm doing to stay sane i try to call my family and keep in touch with people or i'll have people come and sit inside the glass room and chat with me or i'll cut my bangs you know that's how you stay sane everyone cut your bangs cut your bangs 20 20. it's a movement what is my third favorite dinosaur um definitely a brontosaurus is that a dinosaur a brontosaurus dinosaur probably a long long neck because i don't know any of the dinosaurs names i'm sure i'll learn them when stephen gets older he already has a bunch of hand-me-down dinosaur toys that were jeremy's um favorite song we've already talked about that i'm trying to skip through these quickly um when will you get the lemon sticker okay so if you are a patreon and you're waiting for your lemon sticker i did mail some out kind of recently so if your address was there [Music] a couple weeks ago i can't remember when i did it

the musical tuck everlasting yes mia played winnie foster at our local theater hail center theater it was the regional premiere of tuck everlasting and she was brilliant i cried i'm a proud older sister and i'm a crier so literally like she hadn't spoken a single word but the set turned around and she was sitting on stage and i just like started crying but she was darling so yes i have seen tech everlasting it's beautiful are we christians yes can you have me in a video maybe a lot of people ask if we if they can audition for our videos we usually cast our videos with just like our local friends and family if we ever have open auditions we post about them on our facebook page so follow us on facebook at working with lemons we don't do open auditions a ton but if we do that's where we'll post about it so if you want to be in a video make sure you're following us there my first donation to be in a theater production i've never been asked that question that's a fun one um the very well i'm not going to count like little school like elementary school productions i think technically my very first audition was for aladdin junior at my elementary school and i sang i was supposed to sing uh i could have danced all night that's the song i prepared but then i got too shy and i like didn't sing anything um but the first community theater thing i auditioned for i was in for with robbie and my dad and we auditioned for seussical the musical and i sang it's a hard knock life which every kid sings for their audition songs so if you're a kid you shouldn't sing that song um unless you kill it you know whatever if you want to sing it sing it but they might hear it hundred times but we all got cast so that was fun that was before we knew anything about what we were doing favorite board game um i love the game betrayal of the house on the hill it's fun kind of a spooky feel i also love the card game perpetual commotion which is basically the same as nerds or wacky six um okay how did you decide on the name steven atticus so stephen is jeremy's dad's name um it actually took me a while to warm up to the name stephen i have no problem with it but i just like never pictured myself having a son named steven but jeremy really really wanted to name our boy that it's also jeremy's middle name um so we decided that he would choose the first name i which is the second name i love the name atticus i like it as a name first of all but also i love to kill mockingbird so that doesn't hurt because atticus finch so and stephen atticus fox just sounds freaking awesome i really like our baby name it actually um worries me a little bit because when we have another kid i just don't think we're gonna be able to come up with a name that's as good and that's okay i guess but my first musical was seussical the musical and i played a who do i have any pets sure do there's real oh sorry did i wake you up she's so cute oh connie just reminded me about the patreon thing okay you guys are the first to hear about this really our patreon should be the very first to hear about this but uh i'm gonna tell you about it so um we're planning on doing a kind of thing where i don't know what it's called it's just you're gonna help vote on one of the next videos that we do if you are a patron on our patreon page so um to be a patron you go to patreon.com working with lemons and you definitely don't have to do that you can support us just by watching our videos and sharing with people that's totally fine there's no pressure to become a patron but for those who are on our patreon page we want to do something special for them uh and so we're going to let you vote on our next music video or maybe not our next one but one that we'll do soon so oh my husband's locked out hold on let me go let him in uh have you heard taylor swift's new album folklore i started listening to it i think i've technically heard the whole thing but i wasn't really paying attention hi jeremy you're alive yep can you sing opera there you go actually my voice teacher wanted me to join the opera program at the university of utah because i never wanted to be an opera singer but my voice actually likes opera classical music so there you go um how long have i been married five years jeremy also someone said can you give me a shout out but i don't know who wrote this comment so shout out to whoever wrote that question can you do a quiet uptown i already answered that one sorry i'm skipping through these find one i haven't answered yet do i work any other job besides acting i mean technically working with lemons i do a lot more than just acting on that channel so that's my main job sometimes i do acting for that but a lot of times i just i'm running social media running patreon planning videos um i also teach acting lessons right now i'm teaching them online so not in person but i have several students that i coach and i love doing that so i guess that's not me acting but it's related to acting so pretty much every job i do is related to acting in some way um favorite hamilton character the one i connect to the most is eliza but i love thomas jefferson and also lafayette sometimes my ipad freezes there we go who is your favorite actor actress um i really like emily blunt i think she's brilliant and i've liked her like i just think she's really good because she's kind of a chameleon she's not just the same in every single movie she does when you watch her early stuff it's like you didn't realize who this person was and then you're like wait a second that lady was in all these other things and i didn't realize it was the same person so i think she's great not meryl streep i think meryl streep is great too but i like emily blunt more i mean you can't you can't complain about meryl she's great but i also really like um helen mirren and sercia ronan have you heard of anna green gables the musical it's really good i have not but actually no i have maybe i have i know there's like a ballet mia should do that she loves anne of green gables okay peggy angelico realizes who's your favorite eliza and not just because i play her she's just the actual best the life keeps lagging i'm so sorry i don't know how to help that actually i maybe do know how to help that i can prioritize my phone's internet oh shoot just kidding i can't i don't remember my password come on read this and say it out loud there you go what was the last video i filmed for working with lemons um i don't remember no idea probably our house or something can you do songs from anakin gables musical we'll have to look into it because that would be fun okay a hamilton supercut that would be fun someone just suggested that will you be doing any other frozen content probably not i think we've done most of the songs we want to do there's a chance we could do a real-life version of some things never change in the spring but we did the super cut so i don't know if we'll do a real life one there's so many people that asked my favorite hamilton quest character what was your favorite onstage performance um when i was in college a lot of you heard the story i did a performance of a play called mockingbird and i played an 11 year old girl who has autism and it was just a really really beautiful script and a powerful shell so i really liked doing that one i have not seen full house or fuller house do you have any suggestions for people who are newer to singing and for when they get nervous and mess up on stage um just keep practicing just keep doing it i only recently have become more comfortable with singing believe it or not it's kind of funny to me that i make a part of my livelihood by singing for other people online because i never considered myself as the strongest singer i still don't consider myself as like the strongest singer but i got super nervous i still get nervous when i audition for singing stuff but just the more you do it the easier it gets um my favorite memory with working with lemons uh possibly [Music] we had a guy that flew us out to texas to do a little performance at his house so that was really fun because we got to take a trip with my family and some of our friends like the bonners and corey and and our friend kurt and we got to go perform that was really fun how old was i when i started theater i was 11 when i did my first show right 11 was i twelve hmm i think i was eleven how old are you when you're done with fifth grade that's how that was when i did it was the summer after fifth grade i think would you guys ever consider doing tech everlasting videos absolutely but we would just have to make sure we had the budget for it because those videos probably wouldn't be super popular they're they're beautiful videos but people don't search them very often okay uh i'm not gonna sing phantom of the offer for you think of me think of me fondly when we've said goodbye there you go that's all you get that stuff is hard y'all i sing it at home regularly but i don't want to sing it and try to make it sound good on a live okay i'm almost to the end of the questions hi ella my favorite thing about being in a big family is it's just fun there's just people to hang out with and do stuff with it's a party okay my favorite male actor is probably benedict cumberbatch i have a crush on him he's brilliant over alan rickman yeah i love alan rickman too but benedict cumberbatch is probably my favorite hi kinley chapa i if that's how you say your last name have i ever had to dye my hair for a show nope musical ghost quartet i'm familiar with the musical ghost but i don't know the quartet so i'm not that familiar with it i just know of the musical ghost how much wood could a wig chat chuck if a woodchuck this isn't the same but i know how much wood can a wood chuck chuck could a woodchuck would chuck chuck when is the next episode of our house coming out your girl's desperate i'm so sorry we just had a meeting about this my mom's working on a script she's working on a couple scripts actually we just put it on pause for a second because we had the opportunity to film a couple of the hamilton videos and those have been more popular so we stopped and did that for a little bit but i promise we are going to do more our house also i think steven's going to sleep this whole life so sorry about it you can go look at my instagram if you want to see him favorite disney live action remake i don't know i like the originals better pretty much across the board the animated's just better do i have a favorite disney live-action remake jeremy maybe lion king yeah lion king was all right but it's still just like not even close to as good as the animated you just lose a lot when animals can't emote like humans um who is the strongest singer in your family it totally depends on what you're doing jeremy says he's the strongest singer sing for us jeremy um i kind of think that like based on just pure natural ability anson might be but if you go off of like a trained voice i've i have a lot of years in singing training so if it's like a classical song i'd say that that's going to be my strength if it's a belt thing you're gonna want ari to do it so just depends how did working with lemons start back in 2014 frozen was released and actually i think it was released in 2013 but back in 2014 we made do you want to build a snowman video because mia looks just like little anna and then it went viral so that's how we started what is everyone in your family's vocal ranges i mean i don't know their like exact range of notes but let's see jordan and nathan and taylor sing but they don't like sing sing so i don't really know what their ranges are my guess is they all have kind of medium ranges although nathan's voice has dropped so i don't know it's probably a base now um mia i would say is most comfortable in the mezzo range ari has her strength in alto mezzo range i'm more comfortable in the soprano range robbie and porter and anson actually anson can sing pretty low if i remember right um yeah i think anthon's a baritone i think actually robbing porter are baritones as well they can do tenor stuff but i think they're happiest in the baritone range and jeremy's a base um which sibling are you closest to that kind of depends i think the person that i chat with the most right now is ari but also it just depends on the phase of life like during high school taylor and i were super close we're still close but we like went to school together and shared a room um robbie and i are really close because we work together so it just depends on the situation but i probably chat with ari the most do you feel happy about spending time with when spending time with family yes i love spending time with family oh i miss it i've said that like 10 times on this live already um have i ever felt bored about your life routine i mean not typically but during this pandemic yes jeremy can attest to that i'll go a few weeks and then i'm like i'm losing my mind jeremy we have to do something besides me just going through my emotions of the day okay what kind of natural disasters happen in utah well utah has always been known as a place that like could have a lot of earthquakes but i never experienced one until we were on lockdown this year and i was you know nine months pregnant and we had an earthquake which that was exciting we weren't in the heart of the earthquake it was in salt lake city but we felt it enough that it woke us up and our lights were shaking in the house so earthquakes that's what happens in utah do you learn songs from music or by ear um both typically by ear the most but i can plunk out the notes on a piano favorite book to movie adaption ooh that's a good question um i think the lord of the rings movies are good i think they're really well done i think the bbc probably my favorite is probably um the bbc or the a e pride and prejudice with colin firth i think it's a great adaption the harry potter movies are fun but they're not they don't do justice to the books they're just like a fun dose of harry potter if you need it quickly okay we've got about five more minutes so i'm trying to get through can you do season three of our house we'll see oh yeah i'll toast that some more later and eat it are you leaving i am goodbye farewell live i love you he hates me um we might do season three i don't know we'll see if you want to fund season three then you we will totally do season three it's just kind of a lot of work and it doesn't bring in reference which is okay that's not why we do it we do it for uh-oh i've frozen there we go sorry i just took the camera back and forth we do it apparently we don't make anything off of it you guys should do take a break from hamilton well we might someday my favorite musical instrument i love the sound of a violin my mom plays violin it's lovely basically any string instruments i think are beautiful um favorite outside activity hiking i think hiking is really fun i need to do it i haven't cause i have a baby now and we don't have like an outdoor stroller and i have bad shoulders so i feel like carrying my baby on a hike would be a bad idea and jeremy has bad shoulders too so we're kind of in trouble um there's a dear evan hansen movie what someone just said are you excited for the dear evan hansen movie any advice for actors who want more dance experience take a dance class that sounds like very simple but it kind of is check your local resources sign up for dance class have you ever written an original song no oh yeah when i was in sixth grade or fifth grade or fourth grade fourth grade my friends and i wrote a song called smelly shoe and it was brilliant my favorite type of dance is tap dance guys i love tap dancing it's so freaking fun okay i ever felt that algebra is scary um yes but algebra is probably my favorite kind of math oh somebody asked earlier what my favorite school subject was and i didn't answer um so i was kind of a math nerd my mom majored in math so i was blessed to have a live-in math tutor basically um algebra is definitely my favorite i don't remember any math because the last time i took math was in 11th grade i took ap calculus um so geometry was harder for me but i couldn't help you with your math now because it's not like riding a bike math goes away if you don't use it oh my gosh i just got four more questions can you draw um yeah i'm not like a brilliant artist but i like doing art if you look here turning the camera around i've done all these paintings that are on my bookshelf mostly most of them i copied off of something that i saw on pinterest oops hey i think my baby's awake what did i just do oh shoot okay oh gosh um how does the education system work in america i don't i don't know how to describe it you go to elementary school and then you go to middle school and then you go to high school and then you go to college how long have i been dancing so i don't really dance anymore i danced from i think i started dancing when i was eight and i danced consistently until i was 14 and then i stopped dance for a couple years to do so i could do theater in high school and just theater not in high school so while doing theater i also did dance and i took some dance classes in high school um and then in college i majored in musical theater so i did dance a lot there too so i've kind of danced consistently off and on from age 8 to age 21. but i haven't done dance for a long time i haven't auditioned for a musical in a long time so i miss it okay i got through all the questions i'm gonna really quick hop over to the video scan through it's 4 30 so i'm always surprised at how fast these lives go i'm like oh it's gonna go slow if i'm not doing anything my harry potter five and six books are out of order are they i have to go check yeah they are oh thank you not irritating notice um what's elementary so elementary school is like when you start going when you're five years old and you go until you're 12 years old and then middle school is either like 12 to 14 or 12 to 15 and then high school is like roughly 14 or 15 to 18 17 or 18. okay i think i've answered most of these i'm just skimming what sort of mental breakdown did you have oh are you saying that because i cut bangs you know 20 20 i'll do that to you you have 18 siblings sorry i'm just scanning through comments so i'll be responding to random stuff and then i'm gonna hop off peggy is so underrated correct oh why are the comments disabled in the working with someone's channel youtube we don't have any control over that so youtube has disabled comments on a lot of family channels because people were being creepy in the comments so they did it to protect the kids um which is good but it's a bummer because we don't get to hear from you guys which is why we love when you come to the lives and chat with us and when you come to our premieres for our videos and when you talk to us on instagram since we don't get to hear your comments on our videos anymore okay that's all for now folks thanks for coming to the live sorry my baby slept the whole time but also i'm not sorry because it made this live easier for me i love you i'll see you sometime again or not i mean i'm sure i'll see you sometime again i just don't know how soon it will be um good luck with school now that school's starting back up be safe stay healthy bye this is always the worst part when i have to figure out how to stop the life and not be completely awkward when is the next life we do lives every wednesday unless sometimes we'll bump into a different day in the week if we're like filming and want to go live during that typically every wednesday at this same time so come back next week it might be me it might be someone else and i'm leaving the life now", "ZARz9jiXUdg": "[Music] hello i'm kathleen Messala i'm the living arrangements designer with the original designs team here at Rogers gardens today we're gonna talk about how to grow citrus in containers one of the first steps in successfully growing citrus in containers is selecting the right tree first consider the type of citrus that you and your family would like to consume dwarf trees are ideal for growing in containers two popular choices are the Meyer lemon and the Bears lime they're easy to grow trees and perfect for beginners the next step is selecting the right pot there's a few things to think about to make sure you get your tree off to a good start first choose a pot that's large enough to accommodate several inches of new root growth around the original root ball for the tree that you're planting second consider the shape most interest trees are going to be replanted as they grow so think about the shape of the pot if your pot has a tapered edge that comes in at the top this might make it difficult to remove that root ball when you're ready to transplant the next step in getting your citrus tree after the right start is your soil selection you're gonna want to choose a potting mix that's designed for planting in pots not a planter mix that's designed for planting in flower beds or in the ground a good potting mix is going to have a light airy material that's going to allow for great drainage but it's also going to allow for some soil retention and nutrient retention an organic soil is really important because what you're putting into your pot is going to create a living environment that feeds your plant and these nutrients are going to be taken up into the citrus tree and ultimately end up in the citrus you're consuming when you're ready to plant carefully remove the citrus tree from the container you're gonna want to look at your root ball if you see any obvious dead roots you're gonna want to prune those back if you see any extra long routes that are wrapping around you'll want to prune those back as well this is just gonna help give your citrus tree a jumpstart when you put it in a new soil so it can root nicely for you I've planted my citrus chain leaving a couple inches of room from the top of the pot some things to consider are the depth of your planting you want your entire root ball to be below the soil surface but you want to pay attention to the the crown of your plants you want that to stay up above so there's a graft line where the citrus tree was grafted and you want to make sure that stays above the soil surface and I've left enough space in here where I can add my fertilizer some compost and some topdressing citrus trees are heavy feeders I recommend an organic citrus fertilizer something that is specific for citrus citrus have some special needs and if you have a formula that's specific for citrus you won't have any guessing work wondering if you're meeting all the requirements citrus trees like extra nitrogen they like the soil to be slightly acidic and they really need a lot of extra trace minerals the extra trace minerals might be something that you won't find in a regular NPK fertilizer what I'm going to do with this one is it recommends just sprinkling some fertilizer on the soil surface and gently working it in I've given my citrus tree its initial fertilizing because citrus trees are heavy fertilizers I like to feed my citrus tree every month or two all year long when you plant citrus trees and containers if you're watering correctly when you put a lot of water and it can leach nutrients out of the soil so it always requires heavier fertilizing than something that's planted in the ground I fertilize my citrus trees I'm going to move on to two extra steps I'm gonna add some organic compost to the soil surface and then I'm gonna top truss everything with a wood bark or wood mulch organic compost is a nice stuff that I like to use because I think of it as feeding the soil when you have a healthy soil that soil is gonna do a much better job in feeding your citrus trees what I'm going to do is take a couple handfuls of this organic compost and add this to the surface of my planting I'm taking care all the while to not cover up the crown of my tree the crown of the tree is basically what portion of the tree was above the soil level in the planter when you when you first planted it so you don't want to bring soil up the tree trunk but you want to make sure the roots are covered you want to make sure the root crown is covered so I have this extra space that I've allotted so that I can continue to add my compost as well as my top dressing again applying your top dressing is an optional step but it's a stuff I always take as well apply enough wood mulch leaving at least a half an inch space around the top of the pot citrus trees like evenly moist soils you don't want to let the pot dry out in between each watering but you don't want to put water on top of already wet soil you do want to water deeply so you want to water slowly so that you can envision that water is really soaking in and in saturating the entire root ball if your soil surface is dried out and you pour your water on too quickly water tends to follow the path of least resistance and that water will skirt right off the top down the sides and out the drain hole and never really saturate that root ball so a good way to know if you really need to water your plant is to pull away your mulch surfaces get to the soil feel the soil surface the soil surface may be dry which could indicate you need to water it but dig down an inch or two and make sure that the soil level is not wet below the soil surface if you feel that the soils dried out a good inch or two down go ahead and give yourself your plant a good deep watering on average citrus trees should be watered once - twice a week this can depend on many factors the bigger your pot the less often you have to water the better top dressed your pot is the less often you have to water another factor in loitering is the overall weather pattern if we're in the middle of a hot dry summer you're gonna need to water it more frequently if we're in the middle of a cooler winter spell obviously less watering is required one of the last considerations is to look at the tree and decide if we need to do any pruning one of the first things we're gonna look for is any dead branches this branch is broken it's not gonna does any good so we're gonna remove this branch we also want to look at any branches that are crossing over when they cross and rub on each other that can cause problems it can cause a entry for infection so we would just try to remove any branches that are crossing and causing any issues we can also selectively prune our tree to maintains size and shape we also want to allow for airflow in the center of the tree and sunlight to get in so if you have too many branches in the middle you can selectively prune some of these branches to open up that canopy another thing to consider is as fruit grows on your trees fruit load can be heavy so low-hanging branches will often pull down under the weight of the citrus trees and allow the citrus to rest right on the soil surface you want to eliminate that before any citrus production starts to grow so we'll cut off any low branches to avoid those branches from weighting down and laying on the soil surface the hard part is done your citrus tree is planted and you're looking forward to your first harvest however there will be some maintenance over the years as your tree grows you're gonna need to consider repotting it into a larger planter you'll continue to look for planters that'll allow for a couple inches of new growth space around the root ball you'll also need to do some maintenance trimming on your tree you'll want to maintain the size of the canopy and you'll want to continue to look for broken branches or crossing branches and continue to open up the crown and let some sunlight in don't skip on the fertilizing your tree can give you some indications if it's heavy dark lush green full canopies is indicating that you're feeding it properly if you're seeing yellowing leaves that could be a sign of nutrient deficiency by following these basic steps you should have a happy healthy citrus tree that rewards you with a bountiful crop Roger's Gardens brings Beauty into your home in garden [Music]", "HeHgpCf5Dec": "good afternoon everybody it's Jay again 122 degrees Phoenix Arizona and wanted to make a little observation on this pink lemonade tree that I have so I've got this variegated pink lemon and it's a really big tree now but he's turning pretty much into half half albino tree now and now he's starting to shoot up some really big branches out of here and shot up this huge one just in the last week or so and these they're getting big like these leaves are starting to get really huge you see the size of this one and what's kind of cool about these ones is it's got these little green specks all throughout kind of like pepper like chlorophyll pepper so these aren't quite the full white that the other albinos are like they are down here towards the bottom where they're pure white and man these getting pretty big and pretty healthy and it's funny too because he fruits on those L buy no branches here's one of the fruits and they're starting to turn white towards the top these were green the green starting to fade on the bottom out starting to get the white on the top of the lemon as opposed to its normal lemons which look like this and these start out as green and yellow striped and then eventually they turn this yellow and kind of light pink striped so these are the pink lemons variegated pink lemons it's a Eureka lemon basically and it gets pretty good sized lemons - you see the size of this one nice little handful handful probably almost a pound but yeah he's looking really good out here in this full Sun 122 degree day alright guys thanks for watching", "jLNuNRXDAEA": "so I know you look you can see me look there see see you guys all right you guys so I wanted to show you real quickly I just decided might as well this is I'm going to make the juice this is the Omega I have to look up the thing but I don't remember um you guys this is it said it's not that loud let me turn it on that's how quiet it is and if you see here that's how slow it runs and it also has another thing that's in here another piece that goes in here if you want to switch down I think that's more for like harder foods I think like more I don't know how to explain it my husband is funny other than I can but that's it right there this here is just used this here is to use just to push the stuff down in there and then it goes that in here and it just puts the juice here and all your skin's leftover you know what I'm saying right in here so and then I got my cutting board out I'm gonna cut up what I'm gonna use I'm gonna be using oranges and lemons because lemons are the probably best detoxifying as in literally pushing things out of your body into the toilet you know what I'm saying that's just what I'm saying so anyways and then oranges are good vitamin C hadn't been feeling that well so I love oranges they're good for you so I'm going to use that so yeah okay with this I have my lemons and I will put a sticker off as that would be just not smart I have my oranges and my lemons cut up now you can actually put these with the peeling on into here it will literally take it all off and squeeze the juice out and then throw it out I choose not to do that it does say you can I would kind of think that was nasty because some of these peelings don't taste very well and it will take the seeds out for you the seeds do not end up in your juice it is high-tech like I said it's very nice you'll see when it's going through I'll show you but yeah I'm gonna pull these peelings off because I find that it's better but it is an option like if you want to do like cucumbers things like that you can leave the pilling on you do not have to pill it so which is good I mean some people there are benefits in some pilling so you know okay now that I have my lemons and oranges all peeled I love lemons some people may not like lemons that's you know it may be a little tart you could add apples Apple seems to balance out a lot of juices when they're kind of like tardy or you know gives it more of a sweet taste sometimes if it's like two vegetable E or me is and I'm just going to drop them in here and you'll see if so they put them in there and then in here and just push it down so if you're ever doing like hard stuff and soft stuff you wanted to balance in between so as in like a little bit of soft a little bit of hard what we're doing all soft so drop that in there and in there put that in there and then we're going to push it down in there you guys just watch like look at that is that not like the coolest thing look at that juice though like that's a lot of juice and I will say we've had one of those blenders that blends like so fast it sounds like a flippin tornado going through your house like we've had one and we literally could not get this much juice out Oh like you would see more juice and the feelings that were left over then you would from the juice you were getting to drink so and it just literally just pushes it through and there you see the cheese would slowly come out in there and then the peelings come out here as you see and it just it'll fall out so we so I'm gonna put the rest of this in here just like this I'm gonna set it up here like that it does have a tray up here but you could kind of just like set it like this so when you're ready you can just push it down in there so I think that's the last yea that's the last I'm 9 so I'm just gonna like push it down in there like that [Music] this was so simple and the cleanups so easy just this attachment comes off and you just clean it that's it it is so easy to put together sometimes I forget how to do it though because I use it in a while but there it is and you let it run for a few minutes just so all the juice will flow down through there and there's all your pilling something let me get someone show you guys like look look look at that like that is dry that's what you want to see when you're juicing it looks like it's working my hands are wet but this is literally dry there's no juice left in this at all it's literally just nothing left and that that's crazy I mean all the nutrients has been squeezed out so this is what you want to see when you're juicing is nothing left like literally dry so crazy cool huh so there is my juice I'm probably done letting it and run so we'll turn that off so I'm gonna get this cleaned up and pour it into a cup and then we're gonna try it alright guys so this is my juice and as you can see here this is about as much as you get so that's why I'm saying that it's truly important that an incision one of these little blender bottles you know you can buy at Walmart but I'm just throwing it in there so you guys can see through and if you look in the top you could tell like the little bitty like foam that's a little bit of Pulp in there and that happens that's obviously gonna happen with oranges unless you know I don't know anyways see how it's like a little foamy that's what happens with juices which is what you kind of want it's actually healthy but I'll show you guys this is a strainer that it comes with it looks like this this comes with the juicer and I use this a lot my husband likes the foam but like especially when you use vegetables and stuff they tend to get really foaming especially like apples so I will pull my juicer through this a couple of times to get that foam out because I don't like it and see how easy cleanup was like it's just these pieces they pull apart quickly and you're done so back to here so this is it that's why I think stressing to is it truly important if you can get a juicer that really gives you your money's worth of fruit cuz even though that looked like a lot that was like three oranges and three or four oranges and lemon and this is how much juice you get so I mean make sure you're getting your money's worth with our old home we'd have probably gotten about that much so it's expensive so you want to make sure you're getting your money's worth so let's get orange it is oh my god it smells so lemony taste a little different cuz I brush my teeth but on it's got some pulp in it not a lot I don't like poopy orange juice but this is really good the orange balance out the lemon so oh my god I love lemon so this tastes so good to me it's like drinking lemon juice with sweetness of orange in it you guys I could drink like a whole cup of this so it's really good we bought some like vacuum silk cups to produce is in I don't think I have one up there when we make them if we premade them which is what you want if you make a juice drink it well then I think about an hour's so I'll have to look it up I'll give them more in depth when I talk about more of my juicing but to make sure that you're getting all the benefits and the nutrients is instead of leaving the sitting out so this is really good guys so it was three or four oranges and on lemon you can always add more to make more juice or if you want more tardi lemon and more lemon less oranges whatever you want to do but this here guys it's so good and this would be great for breakfast with something to eat or just this alone so mmm oh my gosh I can literally drink this all day so I hope you guys enjoy remember to Like and subscribe and I will be on here with more videos of juices I make and if you have anything in mind or are looking for a certain type of juice or certain effects from a juice let me know in the comments down below and I'll be glad to look up some recipes and try them for you guys and everything like that so that being said I hope you guys have a blessed day and I was you guys on my next video [Music]", "VGDXBizAonk": "yeah yeah yeah Desktop is so yeah can you tell you should maybe talk to your bees Oh

"isSZUTqz9aw": "citrus fruit the orange a grapefruit lemon and the line they are just essential to cooking and they're wonderful to eat I want to show you from the sourest to the sweetest and down here I have them lined up the sourest of them all is the lemon and it's made to be that way we do not expect it to be sweet you can get it you know as a fruit you can get it one-hundred percent lemon juice which you can use this is great to have around so you can make the acid water for those vegetables and fruit that turn brown you can also get it as lemonade sugar is added to lemons to make it lemonade then there are limes limes are green inside whereas lemons are yellow when you buy limes most people look for the greenest actually that's the most immature you want to look for ones that have yellow on them they are the ripe 'used which is kind of strange it looks almost like a little tiny lemon then you also can get the lime juice and use it for the acidulated water for those things that turn brown they also make limeade so that you can drink it they've had to add sugar to it too then there's grapefruit and this is probably my favorite of the citrus fruits just to eat there's smaller ones that are yellow there's there's the come in different varieties of sizes they come in shades from yellow to almost red meat inside you can get grapefruit juice frozen you can get grapefruit juice in there usually in the refrigerated section and then you can get grapefruit segments because I taking them out for you to eat I love to eat these and then we have the sweetest of the citrus fruits this their oranges and the insides orange the outsides orange they make orange juice that's just plain they make orange juice that has other fruit in it this one has pine bananas and oranges have a great variety of those and then they have the orange juice has pulp in it or no pulp in it or extra pulp in it any of its good then they have small containers of one juice for lunches and snacks there are snack sizes of the oranges they are usually mandarin oranges Mandarin or Musa one of the ones like tangerines are easy easy to peel you can also buy it in big jar sections of oranges and then of course you can buy the orange drink the orange juice that's already refrigerated and in the refrigerator case at the grocery store this group of fruit our ascent they are the vitamin C's of all the fruit world that's the highest thing they all have high rates of vitamin C so most of the time we just eat grapefruits and oranges I want to show you a couple other ways to fix them so let me move these out of the way so you can see what i've done is i have google all this over because i have sliced up some oranges there just sliced they have the rind on they just slice them i have three or five three of these you can just sit these on a grill let me show you how my grill on the indoor grill you just sit them on here and let them get brown it doesn't take very long you just want to heat them through and it's amazing how delicious they are hot and you have to try it most people haven't done that the other thing you can do is you can bake them so let's take this one and my neck here is and you peel off as much as you can of the Rhine and you take off as much of the white this one isn't really a juicy one okay now you're down to the meat and you don't have to peel it so much as you want to really cut it off because when you peel you leave a lot of the white on and when the white gets cooked is kind of bitter although some of us don't seem to mind that very much because if they're got some honey on them so what we do then you would smear this with the honey I have some honey and butter he's just melted together in the microwave and you just smear that on the top you can put as many as you can into a pan and you just bake these at 325 and they will turn the most golden color and they will be so delicious and I have a friend that loves to eat lemons I cannot eat a lemon by itself but you can also do that to those and put those in the baking dish you can do with the limes and of course you can do it with the grapefruit on the oranges so that's a great way to cook it and it's a nice way to give it to somebody who doesn't like to have the mess of it you haven't served it for a while for breakfast or lunch so now you can have it for a dinner meal to do citrus fruit one of the best things to do is to roll it back and forth a few times and you'll feel it gets softer and it'll break up the juices inside and then you want to cut it in half then matter which one it is an orange or lime or lemon and then you want to juice it on your juicer I'm using my hand juicer which you push down and twist it back and forth to get off all the juice and you can see all of a sudden it will quit coming you want to be sure you get up against the Rhine where there's a lot of juice so then we would pour this in to the rest and now we get my next one ready now the other thing you often hear about for the citrus fruits is zesting it so I wanted to show you what that is on your graders they have different sized little holes this is the zesting halls the littlest holes and what you can do is you can it's the color part of the oranges and the grapefruit lemons and limes they use all those different zests and you just grave it on there and will come out the other side and you'll notice it's coming off and then you'll see it and you can take that and using a recipe they only want a quarter teaspoon half a teaspoon because it is really full of the perfumes of the fruit and so you can just take that off with a spoon and stick it into your dish and you can also zest after you've had like so you decided to bake a few you people doll that off so now you have your zest you can put this in the freezer for a little while to keep it and speaking of the freezer one of the best ways to keep citrus is you can squeeze them all and you can use your electric squeezer or you can usual hand squeezer and then you can pour them into ice trays and make Omega P ice cubes these happen to be lines this one hundred percent lime juice and then I just after I freeze them in the ice trays I take them out to put them in a bag this can be used for your acidulated water you know you can make it into ice cubes for a drink I put it into the water and you'll have lemon water so there's a lot more stuff about citrus fruits on my website so please go and check it out you", "lziMy5a16vU": "[Music] watch Calvinist welcome to artists Anya's recipes our menu today is lemon jam here are the ingredients for lemons 1 cup of water 2 cups of granulated sugar the lemons here have a thick rind I am cutting off the tips on both ends I am slitting the lemon very gently as if I am cutting it into wedges I am making sure I'm not cutting the flesh of the lemon I will peel the lemons off now now I am chopping the lemon peel into small squares [Music] well I am now removing the white bits from its flesh and I am slicing the lemons now with the knife I am getting rid of the seeds and also removing the hard bits in the center [Music] I am now chopping the slices into small pieces i boiled some water and I am now placing the lemon peels inside in order to get rid of the bitterness from the peels I will boil them for three to four minutes and afterwards drain them I will repeat this process two more times so I will boil another batch of fresh water put the peels inside let them boil for three to four minutes and then again I will boil the third and final batch of water boiled appeals for three to four minutes and drain them we need to do this three times in total this is the first batch I am draining the peels and putting them back into the emptied pot I will fill it with water and let the peels boil again I've done it three times now so let's move on to the next step I am adding the sugar in the pot and the water now let's put it on the hob I am waiting for the water to boil now the water has boiled so I am adding the peels I will let it boil for a few minutes the peels have to boil for about three to four minutes now the peels have boiled about for three to four minutes now I am now adding the lemon flesh in the pot it will cook on medium heat my pot has boiled for half an hour and it's ready now as you can see our Jam has thickened I am now transferring it to a glass jar our jam has turned out great it's not sour and quite the contrary it has a pleasantly tangi taste to it I highly recommend that you try this recipe you can store it in a cool and dry place enjoy [Music] you", "4eTnJ-MeM1c": "well a lover when it's Luke from the mi Gardner channel here with another very exciting episode for you today today we're going to be doing a complete growing guide on how to grow citrus indoors this is a very highly requested growing guide so I know you all are going to enjoy it before we get started I wanted to give a big thank you to eco scraps for sponsoring this episode eco scraps is a company that partners with restaurants and grocery stores to reduce the amount of food that's entering landfills because it's a real shame that every single year Americans throughout over 30 million tons of food scraps that could normally be composted and that equals about one fifth of the total landfill composition so it's crazy when you look at a landfill imagine one-fifth of that being apple cores and celery stalks and things that would normally be thought of as just kind of food byproducts or maybe even food that just didn't even go eaten which is a real shame because that also results in lots of methane gas which contributes to global warming and also is stuff that can be composted and so what they've done is they've actually partnered with the restaurants and grocery stores so that they can compost those food scraps that would normally go into the landfill and they turn it into a sustainable source of food for your plants now the first part we're going to talk about with this growing guide is the soil when it comes to citrus the soil is so crucial for having long-term success oftentimes people they just go with a bagged soil or our compost and they assume it's going to be totally fine however it's only to be fine for a very short period of time because the thing about citrus is they have very finicky roots citrus are grown in arid climates very well draining sandy soils and so the soil that you choose for your potted plant actually has to match that environment because you're going to find that the roots they will rot and die if you go with anything else so coming in close I'm going to show you the soil that I'm using because it's extremely important to having a successful citrus tree so the potting soil mix that works best for us we find is a one-part mixture of spagna moss vermiculite perlite and coconut coir and that gives you a very well draining mix another thing that you can do if you can't locate those ingredients is you can actually mix up two parts sand to one part beg big basically bagged compost and that's going to work just fine too but basically you want a gritty texture because that gritty texture allows little air pockets so that the water can drain through very fast because you don't want the water sticking around very long the next thing with this potting soil is it has very high porosity that means it holds on to water just enough so that it's like a damp sponge but it doesn't hold on to any more than that next thing we talk about is fertilizer when growing citrus citrus have specific needs that are different from other plants so it's important when you're choosing your fertilizer to start with a citrus specific fertilizer this fertilizer here was made for citrus avocado and palm trees because they all have very similar requirements one more component to fertilizing that is very important is the amount of times you fertilize citrus need to be fertilized two times a year and it's very important to do so in the right times spring and summer is the times you want to be fertilizing and as fall approaches or when you want to move them back indoors it's very important to lay off the fertilizer because it's going to stress the plant out and by reducing the amount of fertilizer it's going to slow the growth of the plant so that there's less stress when you move it back indoors also what you want to do is you want to lay off the fertilizer when it's getting ready to flower which is in the winter months so you don't to fertilize then either because it will push out a lot of flowers and that will also stress out the plant because it's indoors and it's already not really receiving the environment that it would get down south in Florida or California or Texas and so you want to make sure that it doesn't over flower and by reducing the amount of fertilizer it gets that's going to help kind of reduce the amount of flowers that it puts out the next thing we're not talking about is pH because that also ties into this fertilizer here so now we're going to about pH when it comes to pH as we talked about very briefly in the fertilizer aspect of this video the pH of citrus needs to be around five point five to six because they like it to be a little more acidic and so ideally you want to replicate that environment in a pot so you have a better chance of success but if you don't to worry about the pH this eco scratched fertilizer already has it built right in and so that's again why you should go with a nice citrus based fertilizer the next where to talk about is temperature oftentimes people they want to move their citrus trees outdoors and me included when the summer time comes out it goes but you want to make sure that the nice stay above 45 degrees because the fact is citrus obviously do not like the cold climates they can tolerate something in the high 30s but I prefer never to give them that because it can stress them out and it can cause leaf drop oftentimes when you have yellowing of leaves or some leaf drop what can happen is that can be caused from the cold temperatures and then warming up it shocks the plant and citrus they don't typically get shocked very often in the climates they grow in so it's important not to shock your citrus either the next thing we're talking about is sun exposure it is very important with citrus if you want to get them to fruit to put them in about 4 to 6 hours of full Sun optimized people ask me why is my citrus not fruiting and I asked them how much sunlight they're getting and they're just not getting enough it's enough to sustain the plant because actually believe it or not if you just want to keep this as foliage these only require about 3 to 5 hours of Sun as foliage but if you wanna get them to fruit they require a little more energy and that's what that extra sunlight is going to do to put out that fruit so about 46 hours of full Sun if you can give them more that is great like I said I put mine out on my patio as soon as the weather is warm enough but a lot of people don't have patios so just a nice south-facing windows going to suffice also if you don't even have a south-facing window what's very important is at least putting it in a window that's going to get around 3 hours 4 hours of Sun and then supplementing with a compact fluorescent bulb during the night for about another 4 to 6 hours and that should give you enough energy to put out fruit the very last component to growing citrus successfully is watering as we talked about in the soil part of this video you do not want to overwater your citrus and so you can make sure that you don't overwater by one of two ways the first way is by getting a soil moisture meter this is going to cost you between 10 and 15 dollars but it's going to make sure that you know if your soil is too dry or too wet and then the next method which is free that we like to call the to knuckle method it's worked for me so I'm sure it will work for you is by measuring down about two knuckles if it's dry about two Knuckles deep you're going to know that you need to water the reason why you don't want to over water your plants is because the fact that as we talked about in the soil aspect of this video citrus are very prone to root rot rot happens when the soil stays damp for a long time there's bacteria in the soil and it will act usually eat away the roots and the roots will begin to rot and that stresses out the plant and the first sign of root rot is by the leaves turning yellow and dropping off of the plant this is the first sign that you've over watered the next sign of over watering is the fact that the plant will die from the top down and so what you want to do is you want to just reduce your watering and that's going to make sure that you don't have any more root rot now I get asked all the time if you can grow a citrus tree from seed now this may seem like a very novel idea because it's very cool to say you grew something from seed until it fruits however pop denies people don't have the patience to get it all the way till fruiting because the fact that growing from seed till fruit can take about ten years so that's a very long time to wait and especially because you may wait for the 10 years and find that you do not even get an orange that you can eat and that could be very discouraging because of the fact that oranges are open pollinated and what that means the fact that any bee can touch any orange and you'll get a combination so the orange you're eating you might say oh this is the sweetest juiciest orange ever I want to grow this you wait 10 years and you get a little dinky orange because it came from a kumquat tree so you never really know what you're going to get and that's why I suggest starting from a seedling you can get these from a nursery or optimized big-box stores you can get them online as well they sell a grafted citrus tree and what that means is going to be a dwarf which is important because you don't want a 20-foot tall tree indoors it's very heavy to lug around and it's also something that's going to be manageable for you to grow indoors also what happens is the fact that it's grafted onto something that they know what the genetics are they take a cutting from this is a wash of the navel so they take they take a graft from a Washington navel and so you know you're going to get Washington navel oranges it's also going to fruit sooner because they take it from a fully mature tree so you're not going to be waiting 10 years you're going to waiting maybe one to two so which is really nice and it's going to help you out because it's oftentimes very discouraging to wait and not see anything so now it's time to transplant once you've found the variety that you want to grow and you've gotten your hands on a beautiful plant it's important to transplant within one to two weeks of getting it because the path of these grow in are called root pots and they're very deep but narrow pops and so your plants are going to be stressed if you leave them in there for a long time however you also do not want to transplant them into too large of a pot this is a huge mistake that people make they just say I only want to transplant it once then I want to basically once and done forget about it and that's going to end up killing your plant for one reason and one reason only the size of the pot has a big difference on how dry the soil gets the more soil you have the more chance of root rot you have because the soil is going to hold on to water and if there's not roots taking up that water and roots kind of taking up the space in the pot the soil is going to hold on to that water really close to the roots so instead of a large plastic pot like this we've chosen a smaller clay pot and the reason why clay is great because it actually wicks away moisture so you're going to have two things you're going to have the wicking action from the clay and you're also going to have the fact that it's a smaller pot so there's not going to be as much space for soil to actually hold onto that water near the roots so now it comes time to transplanting up you want to put just a couple handfuls in the bottom of the pot just to give it something to cushion up against just put a little couple handfuls down there then what you want to do is in order to get the plant out of the pot success without ruining any roots your own damaged roots because that just causes stress let's put your hands in between the stem using your pointer finger and middle finger put it right there tip the plant upside down squeeze the bottom of the pot give it a nice couple taps and it should come right out there we go you don't wanna do any pulling just let gravity do the work and now we have a beautiful plant here and what you want to do you want to make sure that the plant has not been buried up the stem any which it in this case it has oftentimes that happens in transit you want to make sure that the plant is right at soil level do not let any soil come up here on the stem because that's actually going to what do what's called girdle this is going to girdle the stem and it's going to actually cause stem rot so make sure you've taken away that soil stick in the pot there and that we're going to do is we're going to simply back Phil alright so now that we've gotten the soil about halfway up the pot now is when we're going to fertilize this is only done at transplanting time after that you can top dress and I'll show you what top dressing is in a second you want to take about one cup of fertilizer sprinkle it around the plant and then work it in with your fingers what this is going to do is it's going to put the fertilizer right where the roots need it because oftentimes when you transplant it takes a while for the top dressed fertilizer if you were at a top dress to get down to the bottom so it's important to fertilize right away right near the base you give them a little bit more and again this is nice Omri listed organic fertilizer so it's not going to burn the roots which is also important and then we're simply going to fill the rest up with soil alright so we are just about finished here one more thing before we finish is that I wanted to talk about kind of how it should look once it's been transplanted you want to make sure that the top of the soil level in the container is just below the root ball what that's going to create is a little bit of a slope down and this is exactly how orange growers grow them on large citrus farms is because the fact that because they're so prone to root rot it's nice to have the water slide away from the roots so by mounting up a little bit of the soil around the base or by elevating the plant a little bit it's going to give that slope that's naturally going to wash the water down it's important when you're first transplanting to really soak the plant if you have the right soil type it's actually going to run right out the bottom and so you can soak the plant initially and then let it dry out later the very last thing that you want to do is make sure that you remove these white bands in trends that they put this here in order to stabilize the plant but it's very important to remove these because it's going to actually girdle the stem if you don't so they're usually stapled on they are removed very easily and you just want to do that because that's again going to help you to have a more successful plant so if you leave those on in about a year that's going to be very very tighter on there it's going to choke the plant so now I'm going to show you how to top dress this is one of my larger Meyer lemons I've been growing for a few years now it's a beautiful 4 or 5 foot tall plant and what you want to do when you're top dressing you just want to take some of your fertilizer and you want to use about a cup right around the base sprinkle it in and then what you wan to do is you just want to take your hands and work it in with your fingers what that's going to do is it's going to make sure that you don't damage any roots don't use a shovel and dig it in because it's going to cut roots just use your hands and then it's very important to water it in well that's going to do is that's going to make sure that the fertilizer gets carried down into the root system where it's needed so there you go there is a complete growing guide on how to grow citrus indoors hopefully you all enjoyed hopefully you learned something new and again a big thank you to eco scratch for sponsoring this video I'm going to post links to where you can find this fertilizer in the description box below hopefully you go check it

up guys I'm gonna show you how to get all the fruit trees and build out your own orchard in this video guys so there's only really one way to do this right now and we have you can see all the fruit trees here we've got avocado we've got orange we've got lemon and we've got apple all growing in an orchard multiple trees guys this is it there's really only one way and I'm gonna tell you how [Music] and check this out holy moly everybody has a different fruit tree that is native to the island that you get and then to get the other ones you've got to trade with people look look there it is it's a little apple tree inside my hand I'm gonna plant it right there oh look at my little baby apple tree I need the water that tree and put some stinky fish on it well I just like put this fish on the tree and like maybe it'll grow faster this is not a catfish treat this is a baby apple tree guys and that is gonna grow and give me some apples in there must be a whole bunch of like new recipes I hope that use all the new fruit and stuff like that this is very exciting guys this is a new era so I have apple trees if you've got some other kind of tree and you want to trade let me know I have no idea how we get new saplings though because those are not going to be available in the shop are they and so when you cut a tree down you get one sapling so how are we gonna get more apples alright I'm gonna go to town and double-check this thing cuz I just don't know guys do me a favor hit the like button I really appreciate it don't forget to sub turn on the notifications come to our license we've been doing a lot of Skyblock live streams kind of like you know doing Island reviews and checking out people's islands doing giveaways and stuff like wait a minute there's an avocado tree sapling I can buy that so now I have an avocado tree but that's it is that what so maybe everybody gets to do an avocado tree let's go planner avocado tree do oh look my output trees already all grown up and stuff it looks so beautiful over here just hanging out and all of its bapple ino apple glory there's no apples on this thing is that really an apple tree doesn't it look like an apple tree but check this out I got an avocado tree so let's plant the avocado just put that over in this corner over there it's alright little baby avocado that's up to you I need to make some guacamole let's get the best guacamole I had to bring Milo into the video to do the guacamole some Milo take it away peel the avocado peel Yano block go away go away blah go away lock them all away whoa holy moly Milo it worked you did it Hey Thank You Milo the guacamole this is my guacamole [Music] so I don't know like when the fruit ends up on these things are I just don't know I'll wait a little bit and we're gonna go check out some of the other stuff in this update cuz there is like a whole bunch of stuff maybe when we come back we'll have some avocados and some apples and we'll make an applicator guacamole something or other alright so check this out we now have a food processor which will cook items for us automatically you need the new crystallized gold so guys this update just came out I mean I flipped on my cameras within five minutes of the tweet okay so I don't have any crystallized gold yet but I just wanted to make this video super quick because I'm super excited now we got a we need crystallized gold and I'm assuming the only way to get that is you just break you know give buffle cores and the gold yeah and you're only gonna get crystallized gold sometimes all right hold up hold up hold up cuz I'm also looking on the game page and it says right here selling food to the baker is now much more profitable let's go check out what that means but let me tell you what I think this means they're working really hard to balance this economy and the onion Gold auto farming kind of market they got to do something about it and do something even better that you really can't afk so you wanna be able to make some money afk but you want to make even more money without afk I think this is how they're gonna do it so they also said which is pretty interesting that items no longer collide on the conveyor belts so this situation right here you'll see this would normally be like a big stack of onions but watch them all fall in instead of piling up now what happens is they just sort of stack up and they're not bumping into each other creating a pile so they're just sort of queued up right at the face of the thing right there so I don't know how that's gonna affect production yet it may be good it may be worse and it may be just the same so we're going to do some tests so I'm gonna be like doing some time tests soon here and I'll let you guys know if I have any results yeah I'm gonna have to run some time tests like overnight to kind of see really the big difference so definitely like come to a live stream I'll be able to tell you or maybe check the description after I've done it or maybe I'll put out a new video or something like that kind of like exploring exactly how that's a to us and now we have the Baker okay so the baker is now buying apple pie for 225 coins okay so if I could bake a bunch of apple pies that would be it's good money I mean it's more than 30 for an onion so you know if clean onions 30 and apple pies 225 so if I now have automated baking recipes and we can figure out some kind of like automated restaurant incurring it could be pretty interesting where we have like farms automatically washing crops and then baking things and then spitting out finished products that we could then sell like this like if I had like you know five thousand apple pies right now that would be that would be one point one two five million actually five thousand apple pies one point one two five million so somebody could set up like an automated apple pie thing that would be amazing now of course you know the recipes change but now instead of just two or maybe there was three before now we have five different recipes that are in here that you can sell this is turning out to be pretty interesting I mean we're gonna work on this I'm gonna try to figure out a design guys to make the very first automated bakery when we make products from raw ingredients to finish put them in a chest and boom this can be done a buddy so I'm assuming that you teen has done a little work with his alts and he has every single fruit tree look at this we got avocados apples lemons like what is this thing here so that's a lemon there's another lemon what do we got over here we got an orange and there's the avocado and we got an apple and and yeah oh thanks for the apples but and orange so what there's only like what four fruit trees right now just four pieces of fruit boom boom boom yeah so right now you just get one sapling that means you're only going to be able to have one fruit tree period per character right now so there's absolutely no way even if you're like started with Apple like I did you could never have two or three apple trees unless you do the thing with the alts I don't know they're gonna change that in the future but I think that's what we're gonna have to do right now to get a little orchard going like this then you're gonna have to use a whole bunch of alts to make that happen and that's not undoable but it's kind of weird way of sort of like gaming the system but you know how it is we're gonna have to do that and so that's it guys really the only way to get every single fruit tree right now is with alts because when you cut down a tree you only get the one sapling back you only start with one sapling and that's it I bought the avocado from the store but the rest of these I'm gonna have to make alts to get them all and I'm gonna do it because I'm gonna make the first automated restaurant where we're cooking apple pies and selling them for the big bucks you've got to stay tuned to see that video guys so sub turn on notifications guys if you're a good builder in Skyblock we need you on the team so join the discord down below there's a link and we got some special team project builds plus we've got

and let's chat and I'm gonna sign up for now I got a lot of grinding to do and a lot of office to make so I'll see you in the next video peace [Music]", "hMU539xQY98": "hey guys how's it going today i want to show you how to make this beautiful dehydrated orange wreath it's really easy to do and there's something just beautiful in the simplicity of it it's just so pure looking and i feel like you could use this any time of the year because citrus just works any time of the year so we're getting close to the holidays now i'm going to display this inside and it's going to be gorgeous and it'll fit right in with my holiday decor but it'll also fly right into winter and look beautiful and fresh and then spring it'll work and somewhere it'll work i think it all depends kind of on the ribbon that you choose and you don't even have to use ribbon if you don't want to you can just leave it just the oranges i chose this kind of minty sage green ribbon and i think it looks really beautiful so let me go through the steps of how to do it so this project doesn't take very many supplies to complete which is one of the beautiful parts about it you'll want to start by dehydrating your oranges first because that can be a several hour process depending on what method you choose to dry them with so let me walk through how i got my oranges to look this way so first off i started with my box full of fresh oranges you want to choose oranges that are all really nice there's no mold or soft spots or anything like that and then you want to start slicing them and when you slice try to get them as even as possible i mean mine aren't super precise but the closer they are in size the thickness of each slice the more they will dry evenly and at the same time and that's always kind of nice to not have to you know pull the thin ones out and then leave the thicker ones in longer once mine were all sliced up i put them in my dehydrator and so i just laid them out in a single layer on each one of the racks they were touching and that was okay because when they start to dry they kind of shrink up a little bit and then i set my temperature at 135 degrees and ran it for four hours at the end of the four hours i checked it they were still a little bit moist so i ran it again for another four hours so at 135 degrees i found that it took about eight hours to get my oranges to look like this but they all came out really even and i find there's a little bit of difference between drying them in a dehydrator and in the oven when you dry them in the oven they tend to be a little bit more uneven in color which can be good because you can have a little bit more variation there some will be a little bit darker some will be a little bit lighter and i think that depends on your oven as well my oven is not that great so if you have a nicer probably newer oven than me they would dry just fine in the oven and typically like my oven only goes down to 200 degrees so i would set it at 200 degrees and it would take about two and a half to three hours depending on how thick you slice them so now you've got your oranges all dried and that's going to be the longest part of this whole entire project the rest of it is very simple we're going to need to create a wreath form that's very flat so to do that we're going to use a piece of cardboard that i just grabbed out of our barn and you'll also need a stencil so your stencil will kind of determine how big your wreath is so you could use a smaller plate than this this is a charger that i had and i know i want my wreath to be slightly bigger than this so this is going to work out great and then i've got a pen so i can trace it scissors to cut it out you need hot glue spray paint is optional i'm just going to put a light layer over the cardboard just in case we get a glimpse of it at any point i want it to look gold instead of looking like cardboard and then some ribbon to hang it so those are the supplies i'm going to clear the table now and we'll show you step by step how to create the wreath [Music] do [Music] all right it's done i think it looks beautiful laying down but you never can really tell until you hang it whether or not you've got it completely even and sometimes i have to hot glue little pieces in but i want to pick it up right here before we take it inside which we're going to do here in a minute just to see how the ribbon hangs here because i might want to adjust i might not need to adjust look at that oh and that took what 20 minutes to put together erin well 20 minutes plus eight hours of orange dehydrating time that is gorgeous i love it okay so let's take it inside and there it is didn't it end up being the perfect size for that mirror and it just adds such a nice pop of color over here the lighting's a little bit weird because it's so bright outside but it's just oh just adds to the cozy christmas feel in here and the fact that it's going to stay nice for indefinite amount of time is even better so anyway that is going to be it for today's project i hope you enjoyed it such an easy thing to do and you don't need any special equipment you don't need a dehydrator you can just dry the oranges in your oven and you can take it different directions too like you can add in some dried apples if you want or some cinnamon sticks and you can add more texture i just wanted to go with kind of the simplistic look which i think we got so thank you guys so much for watching this video and we will see you in the next one bye", "xVNPONQR3m0": "this year I can barely say DIY Christmas without talking about Hyuga Hyuga is the Danish word for a mood of coziness and a comfortable way of living that evokes feelings of wellness and contentment to [Music] me it's all about togetherness family and filling my house with love and nothing says family at the holidays to me more than making our own Christmas ornaments together these oranges are going to make the perfect addition to my Hyuga Christmas and they're really easy to do the first step is to slice your oranges you want thin slices so they don't take forever to dehydrate but you don't want them so thin that they are too fragile I'm not looking for uniform there is something special about bringing nature in your decor its flaws and all once you have your oranges sliced lay them out in a single layer on your pan my oven has a dehydrate mode but if yours doesn't bake them at a hundred forty degrees Fahrenheit if your oven has a fan to turn that on - it took me a total of about seven hours to dehydrate my orange slices flipping them over one time about halfway through they don't need to be dried in one uninterrupted setting I took mine out to make dinner and then I put them back in the oven later that night once they are completely done and cooled you can poke a little hole in your orange and a piece of string or yarn through it's as easy as that these are some of the easiest and most versatile ornaments I've ever made they look great on the Christmas tree on my real evergreen garland and in my Christmas tree trimming centerpieces make sure to LIKE this video and subscribe to my

think should play anna and live action frozen i mean i'd like to say me uh that might be a little a little cocky of me but i think they should just hire working with lemons to do it and that would be the best um what's the stupidest fight you've ever had with your siblings honestly and i know this sounds like i'm lying but me and my siblings don't really fight i'm trying to think of the stupidest fight that i've had with my siblings i mean like when we were little we would fight so one time my mom came downstairs because me and porter were both screaming and we were screaming because one of us had bit the other one and we wouldn't let go and so the other one like so she came down to me we were just biting each other but i don't know what started it so fave video i've ever done i'd like to say little mermaid that one was just amazing so incredible um [Music] can you do a song from the radio showman we actually we got to do a little performance of the greatest showmen um someone hired us to do a little concert version of it and i did tightrope i played the the wife and it was so fun it's we don't really want to do them on our channel as much because they're already live action so we don't know what would make them stand out more you know um i have seen the anastasia musical and i love the anastasia musical i saw it on broadway in 2018 with um christie altimer and she's so good um porter is good he just had coveted um him and his wife just got covered they're like done quarantining now they're all safe um they didn't have super bad symptoms they lost their sense of taste and smell a little bit but other than that they were pretty okay um i was actually someone asked if i had seen the wizard of oz or if i had if we would do music videos first of all and i did wizard of oz a couple years ago in 2018 i was just in the ensemble but i got to be the dorothy body devil and so i was the one that got to like fly through the air in the tornado hooked up to the fly system it was so good [Music] um i love this one princess someone said can you this is my idea from this one princess and that's like the first thing that i watched when i got into quarantine because it's on hulu right now this is my idea such a good idea it's so good um yeah camry i guess told people in the last slide that i have coveted i do have covet but i'm doing okay i don't have severe symptoms at all and i'm almost done quarantining friday is my last day where i'll be locked up and then i'll be free to go back into the world um i have not had enough water good suggestion thank you denzel because favorite disney princess i mean eric oh here's the thing i love ariel and i'm so attached to her because i love her but if we're talking about like the princess that i would want my kids to be like or

disney channel show i love hannah montana um i love how to montana and i also love which is a literally place that was one that me and my siblings watched when we got disney plus we were like oh we have to watch was there's a waverly place so we watched all of that during quarantine we finished it so it was really good timing hmm hogwarts house i'm a hufflepuff and proud of it anson is good favorite disney live-action movie um that's a hard question honestly and i love the live-action movies but i haven't loved any of them as much as i've loved the animations because they haven't done like i think that cinderella would have been my favorite live-action movie and it maybe still is but they didn't have enough music in there like even though cinderella doesn't um she doesn't have like a ton of songs i still wanted to have more of her songs in there um favorite hannah montana character other than miley yeah miley's not my favorite montana character she's kind of she's kind of dumb but probably i love lily who is my favorite i mean i'm team i'm team jesse i'm not team jake so maybe maybe jesse um favorite role in a show that i've done i don't know it it depends uh there's some shows that have been like super fun because the cast has been amazing or just like the experience has been amazing but the role wasn't necessarily my favorite like role so maybe favorite role would be

know how many of you guys can drive but there's like the lanes that you drive in and then they'll have like a little like bike lane or a turning lane and it's when people don't use the turning lane when there is one if there's not a turning lane there then like i get it whatever but if there's a turning lane and you just slow down in the driving lane before you turn that drives me nuts um [Music] favorite harry potter movie and the least favorite harry potter movie um favorite harry potter movie is probably uh the third one harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban which i feel like is a common favorite because it's the best one uh my least favorite honestly maybe chamber of secrets uh but i'm feel like that's maybe the one that i've seen the most maybe besides the third one so maybe i'm just like sick of that one for some reason i don't know uh someone asked if i would play as christine daye she's a beautiful character and i would love to i'm just not a soprano and so i don't think that i could seeing her parts very well um favorite place you've traveled to i love new york new york might be my favorite place i've ever traveled to it always depends on like what vibe

watched that as a family and it was so fun do you have any tips on how to memorize a monologue yes um for me i like to obviously read it a ton um highlight it make notes on it but i also like to sit and try and remember it and write down what i can remember and then go through and like find what i forgot and fix that and just write it down a bunch and also if you read it right before you go to bed then your brain like works on it overnight and so that helps you memorize as well uh i have not heard about the author frank l cole would i play anna or elsa um honestly maybe in the broadway recording i would probably play elsa i think my voice type fits hers better i just look really bad as a blonde so maybe if you're far enough away it would be okay but i also fit on this so have you ever seen lion king on broadway i haven't i haven't seen that one yeah sorry guys i'm kind of sleepy i think i'm i'm really kind of hungry i haven't had much food today but i can't decide what i want

about it it's so cute oh that's cute so that'll be exciting it's for christmas um can you do a song from rent or mary poppins for the fundraiser or just in general i'll share about stage fright though uh stage fright like just doing more shows helps but even still i get stage fright right before i walk on but i think it's good to get stage fright um because it just means that you're excited to do it and so you have to just kind of remind yourself that uh stage fright is excitement dixie my dog just came in come on up um what are you feeling about uh wicked the musical i love wicked it's fantastic i would absolutely eat cheesecake you guys keep suggesting that and i would if we had any but we don't so would you ever get a piercing or a tattoo i have both my ears pierced i also have a

like singing in public any tips my dog is being so needy right now here give her a look she just keeps pawing me to give her more attention um the thing is you don't have to sing to be in a play i love doing straight plays i don't do enough of them but i think straight plays are so fun or you can be you know you could start doing plays that uh don't have as much singing in them or where you're in the ensemble so you don't have to sing alone there's lots of things you can do there's even characters that don't really sing or don't sing as much so you can get started on that have you ever read

folks this is all the fruit and today we want to find out among other things why the british are called limeys well spoiler alerts they are called limeys for the same reason the germans are called krauts it's all about vitamins all about vitamin c so brits are called limeys because of the lime but what is a lime well i mean isn't the lime something like a small green lemon like yeah lemons um like fist sized and yellow and limes are much smaller and green well it's not that simple nothing with citrus is simple as you can see here you can have green lemons and you can have yellow limes well let's first basically solve the riddle about those green lemons and yellow limes limes are usually being picked green but yeah from time to time maybe they miss a lime until it's ripe and so in a box of green limes they wear one or two yellow limes lemons are usually picked yellow however let's go to the other side and here in this citrus exhibition there is a whole box full of green lemons actually yesterday they were even greener now they are turning yellow well and here is a box full of different slightly chevraltap citrus with lots of green limes well why are the limes green well i guess the green lemons give you a hint i i'm here on the island of gran canaria with the subtropical climate and it's often said that in a subtropical or tropical climate citrus fruit don't get bright colors like oranges are not bright orange lemons are not bright green but to be honest our lemons around here when they get ripe they are quite yellow maybe not as bright yellow as the mediterranean lemons which get a lot more cold but yellow well the oranges around here if they are not treated with ethylene they are usually a pale orange to bright yellow but not the bright orange well here i can show it to you some oranges commercial oranges treated with ethylene and also mandarins treated with ethereum are probably coming from uh from um cold places and here are some of the local oranges which are orangish or bright yellow but not very orange now let's go back to our lime scent lemons well limes yeah limes are being picked unripe so they are green but if you wait they will get yellow like a lemon lemons are usually being picked yellow however here the vendor explained meme a lot of the farmers they pick lemons and other citrus fruit underripe especially lemons and because well lemons are not supposed to be very sweet it's enough if they are sour and when they are green they are already sour enough and when you keep them for a couple days or weeks they will turn yellow and so you extend their shelf life but there is a more important reason for picking them green as soon as you pick the tree clean it will produce flowers and new fruit sooner and so you will have more money because you have less time between harvests and so here we have a ripe lime an unripe lime an unripe lemon and a ripe lemon before we try them let's see what those things are in the botanical sense is there a species of lime and is there a species of lemon well nope most of our citrus fruit actually not species but hybrids and often third fourth fifth sixth generation hybrids it's very complicated and scientists are still fighting over what hybridized with what let's start with the lemon it's quite an easy thing it's a hybrid between the citron citrus medica and the sour or bitter orange citrus x our ancient which is a hybrid in itself so the lemon is at least the second generation hybrid yeah between citron and sour or bitter orange where did the lemon originate well we don't know around the year 1000 it showed up at the two ends of the silk road in china and also in the mediterranean well yep citroen and sour orange they basically come from asia they have been known in china for a long time but during the time of the romans citroen appeared in italy and yeah before the year 1000 the sour orange appeared also in europe and around the year 1000 on both end of the silk road we have lemons the silk road already existed at this time but it was still long before the travels of marco polo so we don't know did the lemon originate in italy and was brought to china or that it originated in china it was brought to italy or did it which is even more probable this at least two hybridization events happen one in china and one in italy in later centuries the italians became the most famous lemon producers and most of today's lemon varieties and hybrids come from italy but this will be the second part of the story about why the brits are called limeys now let's look at the lime it's a much more modern thing the key lime is a hybrid of citrus orange folia and citrus well now the key lime is called citrus x orange folia because it's also a hybrid of citrus micranta which is a type of wild lime like citrus and citrus medica the citron which is pretty big that's how the key lime got created well the key lime then hybridized with the lemon so citrus x already folia hybridized with citrus x lemon and created the persian lime citrus ex latifolia which is generally bigger with thicker skin with less seeds and with a stronger taste i'm not sure which lime this is well is it considered having a lot of seeds or less seeds or is considered having thick skin or thin skin i don't know which lime this is it's most probably the persian lamb or the key lime because they are the main lime looking limes which are being cultivated then there are many other fruit coat limes like the australian finger lime and the and the mauritius papida or kaffir lime which actually comes from malaysia and not from mauritius but is quite popular in asia for example in thai cuisine also in mauritius but let's stick to them limes and lemons because our story oh god i'm already past eight minutes our story about the brits called limeys is about limes and lemons well lamps and lemons were very important for all seafaring nations and the british are seafaring nations it have been for a long time but around the year like one thousand or one thousand one hundred basically the biggest seafaring city state of europe was amalfi in southern italy if you've heard of the beautiful amerifitana coast with its lemon plantations yeah exactly that amalfi they basically ruled the mediterranean this nowadays tiny city had like over a thousand ships and could dictate the mediterranean could dictate the mediterranean trade so much that actually they wrote the first mediterranean seafaring charter or laws this city basically wrote the laws about mediterranean sea travel and see trade and everybody had to obey them because amalfi had the biggest fleet and about the same time the italians bred the lemon or maybe they received it from china but most probably they break it from the citroen and the sour orange and the town of amalfi realized that when their sailors were at sea for long weeks and months they got scurvy but when they ate lemons they did not get scurvy so in this first european or christian seafaring cold seafaring codex seafaring law they included a paragraph about every ship needs to have a lot of lemons on board and needs to feed their sailors lemons i think it was daily or at least several times a week this was also very positive for the town of amalfi because if you know the americana coast it's basically very steep and then fertile machia and nothing is growing there nothing except for the lemons and so the coastal areas around tamalfi got a big boom because in around amalfi on those terraces they would collect soil tear us the steep hills and plant lemons in a climate and in um and on soil which is not really suitable for lemons but they managed to do this and the ships of amalfi the captains of amalfi would buy all those lemons cultivated in the area of amalfi and even after amalfi became insignificant as a trade city even today in the 21st century the area of amalfi is still the yeah most famous lemon growing area of italy with several different varieties one among them the pretty sweet amalfi lemon and then we come to the taste of the lemons which we'll taste in a moment well lemons are sour but limes are even more sour well in the 16 17 18th century britain slowly became the most important seafaring nation of the christian world and probably of the whole world and since britain had a very good relationship at least since the napoleonic wars with southern italy the british basically almost kept southern italy and sicily as a sort of protectorate or puppet state not really a colony but whatever they said happened and they would straight a lot of lemons actually it's being said that the sicilian mafia well sicily became the main producer of lemons after some time because the steepened in fertile and dry slopes of amalfi couldn't produce enough for the big british navy and as soon as sicily become the the hub of lemon cultivation and trade the sicilian mafia approach the lemon producers and buyers and traders and if you didn't pay the mafia regularly basically not your lemons but other people's lemons would end up in the harbor and being sold abroad well your lemons well might end up in the harbor water together with you and yeah britain liked that a lot they did a lot of trade in the mediterranean they got a lot of lemons from sicily until the reunification of italy when italy started producing giant ironclad or men of war or giant battleships which britain didn't like because italy basically tried to compete with britain for them naval supremacy in the mediterranean and so britain said no we are gonna we are not gonna buy your lemons anymore anyway in the caribbean there is a thing called the lime which must contain a lot more of this magic scurvy prawn preventing stuff back then they still didn't know what vitamin c is so in order to punish italy for building giant battleships we will buy them now we'll produce the key lime on our islands in the caribbean we'll produce the lime on our islands in the caribbean we'll stop buying italian lemons and we'll buy our own lemons and if necessary we'll buy lemons from other people's colonies you know we will buy limes not lemons but limes which are more sour so they must be better and which we can produce in our colonies or buy from other colonies in the caribbean yeah punishing italy and at the same time getting a more sour juice what did the british do with that juice well they would produce stuff like punch and grok and so on like the water on the british ships was very bad so they would mix it with rum in order to kill bacteria and other parasites and to get their sailors happy and they would also mix it with lemon or lime juice in order to prevent scurvy and to yeah and to make everything more tasty and thus those famous punches of the mediterranean originated yeah one captain who you know one admiral who really who was really into giving his folks a lot of yeah grog basically was a guy who was also would wear a woolen coat made of i think it was called grockham fabric or something so people would call them his sailors would call him old rock and they would also call the drinky force them to drink grog well after after adding all this rum and lemon and sugar to the grog it was so tasty that the british actually liked drinking it and so nowadays not only sailors drink it but also other people however in the 19th century while the british switched from italian lemons to caribbean limes some other developments occurred first america became a financial superpower and so italian immigrants or sicilian immigrants very soon started selling the sicilian lemons to the united states so italy or sicily they didn't basically care that britain didn't buy their lemons anymore because the financially very powerful united states started buying their lemons and with the lemons the sicilian mafia moved to america thus creating the kosa nostra who would think that them that the sicilian mafia in america has such tasty origins also another thing happened well i mean back then when chemistry and food chemistry was not so well developed the british would say limes are more sour than lemons well lemons are sour lemons perverts prevents curvy a lot of other foods which prevents kirby like apples and so are also sour soda there must be an acid which prevents curvy well this is basically correct vitamin c is also called ascorbic acid and it is sour but it is not very sour there are a lot of other acids in citrus which are more sour and so the brits talk here the limes oh and of course that's why the brits are called limeys because first navy sailors were called limits because they would drink drinks made with limes every day and later this got used for all the british so we answered at least one question but then yeah when they switch from lemons to limes they thought that the limes are much healthier because they are much more sour which is not so correct yes limes are much more sour but they contain a lot less vitamin c also the way british would preserve the limes i mean first the amalfi sailors in the mediterranean they used to have fresh lemons on board later the british was sailed around the whole world and sometimes stay away for months and years they conserve the lemon and later the lime juice in barrels thus killing almost all vitamins you know folks eating fresh fruit is very healthy but all those conserved and preserved juices they contain almost no natural vitamins the brits didn't know that and well yeah in their navy the mortality rates were very high and around the time when they switched to highly preserved lime juice instead of fresh lemons another important development became more common the steamboat and so a ship needed months and years before for a long travel around the world but with the steamboats it went much faster you had maximum a couple weeks between ports normally and so you would get a supply of fresh fruit quite regularly and yeah they would drink their their grock and punch with lime juice but the lime juice wouldn't be so important for them anymore because they stopped often enough in ports to get a lot of fresh fruit however they continued doing this well it was still very important at polar expeditions and that's why polar expeditions people still would get a lot of scurvy if they didn't eat a lot of raw meat because they would basically because they would basically rely on preserved lime or lemon juice which would not save them from scurvy well we don't have a big problem with scurvy on the frotarian paradise of gran canaria but now let's try the difference in taste between ripe lemon unripe lemon unrained lime and ripe lime first ripe lemon this is the type of lemon you usually get for spicing up your food sour with a nice lemony taste the nice lemony flavor the unripe lemon pretty much the same but with a more refined taste i would say it's more sparkly not more prickly now the unripe lime this is the normal state in which limes are being used not more sour than the lemon and without the typical lemon flavor now the ripe lime the ripe lime actually has a stronger lime flavor than the unripe lime yeah so the lemons definitely add the lemon flavor and this lemon was actually even more interesting the android lemon was even more interesting than the light lemon and the ripe lemon it had a more fresh sourness and more fresh lemon taste with the limes actually the ripe lime was much more interesting how shall i describe it yeah basically the lime yeah the lime flavor is much stronger in the right blend than in the under ply so after all the talking basically the most interesting part was really the taste test because i find the green lemon which is very unusual much more interesting than the ripe lemon but i find the ripe lime much more interesting than the green lime by the way those ripe limes they also seem to be a lot thicker and plumper i hope they are limes and not some strange 7th or 8th generation hybrid but yeah both the ripe limes i have in this big this big box of unripe lamps are a lot thicker and plumper than the unripe limes very interesting tell me if you think they might be some sort of hybrid or something else but they did they do taste like limes just more so than the unreplaced so one final question folks why don't we all have unripe lemons and ripe limes instead of ripe lemons and unripe limes can you please answer me that question apart from that stay tuned for a lot more fruit videos from the beautiful island of gran canaria

"9tTPqAZOaKA": "hey everybody this is Justin Ronan from a gross keeping calm so this is a Market Monday and I decided I'd bring you into my kitchen here and show you how to preserve citrus kind of from worse to first so the absolute worst technique that you can do to preserve your citrus is put them in a plastic bag and leave them on your counter so that's the quickest way to get them to overripe in' and mold for you especially if they're stacked in multiples so if you've got him sitting around you want to make sure they have a lot of good airflow a lot of times people think the airflow is best if you put it into a paper bag and then paper bag is better than a plastic bag but as you'll see deep inside of here we've still got some moldy ones starting to show up especially when you start getting them stacked now unlike apples and pears and peaches and a lot of these other ones that put off an ethylene that helps them ripen citrus don't do that and so they need a lot more airflow in order to keep them from molding and causing some challenges and stuff like that the next best is put them in the fridge but not on a shelf but that can still cause some molding and other issues that might show up they'll also dry out and get very unkept I guess you could say they just dry out inside the fridge if you got them in the fridge that way now one quick point is you want to make sure that anytime that you are using citrus you want to if you wash them off be sure to dry them before you store them it's really important that you dry them off because if they stay wet that's again that's the quickest way to getting an orange to mold is getting it wet so any of this citrus world kind of works in the same way now on the counter there's a lot of cool ways to do it here's some of my favorite ways obviously you've got your big harvest basket this is what we do at the farmers markets will always put them in these but anytime you have something like citrus out in the open it needs to be in an everything we like the more natural fiber stuff this one right here is one of my favorite baskets this thing is actually created by a friend of Mines you can find them on Etsy this is a jute basket and I think it's sowing by Sam if you want to check her out she actually makes these baskets and variety of forms and shapes and stuff we use them a lot we really love these baskets this is for this week so if I'm gonna be eating something this week and I've got some citrus it's not only beautiful makes a nice display but you just need to make sure that you're going to within a week anything that's out on the counter and stuff like that in open air it needs to be done in the week it's a great way to prep things for juicing so like these ones right here the tangelos great juicing Orange and in order to get them ready for juicing leave them out at room temperature things juice best at room temperatures so let them get down to room temperature first before you juice them it softens the membranes around those cells that are holding the juice making them easier to juice you end up with a lot less pulp a lot more juice as well as the flavor use these a little more rich now if you're like me and you like a nice cold orange juice best way to do that room temperature for the juicing but then chill it in the fridge after you've juiced it you'll have a much richer and more full flavored orange juice when you do it that way now another way that we like to preserve them let's say that we jumped into our our blood orange just like we've shown here and we don't Dovan into that wonderful blood orange but we only ended up eating half of it there's this little thing we've got called food huggers that we helped fund this company what originally started it was really a lot of fun to be a part of their their GoFundMe kind of campaign but this little guy can literally be just stuck right inside of that and then I can go and throw this in the fridge it helps protect it's kind of a second skin on the outside of my citrus allowing me to come back later works even better for your grapefruits this is a nice oil Blanco one of the sweetest grapefruits we have out here so we like to let them ripen on the counter then we'll put them in the chiller at night we'll put them in the fridge let them chill down we'll eat one in the morning but like this let's say you only want it half and then you get a nice big food hugger on it you can just preserve it that route I really love these food huggers again for preserving my fruit long term now my absolute favorite way to preserve my fruit is putting them in the fridge they'll last for months literally months that can last a lot longer in the fridge let's say you've got one week on the counter you've got maybe two weeks in the fridge all in its own but then you can get four to even eight weeks if you put it inside the chiller and have it on that fruit setting so right inside here you can see we got a variety different fruits and what it does is it basically slows down the entire ripening process regardless the type of fruit you have now these apples we know that we didn't want them to ripen any more so they're okay in the fridge open like this with other types of fruits and we also know that these guys were likely going to be eating this week anyway so with my apples we'll put them in the fridge if we're gonna eat it within a week usually that's how you want to go with most apples if you chill them too cold too long they start actually rotting from the inside to get this kind of clear iridescent kind of space inside and it'll start almost tasting alcoholic and so you can get an apple alcohol out of an overly frigerator apple so be careful with those winter pear mains this is one of our apples that we actually get late season Apple here in Arizona we're still harvesting some of these right now oddly enough in January but with a lot of our other ones like The Merck cots and our Algerian tangerines these are actually really good once we throw in the fridge and we'll leave them open as long as they're inside our fruit chiller and then even a better way to go even a month got the food hugger on top of our lemon and that's the way we like to preserve citrus here at the runner house and with a gross keeping calm so if you enjoyed this and want to learn more market Mondays are going to be our day that we're gonna show you how we take it from harvest to market and basically how we preserve these things long term so the last longer that we can come weekend and week out with great produce and make sure that they're still fresh to the taste and awesome in your fridge we'll see you next time", "r1b-Qtw1YK0": "this is Asha Asha angel is on any Mac but there's

subtropical island of tenerife ooh and this is an orange you might ask why is the orange not orange orange is not named orange because they are orange well nope actually not the color orange is named orange because it was the color of oranges how come and still why is this orange not orange well let's see what the oranges come from there are no wild oranges sweet oranges as well as the so called sour or bitter oranges actually hybrids of other species the sweet oranges hybrid between Mandarin and pomelo which originated in China about 2,000 years ago well the Arabs introduced the so called bitter orange to southern Europe like Sicily and southern Spain and cultivated it on a large scale there the sweet orange was only introduced by Portuguese and Spanish sailors from Asia in the well some times around the beginning of the 16th century and still that doesn't explain why the oranges caught orange well originally it was actually called Apple seen like apple of China and then later their name orange arose because they were traded a lot through the southern French city of orange well and those oranges had a nice well orange color and that's why people thought well why don't we call everything which has this color orange before that there was no concept of the color orange that's why gingers are called red heads and not orange heads I've never seen a person with naturally occurring right here they are all well chestnut brown too well orange and so um that explains where the name of the colorant of the plant comes from at where the plant comes from but it still doesn't explain why this orange here is not orange did I steal an unripe fruit from an orchard did I get scammed by some vendor who sold me worthless unripe windfall or whatever well no why are oranges orange not why are they called orange but why are they orange well the orange is not a tropical fruit but the subtropical food originating from China from areas where winters are quite cold and as soon as it gets caught in autumn and winter the orange fruits turn orange it doesn't get cold they stay either green or turnip pale yellow or sometimes if it doesn't get cold enough they turn like half-hearted Orange if you want really colorful orange fruit well you should wait for some cold spell to hit your orchard well as you can imagine a lot of modern farmers they like to or a lot of modern vendors they like to sell bright orange oranges but they don't want to wait for them to get orange naturally by some cold weather I mean the biggest producer of oranges is Brazil it might have been surpassed by China now by the three biggest producers of Brazil India and China and at least Brazil and India it's not so easy to get cold weather in those two countries weather cold enough to turn oranges orange so what do people do if they want to sell a subtropical or tropical orange to customers who like really bright orange colors when perching on red well there are two ways value treated with ethylene or there is a paint called orange number two no red number towards something like that well some horrible chemicals and here in the fruit shop where I bought this orange there were some really bright orange oranges which I guess were probably either dyed artificially with some carcinogenic and noxious paint or they were from some cool areas of the Spanish Peninsula then there were some yellowish oranges oranges which I think um may be natural or really well oranges left untreated from the Spanish Peninsula and then there was this one it's it naranja piece which means country orange country usually means you cannot expect the worldwide standards to apply to this fruit it's been cultivated locally it's some local variety it hasn't been traded by some big companies it's not standard iso country oranges cultivated here on the island of tenerife it sometimes they turn orange even in this climate like mandarins and oranges I've seen them turning orange here so I guess it's also maybe due to the variety or to them to the specific conditions of this plant specimen it's not like you really need cold climates to get an orange color on oranges or mandarins but it helps a lot well this one did not get any cold climate also it was kind of ripped off from the tree so it is actually possible that I've been scammed and it's not ripe enough well let's see and most important of all its taste if this green orange is ripe enough to be pleasant or not okay the inside looks like it has a pale orange color that's already a good sign or cutting fruit with one hand I have to get better at that with a small knife it's quite okay but if you have the machete or a piranha it gets a little bit difficult so let's try this let's try to focus focus focus well I hope this focused on my hand if not that's what the inside of the orange looks like smells like an orange it tastes sweet enough it's not a very sweet orange but sweet enough too it's confirmed that it's actually right yeah yep an average orange verging on good yeah not a bad orange and definitely ripe but definitely grass green which has some yellow hints on the outside so folks next time you're in a tropical or subtropical place and they offer you oranges or mandarins or lemons which are not completely orange or yellow don't be scared if they on the market there is a good chance they're ripe buy them try them you are probably not gonna regret that at least you know that you have some locally produced and not standardized stuff so folks this was that by the way they spoke probably the novel Orange as you can see from those small structures here well the folks stay tuned for a lot more fruit videos from the island of tenerife oh and don't forget to Like share comment and subscribe", "ruA0YwwNY4c": "lemons are used for their tart flavor and lemony essence when you're choosing a lemon pick it up and give it a squeeze if it's firm it's not going to give you that much juice if you find a softer lemon that's gonna give you way more juice also choose a lemon that's heavier for its size the heavier the lemon the more juicer will give so pick up to and go with the heaviest one now lemons can be stored on the counter for a few days or in the fridge for two to four weeks now sometimes a recipe will call for lemon zest lemon zest is going to give you that really nice intense lemon flavor to do that just use a rasp or a fine grater take your lemon and just press it and rotate it along the rasp now if you don't have a Russ what you can use is a peeler so just take a strip off the side and then take your knife and you just want to Julie in it and then turn it around and mince it now if you need to juice a lemon because you want to get that nice tart flavor take your lemon cut it in half now you'll often use a reamer now reamer is great for getting juice out of a lemon but if you don't have a reamer just use a fork an average lemon will yield about 2 to 4 tablespoons of juice and here's a great tip if a recipe asks you to zest and juice a lemon make sure use s tit before you juice it hope this helps and for more produce tips and easy recipes please visit produce made simple dot CA you", "65UpdfFJqF8": "[Music] g'day I'm mark from self-sufficiently and it's a beautiful winter's day here in sunny South East Queensland Australia and today I just want to show you some of my mandarine and orange trees that we're growing here on our property citrus generally are a pretty easy tree to grow I know you guys in the colder climates will say oh yeah they don't grow too well for us but I do get quite a bit of correspondence through YouTube and my blog of people that grow citrus in pots in indoors and in conservatories and greenhouses and they do it very successfully and that's because citrus trees in general are very very easy to grow in whatever soil or whatever type of climate as long as you give it enough love and care I've got really heavy clay soil here and where other trees find it very difficult to grow like avocados and fruit trees that need really well draining soil all my citrus grow and thrive here so it's a really easy crop for me just to continue to grow and use now getting on to our oranges and mandarins we grow several varieties of oranges here and I have currently only two varieties of mandarines but you'll see the tree behind me is an imperial it's an easy peel mandarine and really don't we don't need anymore mandarine trees because it's just such a great cropper in producer since this tree has ripened up we've given away probably a hundred and fifty you can see behind that this tree is just full of fruit this is the Imperial mandarine it's a young Australian favorite really easy to peel it's got a few seeds but a name people say are I like seedless varieties but these grow terrific and really seeds in a mandarine look how easy that was to peel and pull apart all that I simply do is bite the end well this has never seen it okay that's good I'll bite the end off like that get rid of the seed and then eat the full thing it's wonderful my boys get to mandarines our day in their lunchboxes and when they come home from school they run down stairs and they they hit up the mandarine tree for another feed for afternoon tea let's go around and have a look at all of the oranges and mandarine trees I've got going and I run a little bit of a commentary on them let's just start at the top of our orchard and I'll show you our other mandarine tree now this is a honey Mercat it's a famous mandarine tree because it's got beautiful sweet fruit the only thing I don't like about it is it's a hard fruit to peel you have to really get your fingernails in and get under there and peel the fruit in the process it usually takes some of the flesh with it and drips juice everywhere speaking of juice they juice up wonderfully so we usually eat our Imperial mandarines first and then were pretty well fed up eating mandarins we just juice these in the juicer but they are a wonderful tasting nan during this tree is quite old but it had a root ball problem it had an ant's nest what I had to do is is remove the tree when it was actually about this size so I pruned it all back remove the root ball got rid of the ants and this transplanted it there and now it's coming back beautifully and then a couple of years it'll be a quite a large tree as we move down I'll take you to our first orange tree this is a lanes light navel and I've grown this because it flowers later than other oranges hence the name it produces a beautiful navel orange lovely tasting similar to the Washington probably not quite as sweet and the first few years the fruit was quite spiced this year we've got quite a number of fruit on it this tree is about five years old now and it's got some good clusters of fruit and it does really well okay moving through the next islands trees of Valencia not just a great name and the other thing that I love about Valencia oranges is that they hold on the tree they hold on the tree for a long time after the seasons finished and yeah you get a couple that might drop off but the majority of them stay on there so that went point when we're finished picking our navel oranges then we come to this tree we don't pick any of these at the moment we just leave them sitting and I'll ripen up and I'll just stay on the tree and this will be the last orange tree we use so our seasons extended wonderfully and Valencia oranges are smaller than the other ones the you could say there are medium-sized orange but they're very disease resistant or all citrus are and they taste terrific and they juice really well as well and moving down past our man green tree where I was where I started this off from this is our Washington orange it's our oldest tree it's probably about ten years old and it produces a lot of oranges we've used most of these upper gone halfway through the footy season and I supply the arranges every week for the team and the owns is up by wonderful these are a seedless variety and we've had no child with this tree at all consistently produces good crops every year now I didn't mention this before but our Imperial mandarine has a tendency to be bi and you'll like this season it's produced a whole heap of mandarins hundreds of them and we've picked hundreds already and you still see how many is on there but next year it'll it'll have less it'll probably have half that and that's because it's AI buying your crop so I think what it does it gives us self a rest for a season and then it really pumps up the next season after one last storage trail was just want to show you is this blood orange there's been a lot of talk about blood oranges and how they're full of antioxidants and and all that so I thought I'd grab a tree I'm quite disappointed with this one though though it's growing quite nicely it's about two years old I'll show you a cut one that I've cut open in a second but it doesn't seem to produce the oranges that the colored oranges that I expected here it is here and it looks like a normal orange to me correct me if I'm wrong but the picture on the label it's supposed to have really red dark red rings and and a pigmentation through the flesh it doesn't have any of that say I don't know will it get better as the tree gets older I don't know maybe I've been sold a dad that doesn't want look like blood red orange to me as far as food and fertilizer guys I like to mulch our trees when I can I don't moss them all the time and just keep them all shut I give them a good mulching and let that mulch last I grab the mulch from our chicken pens and quail pens and just from around the area raking up leaves etc and on top of that I'll throw a good couple of kilo of citrus fertilizer every year just once a year and sometimes maybe a little bit of organic chicken manure or chicken pellets dynamic lifter that type of thing but that's about all that I do to feed our citrus crops so that's my little orange and mandarine excursion through our backyard as far as fruit trees go citrus is definitely one of my favorites now just quickly on pests I don't spray our trees with anything except for sometimes some pests oil and you can make that up yourself but apart from that maybe a little bit of pee tharam that's very rare I can't recall the last time I sprayed the trees you can get sometimes a little bit of mold on the oranges and the mandarins and you get some imperfections like some brown spots and that type of thing as long as the insides are fine don't be too concerned at all about what the outsides look like save your money on spraying and more importantly save your health on not having to suck in any of those chemicals that are unnecessarily sprayed on all the sick just that you buy in the shops thanks a lot for watching have any questions wacom below or visit the blog or our forum and say la Cheers bye for now", "MB7URRy2PsQ": "hey guys I wanted to show you my channel in orange from my part 1 and if you want to see the part 1 you can click on the link on the screen so I just wanted to update out my two kalman in orange is doing and the growth about the car wounding oranges so I shot this entire video over three months periods and this is the month of July and where the oranges are green then they're there I think about 100 plus oranges all over the all over the plans so and even though you will see a couple of flowers as well I keep my planter next to the window and also I am used at any ceramic pot so the water drains really well I stay in a high-rise 22nd floor and as you can see it's next to the window it gets about an hour of sunlight every morning and during winter it gets to like -20 but I make sure the heat is really well circulated in the room and this is really surprising so as you can see along with these oranges it also starts growing these flowers so it never stops growing these oranges so there will be plenty of plenty of it so this is the month of August and and as you can see the oranges are turning to yellow and also there are there are so many oranges the tree is actually overwhelmed so I added this wire as you can see to bind all the branches alright now we are into the month of September end and as you can see oranges are are are really orange and they look so beautiful you know whoever comes to my room they start asking about this oranges and few people even ask if these are real or not so it's funny and it looks really really awesome and beautiful along with the right oranges also you can see the green ones so it has all different types of growth in these so it continuously gives these oranges let me pick an origin show it to you so there is a it's a one inch in diameter and I will cut it open and see how it looks like from inside so here they are so I picked up two and now I'll cut it open and once you cut it there are about three to four seeds and seeds are actually the size of the real orange me TSP salt it's really sore and a little bit of sweet so it's like a lemon but has a little bit of orange flavor into it and in skins are really thin I will probably make orange marmalade out of it but not now probably later on after a month or so when the oranges starts falling off from the tree I hope you have enjoyed this video about calmodulin oranges and I highly recommend to have this plant of wherever you are it doesn't matter I think this plant really grows well in the warm area like Florida so but I stay in Canada and its really cold here but as you can see it doesn't matter once you keep it in the room temperature for the instruction your calendar will be really well good luck", "RJGaYspaTcg": "hello everyone Karen Miller here I hope you're doing great I hope you're not worrying and panicking today I'm gonna do a little infusion so this is something that we did you know if we had a cold we did it with the fakes and the orange peel like I showed you some days ago with that concoction that I made that you can drink three times a day if you feel like you're coming down with a cold so today I'm going to do an infusion of these things but not to drink it but to put your head over it to clear up your sinuses if you feel like you're coming down with a cold my research I found out that once you get the flu virus immediately you get into pneumonia if it's really if it affects you if you don't have a strong immune system you immediately get the pneumonia and it's the pneumonia that is dangerous it's the pneumonia that kills you when your lungs fill up with water and they have to give you a ventilator because you cannot breathe it is the bacteria that kills you not the virus so it makes sense when this dr. Kaufmann says that a virus has never been known to kill anyone it's called a core infection you see you have the viral infection from the flu but then you immediately get the pneumonia and it's the pneumonia that kills you and if you have a weak immune system if you are compromised in any way this is how you die and most of the people who are dying from this virus already have been compromised in some way or the other all right so this is why I don't want you to be oh they're panicking and being afraid about some some virus okay so I'm gonna show you what I'm putting into this pot now and I'm gonna get the towel and I'm gonna put my head over the pot and show you how it's done all right so guys I have my pot here it's bubbling away and steaming I'm going to put some lemon rind I squeeze the juice out of this I have so many of these and how because I treat my lemon water every morning and you can for Mendis put some salt on it and use it for cooking these this is these are like gems this is like gold guys you should never throw these things out so I'm going to put some of that in there I'm gonna put my orange peel and I'm going to take some ginger and some peppercorns some cardamom pods these are good for information I use it in curries as you know I use it mostly it's for me it's for like digestion but it's an anti-inflammatory as well so you can do this to clear up your nostrils etc so I'm gonna let this come to a boil again and then I'm going to get my towel put my head over it and inhale all of the fields from that that would clear up your your sinuses and just clear up that area the air nose and the throat area okay and viruses do not like heat so this is why you have to drink a lot of soups and do things like that if you're concerned about a virus so guys I have my pot here with the infusion so I'm going to put my head over the pot with a towel make sure you have a towel and the pot is covered with the towel you turn it around and your face is in there ooh and you inhale the fumes okay so this is what you do and you clear up your sinuses you take a deep breath woo my face is all steamy I'm getting a nice facial guys I'm getting a nice facial my face is all nice and so you get a facial and you clear up your sinuses at the same time okay guys so that's it for the day love you guys don't be scared don't live in fear viruses are not flying around okay bye before I go guys I want to tell you guys to please go to a website called no fee no more no more fake news com Jon Rappoport I'm subscribed to his newsletter I get it in my mailbox he's just top-of-the-line journalist and there's a lot of information there he's been doing a lot of research on these things for years so you go there to his website no more fake news.com and you're

you for watching", "VphA42mIibI": "hello my name is Nicholas Stodden I'm with Monrovia and today we're going to talk about how to feed your lemon tree so one of the big trends today is fruit in the garden and in the house because lemons you can actually have growing inside your house as well I call them migrating plants bring them indoors with you in winter in a container and then put them back out on the patio during the summertime so ways to fertilize the plant if you have them in the ground outside a couple of three different things you can do you can use a water soluble fertilizer comes with a handy-dandy scoop that tells you how much to put in a half a gallon or a gallon or my favorite way is actually with a granular fertilizer now if this plant is outside in your garden remember you need to fertilize all the way out to the drip line that's the area that the canopy of the tree covers but fertilize about four times a year if in a container read the instructions carefully you'll probably do it maybe just a little bit less lemons are always doing something that evergreen they're blooming they're setting fruit so they always need a whole bunch of food now the other way and I've used this very successfully is using an organic fertilizer and that would be fish emulsion or seek help you can use it actually as a foliar feed or you can put it down straight directly into the soil however you use fertilizer you will be guaranteed a fantastic crop like this of lemons this is Nikolas stardom with Monrovia on how to fertilize your lemon tree you", "xRU8TeadHeM": "so in today's experiment we are going to isolate the pectin from citrus fruit so what is pectin basically pectin is nothing but a polysaccharide so this is present in the middle lamina of the peel of citrus fruit as you can see we have taken the citrus fruit here this you can take any type of citrus fruit like a lemon orange musambi or anything we have taken here musambi you can take the orange peel also so the first thing what if we are going to do here we are going to collect the peel from here so you can find here this is uh the the peel of the citrus fruit and here ah the white part yellowish white part you can see this white ish yellows part is the pectin so we are going to separate out this pectin from this orange or any citrus wood bit cut into small pieces now after cutting into small pieces you put in distilled water and you heat it at 100 degree centigrade so that it get boiled the reason for boiling is that the cells get softened now here the ph maintenance is very important here the ph should be maintained around 2.8 degree it should be acidic in nature if we add more amount of acid if the ift solution is more acidic in nature then whatever the pectin is separated will get dissolved and if it is less acidic means it is more than 2.8 then obviously the the precipitated pectin precipitate will not form ah to maintain uh the ph acidic ph we can use any type of organic or inorganic acid as an organic acid we can use tartaric acid or in organic acid we can use uh the hydrochloric acid also so let us add little quantity of acid here like that and with the help of with the help we have added acid here so just we have to return it or we have just we have to mix it not regulating just mixing it and we have to continuously measure the ph of the solution by means of ph paper you can use that so take little quantity of the solution and add as a drop voice and this is the ph meter you can see this is the ph 1 3 6 5 6 7 and this is the basic ph this is the acidic ph and this is the basic ph and we have to compare the color of this ph with the filter paper when it is approximate 2.8 means approximate three slightly orange color then we should immediately stop the adding of acid now let us imagine that we have attained the ph and now you boil it for some time after boiling you filter it with the help of this filtration unit with the help of this filtration unit you just boil it let us take this beaker you slowly decant that solution so it it will take some time so after preparing whatever the mark we are getting this contains the pectin so you collect the mark after collecting the mark you wash with more amount of water so that whatever the excess of acid is there it gets removed so after that you collect in ah in a dish in a factory dish so it will appear slightly orange in color so it will you can see the color here so it will appear the color like that now you dry it inside the hot air oven after and you wait for some time let us imagine uh for 5 or 10 minutes at 100 degree centigrade it is being dry keep periodically checking otherwise the entire product will get chugged take it out and just you still upon steering you will find little bit whitish or yellowish white lump like that you can see here the lump so now you transfer into a mortar and vessel and you return it so the final product what you are getting is like pectin is the powder of peptide you calculate the percentage yield from ah suppose 50 gram of ah the orange peel or any citrus food pill how much you are getting then from that you calculate from 100 gram how much you are getting so this is the report of this experiment thank you", "jqYkEkD9EK0": "hi guys escape day um i'm so excited we are making a salted caramel upside down citrus cake um i have this beautiful citrus and uh and i feel like i need something i need something good and sweet so what i've done here i have buttered my eight inch pan and put a parchment paper at the bottom first step

can grow a wide range of different citrus here in the northwest some are harder than others on the hardiness scale I would say the Meyer lemon which is this guy is the hardiest the improved Meyer lemon the other end you're going to be looking at your limes and oranges and those guys are a couple of things that you want to do the way you want to approach taking care of them over the wintertime is deal is giving them as much Sun as possible and the way you want to do that is actually bringing them inside is great idea because it will protect them from the cold but you want to make sure that you have a really bright sunny window like a south or west facing side in atrium or a sunroom if you don't have that situation you want to treat it more like an indoor/outdoor cat and you want to keep it on your porch on a protected porch which will keep it also from getting too wet which they don't like to be and it'll also protect them from the cold and if we get temperatures getting into the single digits or the teens or really even the low 20s that's when you want to bring it into your garage or shed a cool place so that it doesn't break dormancy in the spring when we come out of our winter time and start getting some more Sun I would put it back outside and feed it with a good fertilizer like citrus tone and this is a great one it's from its boma because it has the trace elements and nutrients that it needs to get growing again in the spring and even if it loses all of its leaves which they sometimes do when you bring them inside it'll come back looking really nice again in the spring so that's great say so you can put these outside in pots and bring them in only when the temperatures go down into the 20s yeah and especially with the Meyer lemon it's good really to the high 20s so they're harder than a lot of people think that's great thanks a lot Stacy you're welcome", "H2yGBKvICdM": "[Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "ZJT8tgQAgLc": "hello I wanted to have a citrus plant so I did a little bit of research which the truss plant will be suitable as indoor house plant so based on my findings the top two are my lemon and Kalamunda in orange so out of these two I chose Kalamunda in orange as you can see here because they are the hardiest citrus of all and it's they are also well adapted to house environment and it can also survive in the cold weather I think about 20 degree Fahrenheit unlike other lemon like my lemon or Pandora's lemon also kalamoon in orange is the best as under Milton house plant because when they when they grow these little oranges all over their plans so it looks really good typically kalman in orange is a mix between tangerine and Concord and it has this large green leaves and as you can see here it bears these tiny fragment white flowers now these flowers have a mixed of I should say is the mixed of Jessamine and citrus smell and when they bloom your entire house will have fresh sweet citrus fragments and kalam onion orange can bloom your around and provide small oranges it's about 1 inch in diameter throughout the year so unless my lemon or under a Solomon which have less blue and foots then the kalman in orange and this this plant is about three years old and they grow based outdoors in direct sunlight or half shade but in indoors they should be blessed in a very well lit area and as you can see I live in a high-rise so I place this plant next to my window and it gets about two hours of direct Sun in the morning so it's not too much but as you can see that the plant is doing well and it's getting new leaves as well so when I got this plant the stem of this plant was kind of inclined towards the towards the base so what I did is I made it straight with this wooden support and it is still there but I'm going to remove it probably a later point of time so you need to order this plant as needed excess or lack of water will kill the plant so when the surface of an inch of soil is becomes dry and you can you can notice it easily and so what I do is I water this plant every three days and I use the all-purpose fertilizer every two weeks and during the winter I will use the fertilizer once in a month and you can also use slow release fertilizer such as our such in you know early spring and continue fertilizing with full strength water-soluble fertilizer monthly during the summer growing season and Calvin Dean's are acid loving plants so if you need if you see the leaves turning to yellow then you can use acid loving fertilizer or chelated iron which is available in the store to get rid of it so what I do is I use a wine vinegar about 50 ml in one gallon of water and use it once in a month which makes the soil acidic for this plant and really helps you need to make sure the leaves of this Kalamunda an orange plant is not dusty enough because dusty leaves will easily result in my 10 scale infections so what I did is I use this water mister and I use all over the plant leaves once in a week and it makes this plant really healthier I use this a 10 inch ceramic pot which looks very nice er so and and it also helps the plant in two ways because you can easily take the plant out of these and then report whenever it's required and also Calment in oranges likes humid environment so when whenever I water the the excess water drains out into this ceramic pot and also I have several several pebbles in the bottom so the bot is also act as humidifier and the excess water drains out which helps the plant from getting it to dry and also Calvin the audience does it like sitting in the water so excess water flows out I need to get rid of these ugly looking extra black plastic from the old pot so I'll do that later this is the month of May and as you can see the oranges are very small and if everything is okay then the oranges will be ready to be harvested during the month of September or October and when it becomes bigger and gets his orange color then I'll upload another video so this will really look good as an ornamental house plant so thanks for watching and do subscribe to my channel for upcoming post", "E01uveKegkk": "hey welcome back if you ever looking for a quick project to do with your kids a fun quick afternoon check out cutting a lemon in half and putting the seeds into a little baggie and turning it into a project that you guys can share for quite some time so a couple months ago me and my kids we put together baggies with paper towels and some lemon seeds in them and once they sprouted just in a couple of weeks we put them in this pot and they're growing quite nicely I usually do this every couple of months because one of my daughters decided she wants to rip all the leaves off of the plans that's okay they're hers she can do it what she wants with them but they do take quite a long time to actually grow into anything to where you can pull any type of fruit Adam one thing to keep in mind though when you're growing when you're growing anything citrus from seed it normally is not going to grow any type of plant that it's not going to grow any type of fruit that you've originally pulled that seed from the likelihood that you're going to get a fruit that's going to be you know absolutely amazing is really slim to none but it's still going to produce fruit eventually could be sour it could be bitter it could be you know orange flavor it could be lime flavor there's a lot of different variations when it comes to citrus fruit so plenty from seeds a fun novelty and I had two plants that I'd grown in Vietnam when I lived out there they produced little green lime colored lemons that I would put in my rum drinks and they were awesome so there's fruit that you can get out of but don't expect to grow lemons you know that kind of really look like that unless you're grafting and that's not what we're doing here we're growing from seed so let me walk you through the steps on how we do this once you get the lemon cut in half just take the seeds out you'll get something that you accidentally cut in half but that's okay you don't really need a whole lot of them I've never actually put a seed inside a bag in it not sprout so we're going to take just three seeds out of this one because we'll use the lemon for rum later all right so you see that these seeds come out and come out pretty easy so what we're going to do is we're going to Nick the top of these very carefully with your fingernail and it's got an outside coating on top of it it's actually quite slippery right now something dry it off real quick so I'm going to just Nick this top off real quick and as you see you take the knife and you split it just a little bit and this thing will peel right off now I don't know if you necessarily have to do this but I've done it this way every single time and I've never had it not sprout so so once you get them all the way peeled this it kind of looks like an unpopped popcorn seed with no coating over the top of it anymore so you just take this and wrap it up in this paper towel wrap it right in the middle of the paper towel and then put the paper towel on a small baggie like yeah really simple and put some water in it I'm going to cut the rest of these up and I'll put them in the bag as well all right so after about a week all three of the seeds sprouted and so that's what you're ready to do so you take these seeds here nice roots on them and you just plant them kids like it the last batch that I showed you a couple days ago the kids are up two plants out of the ground and so now it's just in time for me to plant these new ones so that's really all there is to it now you have three seeds you know you can see the the leaves getting ready to pop out of this one weenie you know growing lemon trees from seed so there you have it if you like this video go ahead and give me a comment and go ahead and like if you also want to see more videos like this go ahead and subscribe I really enjoy doing this kind of stuff so I hope you enjoy the video on how to grow a citrus tree from seed alright thanks a lot you guys have a great day", "XovdjV0rkGE": "today i'll be sharing how to make these\nbeautiful caramelized lemons as you can see i use them to decorate\nthis cake you can use them to decorate other treats or enjoy them on their\nown hi i'm funso from parili couture cakes and\ntreats where i make truly decadent treats for special occasions\nif you're new to my channel my goal is to share easy delicious recipes\nthat you can recreate at home for your friends and families okay let's get started\nso we'll start off by cutting the lemons into quarter inch slices\nobviously you have to rinse them first to make sure they're clean so you don't want the slices to be too\nthin or too fat so about a quarter inch is fine for this recipe i'll be using two lemons\nbut you can use one if you choose or more my lemons are seedless lemons however if\nyou have seeds in your lemons make sure you take them out of the\nlemon slices before you start boiling the lemons next you want to blanch the lemon slices\nin a pot of hot boiling water blanching the lemons will\nhelp to reduce the bitter taste of the lemon pith\nso typically i do this for about a minute or two\nand then i bring them out of the pot of water and put them in a cold bath this will stop the cooking process so\nthat the lemons do not get overcooked while the lemon is cooling\nwe're going to make a simple syrup which is one part water to one part\nsugar it's a very simple recipe to make\nyou put the sugar and water in a wide sauce pan\nover medium heat and then stir the sugar until it dissolves once the simple syrup starts to boil\nit's time to put in your lemon slices so ideally you want to put in just a\nlayer of lemons at a time to ensure that they're all covered with\na simple syrup i was in a bit of a rush so i put a lot\nmore than i should have but it turned out okay\nthe key here is to make sure that all the lemon slices\nare covered with a simple syrup also you want to turn down the heat\nto a low medium heat and allow the lemon slices to cook\nslowly until the syrup is thickened and the lemons look translucent once the lemon slices are translucent\ntake them off the heat and then dry them there are three ways\nyou can dry the lemon slices you can either dry them naturally by\nputting them on a piece of parchment paper and\nletting them dry overnight or you can dry them in a dehydrator like\ni'm doing or you can also dry them using your oven\nso if you're going to use your oven you want to use the lowest setting\npossible so i believe some go as low as 150\nor 200 degrees fahrenheit with my dehydrator i'm going to be turning down\nthe the temperature to about 135 degrees\nfahrenheit and letting it dry slowly for about six\nhours so after six hours i took them out of the dehydrator and put them on a\npiece of parchment paper so you see here that they do not dry\nhard they actually seem to be a little bit rubbery but\nthat's perfect for what i need them for because i need them to be flexible\nfor attaching on the cake one other thing i should have mentioned\nis that i added two drops of yellow food coloring\nto the simple syrup to make the yellow color on the lemon pop a\nlittle more so i wanted a bright yellow color\nfor this cake if you want to watch the tutorial where i use this\ncaramelized lemon slices to decorate a cake make sure you check out this link\ni hope you enjoyed this tutorial if you did i encourage you to like\nto comment and to subscribe if you haven't also feel free to share with\nyour friends and families i hope you enjoy the rest of your week\nyou take care now", "GhKsrw3-vQc": "here's some of the different citrus regrow its the fourteenth of made today this one here is a kumquat and it's in a pot on our deck and we do have Hardy citrus in the ground as well to this is just loaded up with flower buds so it's going to be blooming soon and it's been really liking the warm weather got to keep these watered a lot and make sure you got good drainage holes in the pot so full Sun and it's going to smell good too it's right by the entrance of the accommodation and then there's another one here believe this one is a meijer lemon it is a Meyer lemon you can see it right down there on the tag and load it up again with flower buds so that's going to be beautiful and lots of new growth coming so we'll actually I've eaten a lemon off these before hopefully this year we'll get more lemons so that's Myers lemon Meyer lemon here's another one too I believe this is a Meyer lemon as well and it's got lots of flower buds on it and this one I've had for years maybe more than 15 16 years somebody gave it to me as a small plant it's a puma puma low and I've never had any flowers on it I think they grew it from seed so some of these probably have to be grafted I presume but it's got lots of new growth I just stepped it up put some more soil in the pot and it is healthy looks better this year than it ever has lots of new growth so we'll see what happens with that one and this again is in full Sun on our lower sundeck here it just bakes just bakes in here so that's what they want they want full Sun and like I say keep them lots h2o in the in the dry months here and these stay out most of the year these the citrus matter of fact I've had this out through many winters believe it or not I just tuck it up against the house so if it stays mild mild enough here these can make it here on salt spring island so well we'll see what happens and we'll keep you updated when we get our fruit oh there's one right there ah it's a fruit right there lemon or possibly lime I could be wrong this actually could be a lime and not a meijer lemon the other one up there's Meyer lemon so very are there's one citrus fruit happening pretty cool", "Yi5Yp0yYwmg": "hey everybody its Rob the backyard\ngardenerr and I figure it's time to get you caught up on my citrus trees grown\nfrom seed... that's right everyone it has been three\nmonths since my last update we're about a week away from the three month mark\nsince my last update and these guys are 26 months old now I'm pretty excited\nbecause in the last update I had to do some transplanting I was concerned about\nsome frost damage well you guys have heard the video you haven't seen it you\ncan check it out before you watch this one to any extent let me flip the camera\naround and show you what these orange and lemon trees look like now grown from\nseed you recall in the last episode I had taken these from these small 1\ngallon pots and now I've placed them into two and a half three gallon pots\nit's been three months since they were transplanted into these larger pots and\nmy concern in the last video was that I wasn't getting any growth on the end\nbuds on any of these trees since the frost had hit and my question when the\nlast video was should I top them or should I usually pop them for now and\ncome off just the dead stuff which I ended up doing it and I'm glad I did\nbecause I'll show you we'll start with the lemon tree first\nthis guy is finally in the last few weeks started to get on some new growth\non this but here and on the rest of these there's not a lot going on just\nyet but it is good to see I guess we do have them get a little bit of growth\nthere but it is good to see that he is putting on some new growth on the top\nleader I was really concerned that with the frost damage that we had on the ends\nthat maybe these guys would start sprouting elsewhere and not that I\nwouldn't mind it being a little more bushy but I was afraid that we had\nkilled off the end buds and it doesn't appear that that's the case I'm actually\npretty happy all I've been doing is keeping them watered every other day and\nthese pots I just did a watering on these I let the soil almost completely\ndry out you can tell the leaves start to sag a little bit when the water pressure\nis low because the soils too dry and then I just give a full soaking all the\nway through and then I wait another two days and do the same thing over and over\nagain now I do have to water these a little more frequently because they're\nsitting on this table and we get a lot of sunlight coming in here so they get\nplenty of full Sun throughout the day the problem is the pots do get a little\nhot but because I just transplanted in the roots aren't filling up those pots\nall the way so I'm not too concerned about that\nthey haven't struggled because of it so that's the lemon tree he's definitely\ngetting some height on them and that here are the four orange trees that\nwe've got as well and as you can see many many of the ends are getting\nsprouts on them now so that makes me feel really good about the state of\nthese plants I know that they've adjusted to the transplant shock I know\nthey've gotten past the winter freeze that they had on there and the buds are\nstarting to break once again now in this guy this is the one that I've been a\nlittle more concerned about he hasn't really broken any buds and his leaves\nare the most yellow of all them when I transplanted him he had roots that were\ngrowing through the bottom pot and I had to cut some of the roots as I was\npulling him out of the pot I think he's just a little bit more of a shock state\nthan the other ones as far as this guy he was a slow grower as well but once\nagain we've got some new growth coming on these and then finally the oddball\none this guy looks different than the other ones\nhis Leafs are more rounded if you look at those Leafs compared to these these\ncome to kind of a point and his fan out a little different shape so I'm kind of\ncurious to see what kind of citrus this is gonna be you'll recall I started all\nof these from naval hybrid oranges that I got from the grocery store and because\nI got them from the grocery store and because you can't grow navel oranges\nfrom seeds you can only get them grafted none of these will be a navel orange\neven though the seeds came from a navel hybrid ironically I've bought in several\nof those bags of oranges since then and 90% of the oranges do not have a seed in\nit so kind of cool that I was able to start some seeds from navel hybrid\noranges when typically it is not even an orange seed in those types of oranges\nagain just going back to this guy kind of cool-looking I like how he has\ndifferent leaves than the other ones I don't know if that's something different\nbecause he's a different hybrid or a different species maybe he's gonna be a\ngrapefruit who knows or if that's just how the leaves look on this particular\nplant and he'll produce the same types of fruit as they do now for those\nwondering we're only at 26 months it's gonna be several\nmore months before these even start to fruit I figure they probably won't fruit\nnext year because that will only be the year three and then maybe the following\nyear they'll fruit now it's not unheard of to get a lucky tree that's a citrus\nschool from seed to get a fruit or flower in their third year but I'm not\nexpecting that judging by what's been going on with all of my other grown from\nseed series I highly doubt any one of these will put on a flower or even grow\nfruit next year but in the meantime we're just gonna keep keeping these guys\nnursed and happy and healthy and when the winter freeze hits we're gonna put\nthem into the patio where they can be protected from the elements anyway I\nwanted to give you just a good bird's-eye look at them not much\nprogress since the last video other than the buds breaking the transplant shock\nis gone and they're looking fantastic in my opinion at 26 months old so there you\nhave it everyone that's my update on my citrus trees oranges and lemons grown\nfrom seed at 26 months now many of you asking about my apple tree update I'll\nbe doing that here really shortly I'll get you caught up on the apple trees for\nsure I've got to catch up on my pear trees and then finally I've got a couple\nof other grown from seed series I'd like to get started that many of you\nrequested that I do so give me a few weeks and I'll get all my trees from\nseeds series updated it's so tough to say anyway everyone this is Rob the\nbackyard garden air saying thanks for watching give me a thumbs up if you'd\nlike and happy gardening", "amDY5ULvNX4": "hi this is Linda and welcome back to my kitchen this is something that I showed you on many many videos ago and I've come up with something new concerning it that I think you all will learn better so anyway I way back when I showed you how to preserve lemons without salt and what you do is you just take your lemons your bag of lemons or one lemon whatever how you buy them and you wash them and then you put them whole in the freezer and these will last months and months and months and then when you get ready to use it you thaw it just a little bit in the microwave if you want to set it and if you want to use the whole lemon you just thought-out in there and cut it in half and it'll be so juicy you can hardly contain on the juice and and it's really a good way to keep lemons without using all of that salt only they say you can't taste it I don't believe it and it's just too much trouble so that is the first way the second way is to take the lemon after you've washed your lemons and you don't have to do all of them this way you can freeze some whole if you like this one was frozen whole and the stem end which will be a little green spot you know there's a little pointed end on there that's not it take the stem end and slice it off and then put it in the freezer and then will stay a long time well when you get ready to need and you need here's one I've already done that's frozen you need some lemon zest you take your box grater and you use the holes the larger holes on one side and I I'll try to do this right-handed but I don't know that I can and you just start braiding it I can't do it very well my my right you get the idea don't look on already how much is there let me turn it around and do it with my left hand remember your lemon is claimed to need some zest and you're gonna get a little bit of lemon and then when you've used all you're gonna need of this and there it is get a show a close-up of it you just take the rusty or lemon and put it back in the bag and put it back in the freezer till next time you want to use it so that is my new tip now I'm going to use this in a cake I'm gonna make later and I'll have a video of that so thank you for coming back into my kitchen I appreciate it each and every time give me a thumbs up a like if you like this video if you like my videos or my channel and share the recipe if you want to I love that thank you for coming in and until next time you take care and God bless give you a close-up of that to see what it looks like it's fine enough to use anywhere god bless you", "aniojYBwSWY": "i grew it from i grew it from a little a little yeah nah a little stamp like it was a little tiny tree we're picking the i got fred right there hey fred say hi cause i'm gonna put you on youtube we're gonna get some bags of a whole bunch of lemon oranges you know did you ever taste them the lemon orange they're uh they're really good it's different man it's like sweet and sour they're really good though that's a lot well i just wanted to put this on i thought it would be funny and i gotta tell you brad i don't know what happened that that uh box just went over there by itself i had to keep it busy they're just coming off right like nothing okay well finally taking some more hey fred we got a bag of them i got one let me put this bro they're rather fragrant i said we have something similar in our house but they don't taste good yeah they look more like oranges and they just taste like sour these are they smell so good dude they have like because it i don't know how but they're mixed with oranges you'll see i'll let you open one or take a bag take this bag there's gonna be a lot of bags and then we got this one still not finished so you can put our stuff in there and this tree it should have turned colors already like that tree in the back but it's taking longer i don't know why got higher offenses let's see what this thing tastes like there's one right here let's see what they taste like they smell good it doesn't work we should get about three bags", "eRjGw8nyEOM": "- Today we're going to see how oranges, limes, and lemons grow. In New Mexico, we don't grow orange trees\n'cause it's too cold, but here in southern California\nthey grow really well. So let me show you. You can see this is a younger orange. It's still green. It hasn't had time to mature yet and it's pretty hard. Now, right next to it, on\nthe branches down below, you can see these are some oranges that have already matured. They're really dark orange, and I'm gonna go ahead and cut one off. We'll see what it smells like. So you wanna take\nclippers to your oranges. You can pull them off as well, but the clippers make it easier sometimes. Oh, wow. It smells sort of green and like an orange, like citrus, at the same time. So you can see this is like an\norange you buy in the store, but it's right off the tree, so we need to wash it before we eat it. The flower end down here, this is called a navel orange because it looks like a navel, or it looks like your bellybutton! The leaves on the orange tree\nalso have a really nice scent, and you can sort of crumple them up. Wow, they smell wonderful. Mmm, delicious. Look how big this tree is. It goes all the way up\nover the top of the garage. It's a little hard to pick\nwhen they're up that tall, but the oranges will ripen at slightly different times so you can have oranges\nfresh off your tree. Another thing sometimes people will do is pick oranges and then make marmalade or\njelly or jam out of them, and for the rind on the orange, that's the outside part of the orange, is what you would use to make\norange peel or marmalade. We're still in the same backyard\ngarden here in Los Angeles. You can see what we have here\nis a different kind of a tree. This is growing in a container. It has a different\nplant around the bottom, but this is a lime tree, and look, even though the tree is not even as tall or about as tall as I am, it has lots of limes on it already, and this is a good way to grow citrus, especially if where you live is too cold, so you can grow it in a pot, bring it outside when it's warm, and then bring it back inside\nduring the winter and night so that it doesn't get too cold. Let's go ahead and pick one of the limes. So you can see I've got my pruners here. This one seems pretty ripe. I'm gonna go ahead and cut it right here, and you can see that's\nwhat a lime looks like when it comes off the tree. I wanna show you something\nelse on the lime tree, which is pretty interesting. If you look in here real closely, do you see it there? Thorns! So you have to be careful\nworking with some citrus plants. They have sharp thorns\njust like cactus do. So as you know, before we eat any fresh\nfruits and vegetables, we always wanna rinse them well. These have not been grown with pesticides, but they still have dirt from rain and from birds who've been,\nyou know, in the trees, and that's natural. You just wanna rinse them off really well. See that? Just with our fingers, we can get that dirt off. There you go and we don't wanna use soap\nwith fruits and vegetables. Just clean running water like this. There we go! Walking down the street, I found this mandarin orange tree growing in somebody's yard. You can see the fruit is not\nas round as a navel orange and it's smaller. Like other citrus fruits,\nmandarins can be hard to pick. One nice thing about mandarin oranges is that they're very easy to peel. You can see that it has sections just like a regular orange does. Now that I've peeled it, I just need to pull the mandarin apart. Look how easily the sections come apart. The last thing we're going\nto look at is a lemon tree. You can see these are really big lemons, and this one is pretty ripe. This is what a lemon's gonna look like if you leave it on the\ntree for a long time. You can see it's all dried up, but let's go ahead and pick this one. Of course, we're gonna wanna\nwash it off before we eat it. Wow, but it smells really wonderful. It smells like a really fresh lemon. You can see up here, here's a lemon that's young still, so it hasn't turned yellow. It's still ripening. Right next to one that's\na little bit riper. And you can see here, look\nat this, found a flower. Here's a lemon flower here. That'll turn into a lemon.", "oKtnLxeFWS0": "hi it's my way welcome back to my channel today we'll be making a lemon cane all the materials with links will be in the description starting from a bowl of conditioned translucent clay add a small amount of yellow and mix them until the colors are completely blended roll the clay into flattish cylinder and cut it into 8 wedges wrap the insides of four of those wedges in a thin sheet of white polymer clay so you should be left with this place a snake of white clay in the center of the cane and join both halves of the cane next you want to wrap the cane in a sheet of white clay and I do this twice as the first sheet wasn't thick enough if you want to make the skin of the lemon - you can wrap the cane in a sheet of yellow clay at this point I start squeezing the cane from the center out before I start rolling it it's okay if the clay squeezes out the ends that way you can make sure that the pattern inside the cane is running all the way through now you can start rolling it to reduce it to the desired size trim the ends I'll let the clay rest before you start slicing it if you want to get round to slices mine is still warm and as you can see the slices don't come out perfectly round not that they ever do at least not mine but allowing the clay to cool down really helps also a sharp blade also helps I placed a few slices on a ceramic coaster flatten them slightly and used a toothbrush to texture the skin and to run them up a bit next I use the needle to texture the inside to make a whole lemon use the same clay you used for the skin and shape it there's different kinds of lemons but I'll give mine pointy end today I texture them with a toothbrush but you can also use sandpaper I add more detail with a fine end it tool to make half a lemon close one end of the cane cut a small section and close the other end shape the lemon and cut it in half or even wedges to reveal the inside texture them the same way as we textured the whole lemons don't forget to texture the inside with a needle I just did orange soft vessels on the ends for a bit of definition add a tiny ball of green clay on one end of the lemon and poke a hole in it if you want you can add a thin piece of clay too to make the stalk I joined two thin snakes of green clay and leaves to attach two lemons to I baked that for 10 minutes fast and once cool I pushed them into the uncured whole lemons bonding with liquid clay and baked again I keep my lemon cane and cured so I can cut and texture the slices when I need them in other projects baking everything together later and that's the finished game and lemons I really hope you liked this tutorial give it a thumbs up and subscribe for more if you did thank you all so much for watching and I'll see you next time I touch out", "VctBOnC__so": "now here is a really simple idea if you put some old citrus fruit dried out somewhat you're not going to no longer looks very tiring just put the lemons or oranges on the shelf of your stove of your this one's already been grated a bit on your banner are your motif motif you'll just put on the edge or it doesn't matter if it's whereabouts this one happens to have a shelf on it so it's ideal but what happens the heat of the stove very slowly causes the citrus fruit to evaporate and in doing so you get a very very gentle citrus smell in the room it's not overpowering at all in fact you can only just smell it and this is a great little technique some people um maple holes and put a few cloves in it as well to get a clove smell but this is a very simple technique rather than throwing out your old fruit rolled oranges and lemons and limes put them on your wood burner and it's particularly nice well you can use it all year round but this particular at Christmas thank you", "Gv2ccn_uyuk": "[Music] hey y'all Dallas of Tennessee I am coming to you on Saturday afternoon probably won't be uploaded to sunday money or so somewhere later in the week before I get this edited and done but anyway i'm bringing you along on our recipe and this is going to get to part i want to make something in a farmer's wife making cookbooks because i believe i said in previous video that when we start making some vintage doing some vintage recipes out of these vintage cookbooks the recipe i want to do requires candied orange peel well obviously i have lemons in here so i decided I've got lemons on hand I'm not going to go about oranges to do this my husband like the lemon better anyway so do i so we're going to change from orange to linen and in order to do this it says us strips need to be cut which I've already experimented on one did a little work on this because I didn't want to be wasting a lot of time trying to do this strips are cut and these are boiled until tender then the juice is drained and to the appeals you add two cups of sugar and 1 cup of water or added they are then lifted from the syrup once mixtures boiled into the strips appear transparent and then they are lifted from the syrup and when slightly cooled rolled in sugar and then they should be dried should dry on a flat surface all right I've never done anything like this before I did see some older youtube videos but nothing real current so like I said I've already done one of these it does say that and some other readings I've done on making candy peels you can leave the piss on or I took a peeler and I guess you can probably see over here yeah I've got my vegetable peeler and I kind of peeled some of the back of it off because the list pissed you have on there the less you have to cook these because another recipe I found for it says to boil these a couple of times you boil them and then drain that water off and then you put fresh water in and boil them again so anyway first of all let's get to where we're going to cut our get our peel off of here and this was be very careful with this and if you have any cuts on your hand I highly recommend you wear gloves all right I got sliced a section with a sharp knife on each each side here i'm not trying to do all the way around and I'm taking a dull just a dull table knife and I'm climbing just getting in under the rind hear the appeal to get it started on each end because i am going to use these lemons i'm going to squeeze then i get the juice out of them I'm not just gonna throw them away in a lot of you ladies see that just peeled right off once you start that so kind of I just kind of did it in smaller sections and didn't have much luck trying to get a whole one off like that but once you get them started I just tend to come right off we go all right now as I was saying you can lay the pith on there that bitter bitter white stuff because that you're going to boil these things and i'll probably do not a couple times but i guess the less of the bitter stuff you have on there unless you have to boil it so I found the easiest way to do this was to cut cut in a little smaller section I can flatten out and I'm putting my finger on the back of the blade and I've got the sharp part and you have to push down a good little bit it look look I didn't mean to tear it but oh well that could happen too I said these are gonna be trial and trial and error here on these recipes you're learning right along with me so that's ya chump ok let's see let's see if this one will do a little better so yeah and this seems to be a lot of trouble but hey that one's want to tear to this as I started to say that this is a another use for your your lemon peels I know a lot of people just throw them away I know other people mortal life throat ours in vinegar and let them soak and she use it he uses it for cleaning I believe well hells kitchen does too if I'm not mistaken I believe yeah I recall her saying something when she made her living writing pie not too long ago to save the appeals and put them in vinegar because it does make excellent cleaning solution this one's not being very cooperative for me figures once I've shown the camera the others other one did just fine so you might have to get your fingers in there a little bit let's try let's try a little there we go I mean you can see I am I am getting this off I hope you can see Kenny there we go hopefully I had the camera on right not off to the side yeah when I look at it what they do so alright but anyway you get the gist of this I'm going to cut up enough because I need I need a cup worth of candy lemon peel so this is going to take a little work and I'm not going to sit here and force you to watch me do all this on camera because it would take too long so anyway when we get to the next stage will be back ok found a easier way to do this that was lots of extra hard work take your vegetable peeler well custom cut my hands off can not a very pretty linen but I'm gonna take my vegetable peeler put you can see me here and then get in the way and get back there in the white just a little bit and kind of saw it down till you get that strip of lemon off there I work much better and I don't have to sit there and try to scrape all that gunk out I mean out if you can see that Paul I had to scrape out of that first couple of lemons I did this is a whole lot easier trial and error like I said all right I got all the lemons peeled that second way I showed you much easier much faster things moved along quite well we went ahead and used my lemons and I've got the juice in the refrigerator our next step is we're going to boil these for about 15 minutes or until they're translucent now let me see if I can get behind the camera and see all right as you can see this one here in my right hand is the one I started out with it's a lot thicker and that so it might take a couple of boils on the stress thicker to get that bitterness out of there but anyway this is the part where at okay we're back for our next step we're going to make our simple syrup I've got two cups of sugar in this pot and I'm going to add one cup of water mixed in a little bit let's put on some heat and I'm going to get our our lemon peels the thicker ones are still not quite transparent but and actually I think I was kind of jumping the gun on that that was what one of the other recipes said that's one of the oh gosh okay you okay see that can you meet scoot you a little closer okay here's one of the thicker ones and those are hot and there's one of the thin ones you can see the light to it or not but it's getting transparent good anyway we're going to dump those in to the simple syrup all of you okay you always got a bar video excuse me let me let the dog in yeah alright got the loan people and the simple syrup dogs are back in the house stir this around a little bit and get it coated pretty good it's kind of on a low setting and turn my heat to about a medium heat and I'm sorry for all the steam over here in the back I've got spaghetti cooking I'm doing another video pantry meal that I'm doing as well got garlic bread in so at this point in the farmer's wife couldn't book it says you blood in this mixture until they're transparent I don't know if they'll ever get completely transparent once we get to the next stage we're going to roll them and sugar once they've cooled off slightly and we're going to put them on i'm going to use cooling racks over some wax paper to let them dry with the sugar on them i'm 20 with the idea of even putting some in the dehydrator maybe on a lower rack put the empty racks in between them and so that the heats just not blowing right down on them put a little low setting see how that does that's just something to play with but i mean back in the days that these recipes were done in these era era this era yeah we're talking from the 18 late 1800s through the 1930s these women didn't waste anything they put everything in use and like I said the recipe is for orange candied peel I'm doing London because it's what I had on hand you could do line or grapefruit whatever citrus fruits you have and you like you could turn it into you know take the peel and turn it into candied citrus peel and use it for decorations on cakes cupcakes pies what have you you just I don't know I think I think it's going to turn out looking pretty nice interesting I like piddling and stuff like this and finding other uses for it but anyway this this way nothing goes to waste nothing at all and I like that I like being able to use all parts as or as much in a mini part of food items that you purchase and spend all the money on find some other use for them whether it's putting it in these citrus peels and vinegar and using them for cleaning or candy and candy than candying them is that work Katie turning them into candy house that we go sorry it's saturday i turn my brain off on saturdays that's why it took me longer to figure out just peel the outside of the one and quit trying to peel it and scrape the piss out yeah turn the brain on okay we'll be back all right yeah simple syrup has spoiled down so these are pretty translucent I'm gonna take a slide spin we make sure y'all can see yeah y'all can see keep having to move my camera around so I can have it to check the digit I'm taking a slotted spoon and I'm kind of dishing these out and I'm going to put them on these cookie rocks just kind of kind of try to spread them out and I don't little taste of this simple syrup in here now I'm gonna throw that out I'm going to put it in something and I'm going to use it to sweeten my tea with because I like lemon in my tea anyway and it certainly has the lemony flavor so again nothing going to waste and you go that's a little warm I think yeah I might be able to get everything on here she's like fall through it's okay because some of those are really small pieces that broke on me so I was trying to get to yield some are definitely more translucent than others especially the later ones that I those did translucent real well and I think if I do this again that will definitely be the way I go about healing yet getting the peeling off of there instead of trying to peel the pith that white portion out of there this was much much easier little pieces all right did get translucent on me ok that's pretty well empty so I'm going to set it off to the back here I'm gonna let these kind of drip dry and cool off where I can handle them a little bit in here that's sticking I mean time while that's doing that I'm going to fix my plate of spaghetti and film that and eat dinner so will be Dec ok I've had these out dry in just a little bit letting the excess drip off some of them have fallen through but I've got a bowl of sugar here and I'll probably need to add more to that but I'm just going to take some of these toss them in this bowl and this is going to be a sticky mess and back this whole process with the simple syrup has been sticky I've got to clean up over here no ladies on another rack to let them dry messy yeah I think I need a rack with some you know what i think what i'm going to do is going to dehydrate a rack down because they're not as wide and they're not going to fall through so i think that'll work out a lot better down to see a little bit so you know these aren't going to fall through like they do on the cookie rack this were just a little too little too wide apart rolls around try not to get too many in there at wants cuz they have a tendency to want to stick together but you could see you know you should I've got some wax paper underneath there to catch the excess I don't have quite so big a mess and I have tasted these and they do taste they do taste good I ate one of the pieces that have a little bit thicker a little more thicker pieces that I did first it did have a little bit of an aftertaste but it was still tasty and I think these are going to be really really good in the recipe that I'm going to make them so anyway I'm going to finish these up and these are going to need to dry overnight I am seriously considering i'm going to try for you and the dehydrator for a little bit and see if the granulated sugar will stay on there or if it just going to cause it to you turn to liquefy height 2 i'm hoping it'll dry it out of listing so we can move this process along because i would like to start doing the recipe these to use these tomorrow we've gotten some cooler weather in the area so it'll be okay to turn the oven on without suffocating in the kitchen all right I'll show you let's try when I'm done bring y'all in for a close-up of the finished product I've got these ended up filling to dehydrator trays they seem to fit on there a lot better you can see there's the other one and I'm going to let these sit a little bit and try to dry one recipe says to let them dry for one or two one to two days I'm hoping that by putting them in the dehydrator I can dry them a little faster overnight and hopefully it won't melt the sugar on them I'm going to put the other two racks i have over to the side here on top of these so that they're not directly under the heat blowing on them and like i said i'm going to put them on the low a low setting and check on in fact i think i might just start with one tray and see how it does either way they still taste good and also want to show you this is the simple syrup i saved out of from the boiling of the lemon and I had a little taste of it and it's wonderful I've got a little floaty particles in there but it's just lemon so I'm going to use that to make sweet tea so that's going in the refrigerator I had actually already closed this video on making the candied lemon peel but I wanted to bring our back after i finished dehydrating this overnight this turned out so well I'm really pleased with this I decided to heck with it and went ahead and put it on the dehydrator all night long and I said it on the lowest setting which is 95 I have a nesco american american harvest dehydrator and i also put the other two trays on top I did not want the heat directly on those because i wanted i didn't want to melt the sugar and see if we can get that to focus in [Music] these looks so pretty oh these would make beautiful garnishes for desserts so i'm really pleased with this and i am looking forward to doing the next video with y'all where we're going to use these as an ingredient thank you for watching [Music]", "69BBBrI_hG4": "today I'm going to show you how to make candle out of a citrus fruit what you're gonna need is a fruit since wine some olive oil a knife and a spoon let's begin okay so the first thing you need to make sure of is that your fruit has a nice black base that's gonna send up after that what you need is a slice of thirds and on the middle like this so the next thing you want to do is carve out the inside of the lemon lettuce oops um make sure that you do not damage the central stem because it's gonna be parts of your wick so I've carved out the fruit using a spoon my dad's help me with the carving for safety reasons I have specifically not damaged the stem because it's gonna be part of the wick it's okay to leave a little bit of fruit in there because that's gonna add to the nice smell of the candle and make sure not to punch to this that's why I'm using a spoon because it's gonna be the container for your oil okay so what we've done here is we've just cut a bit of twine which we're gonna use as the wick initially we're gonna tie a very simple knot to the base of the stem inside very simple and you don't have to pull too tight that's just to hold the wick in place at the bottom you know rap a bit of the quicker understand very loosely do the same knot on the top very simple doesn't have to be too tight okay tighten it up a bit and then I'm gonna grab a scissors and just cut that there to create a natural wick with some simple household olive oil and one thing you want to make sure of is that you wet the wick so not strong light it's you have it to be persistent because it's not gonna light at first you go after you have to give it a second for the old stuff burning how cool is that James so we're gonna come back in the evening and watch the candle burning evening so this is a very very simple candle what did we use James nothing but a piece of string of roots and some olive oil so this one looks like a knight it's very bright I'm one of the good things about this candle over a regular one is that it doesn't get produce any bad smells and also it's just olive oil so if you tip over its not gonna be dangerous another good thing is we need to put over it'll just automatically burn it out so this look at this cannon will last you from about ten to fifty fourteen hours and if you want to you can place it inside a bowl just one thing you have to do is you have to keep talking up the oil or the wick is gonna dry out", "1kOMxUsfwFU": "folks this is all the fruit I'm in gran canaria this is 11 this is about as much as I can say I'm here in the small total idea by hostess selling fruit it's as soon as I saw this really big thing I asked Oh what is this it I said those are lemons and then I thought okay I've seen a lot of different levels here and the calories they don't seem to be really standardized I guess everything that's green and sour goes but then during the last at this pretty much everybody coming to his restaurant says oh what is this and they have to explain to everyone the dorsal events so I decided they're interesting enough to make a video despite the usual problem here in Korea nobody knows the variety well it's a really big level about 700 crimes they are all about the same size and same shape so here in the markets often you see leopards where you you have 50 levels in the box that each one looks different but in this case they were pretty uniform pretty much the same size said almost the same shape I bet they would all be like between six hundred and eighty two seven hundred and sixty grams all of them so this suggests to me that it could be some named variety at not some of those old country lemons they have here well whatever let's see what this is inside with a lot of really giant citrus fruit once you cut them open you realize that most of the inside is actually pit it not so much is juice but wow look at that here you really get value for money well okay I mean you could complain about this big all on the inside but look at that most of the fruit this actually juicy flesh the skin is really did yes it is it it is in a small lemon or even thinner okay and this this year might be a bit hollow but at least you don't pay for air right so cutting fruit with one hand homeboy well this is at least an interesting level it is one of the few really big citrus fruit where actually the useful part is big maybe I had this giant lemon Citroen hybrids they sell in Italy the area of a bulky but even when you buy a two or three kilogram fruits there there is almost nothing edible inside well I mean that was a hybrid with Citroen and Citroen is often bred for the skin for the pit so yeah well now let's try this thing interesting it tastes like a lemon sour but not too sour and somehow to me taste salty what they realized for the first time that the sourness of the lemons is quite similar to saltiness and this is somewhere in the middle still a bit closer to lemon sourness but really strange really strange this thing I mean it's good it's really good at it I recommend it to you he's selling them for a euro 50 a kilogram and those you could totally make juice for them you could I think you could drink the juice pour usually lemon juice is a little bit too sour during it pure but yeah awesome this must be really interesting for cooking well giant lemon slices some pretty beautiful for decoration but also this mixture of saltiness and sourness this is incredible I was looking at those things for 10 days the template F&A decided to make the video I thought I would get something with a bit of juicy flesh inside and a lot of bitter pit on the outside something which is just cultivated because of the size so just because it's some lemon but no this thing this thing is really interesting folks YUM laughs don't touch that lemon skin hmm with typical flavor of lemon skin however I cannot detect any bitterness in the skin it's not thick and sweet like in the Amalfi lemon but it's basically without bitterness but with the lemon flavors of this stuff could actually be quite interesting for limoncello if you want to make a really good limoncello you take the juice of the lemon and also the skin but first you remove the white pit from underneath the skin in this case there is not a lot of fight but I wonder if this is something related to the Amalfi lemon or if this is something you could actually use well you can use every lemon like the Amalfi lemon but there are multi lemon is kind of specifically bred to be used for to be used for limoncello in this stuff here this could be as good or even better as the Amalfi lemon for limoncello however I don't know how the saltiness in the taste will I don't know if I should call it saltiness if it tastes like a lemon but a little bit more salty square inch is a pleasant saltiness it doesn't taste like a fruit grown on saline soil which usually makes for quite bad quality fruit this is a really good quality lemon this is one of the best lemons I've ever had one of the most amazing lemons and here this stuff is being sold for a euro 50 a kilo this is amazing I'm so glad I made the video this is Ian sometimes you look at some stuff and think oh god this is gonna be so boring and finally you make the video and you're so glad I wonder how many videos I did not make about stuff I thought would be boring and which is actually amazing Wow I'll continue pestering my host maybe he can find out the lemon variety this is really amazing lemon folks maybe I should save some seats by the way the seats also look a little bit strange look the seats don't look exactly like lemon seats they're kind of wept I think I'll save the tickle safety seats if this is not the named variety this is still a very interesting variety well folks this was a really amazing lemon unfortunately I don't know the name stay tuned for a lot more fruit videos from the Great Island of Gran Canaria and don't forget to like share comment and subscribe", "h-6EtDTazxw": "hi today we're going to be making some sangria using this new device I've got in skul squeezers so this is used to basically squeezed orange juice out of our oranges or any citrus fruit so what you do is I've already tried it with a few so I'm going to do just one because I've already done a few so you just put your orange into your cradle like this and then you have to cut the orange into half so this is an unusual part that I've never seen in any other squeezer so in order to figure out how to use this device you can also read their instructions that come here so explains how to do it so you basically put your orange in or your fruit in and then you put the cutter down and then you have to press in order to squeeze the orange out of the orange juice so this is a typical typical part that you've seen before in any other squeezer but the difference with this one is that it also cuts the fruit into half so this kind of adds a little bit more I think juice when you are juicing the fruit out so I was trying to make this angry and I bought quite a few oranges I wasn't sure how much I'm gonna need but now this is the third one is actually the one that I'm making out and I think I have enough so we need half a cup of or juice and so yeah you squeeze it out like this and you can see all the orange juice that's coming out so I think we're good we have about half a cup of done and so what happens next is I basically have to release it and I'm going to remove the pulp and the citrus that's left and so that's it that's my squeezers so now I'm going to make my sangria for you so what I do is I have my wine container I wasn't sure how much wine was gonna fit in here so we'll see I picked out a red wine for this recipe so going to put the wine in just one bottle of wine it's really cold here in the rainy and where I live in Seattle and so having sangria I think we'll add a lot of kind of warm nice toasty feeling to us this this week so um I'm not sure if my apples are going to fit I might have to redo my apples but basically you have to put in yeah this uh container isn't made for the pieces that I've got so I'm gonna just cut them out by hand so you have to add one Apple and then you add also one whole orange one lemon and everything has to be sliced up and you also add about about one and a half limes we will also be adding some sugar so I'm a bit struggling a bit because my my wine container is not really supposed to be I think for sangria it's gonna be funny to remove all the parts from it how it's gonna pour out we'll figure it out second just one Apple about so now let's let's do some juice so we'll put our juice I don't know if I'm gonna make a mess so about half a cup of orange juice next we're going to get half a cup of brandy so I'm just going to eyeball it so this is the proportion for one bottle of wine there's my brandy and I'm going to put in my orange so you can either cut your orange into segments or if you can do rounds I was expecting that it's going to be a little bit difficult to put these pieces in there so I cut them into house as well so you put your half orange pieces and it really already is creating a really quite quite a beautiful look for this a wine drink so I often by sangria just pre-made and bottles but I think it's much more fun to make it your own and you can vary the amount of sugar citrus if you like and I think the citrus dis already I can see all the colors that it adds to our beautiful wine container oops so I'm going to continue struggling with my Apple pieces I should have probably cut them a little smaller you can do that at home and then I have my lemons as well so i'm using Meyer lemons today as just Meyer lemons are similar to any other lemons that a little smaller and they're yellow I think the flavor is a little stronger so you just need one whole lemon and i'm using actually half actually i'm using a whole line but i think you can add half a lime or one and a half lines depending on how much you like so i'm using key limes for this recipe and mostly all the pieces you see is just from one Apple that I've had to cut as well so I have also have some strawberries i'm not sure if i'm going to add them or not we'll see and already my container school of apples so i'm going to add some sugar right now and some more apples and this wine sangria one is going to be full soon well so there we go so now what happens is next out we're going to need to chill it in the fridge and then we're going to add a cup of club soda to this to just add a little bit of fizz when the drink is chilled we might drink it now because actually our wine was outside and it's pretty cold so I think it's probably ready to to be consumed already so you see how beautiful it looks because of all the fruits in there really adds a lot to your table and kind of improves the mood makes you think about something warm and fruity and you forget about the cold outside so enjoy this recipe try to make sangria at home yourself and check out this device that I've tried today and it's squeezers really neat

super delicious kids love this recipe and you can just have it well it's looking last very long because you're probably gonna eat it but it's really nice I hope you enjoyed this recipe let's get started in your pan add your lemon juice and then orange juice and then we're going to add some orange zest and then lemon zest and I'm gonna mix everything together the flavors and the smell is already so good we're going to cook this for a couple of minutes until you see it starts to bubble up and just keep mixing it until it starts to cook down and reduce once the flavor is infused we're gonna sieve it through and put all the mixture into a cup we don't want to have any bits of that in our marmalade and just gently press down so you get all the juice as much as you can next take your pan and add all your a lemon and orange juice then I'm gonna add some gelatin and you need quite a lot of gelatin for this recipe and just mix everything together until it melts and you don't have any any lumps just keep mixing it together and cook it on a medium heat you don't want to burn this as well and make sure there are no lumps of gelatin anywhere and just mix it through so it becomes kind of nice and even mixture just like this so when it's done you're going to add some sugar and it's a lot of sugar so just add all your sugar inside and then we're going to add the rest of our lime juice and the rest of our orange juice inside and then just mix everything together so the mixture will start to come and even out and we want to make sure that all the sugar melts together but the flavor of this is so so delicious and fresh and citrusy we're going to cook this for a couple of minutes until it's all melted and you can see bubbles on the sides just keep stirring it occasionally then we're going to [Music] guys and girls I have my recipe on my website at Ali's yummy food calm you'll find full ingredients and also directions on how to make this and also you'll be able to find loads of other recipes that I do for my channel and just click through click on the picture and you'll be able to see the whole video with the directions and the full recipe in English and Russian languages to prep our mold you can use any molds that you wish I'm just using a baking tin with some parchment paper and I have sprayed it with some cooking oil then I'm gonna add my lemon and orange marmalade inside and I'm gonna place this into the fridge so it gets nice and set this will take couple of hours or so after that I take it out of the fridge and I'm gonna add some more sugar on top to make sure it doesn't stick to my hands and you want to move your hands around and rub the sugar in just like that and then we're going to flip this around and on to the other side and add more sugar on top and just repeat the process by rubbing sugar inside our marmalade and then you want to take a really really sharp knife and then slice your marmalade inside and it will stick to your knife as well because the sides are not covered in the sugar but don't worry it's it's it's a it's a patient process and just keep slicing that up and then finally you will start to see these little lil shapes and then cut them into triangles or whatever way you like to serve it traditionally we have them in triangles and you can cover the bits in sugar as well so they don't stick to your hands or to your knife and there you go look at this it's so so pretty so delicious really really soft in the middle tastes so amazing so much better than the shop bought one a lot of flavor a lot of citrusy flavor and I absolutely love the homemade version I really really hope you try these guys they're little little pockets of sweets this is what I used to have as a child and they're very very stringy and I love that look at this check out all the other videos I have and make sure to like and comment on this video thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "qGzsq9TtUcg": "hey everybody its joy from Steven suburban homestead welcome back all of our replay viewers so a couple days ago I did a video welcome welcome oh I may not be on Wi-Fi let me turn that on I think that will help our whatever is called ok so I think that might be a better connection in a second great hey Ethan ok so what I did last week if you remember is we juiced a bunch of lemons I use a little electric juicer and that i got for 16 bucks off of amazon there's the kind of contraption i used and we use the lemon juice for lemonade and i'll show you um this is when you just have so many lemons you don't know what to do with it so we make lemonade in a pitcher and then that looks like lemonade but it's actually an entire thing of lemon juice so hey diana and what we do with the lemon juice is we freeze them into little ice cubes and so these you can pop into any drink or you can kind of pre look to see how much many of these would make like a half a cup or something you can use them for baking so that's some super fun way to use your lemons we have Meyer lemons on our tree and then just a day ago I actually juice the rest of our lemons and I'm making lemon candy so go to our pinterest board stephen suburban homestead welcome everybody i'm making lemon candy i'm guessing this is going to taste like lemon heads which I am just wild about I don't know if y'all like lemon heads my husband thought this was kind of weird but you know people have been eating orange slices since like what the 1960s and lemon head so why not try to make it yourself we actually use the peels from these last week to put into vodka to make the first step of limoncello and y'all can go back and look at that old video thanks yeah lemon cello Heller so around here we're all about alcohol and sugar treats I guess but we do drink it so anyway my the recipe I pinned for today I'm not going to take you through every step I just wanted to get you started go to the Pinterest board look at the recipe so we took the lemon peels see this one doesn't look that good so I'm going to throw that out anyway the ones that look really good we watched him so well because I mean this is what you're going to be eating they said on the Pinterest thing to take like a melon baller I'm not sure which one's going to work for me better hey Donnie you just kind of have to experiment with this stuff because not all the time on pinterest of the do these things work but you're scraping out the part here and look I prepared a few so you could see just as a side note in case you're irritated with how bad my video is haha I tried one of those cool little holder things I can't get it to work so we're just go old school like this all right so you're peeling this off and you're appealing the piss I think it's what it's called is the little bit of white just a little bit of and see how close I can get you see that there's the peel and then there's like a little white and then there's that stuff welcome welcome okay so once you kind of scrape out I think with Meyer lemons it's not going to be is essential to get so much of it out because Meyer lemons already are a little bit sweet so then after you do that then you would slice them into super thin pieces so like just super thin here you know like little julienne is what I think you would call it if you're a master chef I'm notice that I cut out the butts is what we call them I'm not just a little part where they hang from the tree or the stem so you don't want to you don't really want to eat that I think because it I'm not sure if it matters but I just cut it out okay so anyhow once you're done I'm scraping with your melon baller to get most of that other stuff out that's not going to be tasty and then you slice these into Julie am then you're going to blanch them for two minutes eat welcome welcome so I have my water boiling you just dump them in you blanch them for two minutes then you throw them in a strainer rinse them with cold water boil some new water throw them in again for two more minutes they said on a regular lemon to do it three times but one of the people said that if you do that you might lose War of the lemon flavor so you're like taking a chance there ooh do I bling it twice or do have lights three times I don't know do it try it if you don't like the candy bird away do it again it's lemon peels for God's sakes twice there you go girlfriend okay so with Meyer lemons especially I think twice because again they're sweeter not as bitter and not as tart so then you blanch them then the second time while you're letting that strain out you'd make a simple syrup and this recipe calls for three cups of sugar and four cups of water you literally just boil it there hey Zach and boil it on there again and then you put all of those little julienne pieces of lemons after you've gotten all this stuff out and then you would just lightly simmer them so like the lowest boil possible it says for an hour so really I have something going on at noon today it's 940 I'm preparing all this I'm going to put it on the stove and let it you know turn the timer on y'all so you don't forget and then I'm going to go off and do whatever I need to do until it's ready so yeah I know I've never done this before thanks for saying that and I've just been looking for you know we make a lot of lemon meringue or lemon cream pies but I mean pretty much everything do lemon is going to involve sugar right because there is this tartness to it we're just trying to find other ways and we just love candy is a treat for us yummers candies a treat we do not eat candy every day we're also those weird people that don't even eat all of our Halloween candy and so if you want the real recipe just scooch on over to stevens suburban homestead on pinterest so i thought well you know what if i could get candy that's made from stuff that we already have like if this works well i'm totally going to try it with our orange peels and call me crazy i may even try it with grape fruit peels because we grapefruits that we have are these um yellow ones let me show you exactly no chemicals no high fructose corn syrup we use organic sugar perfect for saving money and my daughter's five I'm let me just show you this Roy let all my energy out these are like some kind of blondish golden grapefruits there tart but not bitter at all and I'm guessing those ruby reds would be delicious to to try the grapefruit peel if you have someone in your family who likes things a little more tart anyway yeah my daughter is five let me show you a picture ever and she and I are gonna do home school in the fall that's not in focus there we go oh oh isn't she sweet that's her total personality right there always having fun that's what we do and I think that this is going to be something I mean clearly she can't Julian lemons but I could get her scraping away on that stuff thanks y'all so sweet and um even if she can't do everything you know it's just really nice to include your kids in the everyday stuff even if they just do one thing because frankly her attention span is like a net so it's not like I think she's gonna be in here for 45 minutes helping me prep but I'm going to test the recipe see how it goes and then I have a whole nother bag of these i'll show you my bag cuz who has time to do all this you know at one time I don't have a pot banging up but that's a lot of lemon candy if we like it after you know when I tested tonight will make the rest of it into lemon candy and they said that it lasts like a week outside the refrigerator several weeks in the refrigerator I'm going to go for the gold and see if it'll freeze I mean it's candy just barely cost me anything the most expensive part is organic sugar what anyway so thanks for tuning in I do have other videos I think still there or you can go to youtube try to transfer them over because I just hang out here on the homestead and try to save money and have fun and come up with new ways to use what we have growing so I talked about what's in my window a lot because I you know if you're propagating or if you're growing things oh mama needs to cut some flowers so I do a little what's in the window I do a little what's for dinner I do little virtual tours in the garden what's growing on so just to follow us if you haven't already hello there late comers that's ok it's not that long a video and so go ahead and subscribe Stevens suburban homestead and I'm just go back we're talking about making lemon candy for y'all who tuned in late ok y'all peace out have a great day", "9upY91iYybw": "[Music] [Music] you [Music]", "FvpTwLMLfTc": "high-volume girls welcome to blogeee kids lab making science super fun today we're going to show you how to make your very own orange candle proving that you don't need a wick and wax to make a candle for this experiment you're going to need some matches an orange a knife a sharp knife so do be careful and some olive oil firstly take your knife and very carefully cut into the orange you want to cut deep enough to go just beyond the skin but no further than that make sure you cut all the way around the orange then very carefully using your thumb dig into the orange just below the layer of the skin the reason we're being so careful is because even though we want to remove all of the orange we want to try and keep the stalk from the center of the orange attached to the skin because that's going to be really important later on carefully pull the two halves of the orange apart and place one of the halves to one side then very carefully remove the orange from the inside of the skin if you twist the orange out you'll see that the stalk stays attached to the inside of the skin there you go easy you should be left with something that looks a little bit like an upside-down mushroom then take some of your oil and pour it inside the orange skin you want to make sure that some of the oil gets on top of the stalk of the orange then take your matches and very carefully start to light the stalk of the orange this might take a little bit of time to do be patient eventually you'll see that the stalk of the orange catches light this is because the orange act as a natural wick the oil a candle burns by vaporizing the wax or in this case olive oil if you like you can also use the other half of the orange to create a windshield for your orange to make sure that it stays a light for longer and there you go that's how you make your very own orange candle you can think of any other ways to make your own candle at home do let us know leave it in the comments box below and remember to subscribe to our channel so that you can see all of our future experiments and have loads of fun in the future thanks very much bye", "NmBxeMx-yWU": "In this video, I will show you citrus rootstocks being grown from seed\nin a California nursery. I saw this process at\nTreeSource Citrus Nursery in California's Central Valley. Citrus nurseries in California start their rootstock seedlings\nwith seeds from the fruit of mature rootstock\ntrees that are registered with the California Department\nof Food and Agriculture. These are special trees in that\nthey are periodically tested to ensure that they are free of pathogens that cause citrus diseases. The pathogen that causes HLB, the deadliest known citrus disease, is not transmitted via seeds. Some other citrus pathogens\nare seed-transmitted, however, so testing is important. The seeds come from\nspecial varieties of citrus and citrus hybrids called rootstocks. There are many rootstock varieties. The typical rootstock\nfruit tastes terrible, but that's not important\nbecause the fruit to be eaten comes from the scion, the\nfruit-producing citrus variety, that is grafted to the rootstock. The right rootstock can give a citrus tree resistance to disease,\npoor soils, or frost. Also, certain rootstocks\ncan make the fruit of the grafted variety\nmore flavorful than others. The rootstock fruit is harvested by grabbing tree branches\nwith a hook and shaking them. Fruit is then raked up and put in a crate. The fruit is harvested when it is ripe and ready for the seeds to be extracted. The fruit is run through\nan extractor machine to separate the seeds from the fruit. Seeds exit the machine via one chute. The rest of the fruit exits\nthe machine via another chute. The fruit is sent through the extractor multiple times to extract more seeds. The seeds from the extractor\nare rinsed with water. During this process, floating seeds are discarded, as they will not germinate. Only the sinkers are kept. The seeds at this point\nare slimy and acidic. To eliminate the slime and lower the acidity,\nthe seeds are stirred into a mixture of water\nand lime and then, rinsed. Next, the seeds go\nthrough a heat treatment to eliminate some pathogens. The seeds are soaked\nfor 10 minutes in water, mixed to achieve a temperature\nof 52 degrees Celsius. After the heat treatment,\nthe seeds are treated with a fungicide to keep them mold-free. Next, the seeds are spread\nout to dry in the mild Autumn sunshine typical of\nCalifornia's Central Valley. When the seeds are dry, they're collected and taken to the seed sorter. The seeds are sorted into\nmultiple sizes and then, packaged. Seeds that are not germinated right away are placed in cold storage\nand used throughout the year. When it is time to plant the\nseeds, the seeds are peeled. First, the seeds are chemically treated to soften the seed coat. Then, vermiculite is used to rub the seed coats off of the seeds. Peeled citrus seeds germinate much faster than unpeeled citrus seeds and the seedlings from peeled seeds have straighter, healthier roots. A fan is used to separate the seeds from the seed coats, which are blown away. To get ready for the\nseeds, pots are filled with a growth medium that is then watered. To protect them from insects\nthat spread citrus diseases, the seedlings are grown inside\nan insect-proof greenhouse. When employees enter or\nleave the greenhouse, insects are excluded by a\ndouble-doored vestibule, in which only one door\nmay be open at a time. A fan is triggered to blow\ninsects out of the structure whenever the outside door is opened. Even in cold storage, the viability of citrus\nseeds declines with time. Later in the season, when the viability of the seeds is lower, seeds\nare planted two per pot. Having been peeled, the rootstock seeds begin\nto germinate quickly. Unlike most nursery plants, individual citrus rootstock seedlings grow at different rates and must be sorted two\ntimes in the growing cycle of four to six months. When the seedlings are of sufficient size, they are budded with the\ndesired scion variety. Click here to learn how they are budded. I made this video to help stop the spread of deadly citrus diseases. When buying a citrus tree,\nyou can avoid introducing citrus diseases into your\nyard by buying your tree from a reputable nursery.", "T5p7zx_vnHo": "good morning I hope everyone's having a great

citrus trees are relatively easy to grow provided that you never warm enough climate even if your conditions are not ideal there may still be a citrus tree for you read on about how to grow an assortment of citrus fruits after the jump a warm sunny southern or western exposure is best shelter is a big help - if cold is a concern choose or create some place with well-drained soil and avoid putting a citrus tree directly into a lawn a nearby reflective wall fence or even patio can provide both shelter and a bit of extra warmth to choose the type of citrus you would like to try growing oranges lemons grapefruit etc ask the nursery about the climate that the particular tree is suitable for ask about or look up the season for the trees you intend to get citrus generally ripens in winter but different fruits ripen throughout the year as well if you live somewhere that's a bit colder than a strictly Mediterranean climate look into cultivars bred for cold resistance taste the fruit if you have the opportunity not all oranges are alike if you can taste fruit grown on a tree in your area perhaps from a neighbor even better find out if the fruit produced has many seeds or not ask for certification of the health of the tree or ask someone who is experienced with citrus trees to inspect it see warnings ask at the nursery or look up online how large the mature Brie will get tried a warf citrus trees if you are short on space you can even grow them in large pots and they open up the possibility of covering the entire tree in a shelter during the delicate winter months or even bringing the tree indoors even though they are small dwarf citrus trees can produce a very reasonable harvest on the other end of the spectrum a couple of large lemon trees can form a good-sized hedge room it all depends on just how much citrus you want the saying goes that you should dig at least to $60 home for a $20.00 tree as a practical matter make sure you know where you want to place the tree then dig a hole that is about three feet in diameter and as deep as the container do not bury the root to crown the transition from trunk to roots as this will cause problems down the road playa the tree slightly higher than the surrounding soil to allow for some settling most container grown nursery stock has high organic matter content that will decompose causing the plant to settle in the plant in hole dropping the root crown below grade if not planted slightly high if you have any concerns about drainage such as in heavy clay soil fill the hole with water and see how long it takes to drain out if you have drainage problems dig the hole even deeper and plant the tree up higher for a dwarf citrus tree select your large pot try for two feet in diameter or 1/2 barrel at least depending on the quality of what you took out of the hole you might try a half-and-half mixture of compost and the Nellie's in soil create a mound of soil in the middle of the hill that supports the root ball with a crown slightly above it mixed in some citrus fertilizer with the soil if you like if you are planting a dwarf citrus in a pot use straight potting soil and fill it into a similar level place the pot up on blocks and be sure there are plenty of drainage holes in the bottom don't let the pot sit directly in a sorcerer or puddle of water place the tree on the mound of soil add or remove soil underneath to adjust the height so that the crown is level with the soil or even slightly above it fill in the remaining hole with a mixture of compost or potting soil and the soil from your garden if you are using a pot fill with straight potting soil leave at least two inches at the top to allow space to water thoroughly stay away from organic motes as it increases the likelihood of footrot disease as safe betters that the roots are at least as wide as the branches so make the mulch area at least this large you can even add a room of mulch around the circumference of the circle to aid in watering do not multi right up to the base of the trunk leave a little margin so that the Crown has breathing room and doesn't stay wet when you water water the tree at least weekly until it is established unless you get sufficient trained to do the job water even mature citrus trees regularly citrus trees have relatively shallow broad root systems once established the trees may tolerate some droughts but they won't produce fruit plants of good fertilize the tree with an appropriate fertilizer fertilizers are available in citrus or sitrus and avocado formulations apply them according to package instructions typically three to four times a year for slow release types prune citrus trees occasionally they don't require heavy or regular pruning remove any suckers or shoots growing from the root stock citrus trees are grafted meaning that a tree with desirable fruit is cut and attached to a sturdy a root stock you don't want the root stock taking over remove any wild shoots growing beyond the general shape of the tree these will often be long straight quick growing branches that don't follow the overall form or shape of the tree moderately thin the foliage if it grows excessively dense to promote air circulation and availability of light generally trained citrus trees as shrubs or hedges if you'd like to remove a few lower branches to give it more of a tree shape go ahead but don't overdo it harvest fruit when it is fully ripe oranges lemons and grapefruits should all be completely free of green coloring they will", "HYh8mC2mhTY": "[Music] [Music] bye

citrus peel and i haven't had candied citrus appeal for years and years we used when i was when i was little we traveled a lot and we always stopped at the howard johnsons and we all the kids and and my brother a large family would pile out of the car we'd all go running and say mom can we get some of the and they would have the little candy citrus peel-like things there and it was it was just sugar gelatin and stuff but we loved them the first time i made this i ran across it the basic recipe in a fanny farmer cookbook an old fanny farmer cookbook the first time i made it i said i am never buying that stuff at the store again the little gelatin things because it's much better fresh absolutely and it's it's wonderful after that have you tried this yes i did try one earlier and that's more okay have some more okay it's it's and of course a christmas time citrus such a classic traditional thing to have okay and how do we get started it's easy okay it's a little bit messy but it's easy almost every recipe i do is messy with me so it doesn't make any difference the morph mess you make the more fun that you have that's right the better it is okay you've got lemons i've got so you have two different types that you're making i well actually i make it all together okay now you could do this with grapefruit you can do it with lime orange lemon any citrus works great okay i happen to prefer oranges and lemons and i just do them all together okay now i see some the water is beginning to boil here we've got some water boiling okay so this is the part where we make the mess okay we do just slice off either end now the navel oranges sometimes have a really thick right that's okay the easy way i find slice right down through it okay and then we just start taking in fairly large wedges okay we'll get some of those let's do a let's do a line and again just in half and then quarter each half quarters thirds something like that whatever you're in the mood for whatever you're in the mood for because what you want to do is then after you've got the segments is you're going to take your knife and just cut right along and you're just going to cut out all the flesh so you get to have a eat an orange and eat a lemon while you're at it my impeccably clean hands are the only thing that's touching you care for an orange sure there we go yeah you get to eat that too and this is what we're really after here this is the peel and some of those so we're making special something special out of what people usually throw right this is the stuff that normally gets thrown away and in most recipes you know when they when they call for a zest zest of an orange or that's what it is they say be very very careful just to get the top you don't want that white pith that's exactly what we're after here okay and then the navel oranges sometimes have a really thick skin you can pare that down a little bit if you want but i don't because it's all going to get candied and it's all going to be sweet and tart at the same time okay so whoops going to make a mess so you've got we've got some here that we've that i've already cut up okay so it's about uh quarter three against three about a quarter of an inch thick just like that in they go and then just pile that in there okay and through the magic of television we're going to speed up the process okay now this this is very easy but it does take a while now how long would this normally take what i do is i boil this once for oh about five or ten minutes okay a rolling boil a good rolling boil okay about five or ten minutes and then we drain it okay rinse it off okay and we bring it up to a boil again lots of water a new set of water a new set of water okay because what you really there's a lot of uh volatile oils and some of that stuff is pretty bitter and that's what we're going to get okay so we just cook it until it's tender 30 minutes or so in a nice gentle boil okay and when that's done then we just drain them and is it 30 minutes each time no no uh to ten minutes it's it's not real important first boil about five to ten minutes and that's more to clean it up than anything else right and then about 30 minutes until it gets tender and you want them because they're still pretty pretty hard for a couple minutes we want them to be nice and tender okay i told you i was going to make a mess so this is right this can stay and that's it okay you're done with the first part okay now the basic recipe would do oh probably two grapefruit hmm three oranges about this size or maybe four or five lemons about this size okay i of course do a huge batch because on all the when i you're going to make a mess you want to get a lot of mess get a lot done that's right and i make a ton of this stuff okay um so i do a whole bag of oranges and a whole bag of lemons all at once yeah but the basic recipe would do probably about three or four oranges somewhere in that range it's not credit it's not important the exact measurements and what do we do next so what we do next is we get our pot back okay and we're going to put into the pot okay now over the heat again this is going to go on the heat okay a nice gentle heat okay exactly one cup of sugar okay that's exactly one cup of sugar i can see that in okay okay to that about three tablespoons of clear corn syrup okay this carrot syrup one two three okay now what do we say three tablespoons we can put that on the heat okay and a nice low heat and we're gonna add about three quarters of a cup of water okay so it's one cup of sugar three tablespoons of corn syrup and three quarters of a cup of water okay okay put that on the heat okay and and it blends almost instantly yeah it it'll dissolve real quickly all right okay that's going and it will it will get clear as it as it as it cooks up okay and then we take that and this is all one pot right back it goes okay okay a softened boiled peel right okay you're working much too hard charlie at this point let it sit let it sit and get on a very very low heat you want to just barely simmering okay and you walk away and you have yourself some eggnog maybe some of the you have whatever you want yes okay in oh 20 minutes 30 minutes 40 minutes depends on the ratio of water to sugar and so on you're going to find that most of this has evaporated okay or it's cooked in it's absorbed right into the citrus field okay at which point now all that bitterness is gone there's just a little hint of it left and you've got candied citrus peel okay it's ready to eat at this point okay but it's better and in fact you could even you could even let this cook down until most of the liquid is absorbed okay if you like put it in the fridge let it go overnight come back to it the next day okay reheat it slightly and then once again any any liquid that's left in there you drain off there's not going to be that much liquid in yours because it's all right all cooked in okay we're done with the pot and then comes this is the fun part okay this is where we really make a mess paper towels paper towels okay lots of paper towels okay and we're just going to rinse these out no we're not going to ring them out okay we just let them sit and drain okay for a while and again you can go away come back half an hour later or an hour later back to the sugar okay and we'll just put a big pile of sugar okay out there okay we had a garlic okay we have about a minute left just dump them in there you go around roll them around and put them on something voila yeah put them right on there okay this is pretty easy this is where you can get the kids involved in this one yeah except for the cutting oh yeah no i meant just this part i cut my fingers enough that's right and there you go that's all there's that's all there is to it okay that so it does take a long time but it's very easy and then you just let this sit and dry just let it sit and dry a little bit okay and some sugar will come off somewhere some sugar will come off i see you've packaged it two different ways now i have to ask you can you can somebody get a shot of of the of the lid of this of this jar or look at see let look at these two see and it's coupled but this one it looks like it is uh like a hologram where did you find those uh discount paper that we bought in january a couple oh it's just paper oh it's just paper okay over the top of the lid okay sure let's just take you just take the oh the lids in there and then you put that in there it's a great idea place it out on some gift wrap and you don't even have to be very accurate because it's going to be up in there stuff it up in there that's great and there you go okay candied citrus peel one of the great things that you can enjoy in the cookbook so call

to start our lemonade fermentation so we have a large jar we've got some salt - Malay and salt and we've got our stacker lemonade's fresh off the tree so what we've done it at the time or at the moment is with I have cut this down the center almost to the end and spun it around and cut it in opposite direction so that it keeps the lemonade intact and then I'm able to fill the crevices with the salt stage one smooth amazing so now stage two is to fill the crevices with the sauce and once you've done that just pretty much like a jigsaw puzzle squish it in because you need to fit as many of the lemonade's into that jar so we've just salted the final lemonade and I've done into you so if classics have salt that I've got to work out a way to cram this last lemonade into this jar without splitting it so let's see how we go in you get maybe in you get squishy area well that's actually 19 limonade butter in this jar now it's going to add some extra salts if we haven't added enough but it's necessary and now the last process is so arriving question here the salt that's in the in the runoff I used to - other lemons to have a bit of contrast to the lemonade and we're just going to pour this over the top get the cat file having to turn that over every day for at least a month", "2q2kMWBi21Q": "you sick like me oh you're doing you think the thumbnail and you want to put your chef coat on okay Mia what are we doing today and it's gonna be amazing we've got our beautiful assistants mom and Lexi over here prepping Lexi we played with us prepping a pancake batter I'm going to set

lets you just shout it we have my little lemon that I also ate oops my bad nope this is the remnants of my lemon here the remnants of Anson's lemon how crazy okay okay and we're improvising can anyone even see what's all I see now the Orient taste I can't even see comments swiping I've just pulled up your settings just figured out how to give comments filming it from there anyway it's us hello it's us okay that works bring out what we're gonna fix it okay this is our contraption here if nobody moves a muscle we should be okay open the camera okay you guys let's try this again let's even go get another two very much struggling I'm trying to hey working with lemons right you guys nightmare you lucky you choose one of you make me a drop [Music] yes number four thirty seconds yeah here we go Oh wonder what it is 12 of them 45 seconds it's it's probably squeezing them too aggressively a heart a mitten [Music] [Music] close up on the pancake art here supposed to be from this angle is the unicorn I would not never have guessed that was a unicorn oh my gosh what's happening okay we're gonna do a competition Mia you have to draw a portrait of Manson Antony have to draw a portrait of Mia are they for me and you got some pretty distinct things that you can draw but we'll make it look like Anson yeah and then and then we judge who's is better at the end some of you can go first [Music] okay the bigger you make it the fewer pick guys I'm sorry I think that pause for a really long time the competition is me as drawing Anson and Anson's drawing Mia and then we're seeing whose is better it over you're gonna want to let that cook before you flip it okay [Music] [Music] guys why should they draw on on pictionary Anthony speak Mandarin or Cantonese say something okay let's see this is say I know Tom's fake Chong all right an ting [Music] this live videos so much potential I know we're gonna have to do a remake of it clerk you okay [Music] but what about you Lex if you yeah what have you been doing with your summer so far I hate loopy with all my soul our whole family is again soon and we really like good Matteo is a character who never talks but I think he'd be really sweet if he's excited the whole time I'm really curious I said what about you for the wicked what are you doing why are you so exhausted tell us why you're out of it okay I have a challenge Mia wait didn't you draw the last one Oh Mia isn't me is still trying to flip this I think it's gonna be a disaster it was a giant yellow circle with Dave your phone oh my gosh this is the end result of your phone yeah right I'm trying to text you your next thing that you're going to now I'm gonna preface this by saying you don't have the right color for it but I'm gonna go make some more yellow batter oh you know what I should have done is greaseless [Music] okay [Music] [Music] [Music] studio their balls opinion they had you know [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay Wow okay answers do it oh oh oh don't [Music] Anson's drawing something that was requested by no it smelled before who's already burning other stuff oh my gosh I did 60 seconds [Music] you have your phone you should start guessing while he's drawing what are you doing oh yeah Lexi's the guesser oh is that one well I'm telling you what you have to draw next writing words is cheating I think that Greece did not actually help it's making everything turn the heat down turn the heat down what's it ah that's okay what if the red things found that means it's heated up to that happy if mi thank you [Music] [Music] it doesn't matter we're not keeping score at this point so let's check this out folks okay that was a better flip than some we've had so far no no poor Lin are we okay for now [Music] texting me oh no don't break your hand oh that's what I was about to Wow oh my god what were you supposed to drop done okay guess what you think he was supposed to draw locally so that people can see it and you hold it up to the camera try and talk louder they're saying recipes pancake one Hamilton what are you talking to this one was gonna be your ad jealous koloko okay I don't have ten minutes guys we're gonna go a little bit longer do you have somewhere you have to be you're on live in okay Mia's doing hers okay we're gonna go tell poor forty because our poor viewers oh wait oh yeah yeah you have yes fifteen seconds sorry five seconds okay people are guessing it and they're getting it right what did you guess Anton okay you guys I finally got the stuff loaded on what did you do Anton [Music] you've got to be kidding me you guys how much is left in there [Music] I have no regret that not that okay hold your brew licked this so put it on there and use it but like that just let that here they'd be gentle with the yellow bottle not me this okay Hansen I'm sending you your next task Hansen yours has been delivered Mia I'm sending you your next one but you're gonna do after answer I'm ready for mine bumbum bumbum Cameron wait probably need to get Anson gets one minute oh we know that's lazy I just oh yeah I wish this was me how long does he answer everything one minute she's gonna do some words words are cheating we use and that means amazing no that's I'm sending you to so do the first one first what are you doing over there okay Mia has her next one ready to go but we want to show them this crayon in good view okay I'm proud of that Anson Hey here is Anthony's I ran round anyway at first was kinda weird I'd say cram but I understand crayon I think that's technically right I just say it [Music] your time I take you didn't know sorry well I decided to make it into a mouse but it would have been a great Mouse oh here is the genies lamp but then together with mouse yep this is Albert do know just do the first one and then answer his whoo Anson wait you're not honey hi guys what do you think gas is drawing yeah she absolutely well don't put it on the ground I think we should let Anson finish that one even the time runs out because oh good people are guessing a brick wall a shelf a castle a wall chicken Mongolian sweet do the tofu don't throw food don't the fufu [Music] [Music] bricen bogus or bages understood our VeggieTales reference so he's a cool dude kidding please okay show us the man please okay show us your honor your creation mom says time's up one just for the light did she just text you yeah we're going to the 440 which is a kiss Oh hey listeners can you hear my voice behind the camera no I assume you can so I'm here to tell you that on June 11th we are launching our crowdfunding campaign for season two of our house and we're going to be doing a really long live that day like maybe six hours what you don't be there for the whole thing it's gonna be so fun we're gonna like play games and party and people who'll crowd fun and they'll get their name on the wall yeah Bobby food and this way there are people who live in Europe and stuff can come to the beginning before super late at night so June 11 mark your calendars Antony stop texting me you see Anson leaning over his phone he's sending me text messages and even if you can't contribute to the season spark you can follow the campaign you can share with your friends and that really helps us too so go to the link but my nose it is in the comment go cambree you have to be done talking now I see you're not a good bottle you're the fiftieth dream o jz TV filmed jazz TV films you were the 50th that's awesome 50th followers don't leave it too hard don't speed the too hard okay do you need to unplug the tips we're done we probably did like yellows it Anson has one more to draw and yeah it has one more to draw these are the last ones Kay which one you can put on a clean plate instead of the one is somebody said is that eggs the yellow sweater like and then here's the [Music] [Music] okay Anson they weren't busy this is Anthony's last last pancake pictionary y'all hope it's good okay don't explode the yellow yeah guess this as it goes there's a safety pin if you need to unclog the tip somebody gets to rainbow for Mia good job I don't know I guess I guess we just did a rainbow I was like why are you I don't know where that came from someone's getting a burger a banana [Laughter] every someone sent me mine since I did it I thought oh oh I'm sorry I have you know the Latins and ring oh yeah that's a good one huh any colors like wine that was a request from um look I'll tell you that some of our requests came from sorry we didn't get to all of them because we have so many technical difficulties but we will do this activity again so the taco Anson's requested from carly roux carly carly requested the taco a couple people requested the cat Leslie Weinberg never too old for dolls Rebecca thank you oh my gosh that's amazing Hanson never told four dollars requested the castle a lot of people requested our logo which we did in the very beginning a lot of people requested Hamilton all that jazz why is it sticking Mia I just texted you he said oh that's cool Amy I think gets Anton sweeping back there she's a lot being any sleep [Laughter] we got a camera like okay me I can start drawing everything anthing involves all together so we can sign off after this ready go ready set go ready set go oh hey selfies on here hey hey it's me your best cut so I guessed a certain thing I'm not going to tell you because it's correct yes dancing ants need to take a little nap let's see we've actually I've been staying up pretty late but the other tuba ticking and that my they say we're succeeding in life so where are six does anyone know what that is at this point no it's not a snail everyone I think you just turn it all the way down or unplug it okay guys who tell us in the comments who do you think is a better pancake artist answer me two instances and one of them was your fault you can say on one of my creations Anton blew up the yellow and that's the extent of it okay thanks for thanks for putting up with our with our terrible wives video today [Music] join us on Tuesday for a super awesome party all day long gonna be really fun whoa and we will try to make sure the internet is better [Music]", "I7aHHbhSB58": "executive guard so it's in January in Houston in 2015 and it is the it's the middle of the winter but we actually have 70 degrees out here today but I'm gonna do a quick experiment today so you've heard me and you've seen my previous episodes about growing your own lemons growing your own fruit in your backyard so I'm standing next to one of my dwarf lemon trees Meyer lemon trees this one's planted in the ground I'm gonna do a quick test today I'm gonna do the test I'm going to show you a comparison between a let me pick this off here a the fresh lemon this was just taken off the vine compared to a lemon that was store-bought so my daughter and I went to the store today we bought one lemon which I'm sure is two three four or five days old compared to a lemon that I just snipped off the tree and we're gonna be making lemonade today but what I'm gonna show you is the difference in the juiciness and the amount of liquid in each lemon so again this is the one that I just picked off the tree and we'll go inside and show you the one that store-bought and show you the difference between the two and encourage you to grow your own lemons oranges limes whatever in your own backyard stay tuned so here we are here's the ultimate lemon test so again they're about the same size this is store-bought you can actually see the UPC code on the lemon and this is the one I just got off the tree I mean you can actually see a difference look at the difference in the color between the two this one and you just feel doesn't feel like it's full of liquid as much again if you buy fruit from the store it's probably been up to a week old or perhaps picked before it was like so these are the two but let me just show you what I'm gonna do here so I'm gonna cut these open you can tell by machine you know how shiny it is how much liquid is in each so what we're gonna do is we're going to use this juicer and we're going to juice each diamond into this one on each and we'll show you which one provides the most juice so let me just cut these lemons open to start with and I'll show you what it looks like so that's the one we just picked by even close alright so look at the difference in these two okay so this is the one that was growing on the tree look how much you can just see I'm squeezing a little bit the juice just coming up and it's very shiny and look at the difference between you know the the peel on the outside the lemon the lemon occupies most the actual fruit occupies most of it look at the store-bought one store-bought one not you can see I'm squeezing not as shiny is this one not as healthy looking and look how much of the skin of the lemon of the peel is it compared to two completely different between the two so what we're going to do is juice most of these both of these let's show you the difference so if you're making lemonade if you're using it for your tea or if you're putting it in your iced tea whatever the case for water you want to go with their own more importantly on your own you know that you didn't use any pesticides on it and you your kids that drink it or people you serve it to don't have any chemicals in it so I don't know about the store-bought quite frankly so I'll stay tuned we'll show you after we juice these we don't have to videotape with juicing it but the comparison between the two so we'll come right back so back we just used the lemon so you can see they're all gone reduced under the comparison test so so if you take a look down here at the two so this is the lemon from the backyard over here and this is a lemon from the store so this is the lemon here I'm showing you now that came from the store about the same size lemon notice the color and this is from either same size Bowl from the one from the backyard it's almost I'd say two and a half times more liquid almost three times the liquid for the one in the backyard here versus the one in the store so the other thing did you take a look at two is look at the difference in color so my daughter bought this to my attention he's filming this is the one from the backyard look how rich it is with the nice kind of almost like a yellowish orange hue to it let me stir this up a little bit looks a lot more healthier and then this is the one from the store over here and it's just like a bland yellow not a rich gold yellow but a bland yellow is the store-bought one so lesson two so so I guess what I'm saying here is if you're if you're going to be nourishing your body and growing fruit and taking care of your children it's not hard to grow a dwarf lemon tree or a dwarf lime tree put this stuff in your kids and your body it'll you know this I mean unbelievably rich as you know invited men specially vitamin C and other key nutrients and the store-bought so the moral to the story here is that this is not putting anything down the grocery store is because grocery stores are meant to feed the masses not really take care of people their health so it's not hard to do by yourself with dwarf fruit tree could be a orange nectarine lime but you can see the amount of liquid so you can imagine most people don't bite into oranges they don't we don't bite into lemons they bite into oranges but if you're biting into a piece fruit wouldn't you rather this be the juice of the fruit versus this and the reason it's like this back to my point about the grocery stores is they pick the lemons before they're done they're ripe so you know you saw the difference between the outside peel versus the fruit so this is an experiment on growing lemons and what lemons can do for your body how much they can there issue and how much more you get out of fresh fruit versus store-bought food so I hope you enjoyed that quick executive gardener episode we're gonna start ramping up here in a few months as spring comes around start planting some new things but I hope you enjoyed this episode like I said you liked it please forward it to a friend we're subscribed to my channel at the executive gardener thanks for listening have a great week", "Av17eM1Ruyo": "hello my name's Andrew Nelson I've got a small business called Nelson harvesting we build and operate machines for the harvesting of tree crops specifically olives and citrus crops I am from a a nut growing background I spent 20 years growing walnuts and almonds so I feel comfortable working in orchards it's just been doing it since I was a 19 year old spent a year in California I'm in latent in New South Wales standing in an orchard of young trees that were planted in 2006 they were had a dwarf virus inserted into them in 2008 a variety is Hamelin tree spacings are five metres between the rows and 2 metres between the trees it's a combination that works very well for machine harvesting on my left-hand side you can see trees that haven't been harvested and on the right hand side trees that were harvested yesterday we'd like the tree skirt at up 600 millimeters from the ground both for big limbs and the low-hanging fruit carrying wood just so it's it produces the best result trees up to perhaps two and a half metres height work well for us beyond that the crop loads are so heavy that everything tends to bog down what you're looking at coming towards you is the harvester it's pulled with a tractor a bit the same as a PTO driven grape harvester we just think tractor manufacturers can do all really hard stuff which leaves us to do the picking mechanism and the cleaning and delivery systems yeah I think it works well for a small business like us to not get involved in the technical side of transmissions and things like that the house travels down the road in a straight line but once it is in an orchard Harvester sloughs off to the right hand side as you'd expect with a grape Harvester in some ways there's a lot of similarities with the grape harvest er there there's a picking mechanism based on fiberglass rods which in our case is far more sophisticated than a grape harvest er the rest of it is a big version of a grape harvest so there's flaws that travel bring the fruit to the back of the harvester what we call the mini conveyors transferring fruit out to the sides and then bucket conveyors across the top of the harvester there's the cross conveyor there are cleaning fans that we've built slightly bigger than grape harvester ones the whole machine is driven with the oil supply from the tractor which in fence case can be very accurately controlled and also a bank of pumps driven off the PTO there are seven hydraulic pumps six or eight cylinders and six or eight hydraulic motors in the system I'm uncomfortable with computers and PLC's in in agricultural machinery so it's it's a very simple machine now gear pumps solenoids roller motors few gear motors every efforts being made to keep it easily maintained by agricultural staff I'm the primary designer engineer and depending on workload I'm also the the boiler maker the spray painter the hydraulic fitter I've been assisted by some very clever blokes over the years but primarily it's it's my work that's got it to the point that we're at these trees we're looking at now have been harvested for the fourth time mechanically right from day one when there was only half a dozen oranges on the tree they've been picked it works well our aims to cut hand labor out and cut the production costs for growers whether they're Australian growers or someone overseas that's you know labor costs are always a problem and labor availability is often a problem depending on the success of the grower in skirting his trees we can get upwards of 95 probably of 98 percent of the fruit off if the trees haven't been adequately skirted you know it can drop significantly we were running at two and a half or three times an hour and olives which wasn't enough for the citrus we're now good for between six and six and a half tons an hour of oranges you can see this in the footage running at the moment yeah I've I'm not old or dead yet I think we're probably good for ten times an hour with some more refinement it's an expensive business even a small business operating on a shoestring I still spend several hundred thousand dollars here developing this machine and yeah we've got to find the money somewhere else we've received some help from a body called horticulture Australia Limited they provided us with us two small grants which was helpful and gratefully received beyond that we've financed it ourselves the Australian industry developed around Layton and to a large degree is still centered around Layton in the mi eye area of Western New South Wales it's one great location to grow citrus trees further north 400 kilometers north the cotton industry is a big successful industry very custom to using machinery for everything there are five or six large cotton farmers up there who have planted substantial plantings of those things and the industry is now really going to have two centres there'll be this Layton Center and further north called the Mori Center those guys have got no intention of using hand labor there's all sorts of reasons why everyone knows them you know it's difficult to get the labor it it's reluctant to work in wet weather and no one blames them this machine has requirements it's best suited to plantings that were intended to be mechanically harvested right from the start the Australian industry the more progressive growers are now growing a combination of five varieties Hamlin salustiano Parsons brown pineapple and a variety called McMahon which is an Australian selection soon to be available and it's passed its preliminary tests is a Chinese variety called Bing ching-teng so there'll be six varieties which cover a four and a half month harvesting window we've done trials successfully on common Valencia's which would generally be considered unsuitable for machine harvesting because second crop is on the tree but we've just proven with surveys done by the Department of Agriculture that if we harvest in late November up to mid December a three week window we can successfully remove the fruit without interfering with the small fruit we like it to be about the size of a marble a large marble otherwise we will knock it off in the grower shuffles the penalty in his yields next year the growers of these new varieties are expecting yields of 55 tonnes a hectare we haven't worked in yields Clarke quite that high yet because the trees are still young but we have worked in 40 tonnes a hectare quite successfully it so it's a lot of yield per hectare you know getting the fruit off the harvester and into semi trailers is another exercise it's an easier exercise from a designing point of view but there's still machinery involved generally these orchards are planted on to weed spacings the Leighton growers tend to be on five meter row centers the cotton goes further north on seven meters depending where we're working we would use these trailers on the wide spacings for these close plantings behind us the five meter row centers will use these trailers here they're both side tipis they both work well we like 13 14 meters of headland at the end of the row we prefer long rows 600 meters long here which is perfect even longer be better ground that's not undulating obviously it's a large machine and it's it's quite mobile it's surprisingly mobile but it is still a large machine and we have trouble with boundary fences or too close or there's irrigation channels the cotton guys up north you know are well aware of all those things so they've allowed plenty of room and I think in time the leighton industry as old blocks are pushed out and new trees are planted I'm quite convinced this is the way of the future a machine picking on orchards designed for machine picking it might be 15 years time before the complete transformation of the Australian citrus industry takes place but I'm quite sure it'll go down this path it gives the option or gives growers the option of either mechanically harvesting and sending fruit to the juice industries which is what we're in the business of or picking the fruit by hand and sending it to the packing sheds you know some varieties are suitable for both things it's the dawn of a new year I think it's 40 years behind the grape industry but I think we can learn a lot of lessons from them and catch up quite quickly you you", "2Wog50-RWKs": "all right this is what all of y'all been waiting for the citrus toss august um the knife there's the knife and um everyone what about citrus oh here's the citrus oh

joanna's backyard let's go see what she's got to share with us joanna thank you so much for having me oh gorgeous what a beautiful backyard you've got going on here it's more of a courtyard isn't it we're working with a small amount of space how many years have you been here i've been here 12 years and did the trees go straight in no i spent one whole year with just mud and nothing here so i could see what happened with the sun and the rain and decide where i wanted to put things [Applause] what have we got going on here so because i don't have a lot of room i decided to espalier a lemon because every house has to have a little okay espalier talk me through espalier so espalier is when you flatten a tree like a bush i had big wires installed on the masonry yep so that there's a place for the lemons the lemon branches to go out and over the years i've trained them a little bit but as you can see i've not been really formal about it there's some very formal ways of doing it i've just kind of let it go [Applause] i'm not a big cook i like to eat but i'm not a big cook so i needed something simple to do with the lemons that would keep them so because i had a big harvest so i found a recipe for preserving which is often used in north african cooking moroccan cooking and you end up using the skin rather than the flesh but it's really just water salt and lemons in a you know squish them in and then you've got preserved lemons have you got some we can taste [Music] you", "NpiXg2OCssw": "hello and welcome to eating with ashley i'm ashley and this is future fruit friday i

[Music] [Music]", "rYPZ-5AQ_Gs": "so today I'm gonna teach you how to make this lemon slice crochet cotton circle and I use this as a hot pad I use it to clean up water suppose in my kitchen or to place spoons on while I'm cooking they're really handy and really cute and they're made of cotton and not acrylic or wool so they don't burn and I think they're really pretty decoration for a counter okay so this is what you'll need a pair of scissors a size G crochet hook and a tapestry needle and tapestry needles are for crochet they're not sharp and you'll also need some yarn this Oh I'm using is cotton yarn it is worsted weight size for cotton yarn I'm using white and I'm using yellow but you could use white and green for a lemon or a lime slice or white and orange for an orange slice or rainbow or whatever you'd like that's what I'm using today this is basically a basic circle with slip stitch as the liens so we started a circle by making a magic cell and if you don't know how to make that I'm gonna go through it real quick here but I also have a video teaching how in the description box below so that will be linked down below if you want a more in-depth way to make a magic circle so basically what you do is you place your yarn over your fingers and then wrap it around and throw it back so it's loose put your hook under the first grab a second and then turn your hook to make a loop and then pull the whole of your fingers and that's your Magic Circle we're going to be doing chain two and then working eleven double crochet into our ring we'll do our first chain stitches to start it you need to do two so wrap your yarn around the hook pull it through your loop wrap it around pull it through again you're to chain stitches now we'll do 11 double crochet into the loop you'll need to do them inside the loop and you'll wrap your yarn around your hook put it into the loop grab your yarn again pull it back through grab your yarn with your hook pull it through the first two loops on your hook grab it again pull through the last two loops and that's your double crochet now the first two chain stitches count as a double crochet line so you'll do 11 double crochet and the two chain stitches count as one so you'll have twelve lines in your circle okay so let's see if we have twelve here that's one line right here two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven and then the last two are our chain stitches and that's twelve so we're done with this circle okay so what you're going to do is cut your main source of yarn off because we're going to finish this piece and change colors so cut your yarn and then we need to finish it so we're gonna do a slipknot put your yarn on your hook and just basically grab the yarn pull it through and pull it all the way through and then pull that tight so that makes a strong knot grab your other piece of yarn and pull it so that you tighten your circle the hole in the middle and then we're just gonna sew these two ends together once you have the two circle and sewn together all I need to do is not it and sew in the tails once you have the tails sewn in you have this nice clean circle we're going to start a new row off of this circle okay get your yellow yarn out cuz we're switching colors so we're gonna make a slipknot put your small end over the big end grab the loop fold it over grab the yarn through it grab end pull and that's your Slipknot put it on your hook pull the long end do this your end pull the long end and it'll tighten it under your hook now we can attach this to our circle we're going to do two double crochet in each stitch all the way around this way you're starting a piece is called a standing stitch where we go in the hole grab the yarn and pull it through creating a slipknot and then we're going to chain three to create the illusion of the first double crochet and then we're going to do two double crochet all the way around making a total of 24 stitches [Music] [Music] okay let's count and make sure we have all 24 that we need 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 now that we have our 24 stitches we're going to join these in the top of the first double crochet put your yarn through the loops grab the yarn pull it through and pull it through the loop on your hook but don't make it too tight or you'll have difficulty like I did okay now we're going to chain 3 1 2 3 and then do an increase we do 2 double crochet in the same stitch so you wrap the yarn around your hook put it through the loop grab it pull through grab it pull through two grab it pull two last you then want to grab it put through the same hole do another double crochet and we're gonna do two one two one two one alternating so increase with two in one stitch and then the next one's gonna be just one double crochet and then the next stitch do two all the way around giving you a total of 36 double crochet when you finish now that you have 36 we're gonna join in the top of the first double crochet just like we did last put it through both loops and do a slipknot grab the yarn pull it through and pull it through the loop on your hook now we're going to again we're going to chain three and we're gonna do two double crochet in each stitch and been an increase so we're just adding one to our routine do one double crochet one double crochet and then two double crochet in the next stitch all the way around for a total of 48 double crochet this is your last yellow round we're going to chain three and work two double crochet into the next two stitches and then two double crochet into the next stitch so it's three double crochet and then an increase of two one two three and then two and the same one two three and then two in the same until all where you go you go all the way around and you'll have a total of sixty double crochet [Music] now that we have our four rows of yellow we're going to join these in the beginning with a slipknot just like we've been doing but then we're going to cut the yarn and finish off the yellow because the next row we're doing is white so all we do need to do is a slipknot have to pretty cut the yarn we'll just pull the yarn through and that join we did is a slipknot now we just need to sew in this yellow tail and then we'll start the next round and through the magic of editing our tails are all sewn in now we're going to join in the beginning with our white so just make a slipknot for your hook pull it tight and then to join we're just going to join with the slipknot put it through the first loop in the row grab the yarn pull it through pull through the loop on your hook and then we're going to start a row just like we did our yellow we're going to chain three and then we're going to do four double crochet in each stitch and then an increase of two so 1 1 1 1 and then 2 and the next all the way around until you have a total of 72 double crochet now that we have our 74 we're going to join put it in the first loop make a slipknot grab the arm pluck through pull through the loop on your hook and then we're going to finish this row off and switch back to yellow so do the same thing cut it and so in these tails and then we'll switch so now all the tails are sewn in and we're switching back to yellow so do the same thing we did before with the white put a slip knot on your hook and then attach it to the piece at the beginning with a slipknot just put it through the hole grab the yarn pull it through and pull it through the loop on your hook and pull it tight and then we're going to chain three and we're going to add another to our rotation so to do five double crochet in each stitch and then an increase all the way around until you have a total of 84 yellow stitches the double crochet all the way around and then we'll move is finished I'm so excited if it's such a cute piece now that we have all 84 we're going to join the same way we've been doing into the stitch grab the yarn pull it through pull it through the loop on your loop and then this is our last row so we're cutting it and we'll be done you just cut the yarn pull out the loop pull it tight and then so envious tail and we'll do these books okay we're gonna do to some surface slip stitches which I usually do to right under crochet but it's gonna go from the white to the white from the outside to the middle and it's just gonna be spokes and they're going to be just slip knots the way we've been doing this kind of tricky all you do is start from the outside to the inside and keep one hand behind the work but I'll show you so put your piece through grab not a slipknot just the yarn is over it as you'll need to be picking that up through the work so pull it through and we'll secure that later and then keep the the main line behind it because they're just gonna be picking it up through the bottom so go down through pick up the yarn pull it back through into the front and pull it through the loop on your hook and then go back through let me get this better go back through the next part grab the yarn and pull it through the loop on your hook see what I'm doing stab it through grab the yarn pull the yarn back through and pull it through the loop on your hook it is kind of tricky and you just want to go in a straight line there's no clear holes see the line forming here we're just headed towards the middle grab the yarn pull it through pull it through the loop on your hook and then go forward see my little line for me we're going to keep doing that until we get to the middle so grab the yarn pull it through pull through the loop put it through the piece or almost there we only have about two more to go go through the piece you don't want to make them too few to the middle because then it'll pull the piece together do as many as you can between the outer rind and the center okay one more let's go into the white grab the yarn through the piece pull it through pull it through the loop on our hook like this and then that's our last and we have our line going all the way from the outside to the middle we're gonna do six books so they'll do one straight across but you won't want to do one straight across there to make a cross because then you won't be able to have six you'll have to do eight number one two three four five six oh yeah if you want eight spokes and do a cross and then add a line in between each but we're just gonna do six so you do one straight across and then you'll want to count and do them one space apart see these holes here this two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve holes and so you just space them too apart and make your spokes to finish this one we need to do a slip knot make sure this loop is still here you can barely see him but cut your yarn in the back like so and then turn it over and just pull your loop out because all we were doing is making slip stitches so it's just a knot and then I just finished mating making my six and then tied it our sewed in all these tails afterwards and here is the finished lemon slice and you could do whatever you wanted any kind of slices you could do a grapefruit slice the orange slice or blood orange slice or you could make each row a different color and do a rainbow you know whatever you come up with I'd love to see if you do attempt this pattern please post a picture on Instagram or Twitter so I can see it my links are in the description box below thank you so much for watching if you like this video make sure and hit like and if you want to see more make sure and hit", "sAfByOIvLfk": "welcome to my channel today's topic is removing these seeds from a lemon very easily and without a lot of hassle the lemon is a beautiful little lemon and the seeds are all inside so we got to trim off an end and get to the seeds and I like to trim off either end it doesn't really matter to me but I like to crush the lemon first and break it up on the inside so that way the seeds will come out easier this doesn't always work but I like to think of the connective tissue as being a lot less soft than the pulp and the pulp breaking up into the juice and the seeds just sliding past the pulp and coming right out into this jar and that's not difficult either way it's just the way I prefer to do it you don't have to do it that way you can do it any way you want but all I'm doing is I'm getting the juice to get out and into that jar to that glass or Cup or whatever and I'm just gonna capture whatever seats come out whatever doesn't go into the sieve I'll go into a manually by hand there goes one there's two that's one doesn't look to have a lot of seed in it there's three you know I broke up the the inside all right but I didn't break it up the way I wanted to know normally this isn't some messy happens it's okay I'm just gonna look inside there and you can see not a lot of seed action not a lot of seeds in this one so we've got one two three seeds I'd have a whole lemon it's interesting has gained like twenty four others come on seed that looked like a pretty ripe lemon to me but there you go three seeds that's it and only two of them are really viable but uh lemons keeping the lemons away from the juice have a great day", "t8b_9aaFx4A": "hello you two welcome back to our kitchen today we're going to be actually doing a detox water so stay tuned okay we are back and we want to start with some orange slices cucumber slices lemon slices and lime slices so first thing I do honey can you honey baby pour the water we also have four bottles of

that but we're going to do with this detox water it's just a substituted for regular drinks and just kind of drink on it all day and so that's what we're doing here so I've added the cucumber's I've added two oranges and for my understanding you want to make sure that it is - well packed in there so now I'm adding the lemons and finally I'm going to add the lines okay got it stuff down pretty

contribute to strong clear skin and can help lower a person's risk of many conditions oranges are popular due to their natural sweetness the many different types available and the diversity of uses for example a person can consume them in juices and marmalades eat them whole or use zested peel to add a tangy flavor to cakes and desserts this popular citrus fruit is particularly known for its vitamin c content however oranges contain a range of other plant compounds and antioxidants that may reduce inflammation and work against disease benefits cancer as an excellent source of the antioxidant vitamin c oranges may help combat the formation of free radicals that cause cancer although inadequate vitamin c intake is necessary and very beneficial the amount a person would need for the desired therapeutic effect on cancer is more than they could realistically consume for example one study concluded that medical scientists could harness the power of vitamin c from oranges to inhibit colorectal cancer cells in the future however the authors concede that 300 oranges worth of vitamin c would be necessary that said in 2015 a study linked grapefruit and orange juice with a higher risk of skin cancer researchers found that people who consumed high amounts of whole grapefruit or orange juice were over a third more likely to develop melanoma than those who consumed low amounts this may have been due to citrus compounds that exert photocarcinogen properties blood pressure oranges contain no sodium which helps keep a person below their daily limit on the other hand a cup of orange juice can boost daily potassium intake by 14 maintaining a low sodium intake is essential to lowering blood pressure however increasing potassium intake may be just as important for reducing a person's risk of high blood pressure as it can help support the relaxation and opening of blood vessels according to the office of dietary supplements odds increasing potassium intake can reduce the risk of high blood pressure and stroke heart health oranges are a good source of fiber and potassium both of which can support heart health according to one 2017 review of previous meta-analyses consuming enough fiber can significantly reduce the risk of heart disease both developing and being fatal one cup of orange juice can provide 14 of a person's daily potassium requirement the odds found that people with higher potassium intakes may have a lower risk of stroke and other cardiovascular diseases they mainly attribute this to the effects of potassium on blood pressure diabetes a medium orange weighing 131 grams g contributes 3.14 grams of fiber which is nearly 10 of an adult's daily fiber requirement several studies have found that fiber can improve some factors that contribute to diabetes development and progression for example one 2019 study found that consuming four grams of a dietary fiber supplement per day did not reduce blood glucose but improved how the body responds to insulin low insulin sensitivity can contribute to type 2 diabetes weight control is also important for reducing the risk of diabetes as obesity and overweight can contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes the body processes fiber more slowly than other nutrients so it can help a person feel fuller for longer and reduce their urge to eat snacks throughout the day following a diet that contains a high proportion of fruits and vegetables can support blood sugar control and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and disease progression that said a diabetes friendly diet should include healthful foods from a variety of food groups skin consuming enough vitamin c can help a person maintain skin health and appearance vitamin c contributes to collagen production

it if you have seen it there's a line they forgot to put in i think it's it slipped right through my fingers and it's when it's right after milan kicks an arrow it's pretty good um just just say that line when that happens uh we probably won't do more mulan because it is um well just because we can't cast it properly um because we need need to cast it correctly um and we we there's just not a lot of uh asians and that in that culture here in utah um so sadly uh no um probably not anymore mulan i really wanted to do um make a man out of you i think it's such a good song um yeah it's really good but is he in here as a kid uh so my stepsister taylor has a kid and cameron has a kid um what's my favorite movie my go-to is scout pilgrim vs the world or um inversion new groove i think those are like my top quoted movies um yeah oh we have into the woods on our our patreon voting list a couple of songs from that so we'll see we'll see what happens um yeah how's uh how's everyone been doing with with coveting with school i'm curious how how the world is for everybody else and also so what music are you currently listening to and what movies and tv shows are you're watching regularly and what video games are you playing i like to know what's trending excuse me and uh i like to see what you know what's trending and what i need to look into like country music a lot that's cool only music you listen to is hamilton i admit there was a time in my life where that was me uh playing overwatch overwatch is great hamilton full house and most definitely minecraft my brother uh nathan plays minecraft i just finished umbrella academy i enjoyed it hadestown speechless i don't think we did speechless gala yeah i don't think we did speechless um uh let's see and i'll play video games cool cool cool it's the question is uh what do you play what do you watch what do you listen to [Music] good the percy jackson musical is that a thing i think that it is we did do an aladdin song yes um yeah how is everyone robbie uh so good so good i think yeah i think everyone's doing really great my dad just got the uh tony hawk skateboarding game which you bloody probably don't know that was like a game that was made like 15 years ago and he loved it and so they remastered it and we started playing it and he kicked my butt at that game i cannot win at any of it um it's pretty fun though actually uh legally blonde to play roblox i have not played that who came up with the idea of doing these videos videos in the first place me and mom we just had an idea i was like oh we should film frozen because mia looks just like frozen chick lady girl anna that's the one so yeah the name working with lemons comes from it's like one last gives you lemons you just try to make movies it was something i came up with in high school just like filming with whatever we had to make something cool that's what we did um we have done some songs from tangled but did i see the light one of my life begin enchanted ooh that's an idea uh we don't do homeschool currently so one last time depending on whether the power gets back it might get released this friday or the next but it is coming very soon and it is very good i'm very pleased with how it turned out um so it's going to be awesome which one's in for the first time yay hamilton [Music] um sometimes people call my mom mama lemon but i think she feels like yeah i think it just it happens sometimes um papa lemon father lemon what my grand planner lost have you seen i have seen hamilton in theater um and i think i really enjoyed it and i actually really liked the take on it it was different but i think um hamilton's story i feel like it just needs like you need to be up close that's why i like doing the movies of it because are the videos of it because it's just there's so much so much going on um how do you film during code safely so sometimes on stage or like sorry on set um the actors just have to have their masks off so that happens so that potentially they're getting exposed to but for the cast for the crew we all wear masks and uh filming outside lessens the the um risk of getting covered um so yeah um what is my favorite arthouse video i really enjoyed um the d d episodes i know they were kind of quirky and long but it was it was fun and also just really long as well um alana i'm not gonna dress up as olaf unless i have to do a video also because i have to shave a beard my beard so that's just like every time every time i shave it okay i cry a little bit on the inside um sorry i'm just laughing um so the first i watched guys i watched the first episode of our house and it's just you know we've made a lot of we've gotten better um at making videos and that's uh it's my editing has gotten better since the first episode um we're actually going to remaster them and put them on like amazon prime or something um porter's been out of the house for a long time um he's yeah he's been gone for a year or so [Music] and he's uh he's married yeah to alice and they're happily married it's great um i have probably a few more minutes was gwen actually my girlfriend no uh her name is amanda and uh yeah it was really it was it was fun she's great to act with uh we've never dated um and we're just good friends we don't have an interest but it was fun um let's see something happened to the computer oh i forgot about the mac warehouse episode guys that was some of my my best work uh that was the one i was most excited for um and i've gotten excited for other episodes as well but like i wanted that one to be really good um and it turned out really good we are gonna do more hamilton um we got one more video coming one last time either this friday or next friday and then after that um we'll be taking us probably a small break from hamilton uh but i imagine we'll do hamilton again when kovet is at a better spot i think anson's doing a show right now he's probably rehearsing or something like that excuse me how did you pick people to act in our house we cast our family and then we just used our friends we've met from acting from acting in theaters and other films um so uh yeah hey matthew saw my back and wait for it yeah that's right i was hamilton yeah um that was his back side i was trying to be corey the other hamilton so technically we've had three hamiltons anson corey and me as the back of half of cory so um my favorite hamilton video that's hard probably probably dear theodosia or you'll be back but one last time is is is right up there um i really like the helpless and satisfied gosh they're just all so good and wait for it uh the skylar sisters how does one pick what is what is your favorite hamilton video that we've done let me know that might help now probably won't i can't you can't you can't just you know pin it down like that now cory and camry are not actually married um karen's baby is great um let's see you discovered our channel through hamilton yes dear theodosia oh um helpless is your favorite yeah helpless is pretty good yeah do i outside do i act outside of working with lemons no not really i've auditioned for shows and i've done like i've done theater a couple times and i've done i was a scriptwriter no i was a scribe in a film um produced in utah i had one scene it was pretty fun but other than that no i just mainly stick to working with lemons what is your favorite blooper vid you've done minus frozen two trailer real life bloopers oh that's pretty yeah that's that was a good one um mine might be oh it's hard helpless had a funny moment where camry almost um stephen kerr she almost kissed her dad uh her stage dad um on the lips she's supposed to get a kiss from him on the forehead and then kiss uh corey on the lips she messed it up that was so pretty you guys have to see it if you haven't um yeah it was just really great so uh okay we just got a minute left uh until you got to sign off what was your hardest music video to film helpless and satisfied probably um just because it was so much um at once and and jumping back and forth between two songs because we filmed we would while we were filming like helpless we would just jump over to satisfied real quick because it's the same shot but she's singing a little bit differently so helpless and satisfied is probably the hardest um to film then again let it go was like really hard we failed for like five days and just didn't really know what we were doing and we finally pieced something together um yeah that's that's pretty sweet okay guys so quick quick update uh we have a hamilton video coming soon our quick recap um you can vote for uh the video that we should film next this month on patreon you can honestly just sign up for a dollar and then sign off or like unsubscribe after um for after this month um this guy's actually blue but it's it's too overexposed um and then uh yeah it's it's uh wait um mia is still getting her braces uh checked out so um mom rights are our house episodes most of them so okay guys thank you so much and i will see you all soon any advice or tips for future youtubers i don't know find your little niche find something that works for you um find when you can do the best or what you want to be the best at do something that you're passionate about and uh you'll at least have fun and then there's a good

is marcelina cashier grins that come this video is about growing mayor lemons and what can you do to make your name on blooms and produce more fruit [Music] you can grow lemons from seeds from cuttings or grafting the problem of growing lemons from seeds it take a while for the plant to produce fruit as you can see here in this video this is Eureka I grow this plant from seed and as you can see there is no blooms no fruit this is already 7 years and I've been doing a lot of spray foliar spray in this plant but I still did not get any blooms so that is the problem of growing lemons from seeds so the best thing that you can do is grow them is by grafting or by cutting all right guys the success in growing lemons is based upon you as the grower now there are some requirements for the mayor lemons to thrive and grow and produce more blooms and I'm going to share that with you on this video so let's get started there are some requirements for the mayor lemons to get more blooms and produce more fruit in this video I'm going to share with you the seven secrets number one light merely moon needs up to six hours of sunlight a day they won't flower if sunlight is lacking if you grow them in a container place the plant in areas where to get most of the Sun the south-facing areas tend to get more sunlight if you grow them indoor place your tree in a sunny window rotate the plump every two to three weeks so that the entire tree gets more sunshine number two watering make sure your Tris give the right amount of water over watering and harm the plant which also fake liquor production allow the soil slightly dry between watering but it should never be completely dry it's your finger check this the dryness of the soil two inches below the surface and if you think that it is dry then time to water them now when you water the plants make sure you don't work you gradually water them because if you water them so fast it stress out the planet [Music] number three new trends to keep your merely Montell thing filled in with imbalance of fertilizers the best fertilizer to use is the fertilizers specific for citrus give them a boost to a tablespoon a fertilizer three to four times once in early spring once in this early summer in the mid summer and once in the fall space out your spiritual eyes think about four to six weeks and hold off your fertilizer during winter because in the winter season plants is less active so you don't need to fertilize them number four temperature Lehmann is sensitive to cold so if you're living in area where you get the winter season I would recommend to bring your lemon indoor now the temperature in dirt is different that the temperature outside so if you the winter heat makes the plant suit dry so what you need is if you see the plants believe this dry and crispy just spray or mist the plant WETA we have a bottle spray with water or you can put a bowl of water on the base of the clump this would increase the humidity in the house number for pollination now merely moon is self pollinated so you don't need to pull in it them that is big great thing about this plant and you just leave it be take care of them and then they will thrive you just take her give them the care you want and then you produce a lot of blooms [Music] nearly moon blooms every year and if you have a greenhouse you view your lemon would continue of blooming number six pruning now pruning is best for the plant and by pruning it allows them to produce a healthy branch and also healthy lives and produce more fruits but only prone if there is a dead branches or slap litter on your lemon and if it is getting taller and crowded then that's the time to cut them down but other than that we just nip the clump grow by itself as you can see here I prone a little bit in here especially in the center because I want this area to have more space for air circulation because if it is crowded in the center it allows more disease for the person by having this Center open then it circulates the air number seven patients that is one of the most important a mutant I mean you're Bromley moon sometimes it is overwhelming if you if you see your limb own is up doing well and then just be patient and find some ways some problems get into the problems and take care of the limo you do some research and also by watching this video the stable secrets like if you just share it with you so you will be okay if you can't get your lemon to bloom life won't have more lemonade that's my clothing so if you liked this video guys get started so

a look at pizza", "sqvOZO_g7DA": "hello and thanks for watching planted once again i hope that you all are doing great today we are talking about pollination have you ever wondered what's inside of lar let's have a look at it androssium the male part of the flower produces pollen grains gynosium the female part of the flower which receives the pollen grains and the ovary turns into a fruit so what's exactly pollination the transfer of the pollen grains from the male part of the flower to the female part is called pollination now who's responsible for doing this insects and the birds and this is how a fruit grows but if you do not have any insects around your plant you can pollinate your plant too just keep on watching the video now i have this beautiful calmer deen orange plant which is in full bloom right now last year during spring season i had a similar blooming scenario going on but no oranges were produced on the plant this is because we live in cities and we do not have any insects around to pollinate the plant so this time i'm trying to self-pollinate the flowers let us zoom in into this flower these are the male and the female parts of the flower and here i have a brush i'll pick up the pollen grains from one flower and drop them on the other that's it so simple i did this activity with a brush now look at this bee doing the same activity with her legs she transferred the pollen grains from one flower to the other and if you look carefully the pollen grains are sticking on her legs what she gets the nectar let's check the flowers after a few days it has been five days since the pollination and you can see the tiny oranges growing on the plant feel free to subscribe to my channel share this video with your friends so that they can watch and grow more fruits thanks bye [Music] you", "mfiy4hCtBDw": "welcome to the simple life homesteading the pioneer way this is Brenda weatherly I am candying some lemon peel today I've shown you before the lemon water that I drink each morning I drink the juice of half a lemon with 8 ounces of water each morning to alkaline my body or to help alkaline my body there's a lot of fruits and things that you can eat also that alkalines your body and I don't like wasting anything so the rhymes that is left I save them till I get enough to make candy and what you do is you scrape out the pulp you slice the lemon and you can do this with grapefruit limes oranges anything you slice the lemon peel and the first thing you do you want to bring some water up to a boil and you put your lemon peel in it and you boil it for about 10 minutes and what that does is take the bitterness out of the zest of the citrus fruit and then in another pan you take or you can take it out and rinse the pan out so the bitterness is gone then you put a 1 cup of water and 1 cup of sugar in a pan and bring it up to a simmer and simmer it till it the sugar dissolves and then you put the peel back into that and you simmer that for about 10 minutes and that's what I have right here and then you take it out here's my water that I have the sugar water you take that out and you lay it out on something to dry and you want to dry about one hour and it will be tacky it will be kind of dry but it will be tacky and then you take it and roll it in sugar and you've got a wonderful candy and the infused simple syrup is what this is called or it's also cold or what do they call it in the stores I believe it's called fructose or sucrose one of the to it which is just a simple syrup or sugar water which is what simple self is and so I'm not even going to throw this away I'm going to flavor my iced tea with it or you can just make lemonade with it but really flavoring drinks is the best thing for that or you can cook with it put a spoon or two and dishes so it's a needful thing to not waste like I said I drink the juice I eat the peel and then I even use the sugar water that John makes the candy so until next time this is Brenda weatherly with a simple life home studying the pun your way saying keep homesteading", "QhPB0vwTMXU": "all right so dehydrating citrus and oranges specifically is really really easy all I did was I've got my cookie sheet there I've got a wire rack on there and I just sliced up to oranges real thin and I had them in the oven now for maybe four hours at 175 degrees Fahrenheit that's about 80 degrees Celsius I think and you basically just put them in there I'll take them out after work tonight so I'll probably leave them in there a total of 10 ish hours until they're nice and dry and once they're done you can use use them for anything you can eat them you can put them in tea you can cook with them I don't know you just use them whatever it preserves them it keeps them good put them in a jar and it'll stay good for a long time", "NnfIJ-PfYc0": "hey when he's John hair I'm giving a lemon Meyer treat update I moved it indoors once the weather turned cool about maybe three weeks ago tops and the lemons have continued to turn yellow as they've been indoors this is the size of the tree actually what you can see this is our fireplace mantel our front room here that's Havanna in the window but the lime trees up in the little pot up on top of the mantel but the lemons there's there's two and we leave the lights on during the day so they get some light but they have just slowly been turning more and more yellow they're still just a little bit of green on the bottom I know the light's not great and then this one actually is turning is turning more yellow and I think this it's actually in better shape too but it looks fabulous I'm just so excited so that is the lemon Meyer tree update from the Hughes dawn household", "-mNOdh3oQUM": "hello and welcome to my youtube channel my name is Melvin way I have many plant growing series on my youtube channel please check them out subscribe to my channel like and share my videos so the first thing I did was cut eleven in half obviously with a garden-variety knife and first thing I noticed was that seven seeds were damaged that's pretty typical when you get served a drink in a restaurant glass of water if they put a slice of lemon you'll notice all these chopped in half seeds it's amazing how despite all the groom in there that you figure the seeds would have to maneuver around being surrounded by a South Pole and you run a knife through them the seeds are easily cut in half without being fixed in place with anything hard but it's actually quite stable in there so that's what happens they get chopped in half so there are twenty-something seeds at least in this average lemon it's not even a very big lemon as you can see there I had at least 20 to 25 seeds so the first thing you want to do is grab a towel or paper towel use your fingers hold it in place obviously you're not going to use the vise or something for some tiny seed like this and there's a pointy end it's very easy second thing you do is scrape off that end in any direction and start peeling off the seed coat after you fixed it in place so these things despite being dried out to some degree by the towel or are slippery and the rest is just this slope relatively easy process of peeling off additional layers of seed coat and they come off in strips like that so you can have to do this without gloves too of course but these are very acidic fruits full of citric acid there are five to six percent citric acid so that's a fair bit of acid to be dealing with getting under your fingernails and whatnot if you're going to sit here and peel 20 something seeds which I initially thought I was going to do but I realized how much work it was so these seeds feel like hard kernels of corn that's their appearance as well I guess you could say they look like miniature acorns or whatever but I'd say they look like kernels of corn so it takes a lot of time to do just five and that's the amount I ended up going with I figured unless I'm doing some kind of fundamental damage to these you know because this is my first time maybe if I'm scraping off the tip too hard I'm damaging something and ripping off the root tips or whatever then these things can't even get started but it turns out not to be the case and the first time was good enough I peeled five of these rip them out of their seed coats and there was nothing that required delicacy you just need to spend time and hunker down and start peeling away until you're done and it takes a long time actually I mean I fast-forwarded through a lot of this footage and edited out all the bloopers such as dropping the seeds because they're slippery and then picking them up and whatnot and I didn't show everything here so oftentimes you'll peel and your wife and your peel and your wife and you'll notice they're extra strips of seed coat on like that I would say what you see here that last strip of seed coat that wasn't even necessary to remove seed coats often prevent water from getting in contact with the seed right away so if there's a jelly on a seed slimy coat or whatever you can just rub that away and you'll be good to go the seeds will start absorbing water and nutrients once their root systems become active and it'll be good to go so that's it in a nutshell I have four here but later on I did one more you can see the seeds that have been cut in half so easily by the knife right here which is a common sight in restaurant water cups and all these other seeds as well so that's basically it for the peeling seed coats part of the tutorial and after that I had this pot that was pretty much ready to go and sterilized by steaming this potting mix and used it to grow cantaloupes for 22 days he was very sure filler series so I decided to reuse this pot as is without a repeat sterilization after just three weeks to prevent spider mites and fungus gnats from taking a hold it was very clean seemingly and you can see all the grip stems of cantaloupe seedlings beads and the old seed coats so I planted these five seeds sideways and just sprinkled a tiny bit of dirt on them I didn't want to pack down too hard and I didn't want to have them go through too much dirt to sprout so just a few millimeters is enough one centimeter at the most I'm doing some light fertilization with miracle-gro for general purpose growth and I'm also fertilizing with a men's daily multivitamin this is a generic version of the kind I eat to save on cost since I'm doing this a lot these days so multivitamin has all these micronutrients trays metal elements and whatnot in there so that would provide for any change that the soil might be lacking in and the Miracle Grow provides for three of the main macro nutrients that plants typically need for fast growth nitrogen potassium phosphorous some doing some light watering very sparingly just so the nutrients that I've scattered on here will only go in a tiny bit and not be washed all the way to the middle at the bottom of the soil that would be pointless so the reason I'm doing this right now is because I want the roots that will become active after maybe just a day or two to start absorbing nutrients and getting much quicker start so I was a passion fruit flower please check out my growing passion fruits from the seed series and stay 11 and I noticed a typical bulge in the potting mix and upon some further investigation I saw that there was a sprout underneath and I actually wasn't sure that this was a lemon tree sprout as opposed to a cantaloupe seed that had just become active after I had removed everything else so I don't see a bulge anywhere else and the next day I noticed that there are two sprouts I moved this pot on day 11 over to be next to my mango pop because I wasn't sure it was getting optimal amount of sunlight it was on the left end of this table but in the end it seemed that the lemon tree series was progressing as fast as the mango tree series had just by much smaller seeds to 13 days for sprouts to come out of the ground I'll show you very soon so this is still day 12 watering sparingly only to wet the top layer of potting mix every 1 to 2 days because that's what dries out since I've water previously for the cantaloupe series I'm sure that everything in the bottom beneath was already wet so it's day 13 and I finally have two sprouts towards me towards the front of the pot when I'm standing in terms of orientation because the rim of the pot blocks some of the sunlight from hitting the potting mix at the far end so it's always these two especially in this corner the lower right that's what germinates first and sprouts because it receives the greatest amount of sunlight my balcony is west facing and it receives some of that Southwest on every day so I can remove some of the stuff and let the leaves have an easier time to unfurl but otherwise after I'm done showing you I'm going to put a chunk of potting mix to the south of it southwest of it to make sure that this seed that's exposed won't dry out because I'm sure the root system is not far away so it's kind of interesting you can see the seed has sort of a reddish color there I'm not sure where the root is here but you can see the and those permits turn green as well exposure to light after this unfurls and it starts growing I'm going to sprinkle on some dry potting mix to cover all that stuff up if anything's exposed do a little bit of micromanagement to fill the gaps and ensure everything gets good start so I'm doing spot fertilization again with Miracle Grow and I'm just watering enough to dissolve most of the crystals don't necessarily have to dissolve everything I could save that for next time on our water but I don't want to again wash nutrients too deep and deprive these seedlings of access to these nutrients that I'm giving them I hope you enjoyed watching this video tutorial on how to get started for growing lemon trees from
