rub this feedback", "DJ0bAdY61RE": "what's up everybody Derek here with the bass factory today we're gonna be talking about cents and putting these on your plastic lures and do they really work [Music] these two right here along I've got spike it and I've got some golf I used to use some young back in the day there's others there's actual sprays like bang which is just like a garlic there's all kinds of them but one of my favorites is this spike it right here I used to change this on some of my lures just to show that I could put this on the back and if I was in a muddy water situation with some plastics I can put this on the back end of like a green watermelon or any kind of natural looking plastic in order to give it that chartreuse look on the back would tip the end with some of this the chartreuse color and it says crawfish on there but when you smell it ain't no crawfish a man can smell a little bit of hint of garlic maybe but that's some strong stuff but I used to I've got a little a swimbait here just the white just kind of for an example but say that's the end of my plastic I would just take the end dip it down in there for a little bit it doesn't take very long this stuff dies really well and that's what it does right there just tips it and I would do that to a lot of my plastics I don't know if it worked or not but it sure helped my confidence because I used to think oh I'm not catching any I need to tip my maybe I should try that trick out with some some of that spike it or oh I forgot to put some chartreuse on the end and I would do that and then I would start catching him I don't know if that was really the case but in my mind it changed everything up for me and it came almost like a confidence a way of catching stuff but there's one thing if you're a co-angler over you and someone else's boat and you're using this stuff you got to be extremely careful I know that making a remover for this stuff but if you spill this stuff it ain't gonna be good this stuff ruins carpet and all kinds of boat seats and you don't want to spill this stuff but there's some others out there there's this go I've got another Berkeley product which is the power bait set that's on most of the the plastics that Berkeley comes out with I know I used to use these with the power bait on the some of those chunk trailers I'd put them on a jig and I would catch them like crazy but I noticed after a day or two those Berkeley plastics would dry up and that scent would be all gone and there's really no way of reactivating them those were kind of just basically done after you use them one time cuz they dried up but there's bang and some other garlic since there was young that I used to use back in the day that that bill dance used to always throw on his lures that seemed like you know I used to watch that show all the time of bill dance outdoors but the one time that I did learn that it does work it was it was almost like a case or a field study you could say I was out there with a buddy and we were on a hot water lake and it was January it was freezing it was so cold sometimes that the rod tips on your rod would freeze up and it would start making frost as you'd really and it was craziest thing but we went into the back of some pockets and when we were first learning how to to do some bass fishing we weren't watching Bassmaster we're just watching some shows on the Outdoor Channel and we're picking up little tricks and tips from there and we were basically using like what is a mojo rig or a split shot rig but we were working it like a Carolina rig and it was just a real light setup with spinning tackle and we were going into the back of this this Cove where these bass were set up on beds and I was putting this YUM on my lures I was just putting it right all the way down tossing out just blind casting all over there was some cattle that would come out there were some little offensive fence lines that would come out and we were catching them all around the banks up in those shallows in the backwaters because if the water was a little high and there were some trees that weren't back in there and I remember I was catching five to one on this one trip to what he was using and as soon as he started applying that sent to his lures he started catching them we don't know if that really affected the way that the fish were wanting it or if they were finding the bait a lot easier it was not really clear water but it wasn't muddy it was right in the middle and every time we went out there after that one trip we did the same thing over and over again and we would always catch three four or five pounders at this place and that's when I learned that sense really can't affect a bite and I would go out there with other friends in that same location because that's when I really started getting hooked into bass fishing especially hook fishing on those beds like that if you've uh if you've ever fished during the spawn and that was one of the most fun times and that's what got me hooked into bass fishing in the early days when I really started getting into it and from that point on I started applying sense to my lures and kind of like how I was talking about this spy kick it almost became like a confidence confidence thing with me whenever I would apply it to some of my sense I would not be catching them put some of this on there because the oh I forgot kind of a deal put some of this on one of my plastics or just try it again and I would even if it wasn't because of this I would catch on and in my mind it would have changed everything but I do know that this does affect the visibility of the lure in the water what especially whenever you're looking at it as you're dropping the lure down you lose sight of the green or or any of the dark shades and it will bring out the chartreuse so that may be one thing that fish are picking up on so I don't know it worked for me subscribe if you haven't already liked this video if you liked it and I'll see you guys in the next one [Music]", "RXLgiEk7i24": "welcome to the McElroy brothers brand expansion quarterly report I am your oldest chief financial officer Jess McElroy I'm

being from Night Court", "LDK41yfD1hc": "I'm John Skinner and this supports my book fishing a fluke jigging from shore boat and kayak and you can learn more about the book at flounder book.com this is the rig I'll be using in the video at the bottom I have an ounce and a half SNS bucktail tipped with a 5-inch Berkley Gulp alive swimming mullet one foot above that is a six inch gulp grub on a five ol Gamakatsu bait holder hook and a tsunami holo teaser so this is the second half of a trip I was making in my new boat actually a new old boat but new for me nonetheless now the first part of the trip was in a video I posted about a week before this one that was called something like that insane fluke flounder jigging action it really was insane it was non-stop what we call lock and low you drop to the bottom you hook up you have a fish and I went through I don't know easily 50 to 70 fish and we can only keep three above nineteen inches I kept my three had one extra one I threw back but that was 90 minutes of fishing and I didn't want to go in so I decided to make a 10-mile run the fish some waters closer to home and I've moved recently some exploring some new waters and here's the first fish in this new spot I'd only been here about 20 minutes and this one was much bigger than any of the ones I caught on the first part of the trip definitely over five pounds a real quality fluke and you see me hitting the GPS right away there because I've got no marks on this area whatsoever I know that they catch fish in this general area I wasn't sure of the depth I pretty much went there I have a Navionics chip in my hummingbird fish finder that gives me that the shark so I look at the contour lines set up on one of those and yeah roughly I don't know 15 20 minutes into the first trip I got this one now look at this that's the bait it spit up that was a porti and that's the difference between where I'm fishing on this part of the trip and where I was previously where I was previously was all sand eels and I was using actually that white rod that's in the corner rod holder what inch Berkley Gulp alive swimming modes and now that I've moved here I know that this kind of an area has structure has rocks I know that the fish are going to be less plentiful of the sand eels are not here however there are larger baits and those porgies are a prime example of the larger baits that these larger fish will feed on now given the presence of larger fish feeding a larger bait I've upped the size on my gulps and instead of using the foreign swimming mullets that I use very heavily just ten miles from here I've moved up to the six-inch Gulf grub and that is a big bait and on the bucktail I've got a five-inch gulp alive swimming mullet so I'm up the size and yeah I said I'm fishing for Less the bigger fish here and I think you know putting those larger baits down presenting a bigger profile gives you a chance to get these larger fish like this and this this one's bigger than the first one I got here and it figures I've got quite a bit smaller fish in the cooler and both of these are going to have to go back you see again taking a mark because these are the first two marks I've got in this area on my fish finder and yeah this is a learning process for me in about 30 feet of water I'm not even sure this is the right contour line to be on here it's looking good to me so far so I'm happy to get some marks into that GPS and do a little catch or at least look at the belly on that fish clearly that one's got at least one floor B maybe more in it so they're down there chowing down on those porgies so I'm left to answer why don't you use these bigger baits all the time and try to call out bigger fish with them and if you watch the first half of this trip on that previous video that I posted yeah you know I've tried there I've tried to upsize the baits and it just does not make a difference there's so many smaller fish on the bottom it just becomes a call job you go down there you a lot of fish and I you know you hope that the numbers work in your favor and you you know you certainly get your limit and yeah and everyone smile you get a five or six pounder there but I've not had success going to the larger baits they're trying to call larger fish pretty much put the larger baits on I catch the same size fish that I catch on the 4-inch grubs and and if you want to look at economics those four inch grubs cost a lot less than the larger ones so yeah I stick with the fours back in to the Western spot that I was fishing on the first half of this trip and yeah I'll use the bigger stuff here again any marks I can get I'm really trying to learn this so you see that rope in the water I've got a drift control sock out when it breezes been picking up and dropping back and so I put it out to our slow drift down yeah this looked like another good one and it turned out not to be a fluke but it's a really nice fish alright so the rod is a six and a half foot tsunami classic rated ten to twenty pound test line the reels of quantum accuracy will with fifteen pound test spiderwire ultra cast my leader material is in this case twenty-five pound test fluorocarbon there's a loop at the bottom for the bucktail a dropper loop one foot above that for the teaser and the video on my youtube channel it shows exactly how to tie that rig so this is a beautiful sea bass but it's out of season so it's going to have to go back but it's a real nice one I did get a couple others not this size but a couple others in the same spot so I'll be back here when the season opens yeah beautiful fish and slipped out of my hands here not a very graceful release but the rod kind of broke its fall so no damage done to anything that was an otter tail bait strip on the bucktail at that nice sea bass hit all right so my first trip in the new boat turned out to be a real winter hub had for legal fluke back on the first spot that was on the previous video and had five on this spot and four of them were nice ones and a couple of really nice ones so that's good because yeah you know first time out a new boat you're wondering how it handles and how it drifts and everything else and needless to say I'm real pleased so I fished here about two hours only caught seven fluke but five were keepers and for them were nice and two of them or really nice so yep just a different fishery than what I had back in the other spot or if you haven't seen it I would encourage you to go off on my channel and watch that the first part of this trip on that what was entitled insane action and it's quite a difference it moved ten miles and you know it's a completely different fishery so alright I hope you found this helpful and if you enjoy these videos please

attractive or fish scent that they're marketing new brands new smells new types of products liquids gels you name it well these things actually do work they're not necessarily simply to attract fish but they're there to mask any other existing smells on the lure that you're presenting to the fish think about it what do you have on your hands when you're tying your lure on your line when you put a new soft plastic on a hook those sets that are in your hand your oils your growing tobacco you name it food drinks you've had that's going to transfer onto that lure so a lot of these scents are really there to help mask that in addition to possibly attracting fish and they do work so there are a lot of options for you yes you can go to the store you can purchase one of these products is available they do work i but somebody work better than others and some of them are really quite expensive this is a really good easy and expensive option for you and you very well may have all these things sitting in your kitchen right now and it's not one of those nasty or stinky smelly things it's going to make your wife really mad and want to kick you out of the house well what do I use these work really well and they're very similar to a lot of products that are on the market all you need is really three things you need an empty container you need some garlic salt and some extra virgin olive oil really really easy take a container pour some extra virgin olive oil in it and then depending on how thick you want it to make the slurry then just put in some garlic salt think about it you go to the store you buy a package of soft plastics what does it always say on it it says impregnated with salt a lot of the sins have garlic in it well here you go it's got boats if you look at the back of the two main ingredients the two first things on here number one is salt number two is garlic think about it it's also if it's a garlic salt it's really finely ground up you can bind minced garlic but it's not going to is easily into the olive oil think about it it's really cheap really easy these things are probably already in Lowe's since you get what I have here in just in a old plastic container that I had sit around the house leftover from something I had inside it I all I did was simply put some a certain amount of the extra-virgin olive oil in it poured about half a container the garlic salt in it made it a really thick slurry shake it up real well I've got a bunch of a soft plastic cross sitting in this soaking it up I works well but again this is something's going to get those scents that you already have on your hands off of those lures when you're putting it on right this stuff works great you may simply want to soak your lures in it like this for an extended period of time you'll make them swell up a little bit but I'll start absorbing it along there in it they may actually bleed some of the coloration off the Lord's eventually though but uh but that worked or you can somebody take this stuff and you can go to that same department store there you go - and you're buying your groceries if you go down the like you know plastic container all you'll see those little spray containers or the Dollar Tree look kind of like a Windex bottle but you can buy it without anything in it take that get a smaller one again just like what you see when you go in those tackle sections at your store you can pour some of the solution in it a few tire your lure out of your line simply spray gel so you wooded up a store-bought fishing tackle scent it's a good idea especially if you're already using a garlic scent like I said you can use other types of scent a similar method method now the extra-virgin olive oil is a little bit thicker than water so it's going to help it stick a little bit better to the lower especially you're soaking it in and then you guys think that you got a from time to time you might have to shake it up some more make sure that your your garlic salt dissolved up into the liquid but you can do is with other types of things that are have some kind of experiment with it but garlic so it's really cool because if you're working on this your wife's just gonna think you're making pizza garlic bread or something like that and so some nasty smelly stinky I you know if this gut solution you may be using I'm not saying it won't work if you're doing that you might not want to do it on your kitchen this something might wonder in your kitchen then you know just going to smell your cooking Italian food so hope this tip

guys today I'm gonna talk to y'all about Berkley Gulp Berkley Gulp is as we all know any saltwater fish freak or anybody who doesn't live under a rock knows that Berkley Gulp is one of the most effective saltwater baits for inshore fishing but it's so expensive so I'm gonna teach you guys some tips on how to use Berkley Gulp how to catch more fish with them but also how you guys can maximize really every time that you're using these so you're you know not wasting your money buying these expensive baits left and right so the first thing first tip that I have for y'all is to eliminate the tail biters that's tip number one if you can detect certain types of baits when you're fishing really anywhere on the eastern seaboard you get tons of pin fish blue fish and just small fish that tear up your Berkley Gulp right here this is a swimming mullet and you how many times you'll see this where they bite your tail off and then you've got to use another one and how many times have y'all burnt through a whole tub of these things twenty dollars in less than 30 minutes so the first tip out there is how to detect the tail biters when you're fishing a Berkley Gulp and you feel that bite that it literally feels like a mini machine-gun and your rod tip is just like it's just bouncing real quick that's a tail biter that's a pin fish what you want to do is just real real quick about two to three feet so that you get outside of that tail byers you know kind of area one mistake that a lot of people make when they first start fishing Burke legal because it's such an effective bait and it attracts tons of bytes it doesn't always attract the right byte so you do have to know how to detect so if you know how to detect sail flounder by the trout bite or a drum bite if that's what you're targeting better then you can eliminate those tail biters so when you feel that like many machine gun little taps on the end of your pole that's probably not a flounder it's probably not a trout or it's definitely not a drum so you so you just want to reel it in about three feet to make sure that you guys are eliminating those tail buyers if you guys give in to that bite and you're like oh man that's a fish that's a fish then that pin fish is going to tear up your Berkley goal and it's going to leave your shrimp being able to not be used or it's going to leave you know your swimming mullet with no tail so that's tip number one is to eliminate the tail biters alright tip number two is store your Berkley gulps correctly now this right here this is a waterproof stowaway so Berkley Gulp when you buy them in the tub they come in these and you know just like a mason jar you can you know open them unscrew them and screw them back on but what I've experienced is sometimes these tubs they don't really last that long and they are just known to develop leaks I would recommend actually it's worth your while this is only $15 one of these is $20 so if you lose the juice and in here then your Burke legal essentially becomes you can't use it anymore so if you invest just fifteen dollars and one of these and you put the juice in here it's waterproof it's not going to go anywhere and then you can actually set up all of your different berkeley gulps in there the shrimp the swimming mullet so that's tip number two make sure that y'all are storing your berkeley gulps correctly okay so tip number three if you have a general idea of the water conditions where you're going to be fishing then that way you don't have to buy as much Berkley Gulp what I mean by that is if you know that the water you're gonna fish is really really clear for on the other side where Christine I fish and the Outer Banks if that water is going to be tan tannic it's going to be you know kind of brown then that way you know that you're going to be able to eliminate having to buy different types of colors and you can just maximize and hone in on really one or a few different types of Berkley Gulp all right y'all tip number four for Berkley Gulp is know when it's time to change out your Berkley Gulp so I really cannot emphasize for those of y'all who are not too familiar with Berkley Gulp and how effective that they are the tail biters the tail biters sometimes they'll take a little chunk out of the tail of your shrimp or just a little piece of your swimming mullet so I don't have an example on me for sowing mullet but sometimes they'll take like a quarter of an inch off the tail of your soil that's okay you can still catch fish you don't need like a lot of people if they just get a little bite off of the tail of their shrimp you can watch Christine eyes videos and look closely and see that a lot of the redfish that we're catching are coming from tails that have kind of like half bitten off or whatever as long as it still has the action like if it bit off the tail completely then that's when you definitely want to change that out and you do want to you know kind of throw this one away but if it just bit off you know a small piece of that tail then definitely still use it alright y'all so going off a tip number four tip number five is very important and because Berkley Gulp is a more fragile bait and it is susceptible to just trash fish and crabs you know destroying your bait is to make sure that you're using the right hook for your Berkley goal that's really going to allow you to maximize the amount of use that you get out of each brook legal all right so let me show you guys an example of a hook that I don't like to use her Berkley gold and this right here when you push that Berkley Gulp up do you see how thick this is right here as opposed to this is the strike king jig head right here do you see how much thicker that it is so I like to use jig heads that aren't as crazy aggressive of a bait holder like this one I like to go with something that's a little bit more mellow right here like this this is the strike king redfish magic more I also like to use these gotchas right here so as you can see when you catch a fish on the Berkley Gulp you want to be able to use that same Berkley Gulp again and again is so if you catch a fish on this one and your shrimp is moving up and down on this jig head you're probably only going to get one maybe to finish out of that because of the jig head that you're using whereas if you use a jig head with something that's a little bit more thin and not as aggressive for a bait holder then that's going to allow you to maximize the amount of use that you can out of your goal all right y'all so one last kind of extra tip for y'all is so this juice right here inside of these jars also the juices and the bags that you buy but really for these jars these are great so when you're fishing and Christy and I we do weight fishing we also fish here on our boat and let's say we make a run to another spot so what I like to do and just kind of a pro tip is if you haven't caught a fish in probably like 15 to 20 minutes this juice is just like this scent that you can buy just kind of like the flounder pounder scent or some of those other that you can buy so what I like to do is actually keep this open on the nose of my boat and so every five to ten minutes I'm actually taking my bait and I'm dipping it in this juice so then that way it kind of recharges it a little bit more with that scent if you're Berkley Gulp dries up then that's gonna affect the action and you know you're not going to catch as much fish that's kind of an extra tip there for you alright y'all so that's all I got for you guys hopefully those tips help y'all to be more successful out there on the water with Berkley Gulp and do so without breaking the bank because burns legal definitely expensive bait but it is effective so hopefully that helps you guys be more successful make sure to leave us a line below if you guys have anything additional that you'd like to say also subscribe to our channel for weekly almost daily

let's talk about something let's talk about I don't know what do you want what do you want to talk about you guys I almost got prep I almost got chips but then I decide not to oh I'm like I did it last time we need different things if I'm gonna do another 7-eleven Susan I was just craving 7-eleven last one ah I really want their waffles remember last time I did I had the waffle that's gonna repeat that but they're happening also the man at 7-eleven looked so over me like you gotta go because I walk around the store I think of what I want I look at everything and I put it on the counter so I'm still shopping you know most people go in for life I've soda a pack of cigarettes a newspaper maybe I talk I'm like shopping for a feast I'm walking around walking around every time I look at him he's like what is this boy trip it was the same guy from last time I want him part of me feels like he doesn't like me another part of me feels like he doesn't like his job and our part of me feels really bad for him like it's older fifties not 60s but 50s my good poor thing Oh [Music] oh my husband has a channel called Boylan home go subscribe go check it help I would like to address two or three things one of our address but we're gonna say it again number one I appear on the channel sometimes maybe fifty percent of the time it's not because I'm trying to control him it's not because I'm making him it's not because I'm hogging up the spotlight I have three channels we are married and he doesn't always know what to feel like there's some people who just he can't do daily muck bungs he can't binge that much and have those main cheat meals cuz he's gonna die you know he has like one cheat meal week maybe twice a month the rest I mean he's done he's done fruit mukbang speech month bunks during my bunks jackfruit bong he's doing fruits and vegetables but it's it's just not the same it's not as enjoyable as watching him eat like a big bowl of a big pizza you know so the channel will be very empty and hard to grow if he's only posting twice a month three times a month that's excluding the vegetable ones but people are not really digging them there are people who want it but it's a very small percentage and at the other day we have to pay our bills in whatever so I have to make it realistic for both of us and he's like Nick put some videos over here to help bring more people in I would love to get him to 100k subs and get him a checkmark get him verified you know what I mean and by me let's be real I'm not trying to be cocky but if I'm on the channel more people are gonna watch because they know me there's a lot of people that don't even know I'm married there's people done don't even know who he is you know cuz he comes on my channel maybe once a month once every two months my main channel has a lot but there a lot of bad video together so I just I sprink I'm sprinkling myself on there a lot you know twice a week with other things too like unboxing my stuff from Amazon or unboxing my gifts or hey I think he did a vegetable garden video and he does some vlogs it's in everything channel we're gonna call it in everything Channel I'm not trying to hog it I'm not trying to tell what to do it's a space for him and me to just put some extra videos on and to help him grow and at the end of the day it's you know it's his bunny it's not an ant why I make all my channels he also gets half cuz we're married it's 50/50 split so it's not a competition I don't know if people are trying to pin us against each other like you stay on your channel like I only like Orland as I've been great watch the videos of just warlin but he doesn't want to run a channel all by himself and if you're married to someone with a million almost 2 million followers and you have 40 why would you why would your husband not want to help you get from 40 to 100k why would you I would look like a bad husband if I name it help them or be or a collab with him or put some videos over there to bring more people over you know I mean I think people would say that too so these might be people who are think of something to say but this is not the apology that's just to get off I am out of the way and then sometimes chipsy I'm really all about like algorithm and blah blah blah I'm like if I post you much here I don't get paid as much in them in the views and the CPM but you guys know I'm all crazy with that and I've had a lots of lots of problems they shave my YouTube sorry I don't just saturate my channels with a million videos because sometimes I want to feel more than one video so that's a great place to post as well and he wants it I want it we all want it yeah more content if you really love us you're gonna want more content you know it's free you're gonna hang out with us so anyways um there's that the next point is that I did a video excuse maybe maybe two weeks ago and I had Cheetos cheesy chicken nuggets and ramen noodles and I did it at like 1:00 in the morning maybe midnight bills late at night though and I wasn't planning on doing a video that day but I decide to I probably just got really hungry you know so whatever I'm and I already filmed for my video my NIC econo to see I also don't want to stress out like a lot of people by posting too much on all three channels so again I posted for his viewers or try to get a new audience whatever so oil it's like you know because I was hungry he's like film something for my channel you know we need more views over there I'm like okay so I get all the things and I feel me I'm late at night and I started talking about my weight now usually in my videos I don't talk about weight and health because I'm an unhealthy channel like there's nothing healthy about my bones it's for whatever reason maybe I was insecure I think I was reading a lot of comments and people saying you know how fat I am and blah blah blah I'll try to brush her off by saying I'm a tall guy I'm like I'm only in my 250 range and I'm alive been in the 250 range for a year just by eating this way every day so it's not really making me bigger even though I'm overweight I'm not just exponential like you know 300 400 500 is going all the way up it kind of like stopped at plateaued don't know why I don't go to the gym and I was just talking about it and I said something that I regret saying cuz I watched it back in hindsight I didn't even realize I said it and in my head you know how I go in my little spiel sometimes I I feel as if I'm very particular about what I mentioned but in this case I didn't really talk about what I imagined so I said the following I said you know I'm 250 pounds you know maybe a football player a football players 250 pounds that's a no big deal but for woman stewardship a few pounds oh my god it's scary and I kept going but people heard woman overweight equals scary and it made a lot of people upset and I am so sorry I wasn't trying to make anyone upset obviously but I did and I want to apologize football player versus tiny woman let's you know four foot nine 5 foot 1 versus 6 foot 5 football player 250 pounds is normal 250 pounds for someone that small and tiny and petite and a woman it's not you know it's not the same not to say if you're overweight or if you're thick or whatever like if if you're 250 pounds as a woman I'm the last person to even judge you for that I'm over here with my double chin every day oh my gosh I don't hate women that has never ever been my energy it's never even been in my brain of thought that men who is superior to women I don't even think like that just reading those comments shocked me I was like oh my god what did I say because I was reading the comments Orlin doesn't like to read it's like he saw a few he's like make you guys see um and he edited the video he put it up I'm like why did you put that in feels so bad he's like BAE didn't say anything bad I followed what you were saying you were saying it 250 pounds doesn't look the same on anyone and it's true and I also said to if you're overweight you don't need to be told that you're overweight you know people know so he says I didn't see anything giving women roles good luck blocking them in boxes and acting like they are you know downgraded to a certain role in society that is not what I said had nothing to do what I was talking about the people and it turned to a snowball effect I think because I looked at the comments and so many people were saying it and I watched the part cause people were tagging it I'm like I didn't say anything about that so I wrote a little apology I pinned it I left it for an hour to and I'm like no one's gonna see it now cuz his videos videos over there don't get hundreds of thousands of views so I'm like I'll just address it to those who did see it all 5,000 of you and I'm so sorry I am NOT trying to make fun of you I'm not saying that you're bad or not pretty or not beautiful if you're overweight that's I didn't say any of those things but I didn't elaborate on the sentence where I said if you're a guy and you're about 250 pounds it's no big deal if you're a woman it's scary I should have said if you are a tall guy with muscle twitch 50 pounds I was talking about health right I was trying to say obviously not everything is created equally in terms of calories and calories Emma sometimes they go on little tangents and I I don't even know what I'm talking about but I think I do and I'm also a little I'm not delusional I know I'm overweight but I don't like to talk about it while eating so I did in that video and I regret it and I'm sorry I took it down and I don't want that up there so anyways I just want to say that anyways i said that today on my livestream there was only about two hundred people watching me on the livestream but a lot of people in there that saw it they understand better where I was coming from after explaining it so that's why I want to put it in here as well because I don't want to act like I don't care I don't want there to be rumors going around Nick does this and takes it down and hoping people don't know I know I'm aware and I'm gonna acknowledge you and I am so sorry I don't think of women as inferior at all at all that is not I'm was a raised that way I don't feel that way and I I am so sorry that what I said came across that way because that's not what I meant and I'm so sorry so anyways let's try to get happier now ah do you still love me maybe you don't I don't know so I was like I need to stop filming it 2:00 in the morning or whatever like cuz I don't know what I'm saying I'm gonna come over here like oh my gosh I'm not that it's just water way I probably said that a million times it's hot fast just why wait hmm at least I'm a guy you know oh my god if I wait this as a woman he'll be scarier you know without just casual rambling that could be very offensive to people and I mean that's not what I meant it was me trying to get myself excuses

get that youtuber house get that youtuber check get that hit super fans and feign everyone goes on youtube for these reasons usually I know a lot of people say oh it's to connect with people but at the other day is also to get views to build a brand for yourself to make it a career or to get money or all of them I just wish people have been more honest about that not saying she's not understand some people know digressing say I came on YouTube to inspire people I'm like you would not be blowing $30 on a meal to inspire people if that's all you got out of it let's just be frank I wish people would be more honest about it if YouTube didn't pay you once day now obviously I've had trouble with my BAE but I just made more channels you know which I can get something so I wish people would say that more but anyways excuse me that's the YouTube dream you start out on YouTube get an audience you grow you become famous whatever but then you need to do something with your audience and give back or create a book on tour being a musical to a concert make a movie YouTube can be a stepping stone outside of the internet onto the real world like what she did on Netflix that is like the YouTube dream create some books go on tour and work outside of YouTube on TV she I'm Toni Dodd is like right there how to be a youtuber what not how to be a youtuber but what YouTube can do for you if you are lucky and you try hard and you're honest and you're good well not always I mean you can be a chronic liar and end up on a reality TV show like some other youtubers but on the other day it's also luck but still don't stop what else are laughing I don't even know why he's like oh this hits the spot this is gonna make me sleep so good tonight I haven't been sleeping good these past couple days number

burping I always bring my drink sorry I came down but have you ever seen that interview with Britney Spears so funny she was like this so it's um Tucker call Tucker took her across to the guy knowns on Fox News he was actually on CNN you know 20 years ago interviewing Britney Spears asking her the scoop about her Pepsi sponsorship in basically be a little rude I thought I mean like you know she's sponsored you know they're paying her to say I let I support this drink you know there's really no questions to ask they're like well between me and you meanwhile three million people are watching the interview there's TV cameras are right there but he says between just me and you how much do you really like Pepsi and she's so over this interview and she was chewing gum the whole time in she goes I really like Pepsi I really do he's like what kind of Pepsi do you like she goes look hot Pepsi Pepsi Pepsi I like how Pepsi Pepsi he's like you really it's you so just regular Pepsi and she goes yeah it's just right just French it's just regular regular Pepsi it's just so funny because everyone knows Pepsi paid her to like pose with their bottles and that's what paid product placement is pay promotion whatever people know that's how it works and but she was so over that was not an appropriate question for an interview because was she gonna say I hate Pepsi but they paid me like it it's just ridiculous some of the questions he was asking but and then um yeah there's another wall I've seen this on Twitter this little meme a pretty Spears right regular just spread just just regular Pepsi you know that's viral on Twitter I see it all the time but then um you can see the full interview on YouTube like I said and there's a part of the interview where he says have you been clean are you cleaning yourself up like are you acting good implying that she's an Aldi and she was like so over this interview and she was chuner and I'm sure like well it's not like you know I'm not like having orgies all night in my house or anything nowhere geez totally serious and then he's like what do you like to watch on TV she's like oh I like I like MTV I like friends I like what else did she say and he's like how about CNN do you watch scene and she's like oh she rolled her eyes back oh yes I love seeing it oh I love CNN I really do you know just playing with him like he were just so full of it look at me as Britney Spears are so entertaining in her own little way lost way she seems lost a lot of times but it's amazing it's amazing oh my gosh and then I wonder like what's it like to be that famous everyone comes up with conspiracy theories about you like you're just a normal girl that you know hit the jackpot got rich and famous and use and anyone says your mind controlled by MKULTRA you are possessed by the government we're being paid off to do something to help Illuminati like and you're just like no no one is mind controlling me like what you know I'm just imagine what it's like to be her life and see all those conspiracies everyone judging a relationship that isn't theirs welcome to being a youtuber on a much smaller scale Hey Wow yeah um I like Britney Spears she

through that's bad that is bad ah and the ramen noodles were good but they got really spicy well everyone I'm gonna get going it was so nice hanging out with you I hope you can forgive me for what I said on the orleans channel i need to be careful not to talk about weight in general but if i do which should not happen while eating it ruins the vibe here but by whatever reason i'm complaining about my weight i need to focus on me and others and i'm gonna focus on focusing on people i was just passing mention of the differences between male and female bodies and guys can technically be heavier that's kind of like a fact i mean cuz they're taller but i didn't i should have just said that and people would have been like how dare you women are able to be more heavier than man it's not that you're not able to see look at me here I go again if we're talking about health or I shouldn't be talking about health regardless that's the problem you know that's the problem I don't mean it's not it's not for me to even talk about considering that I'm and healthy doing this it's just I don't know what I was thinking I wasn't thinking and I'm so sorry so sometimes I like to go on my little analytical My Mind's flowing and speaking and just some things are off limits let's put that there with politics and religion even though I do like to talk about healthy diets and oh this is good for you that's some soluble vitamins spoke about like I just shouldn't it look I look like a fool excuse me when I do it considering what I'm eating huh yeah it's just cuz it's coming from me and that's the bad thing too I think if someone else had said you know talking about guys can eat more because they technically have they can have more muscle you know like it doesn't sound it's like okay you should shut your mouth type of thing you know if it was like a Fitness channel explaining it metabolism and stuff I don't know Oh anyways thank you for your time I hope to see you tomorrow I hope that you still you still like me and love me if you even saw that video and I'm exposing myself because apartment is like Nick don't even bring it up because 5,000 people saw it you're gonna get 200,000 people on this fit you told them all you expose yourself but I would rather do that and be honest and not act like trying to shove it under the rug like a lot of people do I want to tell you that I know and I need to be very careful and watch what I say and just avoid that subject for my own good - so have a great day I will see you tomorrow bye", "J7L9THry9QM": "you want an atomic pepper mr.

powerful supporters are you kidding me yeah come on don't we have bigger issues to deal with bloomberg is looking for a legacy and some of his pioneering initiatives get picked up elsewhere including canada in 2002 he banned smoking nearly everywhere even parks there was an uproar but people adapted and both smoking and heart attack rates dropped significantly bloomberg forced an end to trans fats in restaurants and was the first to make them post calorie counts on their menus he's also targeted soft drinks before bloomberg banned soft drinks years ago in schools though studies show students simply switch to other sugar-laden beverages like energy drinks still bloomberg is getting kudos from doctors and dietitians this is classic public health if there's a a toxic substance in the

canada and we are approaching a 7-11 because a couple of you guys let me know that 7-eleven canada has now jumped on the chicken sandwich game and that i should go and check it out i'm not sure if they checked it out already or they wanted me to check it out and let them know if it's any good and i do know a lot of you guys like to know if i like something or not and i'm glad i gassed up closer to my house because it was a dollar nineteen canadian for a leader and down here it's a dollar twenty four point six holy shmoly so let's find a good parking spot customers only that's me and we'll get the the shot of the 7-eleven in the background there we are good all right guys let's go into the 7-eleven grab that chicken sandwich and maybe a drink come back here and eat it with you are you guys ready let's go [Music] [Music] donuts more donuts lots of treats let's do some snowballs [Music] hello how are you all right i'd love to try your your chicken sandwich you guys have the new chicken sandwich i thought you guys are on your website you have brand new chicken sandwiches i uh i'm not sure about uber but i was told i saw it but [Music] chicken sandwich any other sandwich right now we don't have the chicken okay if you have an uber account you can login kind of order it and pick up yourself then you buy one you get one thing okay [Music] okay thank you okay thank you well that sucks totally was expecting i see the phone before i came down but it's on their website chicken sandwich that's why i came down here so let's figure out something elsie so far we've got some snowballs and [Music] italian supreme do you guys toast this or do i do it [Music] okay [Music] thank you have a good day [Music] ladies and gentlemen with the big fail the big chicken sandwich fail i usually do phone some of these places to make sure they have it but because it was on their website i just figured they all had it and the fact that she was just like nope we don't have it i'm like what that doesn't make sense why is it like the top banner on their website new chicken sandwich so we settled for some other crazy foods let's get the trusty steering wheel tray and start eating shall we all right first up let's take a sip of my slurpee didn't want to fill it all the way up to the top i didn't want that much but i definitely wanted more than the next one down oh oh man pink cream soda this needs a scoop of ice cream oh yeah all right let's open up this sandwich and see because i have never had their pizza submarine eight inch and of course for dessert we're gonna do some snowballs snowballs who likes snowballs what movie is that from people leave a comment in the comment section below i think he swore a lot about the snowballs so you'll have to uh keep it clean people keep it clean all right let's open this up so i believe the one lady just looked at me all confused because she was new and i didn't know she was new but i said can you toast this and she just like looked at me like do it yourself but they have two microwaves for certain foods and then they also have that toaster machine behind the back there let's open this up see if it's any good oh boy the cheese is nice and gooey check out that nicely squashed bun it got hammered it's definitely toasted let's see if we can pull off some of this top on here check what's underneath oh we got the marinara sauce looks like two different kinds of pepperoni underneath that looks like we've got three or four slices of ooey gooey mozzarella cheese and i'm kind of hoping on the bottom is more marinara and there is nice well done 7-eleven canada all right let's bite into it and see if it's any good smells fantastic by the way okay come on let go the cheese is stuck it's all nice and soft because of that toasting process cheers i'm not bad it'd be nice if they could uh separate the bun from everything else and actually toast it so it has that crunch but other than that it's nice and if i wasn't making a video for you i'd zip back in there i thought in the microwave just to bump it up because the cheese isn't 100 melted some of it was and that part was definitely not melted but again still tastes great lots of food in there and for 5.75 that's pretty good it looks like you just buy it take it home and toast it yourself or have them toast it i think most people would have it toasted here they'd probably be eating in their car like me and uh so the sandwich the drink and the dessert are snowballs is uh 10 and 43 cents here in ontario canada i'm definitely enjoying it so let everybody know in the comments below what your favorite slurpee is this is probably one of mine right here it says only at 7-eleven slurpee warning brain freeze may occur definitely been known to happen i had a friend back when we were really young there was a 7-eleven somewhat near our house it was a really hot day so i bought the slurpee with the only money he had and he went outside and he he was thirsty and he guzzled it and it went right to his head and he it it hurt so much he just smashed the slurpee into the ground he was so mad way to go craig i still talk to him to this day that's probably when we're at 12. hmm good times good memories if i was traveling through the states or across canada and the only place was around was a 7-eleven i'd definitely buy that again it is actually quite good uh like i said i nuke it a little bit more just to melt it make it a little bit more warm than it is that's the only thing i do to it other than that it's perfect and i'm liking it just enough to give it a one o'clock in the morning shout out by to all you amazing men and women out there who love to watch my videos at one o'clock in the morning we don't know why you do but you do this bite is for you cheers good stuff i'm definitely gonna finish this off last bite then let's try the snowballs all right next up are these snowballs 410 calories for both of them mrs freshley's make life sweeter [Music] if i was stuck in the zombie apocalypse and there was a truck full of snowballs i would definitely take a few i wouldn't kick them around so it looks like we got a chocolate cake and then we have marshmallow on top of the chocolate cake and then it's sprinkled with uh coconut and inside supposed to be cream let's take a bite check that out and there is your extreme close-up of a snowball i'm really enjoying the marshmallow outer edge kind of like the icing of a cake and then i've got of course it's got the coconut flavor to it for sure and you got that creamy center i love that kind of cream in like chocolate donuts one of my favorite let's keep eating that cream is gonna be nice and sugary sugary sweet it's not like whipped cream it's more like a sweet icing a sweet vanilla icing on the inside well i'm going to let the cat out of the bag woody harrelson hated these in the movie zombieland and if it came down to these or twinkies i would definitely eat twinkies over these these aren't bad but twinkies are definitely better anyway i'll take this last bite and i'll save the other one maybe for later it's okay well there you go ladies and gentlemen the chicken sandwich fail here at 7-eleven when a subscriber or a few subscribers tell me that the chicken sandwich is here in canada at 7-eleven and then i go on the website and it says chicken sandwich across the top of their website then you would imagine going to a 7-eleven you'd be able to pick up a chicken sandwich but apparently you can't i'm gonna phone around to a few other ones and maybe we'll do it next week we'll take a break from 7-eleven for seven days and then maybe we'll come back next tuesday well there you go ladies and gentlemen we are all done if you find yourself hungry and there's a 7-eleven just around the corner grab yourself a slurpee and a pizza eight-inch sub get them to toast it feel it before you leave the store because if it's not hot enough zip over to the microwave throw another 30 seconds onto it get that cheese super melted and you'll enjoy it as much as i did if you want to show your support for me doing these videos just for you hit it with a thumbs up ding ding ding ding ding but if you're still hungry for more check out that amazing playlist i threw down over there and i'll see you over there bring your hunger", "ijOz15yweug": "hello and welcome to the scope video tutorial where today we are going to be looking at compressing images so in the previous two tutorials we looked at task dependencies and then we looked at how plumber works so this is where we got to with our goal file is and what I'm going to do is we're going to look at compressing images so up here on the Left I have a images folder with a bunch of different images about Geo pegs and PNG images in here these are not being compressed and what we're going to do let's start by and let's open up the terminal so let's do terminal and then I'll just quickly CD into my terminal there we go now what idea we're going to go ahead and install image min so do sudo and do to do install save their gulp image min its enter in your password and I'll type that wrong so let's do it again sudo NPM install scepter go image min I forgot to put the node package manager in there only this in the description as well so everybody can get the installation command but if not you can just copy from here so well starts install it make sure that you've got you know some images to compress and then should be done soon so whilst it's installing I'm just going to move it to the the right and let's require the plug-in like we would do with many other plugin basically so do image min well bar image may require gulp image and I think we're nearly done with this here it comes with a bunch of welcomes bundled with like various different optimizers that's done so we can just pull it all the way so it comes with Jeff JPEG and PNG and compression and SVG compression we're going to work with today's JPEG and PNG but they're all pretty much the same to be honest so what we're going to do is go ahead and create a new task gulp task we'll just do image compression I will do compress images compress images function that I'm here then we'll do return call a sauce and and then we're going to do here let's give it the location of and our images so let's do let's rename it actually to free images so do pre images come down here do pipe image men then you come with this stage we've got push-ups and options so you can do like progressive compression and then you could also do optimization level of income so alright and you could do like ten it goes on scale of one to ten we're just going to leave the optimization like a lot because it comes up by default three which is a pretty good you just don't look that rubbish and once they are compressed they actually look natural as opposed to being really blocky and yeah unnatural basically I do another pipe do gold we're just going to give it a destination where we want them to save and just doing images because it'll create a new folder for us and then that all looks good to me which quickly you know the compress images yep pre images for that particular folder progressive it is equal is set to true pipe the destination two images so let's pull up this terminal and let's do gulp then make sure you call in the tasks that do compress images and before I do that let me show you some of the stats of these images so we can kindly get to grips with how how big these images are so we've got like ones here which is like 1 to 5 KB 2/3 896 46 6 1 6 that's got a fair few colors in that one actually yes the feel is small already but let's go ahead and compress these images but before we do I just realize there's one thing I didn't do in here make sure we do the wild card just to say all so I'll save that when you can't a guy just jpg I can tell you just like PNG but for now tell you everything do gulp compress images because that's what we've called our tasks and we get an error which is coming up line we on 14 and see why return gulp sauce look look ah here we are image mind stupid of me M starts image min let's go ahead and pull the terminal back up again and it works which is good we save 17.3% and we got our images folder so let's go ahead and so got all these images in here which were prior to compression go to our images and let's compare the size of these so we're going to my dog folder I pull this up now so the two folders here and then we've got one two five so served as ten KP next one we saved and yeah a fair bit on that one and next one it said well not much too much on that one and I'll turn the compression up in a second and show you how how can go quite crazy with this but yeah we've pretty much saved a bit on there let me turn the compression up it's only working at three a minute let's go crazy and do optimization level ten see what see how how much reserve on this I've got a feeling they're gonna come out really bout the let's see oh minified nine images so you've got I've got a feeling that didn't really do much or did it let me delete the images again from my images folder minified let's go ahead I see I just remembered I previously mentioned that this can go up to 0 to 10 I was thinking that ever different plug-in it's zero after seven so go to seven as the max so go to gulp compress images and now this should work okay number seven and served as the same amount I think even though we put 10 in there and well setting 0 enables like just basic minimal compression so you don't really get anything like no changes to the depth of color type and so yeah I'm not quite sure I think it goes in levels so when I was reading the plug-in apparently compression ones like one trial impressions 3/16 it starts going up from like 1 8 16 24 48 120 and then they're too far so yeah that's pretty much how image compression works it doesn't seem so much difference between 0 and 7 let me take up progressive safer than if if any difference I'll rerun this I have compressed images so you'll get do 15% less F so progressive actually gives us more compression optimization level well I showed you here I did seven I did the basic default which is number three so goes from 0 7 fellow weird no it was up but yeah this works with like gif JPEG PNG SVG images and seems to you have some decent compression and servers like long HTTP requests or the fairly quickly for all our images to download it but yeah that's pretty much how it works to be honest very simple stuff you could just you know copy this you can like I said you can target like PNG JPEG SMS FG and jiff so yeah thank you for taking time watch this video and I shall stay in excellent", "WiupzcAM2Ic": "hello and welcome to this gulp video tutorial I'm going to be showing you how to minify CSS easily so let's go ahead and jump in what we're going to do is open up terminal do sudo if you are in a UNIX based system NPM install see there gulp minify CSS just leave that for a second so you can copy it so sudo NPM start I'll leave this in the description type in my password and that's installing now while starts installing and go ahead and we're put together a CSS file mine's fairly large actually of your 2,000 lines in here I just wanted to test out how well this actually works to know about that it's told what we can do is we can go up here well let's go to the bottom actually do go I can type tasks minify CSS function give it a call back close the semicolon off return gulp sauce and then we're going to use and let's see what we can work with here so let's use the CSS for the socks dude CSS and then style.css I believe is called yes and did you do I should be good so screwed pipe height minify post remember to actually include the CSS variable PR actually so do minify SC FS equals require gold minify CSS grab this put that there and then we can put in arguments here so let's do one for M let's keep some some comments CEOs keep comments keep special comments keep the special comments you can see the argument so that's just on the NPM and website for gold minify CSS and then keep special comments the one we're going to be looking for so far we can keep all comments well now we can type one in here for keeping the first comment on layer or zero for removing all and we'll type one for now and then what we want to do is give it a distribution so we can do gold rope I go desk and let's do CSS there and what I tend to do is I tend to like trade the folder us like the dish world distribution in the development folder but I'll just rename this to pre CSS for now and then we'll change that it's pre CSS and hopefully this should create a folder with the new file so let's go ahead open up terminal and I'll tell you a second that what all this does so it's just dude gold and remember when you called the task so minify CSS and there we are we've got our folder now so we used to have this with about 2,000 yeah 2,600 lines and now we just have this so we said here keep special comments basically special comments are ones with light and uh schrutes so like this and according to gulp so you can also do a thing sort of a look here we could just actually break this down to do to do something look or work on here yeah so I can give it a go so if we get rid of this and we could just do keep bricks I'll keep line breaks and we could true so run that again see what happens and then we get the line breaks in there which I I tend to prefer personally and we can also do a ton of difference too but to be honest I'm just trying to think you can do a ton of stuff so you can do like set the URI so you can set the puffs to you know your input of rules but if you're using imports in CSS files it may run into some problems with this from what being reading and but yeah that's pretty much it to be honest that's kinda and kind of very simple if I'm be nice so like gulp task minify the CSS and then yeah and then we come down to our function do Kolbert and we get the return people been asking what the returned those bitter the return just indicates to the system that the task is increased so it will run and with all the other tasks we're synchronous again I've got if you go to my notes yes video I've got a quite good explanation of this whereas you get stuff like and so your tasks want us to test Laurie where could split those up so sort of a more run at the same time we do just task one once task one's done toss two three so this is asynchronous route this is a synchronous route and sleep oops so yeah hopefully that makes sense and you come I've got a video as well waking the like here you can set a change to only go ahead and run once Jason it's done so we can run it in asynchronous called linear and stretch as opposed to running do you know them all at the same time async wrestler but yeah yeah coming to the end this video I just want to go back to this return value here where we're returning gold sauce well SRC basically just returns a stream so that's why it's asynchronous and we're going to start looking in future videos that why certain things are is increasing why we've is probably better to say a synchronous just for the simple fact that when we start working with multiple streams and then returning them and then combining those streams we want to you know work with I don't know asynchronous or synchronous tasks depending on and our reasoning for doing so I guess it's all it's just all dependent on the user and if any of this thing makes sense let me know and I'll do my best to help you up so yeah folks taking time to watch this video and I shall see you the next one", "Ak9tFhUypQM": "here we go okay three you're good a good peeps of the world I've got some pork loin chops from the fridge this morning and today I want to show you how I add some real open pizzazz what would normally be just a fried pork chops keep watching I'm Rick Michelle and this is you can cook I've got three very nice pieces of pork pork loin chops are what I call them and what we're going to put in here is one clove of garlic about a half a teaspoon of ginger I haven't decided yet if I'm going to put any chili in there or not decide we start cooking I've got some brown sugar we probably use about half a tablespoon to a tablespoon of that we'll use about half the abuse of half of a vey orange and we'll use a big walloping tablespoon of apricot jam and just a splash of soy for seasoning so let's go over to the stove and get this cooking going to start which is a little bit of oil I'll use olive oil use whatever you've got what we're going to do is fry these up two to three minutes each side and then flip them to the other side for only two or three minutes but we're not going to cook them all the way through I like to get a nice brown crust on it like that turn them over you could quite easily and if you're more comfortable cook them all the way through maybe a bit longer on both sides and then keep them warm while you make the sauce this is just the way I do it I'm going to cook for a little bit longer about two minutes now on that side and we're going to pull them out now these are still fairly raw in the middle these are quite done in both both sides but I pull them out now but like I said before continue on cooking them and getting get some finished cooking and make your sauce if you if you're more comfortable that way now I just heat up just a tiny little bit good garlic I don't want to burn it it's pretty hot here a ginger just soften that up a little bit already smells amazing deglaze your pan with the orange juice add your soy sauce Thank You sugar and a really nice big gulp of your jam I'm going to add a bit more and we just basically heat get that dissolved look up the chilies when I put the meat back in now we cook that until the chops are done and what you'll probably find is that your sauce isn't thickened yet it smells amazing some point turn them over the sauce is starting to look really nice thickening up they're still a bit pink in the middle salsa come along beautifully I'm going to turn that down a little bit that sauce is looking so nice these are coming off in about 30 seconds to a minute that one's done I can tell by feeling it and a good rule of thumb here so you'll see what I mean is we can go by feeling the meat when it's done and take your hand like this okay put your your thumb and index finger together and then touch your the meat of your thumb it's nice and soft well that's very rare go to the second one that's medium-rare go to the that one there you've got like pink in the middle and there is well-done if your meat feels like that it's well-done so that's what I learned maybe 20 years ago I don't know where I got it let's pull these out they're done the sauce looks beautiful turn that off let's plate this up you can have this was literally anything we would have steamed veggies and maybe some potatoes or even some mashed potatoes and check out this sauce if your sauce isn't thick enough just while the meat is taken off when it's first taken off just turn that up a little bit and reduce that sauce how simple was that even if you put the meat aside you cook it first and put the meat aside and then make your sauce the sauce only takes minutes to make and it's a superb sauce now look because not everybody has the time to get out there and pick their apricots make their own apricot jam okay use the jar it's so much faster so much easier and really you get your friends to try that and you're going to absolutely amaze them this is Rick Michelle you can cook internet kitchen and cook up some wonderful [Music]", "6SRGEzwCroU": "[Music] well we did it folks 100 000 subscribers from the bottom of my heart thank you thank you thank you [Music] there's you that makes this channel great i'm just here chugging under me one bottle at a time but thank you and as promised i'm opening the cell books and teaching you how to chunk like badlands booker welcome to badlands chucks and today is a special day today is the day i'll open the checkbooks and teach you how to chuck these are just the basics right now but i'm going to come with several videos covering the whole gambit of chugging you know how to chuck hot liquids cold liquids carbonated liquid soda beer shotgun and everything i know it all and i'm willing to teach you but enough of that first things first is the basics rule number one never put your lips around the bottle you will never win a chunk competition if you do that like so see i've gone nowhere the art of chugging is for you to let the liquid fall down your throat so when you bring the the bottle to you to your lips you always leave room around the top and allow liquid to fall down your throat like so [Music] okay you see how much faster that was how much is left now that's the idea now in order for you to chug fast you have to exercise these muscles the chug muscles what i call them your throat muscles basically by doing what's called gravity chucks you know you basically just choke the water you know and try to take the biggest gulps that you can right but before you do that you must prime this area to chug so basically you've seen me do this many times with the air out of my lungs that primes everything so that everything goes down [Music] smooth and quickly like so [Music] so do your gravity chunks to exercise the throat muscles always take that deep breath so that you can deflate the lungs and get this area ready to receive the liquid and those are the basics next time i'll teach you something else until then happy chugging and stay hungry and focus chugging the world one bottle at a time badly it's chugs is back", "PSDZ_h5XGAg": "Leila that felt like a catfish yeah that's a guy that's a big guy what is going on my name is rock with

spent quite a bit of money and a lot of time trying to figure out if I put some juicy smelly stuff on my soft plastic baits is that going to help those bass hang on to the lure longer or will they eat it better or will they be more attracted to come over to it and likely bite it as an overall answer I definitely think that adding scent and impregnated scent into soft plastic baits is a big advantage just because the actual scent of a soft plastic by itself smells like an old rubber tire it's been laying on the side of the road for a year now bats have a number of senses and because they don't have arms they often have other senses that that help them identify what's going on in the water and taste is one of those and although they don't have a huge taste variety like we do they're still able to pick up on those things and if you look back years ago you know twenty thirty years ago when soft plastics were first being used when there was no scent they used to drop those baits all the time and anglers would have to try to figure out a countdown system or set the hook right away and try to really figure that out whereas now we can really get those bats to hang on to it longer because scent is in the plastic what I actually think it boils down to scientifically is the taste of salt I think salt is always going to be the bread winner when it comes to sense and attractant just because blood has quite a bit of salt in it and it has that salty taste so animals living in the water column no matter what they are that have that saltiness in their blood fish are going to eat that and they're going to realize or feel like that is something that they need to hang on to because it has that familiar taste of the other thing they've been eating and I'm not sure which scent actually correlates with that saltiness the best I'm thinking it's probably garlic because it just has a really strong pungent kind of acidic taste to it but I think salt no matter what is going to be the overall winner no matter what since you put on there it's going to guarantee the fish are going to hang on to that longer than the actual plastic itself without any salt any scent because it just tastes better I mean come on hey do you like mysteries do you like boxes do you like tackle well you've come to the right spot hope you learn something on this tip in trick video and if you'd like to

it in canada i've got the box combo i got two of them i got two of these combos okay all right so you guys so this one here is the chicken tenders um looks very crispy i've also got their texas toast um looks very well toasted and i've also got their crinkle cut fries looks very well fried i've got coleslaw you guys were trolled me last time for not getting the massive sauce so i went and bought their massive sauce over here so that's a little close-up of the sauce and i've got a diet coke drop a like subscribe if you're new and let's get raising canes in my belly right now i was so close to put the straw in the sauce oh yes oh my god fountain diet coke is probably like the best thing ever all right so raising cain's rated r this is what people love to see hmm that is so good it's tender it's crispy but these chicken tenders have to get dipped like i don't know if i could eat this on its own i have to dip it oh that's buttery mmm soft buttery toasty i like a good old um uh coleslaw almost blanked out hmm all right so oh my god the first combos i'm almost done so funny i was buying this whereas when i was picked not buying it when i was picking it up from the window i've never bought these sauces before so i wasn't sure it's right so she's like giving me she's handing me this first um and then she has my other she has this one in her other hand and she's trying to give both i'm like oh i just ordered one drink she's like that's not the drink that's the sauce i was like oh that's a sauce damn that's huge so that's unreal that is unreal hmm the end is very tricky when you peel these things off because it could either splatter on you or it could go very well hmm hmm i'm gonna close this window and open that one i think it's kind of better i could sit down and just eat like a ton of these they're so good put some peanut butter on this or nutella so i think i should have bought a third combo third box look at the size there first this is the sauce they give you this is a sauce that you could order all right so there's always these people commenting on my videos like there's a guy yesterday that commented and i haven't gotten these comments in a very long time he's like you are a a [ __ ] and i i haven't gotten those comments in a while but i usually get them when i used to talk about my boxing stories right some people used to come and be like oh you always you always talk about how you got beat up you never talk about uh you beating people up you always talk about you you're getting beat up you probably always get beat up so funny because i will never you'll never hear me talk about me beating someone up first of all calling someone a [ __ ] is very mean and it's not nice and second i've beat up so many people in my life for boxing for competitions and stuff i'm not gonna go and i don't i'm not gonna brag to people and be like yeah i thought i bashed this guy's face oh i i did this to this guy did this i don't feel comfortable talking about me beating someone up but i feel fine talking about me getting beat up because it's myself i don't care talking about somebody else getting beat up is someone's son you know what i mean someone's brother someone's cousin it's not even though i'm not mentioning names it's still not like you know it's not i don't feel comfortable those guys i call you that call me posting the comments they wouldn't last 15 seconds on in the ring with me actually you know what i'm being too nice they wouldn't last 10 seconds in the ring with me 10 seconds max someone who brags about that stuff is a person who um got into a fight once in their life on the street after a club when they're all drunk and all that stuff and they go and brag to all their friends oh i beat this guy boys yes so yeah those guys i don't know it's not nice to call someone a [ __ ] there's this one time this guy walked into our boxing gym music you want to learn how to box and all this stuff right and he's like you know he's one of those like i'm so gangster thug life oh after clubs i grew in some guy looked at me i looked back at him and i punched him in the video smashed his face on the ground five out of one there were five of them one of me you know like one of those right so i went to my coach i'm like let me fight this guy and then he's like okay okay and then i walk away he looks at my coach looks i was like yeah yeah like he's like yeah because we don't like people like that like we don't like people who like act all tough and there's two different types of people there's two types of people that walk into a boxing gym there's the guys that are gangster like they think they're gangster they think they're thug life and strong and like they know how to fight and there's a second person who comes in humble uh wants to learn how to fight doesn't really brag you know he wants to just learn so those guys we never i'll uh i'll if i spar with them i'll go soft sparring with them i won't go really hard but usually people who go in like come in walking in like tough guy uh i'll go pretty hard i'll go maybe 75 percent so i'm sparring with this guy and he's like punching me and he doesn't have technique i know how street fighters fight and what to look for when a street fighter fights how they throw the punch i know exactly how they fight so he's throwing um he's throwing he's throwing and i'm letting him hit me i want him to build some confidence like yo like hit me it's fine like throw punches on my face it's fine like you i always let someone uh throw punches in my face so they feel confident to throw more so his budget is punching i'm like yo that's all you got like throw harder and then you keep trying to go harder and harder and i was like smiling the entire time like is this what this guy's talking about like oh he punched so many people and stuff i'm just standing there smiling as he's punching me in the face and after we fought um he walked out the gym very nice like very very nice like he was apologizing every time he bumped into someone by accident bbc he would say excuse me to people when he's walking through crazy how you could change someone in like 15 minutes but i don't like talking about stuff like that like i like to talk about my defeats i don't me i don't want to be that guy that talks about i beat up this guy i beat up like i imagine every mukbang you know this one time i beat this guy up it's not cool only losers talk like that this is kind of soft this meal i was i thought it was going to be a good amount but i was so hungry this one time my friend was punking me at the boxing gym you said you won't do anything you won't do anything you won't do anything i'm like okay let's part so um we i'm a boxer like i don't really i don't i don't do jiu-jitsu or muay thai and stuff i know a little bit of groundwork with jiu-jitsu and muay thai i'm okay with it well it's not my my first choice is always boxing so we're boxing and um as she's as soon as he threw punch i went under i went around them okay i went around them on the side i kicked his leg like on top of his calves like behind his knee so he bends his leg uh he dropped because he's taller than me he's a lot taller than me so there's no way i could have done i think the plan that i had i had no chance of doing it without kicking his legs so i kicked his legs he dropped bent it he didn't drop he just bent his legs i grabbed him from the neck i choked him i dropped i dropped him first then i choked him my rear neck and choked them and he tapped out and um he's like yo i don't think you would have done that i'm like were you testing me like what like what's wrong with you why would you do that and my coach was like kind of surprised how'd you do that i'd never taught you this where did you learn this but yeah like i don't i'm not going to talk about like that this is probably the only time you'll ever hear me talk about like stuff like that the one fighting style that everybody should know is jiu jitsu because you don't really get head trauma from jiu jitsu because there's no striking involved it's just all groundwork i know um asamar bro does jiu jitsu and um it's probably one of the best things because you could you could you could put someone down without hurting them in boxing you have to physically hit them you know what i mean there's striking involved so hmm oh you guys i hope you guys all enjoyed this oh that was nice that was absolutely delicious that was really good guys we'll catch you guys on to the next one we'll see you guys in a bit stay safe be well be nice to everyone no one needs to fight and we'll catch you guys on to the next one we'll see you guys in a bit peace", "pRcSJFdvdHc": "today you guys i'm eating

so excited for this this is so good oh oh my god i gotta be careful because i can make a mess here wow that's spicy wow you guys that's unreal that's unreal okay whoever invented this is a street genius so let's dip the quesadilla in here wow the cheese inside these style tacos well napkins do you imagine they forgot to give me napkins so this style taco is normally cooked um not the taco but

four tips for making perfect pasta every single time. I don't care what kind of pasta you're using,\nor what kind of sauce you're using, these are four tips that are universal and probably\nnumber three is my favorite, so stick around until the end. Also make sure you subscribe to my channel\nthat was as soon as my videos come out every Friday morning you get hooked up. Plus if you want to recommend what I make\nnext week leave a comment below. I'll pick my favorite one and I will totally\ngive you a shout out. Past perfection tip number one, salt this\npasta water so it tastes like the ocean. I swear I remember watching old school Molto\nMario and him saying this religiously. The reason for doing this is because this\nis your only chance to season the pasta. Pasta is bland, by seasoning the water with\nsalt you're going to season the pasta. Yep, reminds me of swallowing a big gulp of\nwater in the Atlantic ocean in Miami when I was a kid, so that's perfect. What you don't want to do is take oil and\nadd that to the water, because by adding oil to the water you're going to create an oil\nslick around the pasta noodle. Later on when I toss it with the sauce, the\nsauce won't really adhere to the noodle. Whatever you do keep the oil for later, just\nfill up your pot with a water. Pasta tip numero due, cook your pasta al dente. You hear that term all the time. What it literally means is to the tooth. You don't want to over cook your pasta, you\nactually want to under cook it for about 30 seconds. Then later on you can finish it in the sauce\nand let it finish cooking with that delicious ragu or whatever sauce you want. This is probably like the only time in the\nhistory of labels, read the label on the back of your pasta. This says eight minutes. They know what they're doing, they've been\ndoing this for hundreds of years, so I'm going to pull this after seven minutes and 30 seconds,\nand then we'll finish it in my sauce. Pasta tip number three is by far my favorite,\ntake a glass and just save some of this pasta cooking liquid. Check that out, this is culinary gold because\nit has that starch in there so later on when you sauce your pasta and it's kind of thick,\nor you want to stretch your sauce add some of the cooking liquid in there because it\nhas the starch. It's not going to thin out or water out your\nsauce. Always save some cooking liquid before you\nstrain it. Finally, pasta tip number four, the pasta\nand the sauce have to come together as one. This is a chance for the sauce and the pasta\nto really hang out and get to know each other. You know, how you doing, how you doing. Because we cooked the pasta al dente it will\nactually finish cooking in the sauce, which by the way this is my homemade marinara sauce. I have it in the freezer at all times. If you want to see how to make it and I strongly\nsuggest you do, check out this video and I will totally hook you up with the recipe. By doing this the flavor of the sauce is really\ngoing to infuse into the noodle. The only time you don't want to do this is\nif you're making like a pesto sauce. A pesto's meant to be raw, so you don't want\nto cook it. About 95% of the other times this is exactly\nhow you want to finish your pasta. Now let's say our pasta sauce is looking a\nlittle thick, this is where we reach for our secret weapon, our reserved cooking liquid. Just put a good splash or two in here and\njust like that, that loosens up our sauce, makes it nice and creamy, and nobody knows\nthat we used our secret weapon. I played up a big old portion for myself,\nleave a comment below and let me know your favorite pasta to make at home. To finish this pasta and make it look perty,\nI'm going to grab some fresh parsley and just hit it with some of that. Then my favorite ingredient in the world,\nextra virgin olive oil. A little drizzle my nizzle. Perfect. There it is guys, four tips for making pasta\nthat will seriously hook you up. Before I bite into this make sure you subscribe\nto my channel because I have new videos every Friday and you can get a notification as soon\nas they come out. The sauce and the pasta are together as one\nharmonious deliciousness, that's it guys. If you want to see some more awesome videos\nclick on the ones below me.

(electronic music) Good Mythical Morning. - Here at Mythical Enterprises LLC, we firmly believe that if we\ncan dream it, we can do it. And by do it, we literally mean reaching into our own private rip in the space time continuum and pulling out snacks\nfrom different layers of the multiverse. As far as we know, our travels in and out of alternate universes have not had any catastrophic effects\non our present timeline. And we maintain that the events of 2020 are completely unrelated to\nthis unregulated experiment. - Yeah, what he said. It's time for, Multiverse Munchies. It's true, we brought back all the snacks we're gonna sample today\nfrom alternate universes and our mission is to access each one and then to decide if it's\nfrom a delicious dimension or if it's a snack offension. - First up, now in our universe\nwe have Little Debbie's Oatmeal Creme Pies. You know them, you love them.\n- Look at this beautiful box. - So comforting. - I've never looked at this\nand found myself thinking, I want to go to another dimension, I bet it could be better. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we found another universe where they have Giant Deborah's Oatmeal Creme Pie. - Oh. In this universe, you do\nnot simply buy the snack and bring it in, you have to summon Giant Deborah in verse. Are you ready?\n- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - [Both] Giant Deborah, hear our call, you are big and we are small. We hunger for your oatmeal treat. Creme pie is all we want to eat. We pledge our loyalty for all you do. Giant Deborah, please come through. - Did someone summon Giant Deborah? (Rhett laughs) - Wow. - Deborah, you're so giant. - Yes, I am. I am the tallest one here by a long shot. - And your Oatmeal Creme Pie is freaking-- - [Rhett] Is this where\nI pull, right here? - Yep, right there. - Oh my goodness. Oh my gosh, do you-- (Rhett exclaims) - Here, take the packaging. - Look at that. - You're not gonna eat those. You're supposed to be loyal to me. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, forget that. - Yeah, you know what,\nyou can take them with you and I don't know if that\nwill screw anything up in your universe, but just feel free to-- - Giant Deborah is terrifying. - Look how pretty she is on the package. - [Link] A little chest\nhair goes a long way. - 61 years. - So in this universe, they're\nall terrified of Deborah and it's like a fascist panopticon. Is it hard? Oh, you gotta get through it. There you go, muscle through. - Yeah, I can do it. - Everybody worships Giant Deborah and cream is everywhere. Cream is infested in everything. Oh my gosh.\n- Take your half. - Look at that. - Look at that cross section, y'all. - [Link] That's large. - Now, you know, growing up, I would come over to your house and get your Little Debbie's. - Well, I had plenty to go around. I wasn't hiding my Little Debbie's. - And you shared so much. - I was a big Fudge Round guy. You could have all the\nOatmeal Creme Pies you wanted, just don't mess with my Fudge Rounds. - Should you just go in the middle? - I think we should just\ngo in the middle, yeah. - Dink it. - And sink it. - Wow, it's so creamy. - It tastes exactly the same. That cream-- - [Rhett] Look at that cream. - [Link] It's a magical-- - [Rhett] Look at that, oh man. - I mean, I'm not just being transported to another dimension. - That's dead on. - I'm being transported\nto my childhood, man. They did make and actually still do, you can get them at like grocery stores-- Gas stations, convenient stores. - Do I got anything on my face? - A little bit.\n- You too. - They make giant ones,\nwhich I thought were giant until I saw this. - They don't make them this size. - [Link] As big as a pizza. It's a little scary. - This is just a simple formula, when you got something that's good and it gets bigger and there's more of it, that's always a good thing, so Giant Deborah's Oatmeal Creme Pie. - [Both] Delicious Dimension. - In our universe, mozzarella sticks can't hurt you unless\nyou eat them too fast and stretchy mozzarella\ngets lodged in your throat and Fazoli's waitress has\nto administer the Heimlich in front of the entire restaurant, been there.\n- Oh yeah. - But we found another dimension where things are much more dangerous and they don't have mozzarella sticks, they have mozzarella stones. (plate thuds) - Whoa, okay. - They are hard. Oh, this plate's hard too. Hard? Hard? - I think I'm gonna exacerbate my TMJ if I really go for that. - Uh uh. I made a little progress. - That's why they come\nwith chisels. (laughs) Bring the cutting board over. - Okay. - Let me see if I can just get a little bit shaved off the side here. (Rhett banging) - [Link] I like this little mallet, that's fun.\n- There we go. There we go, now you get-- (Link banging) Oh! That is tasty. - [Link] Yeah? - [Rhett] It's strong. - [Link] I mean, this is\nlike a table side guac type situation. - Yeah. - Some miner comes to your table. - I love it. - And just like slices off cheese hunks. - Get a taste of it, man. It's better than a\nregular mozzarella stick. Also, you should know\nthat in this universe, you don't get kidney stones,\nyou get kidney sticks and that's even worse. (crew laughs) It's real bad. - Look at that, I could do this all night. From table to table,\ngetting tips, you know? - You're not really in to the eating part, you're in to the sculpting part. - Yeah. - This is consistent\nwith your personality. - I mean, and no one seems to be scared? - Yeah, you can't hurt somebody too bad with a chisel, because it's directed in a very specific place. I mean, I'd have to get my hand-- - I mean, I can miss. - You could hurt yourself\nand nobody cares about that. I think these are great. - [Link] I think it's fun. - Link's having a great time, so we're saying mozzarella stones. - [Both] Delicious dimension. - Before we get to this next\nstrange dimensional item, we are pleased to introduce the last quarterly\ncollectable item of 2020 for the Mythical Society, it's these one of a kind-- Well, I mean, I guess everyone\ngets one who gets one, it's not just one of a kind. Rhett and Link bobble heads\nwhich are only available to the Mythical Society\nthird degree members and you can join the third degree monthly by October 31st or the third\ndegree quarterly or annual by December 31st to qualify. - [Rhett] Yes, yes, yes. - Go to mythicalsociety.com for details. I mean, these things are nicely made, man. We're sitting behind the desk. We're nodding in agreement, constantly. - As you can see the cutouts here, this box itself can be transformed into the set that you\nsee behind us right now. And then you can put us on the set, man. It's cool, man, you can put us on the set. - It's us. - They done talk, but if they\ndid, they'd talk like this. - It's us. It's us, get it, mythicalsociety.com. - Okay, now everybody\nknows in our universe, we got the fast food chain, White Castle, their very clear about what they offer, delicious sliders and explosive diarrhea, they go hand in hand. But in another slightly\ndifferent universe, what you see is not exactly what you get, because they have Off White Castle. - So everything that you would expect to experience at White Castle is just a little bit different. - [Rhett] Come on, baby. - So the buns are entirely white. You can't get them out? - I'm being careful with it. Here's you one. - Oh my gosh. I mean, it looks like they\nspray paint their buns white, but maybe it's-- - Maybe they don't, maybe\nthat's not what it is. Maybe it's just a little bit white. - And then underneath,\nyou've got not pickles but you've got pickled parsnips, which are a off white vegetable. - But there's still onions. - Yeah, and you've got\nkind of an off beef patty, which I think is what I call pork. - And instead of ketchup,\nthey've got just basically it's just creamed potatoes\nmade into a sauce. So if you wanna make\nyours a little bit saucy, you're gonna have to figure\nout a way to do that, because I don't have\nanything to put it on with. - I'll just do that. - Just dip? Just dip, you dip, we dip. - I mean it looks crazy and off. - Let's try it. It's not that it's bad. - It's just that it's off. - [Rhett] It's a little bit off. - Through and through off. In the universe, Harold\nand Kumar are both played by Tilda Swinton. - Right. You know, that makes sense. (crew laughs) And \"50 Shades of Gray\" is a cookbook. - Now this, my friends, is a struggle. - Like I said, it's not horrible, but it's not as good as White Castle. - The more I eat it, the\nmore horrible it gets. - Okay, I think the answer's pretty clear, Off White Castle. - [Both] Snack Offension. - I don't know if you've noticed, Rhett, but a shift has taken place right here on Good Mythical Morning. And I think I'm okay with it. - Oh, shifting. - Frosted Mini Wheats has been dethroned as my favorite cereal\nby Raisin Bran Crunch. Which has led me to other dimensions in search of an alternate. And I found one. There is a dimension full of geniuses whose brains are as big as cooked turkeys, and to keep them sharp, they don't eat Raisin Bran Crunch, they eat Raisin Brain Crunch. - [Rhett] Yum. - Yeah, this is great because\nthey kept the raisins, they removed the bran and replaced it with crunchy pieces of brain. - Yum, I'm still hungry. - I mean, the package looks great. I mean, it's even got a maze on the back. Yes, there is real dehydrated\ncrunchy brain pieces in this thing. - So in this universe, you get smarter by consuming more brains,\nmakes sense to me. - That's been your thesis\nsince the beginning. - Yeah, I've been saying that for years. - You wanna pour the brain? - Oh gosh, the smell coming out of that. Oh, there's a maze on the back. (crew laughs) - Where was your brain when I said there was a maze in the back? - I was thinking about how nasty it-- Oh gosh, look, there's\nmore than two scoops of brains in there, I'll\ntell you that right now. I mean, that is some serious-- It's like all brains. - So dehydrated sheep brain. And hydrated sheep milk. - Still kind of your thing even when you visit this universe. Well, we're not really\nvisiting the universe. - How much do you want, I\nmean I really don't know. - That's plenty, it doesn't matter, it's not gonna affect anything, it's gonna taste like\ntrash no matter what I do is my assumption. But you know what, I\nshould keep an open mind. - Speaking of minds, the\nthing I love about this is-- - The maze on the back? - No, on the side, they\nsupport neurologists to get brains responsibly and sustainably. Learn more at the internet. (crew laughs) - At the internet, yeah, yeah. They've still got the\ninternet at this place. - [Link] It looks like\nterraformed walnuts. - Okay, that's an interesting description. - Like the whole thing,\ndoesn't it look like walnuts? - Well, if that makes you feel better. My brain won't go there though. Okay. It seems all I can do is\njust get brains, and so-- - At least it's not juicy. - Trying to get some milk\nin there, here we go. Dink it. - [Both] And sink it. (Link wretches) - Think about terraformed walnuts. (Link coughs) It tastes like a pet store smells. - It crunches like a walnut. And you're exactly right. The raisins help. - It's really awful. I don't think that brain milk's\ngoing to help you at all. (Link exclaims) - I don't wanna go to another dimension. - I think I'd just be real\ndumb in this dimension. - I got it. But I'm afraid that I've\nruined my favorite cereal in the process. Oh gosh, you still don't have it down? I think you're getting smarter. - Got it. - Look, you're smarter. Look at him, he's smarter. - You can see it? You can see it on my face? - Okay. - That was unnecessary, I mean ultimately, the more you think about it, the more unnecessary it\nseems, don't think about it. - [Link] Raisin Brain Crunch is a - [Both] Snack Offension. - Thank you for subscribing\nand clicking that bell. - Do you want some? You can get it on the internet. - You would not want to\nsmell my breath right now. - You know what time it is. - Hi, I'm Bea from Brazil, and it's time to spin\nthe Wheel of Mythicality. - Brazil. - Was that some embroidery, crochet, I don't know the proper term\nat the beginning of that? What's the proper term, do you know? - I think it was just a Brazilian. (Rhett laughs) - Okay, click the top link to watch us-- - Oh, I missed it. - Yeah, you weren't looking\nin the very beginning. - It's a crochet. - Crochet. - Click the top link to watch us smell food scented nail\npolish in this dimension in Good Mythical More. - And to find out where\nthe Wheel of Mythicality's gonna land.

And all that hot sauce too? It\u2019s surprising she didn\u2019t burst into\nflames after taking the first sip! So, what\u2019s in the good cocktail? Nothing like a cold, refreshing coke! Quick! Someone call the fire department \u2014 Hannah\nneeds to be hosed down! I hope you\u2019re giving her some cool air and\nnot adding fuel to the fire. Is it just me or does Hannah look totally\ngorgeous right now? Well, this is how the models do it, isn\u2019t\nit? Hey, your mouth may be on fire but why not\nmake the most of it!

Mmm! This is just some ice cold milk! This is not a fun decision to make. Especially \u2018cuz the drinks are full of canned\nfish! Those things are so slimy! And they smell even worse! You\u2019re not really gonna make Hannah drink\nthis stuff, are you? No amount of water\u2019s gonna make this better,\nAlice. We can barely keep our stomachs from turning\njust from looking at that!

So, Hannah, how does your cocktail taste? Quick! Somebody get this girl a pail! Oh no, not my wallet! Ew! I feel much better now, thanks. Ooh, that\u2019s bad. Just zip it up and throw it away, okay?

Looks like Claire got stuck with the bad cocktail\nyet again! In case you were wondering, this drink had\nsome raw egg in it. Think shaking the eggs up like this will turn\nthem into scrambled ones? Ew! They look so runny. The good drink, however, is a lot less disgusting. And that splash of milk makes it super creamy! What on earth is in my mouth?

And of course, it\u2019s shaken up so it\u2019s\nnice and cold. And the good cocktail is simply some delicious\nberry juice! Oh no, Claire looks like she\u2019s gonna be\nsick! Phew, I swallowed it.

looking more into streams and how they work if you have a good understanding streams we kind of got the concept as to how they work then this video may not be for you but we're just going to kinda go into a bit of the background of how streams come about on different types of streams this is more a unique some note best for the background as opposed to being specifically or uncle so let's go in and start with where the shrooms come from so streams come from Unix so they've been around a long time I remember when I was a university was doing a lot of a stream work I think it was in C was doing a lot in C when it came to streams sending like audio down a certain stream and whatnot so yeah they've been around a long time that they're implemented within UNIX shells by using their sent pipes so what they said classrooms will streams better just allow it you pass like a certain tear through like think of it as a pipe like a wall pipe and you can pass you sort things through there but there's different types of pipes so it's just like readable writable and ones will go back and forth so once there is passed like a modified there will then be passed to another function that's the can house rooms works so the could be function at the start of a stream at the end of a stream streams are asynchronous or interactive to separate different things at the same time such as like a networking dish Drive requires you to use callback functions callback functions if you're into jQuery there's tons and tons and tons in their primal well primarily yeah there's a lot in JavaScript but mostly I come across them in jQuery and I sent a fit of a jQuery ma when it comes to taking shortcuts I guess so a shrooms helpful well we need them in gulp because that's what the gulp such Liam built around so streams help is basically separate tasks as you probably have seen in the previous videos but they can also like restrict the Clementi ocean surface area solar into a consistent interface that can be reused so streams are helpful but they can kind of restrict a few things if you don't understand how streams work such as which are able which are not you could plug the output of one stream into notice I think of it as a pipe where a pipe may emerge into another which may be a higher flowing stream more control in that particular stream and five different types of streams readable rivals transform duplex and classic how do pipes plane to all of this well got a nice picture of pipes there which is pretty cool all different types of streams use pipe as we have seen in the golf tutorials to pair inputs with outputs such as like gulp sauce and gulp destination so we're kind of given it the start and the finish so pipe is simply function that takes a readable source stream which is a source and links of that particular output to a destination so it's just a distribution which German just mentioned you can chain together pipes which we kind of have in this area here but you can tune together pipes like a1 dot notation pipe to then pipe three pipe flow and so on so readable streams readable streams basically just produced there that is passed to a writable transform or duplicate stream by Colin pipe pretty much everything's done by Colin pipe especially Wingull here's an example here we have a readable a rifle and a writable free Calgary so we have this like pipeline we are reading from the sauce doing a transform on the read unrideable and then we get to the destination through these three particular pipes now we have writable streams a Red Bull stream is better just a stream that can pipe to but not from so we could write something but we cannot you know go back into that particular pipe if that makes sense so an example here source top pipe right to our stream but cannot you know go back to that particular pipe transform streams so these are set on top of duplex stream that basically give you the ability to both read and write which is incredibly useful the only differences at transport streams outputs calculate from the input so whatever we put in the read stream which is here which is a pipe we could go into the transform stream and then we have another transformed stream and then we write to the stream but all this is dependent on the input so all duplex streams do plate streams are both readable and writeable therefore both ends off the stream engage into in interaction sending my messages back and forth so you could use some sort of messaging application to do this in nodejs an example as a telephone example actual air pipe to be then piped back to air so in piping back-and-forth you doing read and write up all the options so if you're probably seen this before you're probably dealing with a to play stream here's a little nice diagram how we're reading in and reading out you could actually do this with just like notifications to get like some awareness of what's going on within your application classic streams these are basically emitters that I met their events their events we may have seen this when you use something like I think it's this don't end in gulp or maybe you can wrap it around your error handler so you can do like on error this dined or this dot on the end I think it may be some it's along those lines in terms of notation and so yeah these are amazed that I made their events their event like could have met an end event which would end the processing of the data pipe checks whether a classic stream is readable by checking like the input of the stream that is coming through from readable so classic hribal streams are very simple we can just define them with like write both and end and destroy so if cope use extreme what does grunt choose well grunt doesn't use streams used as a method of taking like a task file runs a particular task fault and it saves that new dear so it's always reading and writing new data to the file system so the way it works is slow and does a lot of reading and writing so yeah that's kind of a brief overlook or a more in-depth look into streams I'm gonna leave a link in the description which is down here so you can go more reading dizzy well there is a great link and handbook on github which you can go ahead and read more remember to like this video subscribe and if you have any questions comment below I'll just tweet me uncle hotwing and yeah hopefully self all and i shall see in the next video peace", "G7i6fSCrmhA": "[Music] right [Music] finally  up [Music] this feels like a pretty good [Music] [Music] real nice cat what a beautiful fish awesome channel catfish it's a nice big male fish got it on the triple-s channel cap date the blood formula we let this guy go that's my first fish but that's a great fish let's keep going yes oh that was awesome how's my first catfish of the year actually second but first real good size one we're just fishing up along the rocks along the train tracks up on Poole six been getting some really good hits but haven't been able to hook up and it finally hooked up on one let's get after them and do it again just using these dip worms they come rigged with a treble hook not real super excited about the size of that treble hook I were to do it myself which I think I will for later trips I'll put a little bit bigger hook on there but they come rigged with line right through it and a loop at the end so what you do is you put the loop through your swivel eye and then put the swivel back through the loop just like that then pull it tight end up with that and I'm running a three-quarter ounce bell sinker and then a bead to protect the the knot and then I'll tell you the other end of the swivel on to the mainline use a Palomar knot and that's your setup right there first time the worm goes in the dip beat you don't need to dry it it's nice and dry but after it's been in the water you want to make sure you dry it off before you rebate because the bait won't stick otherwise so I always bring a lot of paper towels they're nice for cleanup too I just put the worm right in the bait and use like a like a paint stick or or just a stick you might have laying around and I push the worm right down in I just bury it right in there make sure the the bait is packed around it and then I just slowly pull it pull it out you can kind of knock off some of the excess but that's what you end up with right there that'll that'll last for a while 15 minutes or so and then then you want to clean it off and put some more bait on or move to a different spot that one chewed my thumb up a little bit it's alright it's a sign of a good day this one I got rigged up similar quite a bit heavier weight three ounce which is probably a little bit of an overkill bead swivel a lead line then I'm using a circle hook on this one and then just putting that worm right on that circle hook since this one was in the water and dry it off real good this certainly is not a clean way to fish so it's important to bring a lot of paper towels with dip that down in there work the bait into the end of the plastic like so and we're ready to kiss and if you have rod holders use them that last fish almost pulled my rod right in I have rod holders but they're not rigged up yet no we wait well guys I'm on my last spot of the evening got the one real good fish missed a couple others but I don't have real good lighting for night fishing tonight so I'm gonna have to call it let's stick with me for day two we're gonna get some cats [Music] the right guy song back Allwood after fishing yesterday and touching that real nice catfish made a few changes just after what I learned yesterday I got rod holders now so that's good I just basically just bolted those on kind of temporary positions but I think it'll be better than not having a rod holder I also kind of changed my my rigging so I'm going with the 2 ounce pyramid sinker and the bead and the swivel just like yesterday but I'm shortening up my my leader a little bit that'll keep the bait from from moving around so much and then I switched I downsized the hook or upsized it in the case of the treble hook I was using I changed the hook to a number or it's a 5 OTT octopus circle hook and then I'm just putting that that rubber worm on there and the rubber worm I'm using is actually this isn't a catfish bait this is a bass lure it's actually a product by late Fork trophy lures it's a big bass worm but I cut those in half they have really nice ribs on them and they hold the bait pretty well they do come a little bit oily so it's good to wipe the oil off so the bait sticks better these work just as well as the catfish worms that's the basic setup we're going to be using today and let's see if we can get a cat or two these circle hooks you kind of want to let the fish hook themselves oh yeah we're on like a nice fish good start to the day execute a cat be a good eater well beautiful fish that didn't take five minutes let's get some more oof-dah he was talking to me this might be your best friend out here went fishing with this dippy so make sure you have one of these but in this spot for about 20 minutes or so and got that first fish right away and I've been getting little taps here and there what that is is that smaller fish just pulling go on the dip bait off my cuff my worm I think typically a good rule of thumb is twenty to thirty minutes and then head to your next spot you have enough time in the day you can go back to a spot and see if you can get another fish but we're gonna keep moving and let's try and stay on some active fish I think the biggest fish are most active and they're gonna be the first ones to bite so let's move to the next spot down at spot number two basically just slid down the rocks here maybe 75 yards it's gotten a little bit deeper in 13 feet where we were in eight before that eight to nine foot range is where we got our fish last night too so maybe that's kind of the magic depth to key in on we'll see how this goes at two ounce sinker is just perfect tonight it's not too heavy it's not so light where to get a few weeds on your line it's not pulling that sinker up off the bottom Oh guys spot number two is slow really slow few small bumps but my head on the spot all right guys we're at spot number three today this is where we caught the nice one yesterday it just looks really good here we got a fun bunch of snags down there the bottom comes up a little bit and we got kind of a flat there so we're gonna get our baits out there and see if we can pick up a fish into here there we go it was on there we beat it back up and try it again and we're on giant feels pretty good it's a smaller fish but he's definitely a catfish it's the right species he is fat go fat that thing you completely ate my worm the belly on that thing nice looking fish his channel kit he completely ate that thing Wow you have to do some surgery on this guy hey there we go catfish number two giant put a fun fish to catch we'll get that guy back well I think that's gonna do it for spot number three we got some good action here we actually got some really good bites this one fish and caught another I think it's time to move on to the next spot we this is the lucky spot because we're running out of daylight here that may be a half an hour so efficient time enough I might try one or two more spots got real nice deep Bank here a bunch of timber down in the water flow is just about perfect currently we're in 16 feet so it's a little deeper than what we've been fishing just gonna kind of try a bunch of different stuff and see what what happens really haven't done much catfishing as of recent so I'm still trying to kind of figure out what they want and where they're hanging out [Music] that did not take long we're hooked up goes to show you that you do not need to fish long in a spot and find out a fish fish there there's like a pretty good fish oh yeah good cat [Music] [Music] [Music] all right guys your third fish of the day just an absolute beauty oh that was fun just got set up in her spot here and they he just stirred hammer and within five minutes take long at all [Music] and I sure do love catfish and that is just a blast those are odds they're just sitting still and then all of a sudden it's just boom boom grab it and the fight is on it's been a while since I did some real good catfishing and and I sure do miss it off to do more of it I hope some of you guys out there watching our catfish and lovers because I sure do enjoy it I really like fishing for everything as long as as long as it tucks creates that excitement of the bite and the fight I don't care what it is but catfish man they sure do battle such a blast I think we learned something there that they aren't just shallow that one was 16 feet where the first couple fish were only in the eighth and nine feet so you really just got to keep moving and stay on some active fish well we got deeper water and a lot of timber which is always a good recipe for catfish well guys that rainstorm it's got enough lightning in it where I don't want to be on the water I think I'm gonna get out of here a great night got some really nice catfish I hope you guys learned something tonight and I hope you enjoyed the video thanks for watching [Music] you", "eYyeMv0ECNo": "hello everyone

Today's short video blog is going to answer the question\" how do you teach a child with autism to take medication?\" As you probably know I'm a behavior analyst and a mom to two adult sons, one with autism. Some of you may not know that I've also been a registered nurse for over three decades and feel that my nursing background has been extremely helpful in working within the autism field. Because of my background and experience, I feel qualified to answer questions about medication administration and the unique issues parents and staff members often face when working with children and clients with autism. When Lucas was a baby, we could put liquid medicines such as infant ibuprofen directly into his mouth but as Lucas got older the volumes of liquid ibuprofen for instance required for his larger size became a lot more difficult. Also many medications weren't available in liquids. Shortly after Lucas's diagnosis at the age of three, what we would do is we would crush up the vitamins and supplements and any prescription medications, dump them into applesauce and spoon feed one spoonful of the concoction, followed usually by an edible reinforcement. Then another spoonful of the crushed up vitamins and supplements and applesauce, followed by another edible reinforcement. And at times, the concoction was okay, but many times it was nasty and Lucas became resistant and exhibited problem behaviors some time around medication administration. I asked another BCBA to watch me give Lucas's vitamins and medicines when he was around five years of age and as I was looking for ideas on how to have Lucas take his medicines without problem behaviors. She basically told me that crushing the pills made the concotions smell, and probably taste, really bad and that the only way to make it better with the teach Lucas to swallow pills. Some parents mix everything into juice, which I couldn't do because Lucas never liked juice and it was impossible to disguise the taste in just water. I also saw over the years as a BCBA that giving medications in juice was not the answer either since it may take the child a long time to finish that cup thus affecting the time of the dose plus the meds usually settled at the bottom of the cup and many times especially if the meds weren't juice the parent really couldn't be sure of how much of the medication the child actually ingested. Trying to disguise medicine, put in food or drinks, is not a great solution especially because many of our kids are very picky eaters so this makes the problem even worse and crushing pills in food and drinks is not a good long-term solution since there are some medicines such as omega-3s that are really nasty tasting and gross and there are some meds that are in time capsules that can't be crushed. So over the years I've attended a few lectures on pill swallowing and learned how to teach this skill using systematic desensitization procedures and stimulus fading of more difficult demands or in this case using stimulus fading involved gradually making the pill size larger as well as using the ABA principles of modeling and of course reinforcement. Coupled with my nursing background, I have been successful with teaching kids with autism to swallow pills, including Lucas. I got Lucas to start swallowing pills when he was on prednisone for 21 days to treat a flare-up of his autoimmune disorder. Lucas was 14 at the time this medication was prescribed, and in hindsight, I should have taught Lucas to swallow pills a lot sooner. When the doctor prescribed prednisone, he said that the prednisone pill was particularly bitter tasting. The doctor warned me that if I crushed it up it would be just disgusting, and he was afraid that Lukas would not take it. Because I told the doctor I was giving Lucas other things crushed in applesauce he advised me to just dunk the small little prednisone pill, it was really little, into applesauce without Lucas seeing me do it at first and then just give him the applesauce with the pill already hidden in it and actually the prednisone pill was so little that it just slid right down without Lucas even noticing. Since Lucas was used to taking applesauce, we started to systematically increase the size of the pills that we dumped in applesauce. Also, we started showing him that we were dunking pills and that it was actually medicine time, not hiding pills. And we always followed each bite and each administration with reinforcements. Now Lucas can take large capsules, but he only still takes them an applesauce. But if your child is okay with swallowing a gulp of water from an open cup, that's where I'd start. Then, I would systematically, like the lectures I've seen, start with very small pieces of things, like a piece of rice or the smallest little bean you can find, or something like an orzo pasta. Some people recommend starting with a tic-tac or other candy but that's probably not a good idea because it has a taste to it and you don't want the child chewing on candy or experiencing any taste. That's why using beans, rice, or pasta and then systematically increasing the size of it with strong reinforcement is the way to go. For some kids, you can model directly like \"watch mom take a big gulp of water\" and we both have cups, I take a big gulp, the child takes a big gulp. Then have the child imitate \"watch mom put for a piece rice on my tongue,\" gulp water. The child might be able to imitate put the piece of rice on, gulp of water, for reinforcement. If the direct modeling doesn't work, you can also consider video modeling, where you record the same action that you want the child to imitate. Sometimes watching it on a screen is helpful to some kids. If like Lucas you're more eager to try the applesauce method, get the applesauce \ndunk something small like the orzo pasta or the piece of rice and give the spoon of apple sauce to your child and reinforce. And after each successful step or larger item is successful, systematically then start showing your child that you are dunking the medicine and that you're giving him medicine. Once they have three trials, for example they're able to swallow the rice, then I would go up to a very small orzo pasta, three trials and then to a small bean. Of course, you've got to give the child major reinforcement for each of these steps. Once your child can swallow pills then it might be time to have the child, teen, or adult to learn to be independent with taking medicine from pre poured containers and or responding to timers or visual schedules to take the correct medicine at the prescribed time. Many of our kids require lifetime supervision in terms of medication administration, but many children can learn to be much more independent with medicines. These are some proven ABA strategies to try to improve your child or client's acceptance of medication. If your child has any serious medical issues, swallowing difficulties, or problem behavior surrounding medication administration, he or she will need a thorough assessment and individualized programming to treat these issues.

Kent W I don't want to say his last name and I'll have permission to say his last name but he said Ken get your ass over to 7-eleven and try their pizza and I I've always known that they've had hot dogs and those little roll things I had no idea that had a whole pizza that they cooked for you in about three minutes it wasn't frozen it was probably in a fridge in the back she didn't have any up in the front and I didn't know they had like a little pizza oven in there she just threw it in there press the button popped out she cut it up and she's like oh do you want to slice our whole pizza I'm like let's go hold pizza and then I can share it with some people but yeah so all I came to I think I was 8 bucks or something and it's not broken down unfortunately bought the pizza and the coke so I think the pizzas eight dollars and then the cokes probably like 2 bucks to $9 and all my way out she's like Oh which like a sauce with that and I'm thinking do you charge for the sauces but she just I said what kind of sauces you have and she rhymed off a few sauces and I said no that's cool ranch so she gave me a wrench and then I was waiting for her to say well that's 50 cents a piece or something but she didn't say it so either she's just being nice and gave me the sauces for free or they don't charge for the sauces nice way to go 7-eleven so this is the first time ever having a 7-eleven Pizza wow this is gonna be awesome let me know in the comments below if you want to see more 7-eleven reviews and again email me a kendama cut gmail.com and I'll put you into like a queue of the things I want to do and the things oh and the lady in there there's two girls and I said how is it and she says it's better than Little Caesars I'm like wow she said little she just crushed it's good but this blows away Little Caesars Pizza I can't believe that and I don't need a tray today because we have this built-in tray my problem is I need my coke nearby gotta have a coke oh yes hot summer nights baby hot summer nights all right let's get right into I am freakin starving I just don't know because this box is so big I don't know where I put the coke show the logo well that was not real logo on that side oh there it is they put it away over here now while they're doing the whole name tag things alright oh boy oh boy so I'm glad I got to see her make it right there in front of me I wanted to get the nicest piece to show you it's a very soft crush she didn't cut it very well she tried it's just that it's stuck and I don't want to pull off toppings don't pull out the dog bag very soft Pizza kinda reminds me a little bit of I guess Pizza Hut without the greasy bottom but let's give it a shot people check it out you can scratch it you can sniff it and I bet the rust is gonna be mine mmm-hmm Joey not bad only one for a couple more bites [Music] I'm trying to remember what make speech like this I'm thinking it's like to list deliciou or whatever it's like that frozen pizza whoops if you don't put the long enough comes out the same once you open up the oven and I kind of leaned over to look and she says on all right I don't know my number hot pizza here before you gotta tell me if it's all right so it's almost like I'm eating crazy bread from Little Caesars but made out into a pizza because the dough is so doughy I know I know some of you guys prefer like a thin crust that's crunchy err but this is definitely a doughy or bread style of pizza the marinara sauce pizza sauce perfectly fine and tangy the cheese is pretty good I'd say they need to put more cheese on it cuz it doesn't look like there's a whole lot of cheese on there you'd be the judge I can only describe what I'm seeing but you guys can check it out too the pepperoni is nice and savory mmm for eight bucks hmm I could do a comparison between this and the five-dollar pizza not Little Caesars this looks around the same size maybe it's a bit bigger but I'm going to show you the next piece hmm I forgot I'll make sure I use this on the next one I'm very old-school when it comes to pizza and using dipping sauce with something that started happening I don't know in that early 2000s maybe mid 2000 all right number of some when you got your pizza pizza pizza or wherever there like a little stack of sauces that they charge you 50 cents for it like when did everybody start using sauces on their pizza I mean you buy a pizza and that's it the dipping sauce okay now let me let me know in the comments below is that enough cheese I don't think it is I think they need to step up their cheese cuz usually when you pull it you want to have that big cheese pull when you get the piece that's not one you know there's a lot of cheese I wouldn't mind ordering it again and ask him to cook it longer see if it would uh stay soft and bready like this or would it crisp up again let me know if you've ordered pizza from here okay here we go in for the the ranch hmm and it's cool I'm not knocking the sauces just up my whole life when you order a pizza order pizza and you pop or your beer and that's it and get the sauces I like it let's start a discussion in the comment section below which is just favorite sauce for your pizza crust and you dip your pizza or just the crust at the end let's get a good discussing one Wow a Porsche this rip bike nice sounding Porsche two two motorcycles well ladies and gentlemen that was fun I'm gonna probably have one more slice before I leave this parking lot but I'm at a 7-eleven here in Bradford I've got to tell you that at the beginning that used to be in old McDonald's the new McDonald's is at the other end of town well this is where the McDonald's was for many many many years and they even have the drive-thru still there but they put planters in the way to stop people from trying to drive through again alright ladies and gentlemen all my ring scale I'm gonna have to give the 7-eleven large pepperoni pizza a would recommend excuse me Wow pizza and pop burp every time sometimes twice apparently like I said it's a would recommend if you live near our 7-eleven and you'll want to try a new type of pizza or just a different style of pizza than some of the big pizza chains just zip into 7-eleven it only costs eight bucks and then you can get all your other stuff there now you go to a pizza place you just got pizza and pop you go to 7-eleven you can get your pizza any kind of pop you want cuz it's a convenience store and then get your ice cream for after ever you want so 7-eleven you got a good thing going here with the pizza I will probably order pizza here again and if there's any students out there who go to school in the area what a great lunch man you can split that with three people hate pucks no

world and the last one to eat instead thousand pounds that's a lot of money and now it's time to introduce the contestants my name is Dmytro and I play for Toronto Raptors confident you know I'm gonna use my skills and absolutely we're going to play mafia what's that just play the video welcome to mafia six players six cards two for the Mafia's four for the civilians the cards are picked at random by all players the Mafia share their identity with each other of the others close the eyes and are left in the dark all players open their eyes and the game is on the civilians job is to find both the mafias and get them out they need to work together in catching these two and not letting them take over only problem is they don't know what card everyone else has the Mafia's job is to get all the civilians to turn on each other and eventually vote each other out making them the only remaining players at the end of every round one person will be voted out and punished by taking a bike from the world famous ghost chili pepper we'll then reveal that card showing the rest of the play whether they made the right choice or not the game ends when either both mafias are caught or all civilians are outnumbered and voted out let the game commence many names but you call me Philip or Roger whatever the school's haven't got written down well who's the youngest I was either young ones I always get what I want but our six cards if you guys don't know the rules for this week is the two people I pull out the jacks are the Mafia and the normal cars are civilians I'm gonna go to console floor everyone take your card so you can spread it out there you go take part make sure no one sees and then put them like somewhere comfortably behind you everyone now close your eyes [Music] [Applause] [Applause] I'm actually I'm a civilian I don't [ __ ] be able to deal with the pressures of being mafia so soon into the mafia series I want to stay civilian for the first few weeks this is music to my ears snicker this is music to my ears I can't wait till you find out uh civilian I mean if he's mafia then obviously knows officer video maybe civilian and he's so sharp ciliate then I can't wait til he finds out listen I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing yeah I'm just pretending that I know who it is because these guys have like a dog mentality so if I just say yo it's this person they're not going to come for me I have I don't know who it is but I just don't want to eat a ghost chili I feel I'm trying to read you right now and I feel like you are hesitating it's all just what we shock you because he's feeling a little bit I don't have a big theory right now but first impressions to me a shock I just want to keep safe that's all I want as long as I'm not eating that chili I'm fine so I'm just acting like I know I'm talking about what why is it shocking because they were though saying now I watched the last episode right now and I saw that came yesterday was a stupid idiot in the last episode so I had a gopher was easy opening their eyes I heard he's crazy he's crazy I had good Johnny's weird Tony's are really weird I don't understand that kid and I've got suspicious about him of all deep suspicions our bodies to video I should've be thinking about the last game I just feel like it was like to be honest um yeah I want to take the back seat so after but for [Music] why one because he was talking a lot so I feel like he was trying to manipulate the whole thing again so even on the Mafia your life was good just to just to get him out use as an excuse to care now because you know how he was in the last game Kenny we're from here for no reason so here when it comes out on [Music] Sharky's reason there's donkey the reason I keep asking the rules even off-camera asking the ones that mean come early nervous I don't need a ghost pepper some keep refreshing myself innocence innocence why are you innocent listen replay that clip right now alright listen the bit waste he tried to see civilian and he said sir that's that's not English see listen even though I'm mafia that what he's saying I'm the deuteron and all these stuff lies yeah I know the whole game he's been bugging out liar Sonny AJ oh oh this is an even worse start to you know Johnny enjoy I've made my decision I am pretty split on these two people listen I don't think it's are these guys but I just I would really enjoy watching AJ oh yeah I didn't want this to happen why is AJ eating a whole ghost chili papa I was almost in tears what are you talking about I would really enjoy watching a je a ghost chili shut up okay shut up yeah I'm all for peace and love but why are you coming for me that's not very peaceful of you I told you guys I said it I don't think I do mafia if I still need to figure out who the two mafias own because the longer this game goes one of my civilian brothers is out on Avenger AJ my brother tiny awesome I need a partner civilian family this Thai place a lighted up KP ugh and because you're short and the old one I'm gonna plate the whole thing last time so about time you got a payback AJ's out yeah good cause yet his eyes on me and that was one less person on me I mean chunks and nickel then things are not the whole thing I think is me but still with Sharky in there and Sharky is very persuasive person I'm afraid everyone else they conspired against me I know this is what they done they know I won the last one that it came from you in this one my plan was to direct everyone to Johnny and then bring out the Mafia's which happened Nikko's one of them right so I was right the whole time so I was right that's what it was I knew that see the conspiring against me none of these idiots wanted to listen I said it was Johnny from the start listen just leave me alone I'm off yeah see you got the next mafia just everyone again I really couldn't care less I wanted him out okay him and only that my only people that could potentially get me up but one of them is out I don't want more to go always pick the weak fun [Music] around I don't even need five minutes I just want to say is Kenny from the get-go you cooked and because of a god yes you I could not wait let me tell you a little something about the gold food right so I was just closing my eyes and I hear Kenny go after the Matthews have already opened their eyes that just means this guy's composing himself now yes it's just a theory it's the only thing I'm sure of in this game the only thing and if it turns out right then I guess hammer genius yeah you may people will talk about it for years and years it's actually been proven by Harry o Messalina which is actually the Italian government system of 2006 - so he's in the future yes he knows what he's talking about the gold theory is a very good theory because I mean I still have my people I'm feeling nervous I don't know what to think because low key there aren't something Johnny laughs like I got this in the bag and I'm gonna lick Oh Kenya sha Qian Johnny who you think the Mafia who's the Mafia say he went from being almost go to them my vote is with Kenny I have no idea what I'm doing this is all alike I'm just acting like it so they don't suspect me and it's working it's working I'm gonna do this every week I love it I feel like I'm really long gone so I'll be able to read him so Kenny is coming for me for no reason he just loves saying my name we play a lot of games of mafia off-camera and always vote for me as well so I know he just loves to target me and I'm really I don't think I was gonna follow the Batman I love Kenny cuz he's an idiot I can't even fit for himself so yeah I'm worried about I still think it's Johnny but I do also think one of Nicole and chunks might be mafia I don't think it's both of them I think it's one of them I think a senior player is definitely more for only senior players ken is not a senior player okay it's been two videos Nicko chunks me age anywhere to see any players and I think what I'm taking from our field I'm sticking with Johnny because intuition Johnny the stupid idiot could have Jared four chunks to save me but he still went with nikka so either way if he wins technically I win cause he's in my team right there we go I think there's any wounds but I should have whatever chunks to save Kenny but in my head I fought Nico had a vote as well but he didn't yeah actually yeah I said I'm out here you got it oh yeah [Applause] so Kenny was the Mafia and the good theory was correct people are gonna be going on about this for years and years give me a Netflix show the gold theory oh good we got mafia which is good but I didn't read if the girls in I really didn't think it was him but we got my fear bang one muffin down we have to do now is get the second mafia out and I don't have to eat actually it goes Chile please please let me escape before this week for the Mafia because he was a possibility sentence the Mafia yes yes yeah I'm very gasps I'm very excited I'm very happy I'm elated total joy now the thing that blew my mind Johnny Carrey was touching my shoulders being like Jerry's the Mafia Kelly's the Mafia God please God talk about that before at that moment I knew joining is the Mafia but I'm not even gonna go for him next round I'm gonna gas him up a little bit comfort his ego and then I'm gonna go in for the kill in the future but right now I'm just gonna play with him do you think you're right now no I thought Nicko is unto me proper for a shark he's just doing it because he just was a stick stick to his vote going for the start so if he does get me out he can say yeah from the start I said it Johnny and Nick I was getting on to me I dunno what he's figuring out about me you could I don't think I'm giving much away but he's getting on to me [Music] okay now we're gonna have a little bit of a time job because we took a day off to celebrate Kenny's death because of how badly that idiot flopped last time yes why are you laughing muttering in the background Kenny you're awful okay we're back I'm ready to finish off the game okay I have the right yeah and then this one I'm just calling the Nicoli ah instantly the goofy Reverend was crazy hours right partner yeah now I am now at the point where I believe I have supernatural powers and my instant thought was you with Amara I completely made up the Nicko theory I literally put it on the sport just so I could give an excuse not to go for joining this round and keep this game going because I'm actually enjoying it is that so that's why I'm not going to you know his problem is I really don't unless he's mafia and he knows I'm an innocent civilian then it makes sense why it's going for me but if he's a villain I don't always probably game was like six days ago obviously i'ma just wait well like I said it's been four seven days since that last game and I just forgot everything well I remembered it was our civilian so uh yeah I just decided to take a different approach just game I'm just getting by yeah listen you can suspend me relax I'm playing this run well last time yeah a lot of people were speculating for me no one's on my back no one thinks it's me yeah I'm in the clear watch my last game was shocking and AJ because AJ was being very like I was wrong reverse psychology Valentine a new step back because I would go higher I mean change your shirt oh I'm absolutely clueless what is happening who is it I can't lie this is met definitely the most confused I've been the two games of mafia that we've had I am so clueless I don't know what's happening I reckon when a game is so tight there's at least one senior play that's mafia and I see the players are myself no longer do I think is here because I don't think any and Johnny wouldn't like it's a decent fairy I can't lie but then that also involves him into his own theory and number one rule when you're making a theory get all eyes off you what he's done is he's actually added wise unto himself because who is he the senior player there's a senior play series I really wanted Nick or chunk yeah but see that means that you're also evolved as I see the flare of course on my own at this point I was so confused I didn't even know who the Matthew was anymore I've got my theory on Johnny but I'm not a hundred percent sure I know it's crazy for me to say that but I'm not a hundred percent sure imagine I'm voting out Sharky and then I'm going for Johnny but it's actually chunks I'm back to bite and my mind feels like it's expanding out of my brain I don't know what I'd rather vote this person out and they'd be a civilian rather he only because of the reason I spoke about because a baby's sake spiria but penis senior players is decent I'm gonna go with my gut do you know what I thought in mind that marks cuz he did a most reasoning behind it yeah stupid vote because he didn't much reason he just said it went for who's got but I'm hoping Nichol alright Johnny's gone for me that's not surprised I went from the first two rounds really so I do slightly thinking on Johnny's a mafia but he went for me it's no surprise because got excited vote he really is the I went out on this exact round in the last episode so it's just history repeating itself really I'm but I just want to literally parrot what Sharky said just minutes ago you came for me and I feel worse obviously I've got to pick between you Johnny I'm so annoying bomb so I don't know why Nick away with me I think it was like a last minute thing I should I should have bought it for Nicole like in the back of my head I was thinking right I'm in the clear yeah I think I'll play I perceiving I played that round well I don't want to vote with me yeah I was gonna vote for Nicola Shakib over Nicole and I would win to vote so I thought you know what Nico's wanting for shopping you get that vibe they bond with Sharky ah yeah I actually thought I was gonna do that wrong I only see what I don't do that wrong and I was flipping around its daguan chunks I'm sure I'm sure oh my god what does happen what what I mean great I'm still in the game but I didn't expect that I did not expect that one bit I don't even know why I did that I really surprised myself in that in that moment I feel like I just wanted that in the game only got a bit too confident it got to me I really hope that Johnny is the Mafia because if not I will have absolutely no idea what's going on next so I'm very Romney I'm telling you're not we'd caught him out we caught him a college any college come on Tony Blair yeah I know [Music] [Laughter] and you understand I only had two games two of many as this there's a chance for me to redeem there is there is this week I've won the 10,000 pounds

that I feel like the cameras tilted a little bit anyway so I wanted to do this I wanted to do this challenge for quite a while I just needed these crappie to get into their summer depths to where they're suspended their schooled up tight that's pretty much how I the only way to do this challenge now well yeah I should probably tell you what the challenge is so crappie calm last year they sent me a bunch of bottles of this this is slab sauce their original scent well this year they came out with the G sauce I've done a couple videos on this already but you know what I thought let's let's put these guys to the test so we're gonna do slab sauce verse G sauce and the rig I tied up I thought this was going to be a brilliant way to to fish this because last year I think I did slip bobbers with two rods I tried to keep them at the same depth but I don't have a rod holder up front and it was just a pain in the butt to kind of catch a fish put one rod down and then I get a hit on the other rod have to go down and pick that up so this year I tie it on a tee rig I made it out of a coat hanger so that's the t rig it's a makeshift T rig but I just kind of bent coat hanger and a bunch of loops and yeah tied on main line goes in the middle that's the one to the rod then I got two lines tied on one here and one here and I got the same length there about I think they're about 3 feet 3 foot leaders and I have a 1/16 ounce jig head just a simple jig head and on the on the G sauce one I have a little rubber Bobby stop so in order to tell the difference because I'm going to be using the exact same bait that's these pink and white what focus these pink and white Piko scent rinks they're tubes they got more the squid tail going on but in order to tell which one is slap sauce and which one is G sauce I put the black bar stop on one of them so that's gonna be the G sauce I got a feeling I'm gonna be frustrated by these lines getting tangled up but I still wanted to fish it so here's how it's gonna work I'm gonna put 10 minutes on the clock I'm gonna these crappie are schooled up really really tight so once I get into a school of them and I'm just going to troll I think that's the best way I'm gonna not get tangled is kind of troll through them but these crappie are schooled up really really tight we're in mid-july right now so I'm just going to find a big school trolling motor down troll through them 10 minutes who's gonna catch the most fish either the slab sauce or the G sauce so that's what we're here to find out and don't worry I'm going to do this challenge multiple times this summer I just needed the crappie to get schooled back up after their post spawn phase and they've done it so so let's find the school get the slap sauce and the G sauce on these sent rings let's catch some crappie all right here we go let's get these jigs sprayed up so which one is this yeah I'm gonna have a fun time untangling all this crap oh my goodness mmm it's not as tangle as I thought I don't think then go okay so that's the rubber bobber stop that just means this is going to be the G sauce good little G sauce here this is potent so one two sprays and that one's good and no bobber stop it's gonna be the good old slab sauce one two all right let's get this thing in the water somehow without getting it all tangled up and I'm just going to troll it's all I'm gonna do I think that's the only way to not get these things caught tangled up [Music] well that didn't worked very long I got a fish on already holy smokes this would be the this would be the G sauce it looks like No yeah it was G sauce G sauce one oh yeah ten minutes on the clock wow this is just a mess this is just a nightmare some ideas sound really really good and they just aren't alright this isn't working everything is getting tangled this is just it's just not working so we're gonna change it up alright so since that didn't work here's what I'm gonna do I just tied on I'm gonna do 10 minutes each lure or each each cent so the first one I tied on is the G sauce I'm gonna spray it one more time here that's I'm just gonna give it ten minutes with this I'm gonna be on the same school of fish okay so I I just can't do two rods it just it's gonna be too much and I thought that was gonna be a great idea but it really wasn't it really it sucked I feel like I feel like my head's cut off in the frame we're in focus there's a school out in front of me alright so what are we going on the clock here 1:30 all right we're gonna go ten minutes with the G sauce and ten minutes with the slab sauce see which one can catch the most fish I'll still count the two for the G sauce because technically oh here we go right on top of them here brush piles brush piles suspended fish big schools there is so that's three for G sauce well hey hey hey they're not big but it's a big school of them and we're counting numbers here we're not we're not worried about size on this one there is there is four for the G sauce number for wind decided to pick up today it's a little tougher to stay on these fish there's wind yeah what do I got here there he is got him that time Gavin that time was his number five for the G sauce or comeback comeback there we go come on time is crucial on this one gotta get him off that where'd they go here we go come on let's go for number six here yep that's always fun oh there he is number six number six on the G sauce got about a minute and a half left here where'd that school go oh there he is there he is number seven number seven what's the time chick oh it's gonna end it seven fish in ten minutes for the G sauce Wow ten plus because I counted the other two all right let's switch it up to the slab sauce I'm gonna throw on the the other tube that's already sprayed with slab sauce and let's get it done all right tie it on a completely different jig and through a different tube on for the slab sauce so there isn't any mixture of G sauce versus slab soft stuff all right so once we find the school here this wind keeps pushing me in it's like nine feet of water I got to get back out to 20 that's where they are once we find the school we're gonna start the clock ten minutes slab sauce all right so time check one will start at two so we'll go go to 12 minutes on my GoPro starting now schools right in front of me there he is there's number one there's number one one in the slab sauce six more to go to beat the G sauce mark no no every second counts come on fish there he is crappie number two number two for the slab sauce it's definitely gonna have to have to do some work here cover some time I don't know I don't know if it's gonna catch the G sauce five minute well I start out to some three minutes in seven minutes left there's a chance oh there he is three three for the slab sauce hopefully he didn't get on the GoPro I really want to take time to clean that I can't tell if he did or not oh well sorry if there's something on the camera lens oh there he is there is four five oh I lost count I'll remember what number I'm at in the editing room but when I go back to edit this thing I don't know if that's four or five yeah we're halfway through slab sauce could catch them oh we're tangled we're tangled no we're not we're good oh there he is oh no it doesn't count because I didn't get him in gotta fix the tube there he is got him that time I think it's five five maybe six I don't remember come on Oh lawyers time there is there he is this might tie it up or might be six I don't remember if it is to tie it up hey slap sauce came back tied it up if not we're down by one man they get their hook and I'm deep though what do we go for four count here eleven minus two so I got two minutes left five seconds left I don't know if I'm gonna get it done nope that's gonna end it alright well that's gonna wrap it up for the G sauce versed slab sauce challenge I'm definitely gonna do a bunch more 1v1 type of challenges like this going throughout the summer but yeah ten minutes I think it was I easy their tie or G sauce one by one I don't remember I'll post it right here the winner is gonna be right right here I just lost count I've been out on the water a little too long 11:45 this is a midday bite to remember that this is not an early morning or late at night that's midday what I catch 14 total 13

it's midday I'm gonna hit some Shore here I'm gonna bout to run into a tree because we keep drifting there's a lot of jet skis on the water if you like these challenge videos especially the cent challenge video maybe you'll like seeing a live bait verse dead bait or a live bait first artificial with a scent like this video that way I know to keep posting videos like that also comment below if you have a type of challenge video that you want to do that involves one of these scents ok so maybe like I said a live bait verse verse artificial with one of these scents or something like that maybe crankbaits with one of these scents post that in the comments section below your idea for a challenge video and as always if you're not a subscriber bottom right-hand corner of the screen

believe you believe it and you might be right but I've never heard it before alright here we go guys Monday what August 5 [Music] Gina and that's Mike Mike's got quite the tall tale about gulps but James in the pilothouse we are we are so Regina I didn't bring sunglasses I'm not netting today all right here we go guys and as you heard in that cold intro this was an August 5 2009 teen party boat trip on the Hampton lady I'll include a link to the trip we did last year the same boat same group of people where we were completely rained on and we were in pitching 6 to 8 foot seas and it was great fun time but from a fishing perspective a horrible time this was the exact opposite every year Kenneth Westar felt if Kenneth Western felt fishing I'll include a link to that YouTube page in my description and more on that a little later he organizes a group of these trips I'm going on this one I went on this one and the fishing was fantastic and what I included in that cold intro was you met Joe you know Sweeney already met Joe Regina aka the garbage man he won the pool will include that fish in the video and Mike the guy with the glasses that we were calling with love spaceman because we thought his theory was out of this world about gulp and in what Mike is saying is that a scientist buddy of his looked up the patent and that scientist but he actually called me later and he was very convincing so I'm tending to believe this is true I have not independently corroborated this but that the the secret sauce the gulp is is not really the juice itself but it's the the vegetable extract that the gulp itself is made out of it's a biodegradable thing that's why it doesn't really do harm to fish and it's the same type of material that's used in slow-release medicine and tablets and that allows develop juice to not come all out at once but to be slowly released and gulp has a patent on it or Berkeley does till 2026 so I thought it was an interesting theory I never thought about it like that but will will will include that little explanation coming up right now as always if you like these videos hit that like button if you're not already a subscriber and you

started the YouTube page this year he's got a lot of videos up already a lot of cool fishing stuff check it out for yourself Mike you're on what's up Skinner I've seen you a lot haven't met yet gulp I'm trying to explain my beliefs and I'm pretty certain of this is that it is basically the body of it that is derived from a Japanese mountain yam a sticky M and this is the truth I don't know what else they mix it with but yam is one of the primary ingredients and Mike what am i accusing you of coming off of today some kind of space yeah should pass stay on me how deep are we here tonight nice 21 Oh Joey's on that's a fluke Joe feels better than the last one Kenny's on two I have a knife in my back no he's talking to James the captain Oh Joe Joe might need a net oh there's an au pair yeah you're blue Yeah right onion Kenny anything I thought you gonna say seventeen and a half inch Joe nice fish meanwhile I got a good one too yeah good one caddy all right I'm actually going tonight come on one tomorrow I knew I knew so we got another bait oh oh we got two nets here okay mine is good yeah yeah that's a nice fish that's eight pounds right yeah seven seventy which are during him you should be able to use whatever you want nice caddy mics on - oh just dropped it was that good all right come to me come to me damn Kenny that's my fish you're gonna get the net guys got like three nuts fire but I know I go into my past but nothing great not like that no I saw the head shakes yeah cuz it just got a little heavier you can reel up slowly with me if I have you we have each other yeah cuz it just got a little heavier and I'm like yeah and it just got lighter again keeper yeah I think he's taking now [Music] yeah you guys got to get those nuts without you know what I'm saying the mesh Nets the rubber ones [Music] close I think I know there's a lot of current I think I might need than that yeah yeah got some weight yeah he's got weight actually yeah just a fine job limit you I shouldn't I shouldn't say that yet oh he's coming up easy now why Jesus came up so easy it's a nice one actually and that last fish I call it not only got me a limit on the fluke but also got me second place in the pool 150 bucks it was about seven pounds I guess Joe Regina who you saw earlier bring up a nice bigger fish his fish came in at about eight and a half pounds the scale was jumping between eight and a half and 9.2 I know Joe's treating it as a nine so why don't we say nine I said I know the text says eight mahat but we love Joe great guy the garbage man so we'll say nine and the interesting thing from this video though in my opinion was Mike to my right very intelligent guy is a CPA and his his theory which again I haven't independently corroborated but that the the body of the gulp is derived from a Japanese sticky mountain yam again I have not looked this up but I thought it was an interesting theory especially that you know what differentiates the gulp from some of the competitors is the fact that the juice that it contains it soaks in and then it slowly releases so you can use it awhile you can recharge it I don't know what do you guys think does anybody have any opinion or knowledge as to what make sculpt work so well especially compared to other soft plastics remember to check out Kenny westerfeld's page check out the description for links to all the

Batman chunks is back", "bwPOw7q1RJI": "in this video we're going to tell you the basics of heritage on something [Music] I really do love soft baiting a lot it's a lot of fun you're catching fish in shallow water you're casting and some of the fights can be really epic you know the snapper really do take off in the shallow water so where do we go soft baiting anywhere in water from 5 meters to 20 meters deep along coastlines we're - seaweed meets the sand which is generally about 10 to 15 meters so look for the contour lines on your chart when there's squash together which means a nice Bank so a fishing long thanks so what generally happens around the coastline of New Zealand as you have some sealy and in a bank and then seen so you're trying to go down those areas there because the snapper live in the seaweed but they come in and feed on the scene so we're trying to drift along these contour lines if you can drift parallel to the contour lines and in the same direction they're line you can stand that zone longer so I'm always looking for the wind and current to keep us and the kind of the same get and travel along the coastline when I'm soft baiting now the gear we're using as soft bedding is all about casting so I'm using a rod that's designed for soft baiting and its main function is to cast let's lure a long way and this guide here you've probably heard about it the ocean angler microwave rod it's a bit longer and it's got the special guide which has allows us to cast further and we want to cast further because the bigger fish don't like the boat we're in shallow water the boats a bit noisy so the further you can cast your soft bait you'll catch more fish the lures we use we use z-man soft baits these are buoyant lures so when they're buoyant that adds a whole new dimension to what you can do with your sink rate like this floats that's led it sinks so by coming up different variations you can adjust this arm sink rate by using Z means and the lighter jig heads we've got two size jig heads now we've got the the long shank which is this one here that's designed to fish on the seven-inch soft baits saying that some people prefer the long shank on the five-inch as well and then we have our regular size to kid with the shorter shank and that's designed for fishing soft baits between 4 or 3 inches and 5 inches and the reason is is because we want the hop to come out from about a third to half way along the soft bait because if it goes too far back you lose all that wiggly action and we certainly don't want to do that so if it comes out a third to half way you know we're happy you can see the UV IDEs at the moment on the light bulb jackets that stent done that's UV paint and it does catch more fish the UV globe so UV reflector the fish can see it from further away and it really does work there's three different styles of soft bait I use the first one is a jerk shed and as the name suggests it's for jerking and twitching through the water so with when you're fishing with it with your rod you really want to touch your rod because action is in the twitching of the rod tuck then there's other lures that kind of got a built in action like the z-man peddler zeke you can see this little tail it wobbles so that has action when you just pull it through the water so when I'm fishing with a pedal tail I'm casting out limiting and then kind of pulling it through the water rather than touching it like a soft bait same deal for the curly tail has built in action with this curly tail so casting out and pulling through the water rather than twitching I really like the soft bait on big jig heads for dragging the dragging technique and so that's the three different styles of soft baits I'll use so to give the very best action to your jig head and lure you want to use the thinnest fluorocarbon and the thinnest braid you possibly can the ultimate would to be have like a piece of cotton you could use to to cast this out because that will give it the best action possible so keep your fluorocarbon thin we use 16 pound that would be the average on if it's really big for in I might go up to 20 but very really so generally 16 pound ghost fluorocarbon and on days when it's harder fishing or in the inner harbor even down to 12 pound ocean angle ghost fluorocarbon that's all you need and your braids so many people I see who have braids that's way too thick on this soft Rod's so I'm using those are about 16 pound it's actually an ocean angler braid which will be coming soon but talk about the diameter when you're talking about Fred's not about the poundage or breaking strains because you know the different manufacture all kinds of marketing tricks to make you buy it so look at the diameter I use about 0.12 of a millimeter to 0.15 of a millimeter in diameter and so look at that point one to the mill to 0.15 of the mill 16 pound goes to fluorocarbon and that's what I use 90% of the time when I'm soft bathing now when you're drift fishing that's really important to drift up and down with the current especially along a coastline because if you don't if your drift in the direction of the wind you're soft bait instead of going back and forth and the current might go across the current because of your drip and you really don't want there happening so that's why I can the most important tool but all you look fishing is a decent sea anchor this is the ocean angler hand brake they come in three sizes up to twelve foot now but this takes away the effect of the wind not the current the wind so we want to trip back and forth with the current and take that wind effect out of our drift and we do that with a sinker you make sure you get a decent one this is a really important piece of kit to catch fish when your soft baby come I get a lot of people ask now where do I time I see anchor on to and it varies with different boats that varies how many people you have on the boat usually I just tie it on the side I just tied on a I click on the side of the boat and drift sideways but on when I'm doing charter work that allows me to have more people fishing down the side so just wherever it suits your boat and just make sure you run the trip line you know the part this is the piece of rope to pull it back into your cockpit make sure that somewhere handy so when you want to pull it in you just need to grab the right pollen and when you're unikz what you just shred out again so it can be it can be even attached to the bow as long as the trip line has back in the cockpit so it's easy to retrieve and redeploy next time you've got to make sure you cast you lure the right way as well you need to cast it forward of the current so at the moment the currents go in that way so I want to cut that way you can be mistaken because the winds blow in that way but it's the way the boats moving at the moment we're moving with the current because we've got our sea anchor out so I want to cast that way we just enter the wind but with the current so that way and that way my I'm catching up to the lure with the boat and it has time to sink down naturally and it's been pulled if I cut the other way kind of be pulled and it wouldn't um float down naturally and it doesn't work as well so cast forward of your drift hard part of soft baiting is kind of visualizing it sinking to the bottom you don't want any tension on your line when it's sinking to the bottom but also being in touch with your lure so to feel you look it's just like half a foot lifting in right tip away but it's also loose when it's falling down the water column because it doesn't want to be hindered by your line at all so at the moment I'm visualizing it sinking down about ten meters or if it's on the bottom about now then I do a few little touches let it sink back down again a few more little twitches let it sink back down again and that's my method so I'll do that four or five times and then I'm going to wind it all the way in because I'm not interested in fetching this area close to the boat because I know the big snapper are afraid of the boat and they're going to be further away so I'm constantly winding in and casting my lure back out again so it stays away from my boat I don't want to push it close to my boat so here we go cast it back out down current let lay the line on the water I'm letting it sink down I'm watching my line I'm not putting any tension on it if that line takes up I know fish has grabbed it so it's sinking down sinking down I'm just visualizing right now that's sinking down 10 meters you know I might take 30 seconds that's on the bottom about now little twitches take in the slack a few little touches take in the slack maybe let it sit down for a bit remember snapper like an easy feat sometime take your soft bait when it's just sitting on the bottom doing nothing now remember the Z man's because they're buoyant they actually sit up so this when it's doing nothing it's actually sitting on the bottom and that oh isn't just got to bite them so it's sitting on the bottom and the tail is floating so you actually in action when you're doing nothing with Z means the more casts equals more drops which equals more fish so don't leave your soft bait and order for too long without winding in and casting back out again I'm a big believer and putting scent on your soft baits and you know I reckon by using secret sauce oricon you're increasing it you're increasing your chances by you know 30 percent maybe so what I do is a bead and the belly there that bead down each side and I'm ready to go so I've had about four casts with this color now so what I'm going to do because I know this fish here Den is called a 20-pounder I'm going to change colors because that's what it's all about changing colors changing jighead weights changing Lewis styles until you figure out what's working so I'm not I'm going to change and I mean you asked in what here what do you have on then Bruce for that Bruce banana so what am I going to do I'm going to copy in what he just called as fish on so there we go so I've got it's only a 3/8 ounce Jughead a big buoyant soft bait so that should slow might have seemed right down which is great for the shallow water that hang time more hang time you get the more time that snip has a chance to see it source and one cut on a cast as far as I can the good thing about a seven inch soft bait got a bit of weight to it so you can cast it further back out again keep it away from the boat I've because I'm drifting I'm casting into a new area it's not like when you're anchored and you're casting back to the same place each time when you're on the drift each cast as new spot [Music] here we go soft fading but 15 to 20 meters along those contour lines the nice fish [Music]", "AE_-ROS98PA": "What\u2019s up everyone? Today we\u2019re making \"J\u00f3 J\u016bng T\u00f2hng G\u0101i\" \"General Tso\u2019s Chicken\" My name is Randy And I\u2019m a second generation Chinese American On a mission to share and preserve My family\u2019s recipes and stories, one meal at a time. Hahaha You can\u2019t use olive oil to fry! Hahaha My dad has been a Chinese chef for over 50 years and  Today he will be showing us his recipe for \u201cGeneral Tso\u2019s Chicken\u201d Hello friends! Hope you're all well! Today we're going to share our recipe for \u201cGeneral Tso\u2019s Chicken.\u201d Many Chinese restaurants, big and small, All across the US make this dish. Now I\u2019ll show you how to make it. First we're going to cut the chicken. A lot of people use chicken thighs. For a healthier alternative, we'll use chicken breast. Here we have about 10 oz chicken breast. First we'll cut the chicken. If you\u2019re not familiar with General Tso\u2019s Chicken, It\u2019s an extremely popular menu item In Chinese American restaurants  But fairly unheard of in mainland China.  The original recipe was invented by renowned chef Peng Chang Kuei in Taiwan in the 1960s,  Who named it General Tso\u2019s Chicken As an homage to his Hunanese heritage  And their beloved general Zuo Zongtang.  When done properly,  General Tso\u2019s Chicken is an incredibly delicious dish  That\u2019s crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  Chef Peng\u2019s original recipe is more in line with the intense spices, Tanginess, and savory flavors of Hunanese cuisine,  And in America, Chinese chefs added sugar to the recipe  To appeal to a more western customer base.  We\u2019ll talk about this more later,  But there\u2019s a really poignant documentary  Called \u201cThe Search for General Tso\u201d  That explains not only the origins of how this iconic dish  Became its own billion dollar industry,  But the struggles of Chinese immigrants Fighting to survive and thrive in America.  We're done cutting the chicken. Next, we're going to marinate the chicken.   We\u2019ll add our chicken to a bowl as well as\u2026 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 egg 1 tbsp cornstarch 1/2 tbsp water We\u2019ll be saving the other half of the egg for later If you're looking for a written version of this recipe Check out our blog post at madewithlau.com Where you'll find an adjustable list of ingredients And step-by-step videos to guide you As you make the recipe at home. So now we're mixing the chicken with the marinade. Mix it around like this.  It\u2019s okay if you want to mix it for longer.  Mix and massage in a circular motion.  Now we're done marinating the chicken. Let it sit for about 10-20 minutes. Now we're going to prepare the batter. To a different bowl, we\u2019ll add... 3 tbsp flour 1 tbsp cornstarch The remaining half of the egg  1 tsp baking powder About 4 tablespoons of water to start.  We might need to add more water as we mix.  After mixing, if we see this kind of consistency Then we know there isn't enough water  Now we need to add more water (to get the right consistency). Add one more tablespoon. How do you make it crispier?  Add two types of powder -  Cornstarch and flour. If you only use flour, it won't work. If you use only flour it will become very soft. If you use only cornstarch it will become very hard. The perfect ratio is 3:1. 3 parts flour to 1 part cornstarch. We\u2019ll also add 1 tbsp olive oil. Which helps the chicken turn out more shiny And helps to prevent the batter from clumping together. Last, we'll add some oil. Use water to mix around. We have to mix it very well so that there are no clumps.  When you see it\u2019s like this, it's still a little too thick. Add 1/2 tablespoon water. Like this - this is perfect.  See? Okay, we're using 2 garlic cloves. Next, we\u2019ll be mincing 2 garlic cloves A few slices of ginger,  And about 1-2 ounces Or about a \u2153 of a red bell pepper Mince the ginger. Red bell pepper About 1 ounce or a little less than a half. A lot of Chinese American restaurants  Tend to garnish General Tso\u2019s Chicken With a ring of a few pieces of broccoli  And sometimes pieces of sliced tomato,  So feel free to chop and prepare some if you\u2019d like.  We've cut all of our ingredients Let's start to heat up the oil Now we'll pour the oil into the wok. This is corn oil. When you deep fry, don\u2019t use olive oil  Because it can\u2019t withstand high heat. That\u2019s enough oil now.  We want enough to submerge the chicken. There isn't that much chicken to fry. Like my dad mentioned,  You should generally avoid olive oil  For anything that involves higher heat.  This is because olive oil has what\u2019s called a lower smoke point,  Which is the temperature at which the oil stops shimmering or rippling And starts smoking or burning Smoking oil isn\u2019t always a problem  And sometimes even desired for getting that perfect  \u201cWok Hei\u201d in your stir fry,  But it\u2019s a sign that the oil is breaking down,  Which can release burnt or bitter flavors  Or even harmful free radicals. Here\u2019s a chart that highlights the smoke points  Of a few of the most common cooking oils.  There are a few other factors that go into selecting oils Like whether they\u2019re neutral or flavored.  Or refined or unrefined.  Most cooking oil is created by extracting and compressing seeds and nuts,  And oils that are \u201cunrefined\u201d, \u201craw\u201d, or \u201cvirgin\u201d  Are usually bottled almost immediately.  They generally have more nutrients  But a lower smoke point and shorter shelf life.  Refined oils go through more processing  For a higher smoke point, longer shelf life,  And a more neutral flavor.  It\u2019s not totally true that you should avoid olive oil,  Since you can buy either refined or unrefined varieties.  But for simplicity\u2019s sake, for frying,  You generally want to use neutral, refined oils  Like vegetable oil, refined olive oil, or corn oil.  Set the stove to its highest heat.  To check if the oil is hot enough, It's pretty easy. Place one drop of the batter into the oil. If it floats to the top immediately then the oil is hot enough It\u2019s not hot enough. See now it\u2019s going up though. Continue to heat it up. If you see it\u2019s coming up too slow, then the oil is not hot enough Another way you can test if it's hot enough Is to put in something that has water content (it should sizzle) See, it\u2019s not hot enough. Continue to heat it up You can see it. Mmm, it depends on how much oil you use. If you have more oil then it takes longer to heat up. Here\u2019s an example of what it should look like when the oil is hot enough. My dad also said that if the batter instantly turns golden brown,  Then the oil is too hot.  If you put it in right away and it turns yellow immediately then it\u2019s too hot? Yes then it\u2019s too hot. My dad will be explaining this later,  But we\u2019ll be frying our chicken twice.  For the first fry, we\u2019re looking to heat our oil to around 300\u00b0F (149\u00b0C),  And 350 - 400\u00b0F (176 - 204\u00b0C) for the second frying.  Another easy way to monitor the temperature  Is to get an Instant Read Thermometer,  Which allows you to set a temperature probe in the oil  And know exactly what temperature it\u2019s at.  I\u2019ve included links to some of our favorite options in our description  And on our blog post. Also you need to see how much power your stove has Gas stoves heat up faster Our electric stove heats up pretty slowly. It\u2019s a little bit slower but that\u2019s okay. As our oil heats up,  We\u2019ll prepare our all-important sauce by mixing  2 tbsp light soy sauce 1 tsp dark soy sauce 2 tbsp sugar 1 tbsp vinegar 1 tbsp ketchup 1/2 tsp white pepper After our chicken is done frying,  We\u2019ll also be cooking the sauce with 4 dried chili peppers,  Our garlic, as well as 1 teaspoon of cornstarch,  2 tbsp of water, and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil.  You can put this sauce on a lot of things. When I worked for New Lim\u2019s, nobody knew this sauce. Shortly after I arrived in the US, I learned to make this sauce. I already knew how to make this sauce. Mix up all together. And now we're going to try and see how it tastes. If it\u2019s not perfect, we can add or subtract. Okay! Okay! Good. We'll be using this sauce after we finish frying. Now we're going to mix the batter with the chicken. The chicken has already been marinating. Now, mix it with the batter.   Now the oil is hot enough When we put it inside the drop floated up. Now we put the chicken in, piece by piece. Transfer it into the wok slowly with chopsticks. Why don\u2019t you put all in at once? It will stick together.  If you put it all in at once it will all stick together. We\u2019ll be frying it until it turns golden yellow. Yellow Now, it\u2019s all in the wok. Now we\u2019ll separate all the pieces. You keep frying until the juices comes out and start to hear sizzling. The sound comes from the moisture inside the meat. Fry it for at least 10 minutes until it turns yellow. The pan should not be too shallow right? If it\u2019s too shallow the oil will easily splash out. Our pan is maybe 4 inches deep. Even 3 inches is okay.  A slightly curved bottom pan is better If you're deep-frying, a flat bottom is also okay. If you're deep frying, a flat bottom is okay. Yes, not completely flat. You use less oil if it\u2019s that way too. Yes  While we wait for our chicken to cook I wanted to make a special shoutout To thank our wonderful Patreon supporters  For helping bring this video to life Son, do you like to eat fried food? Since you like fried food, I'll make fried shrimp for you. Since I already have a pot with oil. I'll make some food for you. I'll make some food for you and Kat. Okay, we've been deep-frying up until now. It\u2019s turning golden yellow. Now we'll scoop it out. Scoop it out - later we'll fry it again. Wow, beautiful! Oh my God! Do you see how beautiful it is? After transferring the chicken out,  We\u2019ll need to let the oil heat up again,  This time to 350-400F,  Before dumping the chicken back in.\t On our setup, this took about 2 minutes.\t We'll pour it in to re-fry again.\t Like this, the meat looks so beautiful.\t The skin is very crunchy.\t See, right now when you touch the skin it\u2019s pretty soft.\t If you fry it again, the skin will contract and harden. Wait a little bit.\t Fry it again and it will become more beautiful Usually in the restaurant they don\u2019t cook this made-to-order They do it in large batches If a customer places an order, we\u2019ll bring the dish to them. The fried chicken is already mostly ready (from the first fry).\t Once a customer orders, we'd start the second fry. We'd fry it a second time, do you understand?\t Whether it\u2019s Lemon Chicken or Sweet & Sour Pork.\t It's done the same way.\t Now we'll pour it in and fry again.\t See?\t You don\u2019t need to fry too long for the second fry.\t We only need to fry 1-2 minutes.\t Just for a little bit. Done! Wow! See? Whoaa!\t Good! Do you see how beautiful that is? Oh, hot!\t Of course it\u2019s hot! It just finished frying! Does that taste good?\t Now, we need make the sauce.\t The last step is to create the sauce.\t We\u2019ll scoop some of the frying oil into a new pan.\t Let the pan heat up for 1 to 2 minutes\t Until the oil is shimmering, or forming ripples,\t And then we\u2019ll cook 4 dried chili peppers For about 10-15 seconds. Dried chilies are better (than fresh) - they have a stronger aroma, flavor. Then we\u2019ll add the minced garlic and ginger.\t Stir and cook for 20-30 seconds  To release the aromas and flavors. Next, we\u2019ll pour our sauce mix from earlier\t And stir around for another 20-30 seconds.\t Mmm, very good.\t Then, we\u2019ll thicken the sauce with a cornstarch slurry\t Made of 1 tsp cornstarch and 2 tbsp water.\t Stir for 20-30 seconds,\t Then add the bell peppers and 1 tsp sesame oil,  And stir and cook for another 30 seconds.\t You can adjust the thickness of the sauce to your liking\t By adding either more cornstarch, or more water.\t Okay, it's done! Pour it in\t Ooohhh\t Whoo\t Wow! Okay. All done cooking! Let's plate it! Mmm\t Okay\t Now we add our garnish. J\u00f3 J\u016bng T\u00f2hng G\u0101i, all done! Let\u2019s eat! Before we sit down to eat, I wanted to reflect  On watching The Search for General Tso,  Which does a beautiful job telling the stories And struggles of Chinese immigrants fighting  To survive in America, and it also stirs a lot of  Thoughts on what it means for Chinese food to be \u201cauthentic\u201d. In a nutshell, Chinese immigrants, mostly from Guangdong,  Flocked to California during the Gold Rush in the 1850s.  Work was extremely limited and low paying,  And restaurants were often the only opportunity  That Chinese immigrants had to make a living.  Right from the start, and even to this day to a degree,  Chinese Americans struggled because we were  Viewed as aliens and second-class citizens.  It used to be legal and even encouraged to  Commit violence against Chinese people,  And it was pretty common for Chinese restaurants  To be blown up, burned down, and for entire Chinese  Communities to be completely driven out of town, Like in Monterey, California for example.  So it\u2019s against this backdrop that Chinese people were  Forced to find a way to be accepted by White Americans.  This was the hostile environment where Chinese food  Had to evolve to be more relatable and palatable to  A non-Chinese audience, and why dishes like  General Tso\u2019s Chicken or Chop Suey  Are practically unheard of in China,  But were staples of Chinese American restaurants.  I think Chinese American dishes like this sometimes  Get hate because they\u2019re not \u201creal Chinese food\u201d,  But I don\u2019t think they\u2019re any less authentic  Than mainland Chinese cuisine.  I think on the contrary, it speaks to how innovative  And resilient Chinese immigrants had to be  To be able to call a foreign land their home.  While it is true that there are customs  And core ingredients that tend to  Define traditional Chinese cuisine,  If you look closely, the culinary practices in China  Were and are still constantly evolving,  And draw from many different parts of the world. I think something that is clearly fake and inauthentic  Would be like someone slapping a Louis Vuitton logo  On a bag and trying to sell it to you.  But unlike Louis Vuitton, no single person or company  Gets to define what real Chinese food is and isn\u2019t.  If your first experience of Chinese food  Was in a small Chinese restaurant in the midwest,  Sure, it might taste drastically different  From something you\u2019d get in Sichuan or Guangzhou,  But in my opinion, it doesn\u2019t make your own  Personal experience any less authentic  Or real just because you didn\u2019t eat that meal in China.  I think what IS authentic and real is  The fact that you enjoyed your meal,  That you maybe had a great conversation with your family,  That the people serving you put  Their hearts into making it for you,  And that everyone was able to provide for people that they love.  To me, that is a completely genuine experience,  And it\u2019s certainly not our place to gate-keep  Chinese cuisine and judge what\u2019s authentic or not.  All that being said, these are just my opinions,  And I\u2019d love to get your thoughts as well.  Feel free to leave a comment on how you might relate  Or even disagree with this, and what  Authentic cuisine means to you. Hi baby! Yay! Hi! Oh my God! Looks amazing! Alright Randy. Serve it up, serve it up! We\u2019re ready! We\u2019re ready! Okay Cheers! Cheers Camie! Ohh, in my mouth! I\u2019m so excited.  Mmmm that crunch! Wow, it tastes so good! This dish is very famous in Chinese restaurants. It tastes a little sweet, sour, and a little spicy. If you have a kid at home and you make this dish I think it will be gone immediately! It\u2019s just so good.  The taste is so good. Let\u2019s try the shrimp! Get ketchup Mmm, mm mm good! Who wants more? Did you try this in China?  No Where did you learn this? In the United States. In the restaurant? Every restaurant in the US has General Tso\u2019s Chicken Is it a well-known dish? It's not very famous in China. Also, it's not very popular in Hunan province. But it's very popular in the United States. In your old restaurant, did a lot of people like this dish? Yes, a lot of people loved it. Many other restaurants might not call it \u201cGeneral Tso's Chicken\u201d Some call it \u201cHunan Chicken\u201d Why do you need to fry it twice? During the first fry, some of the water Inside the meat will be released into the batter Then you scoop it out, and wait until the oil heats up again. On the second fry, the moisture will be reabsorbed into the chicken. So when you do it the second time,  The chicken will become very crunchy Because all the juices will be trapped in the inner layer That\u2019s the secret. So, can you use this method for any type of meat? Deep-fried fish, deep-fried shrimp, deep-fried anything. Did you deep-fry fish when you were in China? Rarely We didn't have cooking oil in China, son! When we were in China we had very little cooking oil! Was it really expensive? Before, in China, it was rare to have cooking oil. You think we had oil for cooking? Also we probably only had a half-pound of oil per month Wow That the government rationed for us. We used a coupon to buy it  Do you know where the oil I used came from? It was mailed from Hong Kong! From Hong Kong to China Your grandma and aunt mailed oil from Hong Kong to us Wow! A lot of time when we had pork Pork has a lot of fat So we saved the fat, and we fried the fat.  It will produce a lot of oil that we could use for cooking. We bought fatty parts of the pork  And would deep fry the fat for cooking oil So all the pig fat parts, we'd deep fry And then after deep frying, it became oil. Did you reuse the oil? Like say, if for this dish,  Would you use it, store it, and use it again? For vegetable oil, yes. When you had that, how would you know  When the oil wasn\u2019t good anymore? Mmm at home if you do deep fry once or twice, it's still okay. You don\u2019t have to throw it away. This is the oil I just used for frying. See? After frying, I pour it out with the strainer. After you deep fry, you strain it because there are a lot of pieces, crumbs.  So we use this to strain the oil so it's more pure. Yea, smart. It's still very flavorful! We can still cook with it - it still has a lot of aroma! Smell it. Hot! Smell how beautiful it is! Smell good? Soup? Oh soup! Gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp Hahahaha It smells very fragrant! The oil was used in our deep frying When are you going to throw it away? We're never going to throw it away. We use it for cooking. Why not olive oil? Olive oil is not fit for high heat. You can use any oil, but don\u2019t use olive oil for deep frying. Peanut oil, other oils are okay. Ohhh, Hong Doy. Can\u2019t do it, can\u2019t do it. Hong Doy you want to eat? You hear that Cam? Life advice from grandpa. You can\u2019t use olive oil for deep frying! Ooohh What did he say? You can\u2019t use olive oil! Hahaha You can\u2019t use olive oil for deep frying! Hello, all of our friends! Nice to talk to all of our friends today! Today Daddy Lau cooked \u201cJ\u00f3 J\u016bng T\u00f2hng G\u0101i\u201d It\u2019s very delicious!

they did for theirs i like that i like that now for booker telepharal washington his wise words are i have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome while trying to succeed yes by the way i just want to give it a quick little shout out there yeah go ahead your sound went out just a little bit just i i had to do it for the people you know shout out to all my testimonials okay it's all good you know i'm happy for you i'm happy that you have the opportunity to go to an hbcu did you know that i was going to go to florida a m and i bailed last month you were gonna go to famu yes i was you know everything happens for a reason because i don't know about here right now i don't know but let me read it one more time i have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome while trying to succeed so if you've had some obstacles in your life and you overcome then shout yourself out in the comments when they come back give yourself a pat on the back and i salute you yes we appreciate your existence mark yes so you know one highlight of this week besides the fact that it's black history month was the fact that we got to um a visit well visit via zoom anyway our um the classroom of course the console series curriculum oh man that was lit like it was super duper like um like just being able to have the opportunity to like literally speak to the future and to talk to the young adults about like markets and everything else and the cool part was we were only supposed to be there for like maybe like 45 minutes and then like or one hour oh one hour and then all of a sudden just like class is over it's just like yo we got more questions yo let's let's kick it let's talk so that was pretty cool and then on top of that i'm telling y'all like these kids are going to be scholarly just like each and every single one of you who participate every week for every episode for every pre-recorded video they are coming and when i mean that they're coming yo we're raising up a whole new set of wolves the next generation of wolves they're coming right behind us so i'm excited um i know that the the young adults are excited as well it was a great learning experience on both sides and uh yo let's get it yeah i'm excited so shout out to legacy um that's the name of the high school it's a longer name i've been calling it legacy for short um yeah and now the full name escapes me so i know it's legacy like maybe magnet uh college or something like that no but i know that it's in greenville south carolina so if you're in greenville south carolina go ahead and shout us out and put it in the comment section um go ahead it's legacy early college high school ah see i knew it was well a magnet i thought it was like super duper dope and it is so that's why i thought magnet but yeah good name i'm sorry to butcher your name for your high school but you're still dope students and i appreciate all of your existence chad is back chad is back what up okay a little delayed oh i see all these hbcus ooh someone's daughter wayne griffith's daughter goes to tuskegee hey what's good what's good they are shouting out okay mom morgan stay okay when we have this cookout i want to see everybody wear their their school shirts let me order my human college don't worry joellen i got you you're an honorary ski member i mean you know i do have a hampton shirt okay another school in which another school in which booker t washington helped get started so i mean hey do your thug fizzle all right so mark you know we have a lot of um questions that have to do with i guess and if we go if we end up going over that's okay cause honestly i'm not going to be doing any live streams after today's episode don't let me who knows i may show up in clubhouse tomorrow but yeah that's a maybe so let's just let's let's you got to give the people what they want so let's give them as much value as we can tonight all right so i just want to say i just want to say to all those folks that were like part of that whole wall street bets thing i'm just yeah let's just take a long step to that one you hear that gulp i don't know if it came across on the audio but yo [Laughter] yo even aaron's thirsty on that one so hey don't say that we didn't warn y'all i'm saying yo there are people that made out like a bandit like seriously and we're not talking about the retail traders no we are not we are not 40 what is it 44 million dollars on tickets we may as well tell the story before we get going so yeah pretty much there was a bunch of wall street stocks or wall street bet stocks in which that they were known as meme stocks or stonks whatever you want to call them um but essentially there was like your game stops your amc's but then there was also one by the name of koss yeah that's k-o-s-s as in cause family and the interesting thing about that is is that while a lot of the retail investors and traders were buying and boosting up the stock somebody was selling and they were selling a lot and it would be yo put them on mark it would be so hilarious if it was the cause family themselves making money okay i think it was like 44 million or something like that that they made off like 44 million i heard that uh yeah somebody said i heard michael jordan lost money i don't know if it was michael jordan that lost a lot of money but i think it was also his mind the partners that he brought in that were minority holders inside the charlotte hornets they also lost money too because they were tried to i think melvin capital so i think that everybody just took an l on this one so i think that the best thing that we can do for just history and time is just you know ultimately move on just like we did from the previous administration so yes let's move on okay act two wait let me shout out some of these hbcus we got southern university university okay um who else is popping up grambling state university purdue miss band spelman okay southern university somebody said amd university when they low when they got about and not yo wow that's hilarious all right oh also we gotta give a shout out to howard university they call it the mecca for homecoming and everything else and a lot of your black greek organizations were also started there um and then we also got to shout out a few others like your johnson c smiths which are smaller but at the same token they're here i'll even give a shout out to alabama state those their arrival but you know we called them like the high school but you know they got their education they got that degree so it's all the same so congratulations to all of you that have attended wonderful illustrious uh hbcu universities and if you didn't that's okay i mean it's a great experience to attend but at the same token you're there to get the education as well as build the camaraderie and friendships which i believe that all of you have so and there's no greater pride than just looking at yourself in the mirror and just realizing that we are wonderfully black and on top of that that we come from a great rich history so we out here we're hella out here in hella traffic all right so mark let's get to let's get to the chippage and the dippage because uh we need to talk about it so we got folks asking about amd okay um and in particular what was happening with the short with amd yes so apparently there was a little mistyped a little typo that happened where they mis did amd with and mistook it for amc and thus sending the stock traveling downward and [Music] pretty much all in all no bueno because amd took a significant hit and i wonder who's going to be coming for the restitution for that because of the fact that they lost a lot of money on that trade just because somebody made an error so um you have that um and then on top of that it's like you also have like this this short supply which i did speak about a few weeks ago when it when we were talking about the shortage of chips and uh but here's the funny thing you know shout outs to lisa sue man because she'd be on it doctor sue what did it do no like if you think about selling your amd please send me a shout out on instagram or wherever because i have no problem in buying up things in which that you leave behind for sure for sure because clearly if you are not in the know i mean word on the street is that amd is not only just working with tsm but they're also working with samsung because samsung also makes phones that are going to be pretty dope supposedly though i don't really use samsung phones anymore but you know they they are still dope they're innovative and here's the cool part you know those gpu chips that they normally use well apparently they signed a deal with amd and amd is going to be bringing its rdna into a samsung galaxy 22 s22 chip or s22 phone next year but they're also bringing in the chips for graphics into the phone that will release this year which is their galaxy phone uh device and i'm probably expecting that there's gonna be many many more devices like maybe their chromebooks their laptops and whatnot so i think that this is a great relationship between the two and i think that this is just only making amd's like stay bigger and on top of that if we also want to talk about amd about them now partnering up with you know somebody stock bay or stock crush whatever you want to call them i just know that i wear a lot of red and their name is tesla yes where you will be able to play a triple a game title the same type of graphics chip that you're going to be using in ps5 and xbox will be coming to a tesla model s or model x and i'm probably sure after that and model 3 and model y which will probably be a lower tiered version of the chip but at the same token they'll still be there so we see you amd you out here amd amd is one of those um stocks where you really just you have to know the catalyst um have a strong thesis and refer to it often because things just be happening and one minute it's up and then it will just take like a little hit it always dips after earnings so you've got to prepare for that um can i give people a little secret though yes if if it has to do with what you told me yes a lot of these companies have what is called a seasonality factor and so sometimes if you go back and check some of the history shout outs to one of the members of the suicide squad uh aka health original um we talked about it and i remember like you know knowing of the site a while back and they talked about a site called stockcharts.com and on stockcharts.com you can kind of look at the seasonality factor of a stock and so i would say for any of you that are kind of getting a little bit discouraged about a stock especially one by the name of amd or even let's say an nvidia you may want to go back and look at and see what their history is and check the tale of the tape to see exactly how is that these stocks trade you know and when do they start getting a little bit more active to get going so yeah well what you really should do is when you go to stockcharts.com they do have a one month free trial but even if you buy bypass that um there there's a little drop down menu next to the search button and um you just click that that and then you click on um seasonality and then put the ticker symbol in so that you're looking for the right thing it wasn't readily apparent so you know i had to like you know thumb through so i did that work for y'all so just go on ahead and look at that chart look at god he'd be knowing he'd be knowing tebow says nvidia is doing better than amd lord you know oh little brother now they asking for a stock charts uh login hilarious he hilarious all right so we covered amd let's get into qualcomm because it was running it was running pretty like high for a minute but like you say when report cards come out yo yo when the report cards come out and then we see what the real grades look like then essentially like yo we're sorry but uh qualcomm got sent inside in their own restriction so uh they ain't gonna be able to come outside and play with the rest of the with the rest of the chips for a while so they took a nice little dip and now they sitting so uh qualcomm you know they you know the interesting thing about qualcomm is is that you know they had a great run um especially it's like if you look at like companies like you know apple but though i know that apple's looking to go into its own you know band for 5g since they acquired intel's division of band technology for 5g so it should be interesting what the what the future is going to look like for qualcomm um especially as other players start looking you know to other companies um but i think that overall i think that qualcomm is going to be just fine i mean a lot of folks like to look at qualcomm as like a company that's like okay hey you're you're here you're kind of just floating around but you got to think about it like infrastructure takes time i mean we haven't we we are just at the beginning cusp of what 5g is i mean where qualcomm is really expected to shine is not really in the lower margin of like your cell phones but more so they're going to face high margin uh in areas of internet of things which you know we're still getting some of those you're also having laptops that those are going to be hitting the market much more uh so i mean honestly we're still in the early innings for qualcomm as it pertains to this 5g play though i will say this i wouldn't be surprised if qualcomm's looking to make some acquisitions this year because ultimately it's like yo you can't be a one-trick pony out here in these markets as you can see that this chip market is starting to heat up so when you got companies like amd out here working together with samsung and then on top of that you got them on the cusp of potentially acquiring xilinx as well um and then on top of that you got you know other players like broadcom which i mean they've been kind of quiet for good reason they got their head down working okay we're just gonna assume that they got their head down working i hope so so you know it's still early innings for 5g i mean of course don't get me wrong you had apple and verizon plastering at 5g 5g i think they said like when during their launch for the iphone they had it like i think they said it like almost 60 times and so with that being said it's like okay well a lot of folks don't realize that you know 5g infrastructure is going to take some time and ultimately the adoption as well especially if you had other folks that were buying significant phones from different product refreshes so again it's still in the early innings for companies like qualcomm though that the chips are being made but at the same token it's what good is the chips being made if nobody is really buying the phones yet so it's going to take some time but i think that by the time we look at the second half of this year i mean qualcomm is going to be a totally different company that is a fact okay so keep your eye on that um somebody said what about little boy blue turning up on us aka intel you know money flows through uh wall street like and so when somebody's selling out of one place i'm glad you're at that camp i was a little nervous yeah i had to use the one hand to like literally set it up but you know honestly i mean real talk i mean intel a lot of folks are trying a lot of folks are trying to start positioning themselves for you know what the multi-year will look like so they believe that this may have been the bottom for intel and they believe that essentially that there's a lot of strong upside i i just i just don't see the strong upside i mean don't get me wrong i think that intel's going to beat significantly on its earnings and stuff like that moving forward unless you know their short supply is just so you know dominant that it literally hurts them i think the biggest thing that we're looking at is that you know you got data centers which are getting threatened by nvidia as well as in amd and then on top of that you have let's say the desktop chip space which you're being definitely threatened by amt um it's going to be tough for intel over these next set of years i mean really really tough and i know that they've been discussing whether or not they're going to work with tsm uh taiwan semiconductor but i think that that doesn't even help them because taiwan semiconductor has already got so much backlog of other companies as well not only just chip companies but also think about the auto manufacturers that are also in this space as well so it's going to be tough and i think that one of the things that a lot of folks don't realize is that intel has its own foundry which means that they can design and manufacture and process their own chips the thing is is just that you know it's just not there like when you haven't when you did weren't thinking about this a while back and now you're trying to like literally embed this process in it's going to take a lot of money we're talking about billions of dollars in which you're gonna have to make the investment on which i see that they're doing or we'll just say a few billion dollars maybe like two where you're gonna have to make that investment to try to scale as fast as you can so that way you can be relevant and they're saying that they will get to what is it seven nanometer uh by 2023 but when you put that into perspective by the time when you get to seven nanometer by 2023 where will your competition be since tsm has already done the five nanometer process and i'm probably sure that their samsung is already working on the three nanometer process so it's gonna get a little rocky so i would just say be careful to a lot of the folks out there that are ultimately trying to jump on the intel bandwagon because of the fact that you see some volume going i think that what's happening is though that you see uh amd and nvidia kind of like trading sideways and just going through a period of consolidation the interesting thing is when you go through that and when people sell they want to put their money elsewhere so of course what would be the pivot strategy intel so you always have to say this fire beware well now it's like people are seeing a quote-unquote like live pivot but from the other side but um someone who was it oh i just saw it in the chat it's gone well anyway someone one of the cousins had mentioned that on cnbc they were talking about um a potential merger between intel and qualcomm um okay well i see the snicker but what i mean i'm not sure like what what that would do besides potentially well if they if qualcomm can get their five-year-olds on their mobile chat yeah so when you think about it like let's put this into perspective when you think of qualcomm chips they provide like their own processor and then on top of that they provide a gpu for mobile devices like tablets and cell phones and you know some internet of things devices okay there's that then you got intel which has a lot of like you know they're known for like you know if you think about it they were the ones that wrote moore's law so you know they're known for like you know being the pillar within the semiconductor space i mean they literally you know really help shape and define it the problem is is that when you lack the innovation because sooner or later and i think that it kind of like speaks to like you know the progress of like your jeff bezos of the world when you realize that you've reached the sunset period in the time of like when you think about being invented inventive or innovative um that you realize that okay hey it's my turn to kind of like bow out gracefully and let the new the next generation of leadership come forth and i think that intel missed that and then on top of that you also have qualcomm ceo i think it's mullinkov he's gone like he's no longer there anymore and so now you got like pretty much two new ceos at two companies in which that they're kind of like you know it's really kind of interesting to see where the future is going to be now will they not be existent in these markets no they're very much so going to be very existent and i think that sooner or later intel will get it together but at the same token it's just like you missed your opportunity to really like keep that foothold dominance and now when you let go it's a cautionary tale especially within the tech sector to realize that okay hey this is what it looks like when you get too comfortable and you stop innovating and when you see the true innovators they're innovating because of the fact that they're consumer based as well as like for you know their their average retail consumers as well as for enterprise you see that they're consistently innovating because they want to provide a better product for them versus like okay hey well we've got all this dominance we don't really see any competition so really what what's the point we can kind of like just slow down and that's exactly what intel did um so i mean it's you could see it but then the question is is like where would the value be for the two because yeah i just don't see the i just don't see it okay so not so much a turnip on intel but more so a two step all right yeah it's kind of like you know i'm gonna like you know i'm gonna sell out of you know these other positions that have made me x amount of return but then at the same token you know when i started seeing a little you know a little you know movement you know hey it's been real intel but i gotta go my my ride is here so we have some questions about um where did it go pivots okay um so it looks like cousins are wanting to know um let's see pivots what's the pivots move for long-term execution like how would you go about um setting up pivots for long-term execution good um so when i think about a pivot let's take a long-term two-year contract right so typically what i'll give myself is about a three-month timeline to look at whether or not anything that i'm reading or anything that i'm seeing is saying that the the narrative or the thesis itself is broken that's fair if i see that that thesis is breaking then at that point in time i've gotten i already must know what my pivot is so when i mean by pivot it's a company in which that honestly i get defensive or it can be something which said to this company's loss means another company's gain and so i'm looking to pivot during that period of time um now i'm not looking at say for example always the stock performance more so i care about the narrative of what's going on when it comes to the stock or when it comes to even if i'm looking at the etf a series of companies within the etf just to get the overall consensus of what the overall market looks like so if i see that something is broken within that thesis then it's time to pivot there are no if ands or buts about it if i need to hold for a little bit more time i'll give myself an extra two months and by within that two months i should see a rebound i should see that that's like rebound time if i don't see rebound during that period of time then it's time to exit stage right i mean there are yeah it's it's done so naturally about five months total huh will you take a loss to if that's the case yeah so i'll end up and take a loss but yeah i would rather take a loss realizing that essentially that i can step into something else and to recoup whatever it is that i lost into a better position that can perform well and versus sticking with a position that is ultimately just losing and it's just terrible and ultimately i can go from a loss to just like okay hey this position just completely i mean i lost everything okay someone asked um what is a example of um something being broken in in the thesis so what does it look like when something's broken in the thesis okay good question so let's say if you were going to go with the auto manufacturers okay so when we look at auto manufacturers let's say if you're looking to make a play on ford because i i think i sometimes go a little hard on the other company but y'all know who i'm talking about good morning um so then let's just say um you're going with the thesis of ford and ford is ultimately saying okay hey well we're gonna be a little bit slowed down on this ford f-150 because of the fact that we have a chip shortage so now i'm asking exactly how bad is this going to look and i'm looking at potential earnings down the road so if i'm looking at potential earnings down the road i'm saying okay hey well if does this hurt their delivery time of them being able to get this out to the consumer and on top of that will they have enough time to go through quality assurance quality control and all these other things and then on top of that will the consumer want to stick around to actually buy this or if they know this will they want to go to somewhere else so which means if i'm looking at if i'm playing ford and if i realize that you know hey ford isn't going to be there then i may look to say for example a tesla which may be my better play and the reason why i say that is because here's where the thesis comes into play where you can look towards it as a pivot the reason why you can say that is because if you if you guys journey back in time with me where tesla had said that okay we're going to pause our manufacturing on the model s and the model x series and then at that same time they were getting ready to go through this process of okay we're going to release these new model s's and model x's word on my street is i haven't heard anything about tesla talking about they've got a chip shortage they haven't said anything about that and last time i checked if you go to their if you go to their site they ain't saying nothing they said nothing on their site about like deliveries being delayed at all so with that being said and now i ask myself which company puts me in the best position do i stick with this forward position which that this can like potentially hurt and you know this is hurting them on production like you know and then on top of that you got other companies good morning that are talking about literally that their thesis was originally for 2030 and it's looking more like 2040 because of the fact that you're a little backed up right meanwhile you can pivot for somebody who's already out here and doing their thing and thus you would be pivoting that would also be like oil if you're looking at oil and realizing that the oil play is bonito here's another thing if you can predict the weather then you can predict the price of oil i mean that's a simple thing like predict the predict the weather predict the price of oil so if the weather gets cold and ultimately the value of oil should go up if the weather gets hotter then essentially well there you have it and then on top of that you have a lot of folks that are switching from oil to going to renewable energy so if i'm in an xle energy etf and i'm noticing that we're starting to see certain catalysts where that thesis of energy traditional energy being broken and we see that hey you know the economics and the quantitative data says this is where the future is and this is where the money is residing then literally at this point in time then maybe a 10 is probably your better play and thus you would pivot from if you were in xle then you would pivot to 10 solar etf which today well it was in the bottom three so it could be a deal okay okay okay still waiting on that legislation well we're gonna see we're gonna see um okay so up next we have this was a question um does everyone go speaking of like rotating and things of that nature does everyone going to samsung hurt tsm no i and the thing is is like you know tsm has a shortage but yet same token like you have to take into consideration these companies have long term contracts so a lot of these companies aren't going anywhere they're not going to try to break a contract in which that honestly you know tsm is out here because even if you try to go over there and run to samsung i mean you have to think about it samsung provides ships to all of its uh devices and we're not just talking about like their mobile devices we're talking about their kitchen appliances and everything else and then on top of that that also means that essentially that like the major sectors that are really hurting right now are auto manufacturers those are the folks at whom which that are getting hit the hardest because of the fact that the parts in which that they need especially within the chips i mean they're just not there because of the fact that a lot of these suppliers literally provide it towards other arenas and it's like okay hey well these have been kind of like our best performers now of course now when we talk about it in the form of volume that may swing but yet at the same token it's like you now send everybody over to samsung and samsung gets overloaded and then next you know tsm is like hey we're a little light you know if you want to come back over then it just doesn't make any sense so honestly i really wouldn't get too caught up in that at all i think that honestly you may start seeing partnerships that's fine but yet for the most part tsm is just fine okay i know father time is just happy about that oh he's going in on these comments i see his little blue name popping up all right okay let me see oh this is a this is a question okay that was earlier so oh okay so we talked about pivots and those are you know when there's basically when there's a dip in your position or the narrative changes what have you what are other things strategy wise um folks can be doing when there isn't it what can the folks be doing if there's an if there's a dip coming well one it depends on the strategy in which that you're in so if you're playing long term then you look at it in the sense of these dips don't really matter the dips are blue pretty much i mean there's just a small blip on the screen i mean honestly when you put it into perspective let me let me help each and every single person real quick i'm gonna try to see if i can pull up something we're gonna let's go to a chart shall we wow charts on a thursday okay i mean i cannot do it i mean i think you should i'm just saying so let's take say for example you know since everybody wanted to hear about emd we'll take amd oh they're salivating okay all right so let's go ahead and share this screen so as you can see here on my screen i have amd over the last year but when you put it out towards say for example a two-year do you really care about these dips or do you care about say for example the stock going from let's say 23 bucks all the way up to 87 right now of course if you're expecting that okay hey that you know hey mark that's covid i'm glad that you said that so let's let's go back in time here shall we so let's go all the way back to let's say 2017. wow 2017. you in the future mark the future is where i stay at yeah actually let's go all the way back to 2016 actually and let's look at it from 01 in january i think that this should give a good look of where we're at so again do you care if amd's trading at two bucks and then making it to 11 bucks and 31 cents or do you care about the dips in between yeah so when you're holding long term the blips you know it's just a perfect opportunity to research blown up on your thesis we could catalyst see if the narrative has changed all those things that we just discussed you know the crazy part is that a lot of folks probably are like sitting back and thinking about though check this out amd was once upon a time back in january of 2016 was two dollars and three cents imagine that and then bring it in to today where we literally we'll probably have to like refresh this but if we bring it in today i'm just looking at it over say for example year to date it's not trading at 87. oh what was that dip in february what was that the dip in february here yeah in that chart i just want to see what price it was at this is about the same this is so we saw it from 94 to say for example 85 so that's pretty much amd's incorrection right now okay if we look at it in yeah so if we look at it in perspective i always like to look at it from a one-month chart just to see exactly where you're at in three months here we were at our high at 97. we came back and ultimately now we're back at say for example 87 i mean the goal is is that essentially that we'll start moving out of correction now notice something here you had a lot of heavy duty volume of selling you had a lot of heavy duty volume of selling here and then what happened yeah heavy duty amounts of volume so essentially what you're starting to see is that essentially that there's a there's a trend here saying that there's a consolidation of sellers preparing to run up out of the stock now just for the sake of for folks that would like to look at starcharts.com let's pull it up for the people shall we we shall and we'll pull up andy's uh seasonality i'll share the screen with everybody just so that we're on the same page so if we look here at january february you make it bigger i can do what i can hopefully that helps folks yeah that is so we look at say for example january good month february kind of come down then we run up to march now let's go all the way back to 2016 or 2017. we had a major run-up 2018 2019 and 2020. so if we want to put it into perspective and look at let's say here we are so performance from 28 2017-2021 but if we look at february it's kind of like a known as a garbage month for amd when we put it into perspective so again honestly you know if you're if you're really worried um you're focused on the long term do you really care about what happens in say for example one month or do you care about what happens more so over the term of let's say six to nine months all right so you all heard it when there are dips you can either assess for a pivot which mark went through or you can tighten up your long term focus you could also buy more during the dip you know you can do that as well i mean it's a great way to dollar cost average so all right what's next let me see okay um so we got a question on thoughts on squares on squares road versus competition like sophie stripe um clover and paypal it's funny because i was actually planning on going through the big ideas digital wallets well let's go for it okay so uh as we as we continue on from our wonderful friends over there are confessed that we're dissecting exactly what they did let's talk about digital wallets so i mean digital wallets represents a 4.6 trillion opportunity in your pocket so what are we talking about here we're talking about essentially that we're going away from cash and i don't know i don't i don't know when's the last time i actually had cash i think my favorite time of you know never even having to pull out my wallet was when i was in barcelona and honestly i literally used my phone to pay for everything just using digital wallet to pay for everything um the interesting thing of where we see ourselves now is once upon a time we had cash and then we had checks and then from checks we had debit cards and credit cards and now we're at a point where it's just like honestly you just have your email email or phone number and so they believe at arc and honestly i think that they're pretty solid in which that venmo and cash app and venture funded startups are likely to up in traditional banking and i think that you're already starting to see that where even your credit card companies like capital one are even starting to get into the banking space um you're seeing a lot of online banks that are starting to come out of you know the woodworks to be able to supply for not only just regular individuals but also for small businesses and medium-sized businesses so they're saying that digital wallets are beginning to penetrate the full traditional financial services stack so that's including brokerage and lending that's true because when you look at what happened with cash app and also in some of the other apps you're able to buy stocks you're able to buy cryptocurrency you're also even able to like apply for loans uh like small or or small business loans through say for example square so honestly i mean i think that it makes all the sense one of the things that you may want to pay attention to if you're interested in square is pay attention also to their pos system and how that embeds across the entire ecosystem of square in their financial services because with that it was supposed to be the a la carte for small business owners or medium-sized businesses for their management employees as well as for lending as well so it's going to be interesting after covet what exactly that looks like so if we look at what happened in china mobile payments are at a two and a half x it's gdp so that means that it's two two and a half times its gdp size the entire gdp size for china so putting it into perspective um i think that they had it listed at uh from roughly 2 trillion in 2015 to an estimated 36 trillion nearly three times the size of china's gdp in 2020. so yeah if we look at it right now yeah that's about uh i'd say that's about 15 trillion dollars in uh china gdp but yet at the same token we're at 35 trillion in uh mobile payments in china just to put that into perspective and this has just been growing ever since and it's not stopping so here's how you kind of like break it down across the spectrum these are all the services in which that are used across the spectrum and of course we have some over in north america and then on top of that we have a few like say for example revolut which is definitely well known over there in europe shout out to our friends across the pond and then on top of that over there in asia they definitely use a significant amount of wechat how do you know this remember that time where they were talking about the ban of say for example chinese company wechat and then that also hit apple yeah so the reason why is because a lot of those folks use wechat to say for example use it for their marketplace payments to even buy either things with their iphone or to even purchase apple devices using wechat and then of course you have alipay which is through alibaba and you know so many others and then on top of that you also have africa you know to our friends over there our family in over there in the motherland and then on top of that we have uh south america which as you can see they have quite a few uh mobile payment services there where they're all digital wallet base and like i said this is just forever growing so when we look at it so jpmorgan chase uh deposit accounts versus cash app and venmo so if you look at it look at the mergers across the board where you had merger after merger after merger and then bank one acquisition and then washington mutual shout outs to my grandmother who used to work at uh washington mutual and left before all the shenanigans took place shout outs to you carolyn steer love you um and then on top of that look at the right look at how long it took for the rise of these things when you talk about the active users in the millions and then just look at how cash app and venmo have just literally just taken off and then think about it like this venmo started through paypal which started way before cash app well not way before but a little bit before cash app and just look at the look at the trajectory of where cash app is even looking to eclipse so cash app will probably eclipse you know traditional jp morgan deposit accounts this year unless jp morgan is like and we know that jp morgan is looking to get into um jpmorgan is looking to get into digital wallet space but the question is is that okay hey can you outpace cache app or say for example venmo do you think they'll try to acquire it's possible i mean it's possible though that i don't think that they're going to be able to acquire square i don't think they're gonna be able to acquire cash app but there's a few other services out there that you know that makes sense i mean for example you know there was somebody that was trying to acquire plaid and that deal fell through i wonder who would be looking to acquire it now so um let's go further so digital wallets can acquire customers for a fraction of bank customer acquisition costs so look at the cost of what it costs to to literally you know acquire you know customers for credit cards and then look at the cost for banking bank retail checking accounts look at look at the cost but then when it comes to setting up a digital wallet look at the cost you know consumer lending look at that look at i mean these are all the costs that it takes to actually acquire the customer it literally only takes 20 dollars just to acquire the customer now i do have to say that a digital wallet is quite leisurely super convenient as well so i mean this is one of the major reasons why you see a significant boom within the digital wallet space because it doesn't cost that much to acquire so bank branch costs are rising while their utility is decreasing so what we mean by that is the cost to say for example run a bank is very high but then at the same token their utilization so which means people actually going into branches utilizing sitting down and talking to their bankers is actually becoming kind of like non-existent where they're starting to see okay huh especially during covey times well you would think that right i mean look at the cost but look at the cost rise as it pertains to occupancy expenses per bank branch over the years like that's that's crazy like you have to take into consideration the leasing of the space and everything else or like the building you know the utility costs all of that that's pretty that's a pretty hefty cost to literally sit there and run a bank whereas you can literally just be digital pay the software devs or software engineers a wonderful salary in which they can keep making the platform more robust and then on top of that find ways to incorporate artificial intelligence and machine learning as well as deep learning so that way the experience becomes even greater and that's you know pretty much your banks are non-existent so traditional banks are facing potentially sizable risk so let's go through those real quick digital wallets are entering the unsecured lending market suggesting that traditional bank lending is is unlikely to recover to the peak it hit in 2019. according to arc it estimates that bank interest income on credit cards fell more than 10 or roughly 16 billion in 2020 and is likely to drop more than 25 further from 130 130 billion in 2019 to 95 billion by 2025 and then of course you have digital lenders such as square paypal affirm uh klarna and lending club are likely to take share from those traditional banks and that's true because we're already seeing it you know you're looking at and and as you move forward in the generations in which they're coming forth then this becomes their norm right it's like for example i'll give you a stark example when we talk about like what became the norm for say for example millennials was having a computer was having a computer or having a dvd player whatever it is now the next generation that followed like i always believe that there's two phases there's two stages in every generation so you have an older part of that generation and then say for example a newer part of the generation so the newer part of the millennial generation they grew up where it was like text social media it's all here it's at our fingertips even banking started to change a little bit because they didn't really deal with a lot of cash i mean they didn't really like they received gifts in in say for example deposits and then it's like when you think about like what the generation z is looking at they grew up with i like literally the iphone the ipad and maybe a few other android devices like for example chromebooks and all that other stuff that was their norm and so with that doing everything that you can on mobile experiences since there's so many apps in across the board that literally became the place where they are they're not and and think about how companies have also shifted like for example once upon a time you could buy a product and literally it was a one-time purchase now you got companies like adobe that no longer do one-time purchases and their business is subscription so it just goes to show you exactly how is it that the system itself has moved and of course you have the banking system the traditional banking system that try to get on board with a system called zell and let's just be real that system just couldn't keep up zell is i don't like though so when you look at the future of what's coming you know you have companies that are testing sending money over audio waves so and also using biometric and all those other things and that's all just going to be digital so which ultimately has no necessary need for really you know traditional banks unfortunately so each digital wallet could could be worth roughly twenty thousand dollars so they say the potential average uh the potential value for average digital wallet customer across commercial and financial products in the us so you have offline and online commerce so that pretty much means like you're shopping uh payments so your payment system whether it's like you know paying for things like bills and stuff like that and then on top of that you have insurance personal credit and mortgage saving and spending account and then brokerage like think about all those services all combined in one and i think that that's ultimately where a company like square is literally headed into where they become that pretty much ecosystem of the entire you know life cycle of a person's financial scope we have a lot of cousins that are saying they like zell i don't like zeal because they try to place a limit on how much you can send i don't like limits like that we should be living in a world without limits exactly financing so let's size up the opportunity shall we so they say in their research if each estimated 230 million uh us digital wallet users were valued at 19 900 in 2025 the us digital wallet opportunity could be worth 4.6 trillion now remember how that number came back where we started earlier where we talked about 4.6 trillion and this is how you kind of play it out you know digital wallet users by by you know by the millions over time and then looking at the value per customer rising uh at the same time wow 4.6 trillion yeah that is a lot of money yes and that's that i mean that's literally a digital wallet so when you think about even brokerages um you know i hate to say it but you know like you're going to probably see more things like robin hood coming to the forefront now whether or not you know they will be just as efficient i think that robin hood could be say for example an acquisition target um or if it goes ipo i mean i think it's still going to have a sour taste in a lot of people's mouths but overall my focus in my thesis probably makes robin hood an acquisition target to either one of the large investment banks or say for example one of the existing players that are already out there like if you had charles schwab gobble up td and then of course morgan stanley gobble up you know e-trade and then of course you've got fidelity out there then those are really the three major players now now what does that leave robinhood especially given that they've been going through quite a few ordeal of woes well so who does that look like as a potential acquisition target for this company to give it more emphasis as well as more validation as well as structure well you got companies like fidelity you have companies like jp morgan you also have goldman sachs and quite a few others maybe even city i don't know if wells fargo would do that but i mean we'll even throw their name into the hat but you know you've got opportunities there but for the most part yeah hmm also looking to see who how who has how much cash on hand position like that sure okay now um let me see that was really good i appreciate um arc invest in their big ideas okay so someone's asking you had mentioned adobe so someone asked is adobe gonna heat up or is this something to pivot out of i think that what we're looking at for adobe and honestly it's partly due to coven i mean now don't get me wrong adobe is doing phenomenal when it comes to their digital sales platform as well as their creative cloud is just you know it's out here and i think that once you're in the adobe ecosystem it's hard to get out and on top of that they started doing a lot more government contracts i think that that's not going to stop i think that also they have a plethora of things in which they can turn the lights on so honestly i'm not turning the lights off on adobe i would strongly urge people to go look at the seasonality for adobe because dobie had a great year last year and you know it's okay for quite a bit of these winners to literally take a break you know yes stocks do go up over a long-term trajectory of time and i think that some folks are out here literally getting a little bit too antsy expecting for things to cook like a microwave and we talked about this where it's just like you got to stop looking at every single company as a microwave stock because just as much as they heat up they also cool down just as fast like for example you know something that's really really microwave is just like and then just turned into flames because you left it in the microwave for too long was like your game stop at amc and you know many others and now it's like you got to sit there with this you know and eat this burnt meal which i feel bad for a lot of folks who wish got burnt uh in this process so but then you also have some uh physicians out there that are you know they take a little bit longer to cook but the thing is that you have to put it into perspective is you bought the time you bought the time and i know a lot of folks are trying to go for leverage plays sometimes leverage plays are not always going to be the route to go sometimes it's better just you know what sit down stay put and just chill you know one of the things that one of the great i'll give a lesson i remember one time um i was angry as a kid okay it's like dang when's the last as a kid i was i was i got upset about something and you know one of the neighborhood kids that did me like did something that just like literally just pissed me off and i wanted to react i wanted to react so bad and then my grandfather just pulled me aside and said sit down and just relax and the kid was like literally acting up like you know came like i'm sitting there on my stoop like like in like in my like my front porch while watching this kid who is like literally like just antagonizing me and just antagonizing me and then all of a sudden his mom shows up uh-oh and then it's like i i just witnessed poetic justice pick up and it was just by me sitting back and being patient and just sitting back and listening to my grandfather apparently he got in trouble with not only just like you know messing with me but also one of the girls from down the street and her father contacted his mom and his mom came home quickly and wrecked shot wow and so the moral of that story in which i i i i tell folks and it was the reason why i said it was poetic justice because just as much as he was entire antagonizing me in the street that poetic justice was taking place right there in the street and the reason why i say that is is not because of the fact of like in the sense of revenge or anything like that that's not the point the point is sometimes it's best that you just sit back and be still sometimes it's just best that you sit back be still don't be reactionary and just let things something things just play out and that's honestly how you sometimes have to look at the market you've already like put yourself you've already like given yourself the time you've already priced in say for example any potential pullbacks you've also did a significant amount of shaving when you were doing your strike price formulas so you paid for it so you may as well just sit back and watch now of course if the strategy itself the thesis is falling apart like for example let's just say that its magento platform is literally just like not there and they're not getting the type of sales through through other platforms and everything else if that's falling apart and if their digital cloud is also falling apart then at that point in time now we got to start having that different type of discussion but if that's not the case then honestly just just stay put you know stocks are going to have those moments in which they take breathers and that's fair i mean not everybody that comes into the market is a buyer some people have been in the market for quite some time and they want to take profit too so sit back and relax and deal with it or not that you're gonna pull up the shades oh lord okay so that was mainly yeah that was most of the questions there were i do have one announcement that i need to make but um that was pretty much the question there was a question about apple and hyundai um i can answer that okay so i mean and i'll i'll just address the whole auto manufacturing market the story told the story told so far so we've been hearing about apple making this apple car now we hear about them partnering up with kia and hyundai hyundai being a korean company um and it's interesting because at the same time that we're hearing about this this story broke about ford teaming up with google and that google's android platform will be supplied on or in a ford vehicle now i don't know what that's going to look like i mean they got google car you know so sure so when we look at it in the sense of autonomy i think that google's waymo service could also be embedded there through licensing through ford and then i think the same thing i think i said this a while back i don't see apple going through the process of doing their own manufacturing and spending that much amount of cash like because that's a lot of cash to like literally get in this marketplace i didn't see that happening what i did see is that them using leverages of software and whatever else r d that they're embedding and then bringing that to say for example working with certain car partners and embedding that system into again hyundai and kia now again we're dealing with a a chip shortage that's in this market so now you got companies like i'm just going to say it gm that lily has also promised to bring 35 electric vehicles to the marketplace so this ev market is heating up the autonomous driving market is heating up here's the problem this is where it's like for me i get a little nervous the reason why i get a little nervous is because now i'm starting to hear that everybody wants to make an ev vehicle okay there's validation and showing you that it's more efficient and everything else we got that part and then we're hearing about all this autonomy and which that we haven't seen that much road time on the road so it's going to be very interesting to see exactly how these things play out and what they will look like in real world uh experiences now they're testing it out in california from what i hear but again i'll believe it when i see it you got you know like i said you got google out here you got amazon out here you got chevy cruze or you know i guess that's gm working together with microsoft you also have apple out here and then on top of that you have nvidia which they're embedding themselves across multiple different car auto manufacturers and then you also have tesla again it's gonna be very very interesting to see exactly how this shakes out but like i said i'm nervous because of the fact that everybody's gonna try to find a way to skin you know to skin the cat here and i need some receipts i need some proof because we can't all be like oprah and be like you get it you get an ev you get a ep or you have autonomy you have autonomy you have autonomy it's like sooner or later i think that what you're going to see is that a lot of these autonomy uh providers are going to be out here and then sooner or later you'll start to see a consolidation because of the fact that you know they're just not accepted across the market and then you'll start to see that other players maybe start to gobble each other up i think the i think the company that focuses on you know putting together a strong neural network that is able to talk to the city along with talking to the vehicles then that's probably going to be your winning company so that sounds like tesla to me i mean it could be tesla but also the same token it also could be nvidia um it also could be google so those are the top three that i have on my on my list if i'm looking at it from you know best to not so best um i would probably put it at tesla because of the fact that they have way more real-world driving uh hours and then i would probably put google waymo and nvidia kind of very close to each other and then after that it just gets a little murky there because you know you say that there's zooks you could say that there's crews you can say all these other companies but again not the facial expressions oh here's the question that came in earlier but i forgot to bring it up um folks are wanting to know what is the deal with u.s steel infrastructure i mean are we talking about like the stock is kind of like underperforming over this period of time and like like i said you had companies that were trading at their 52-week high and now you've seen them come back and take a breather jesus i mean like everybody just expects for everybody to just be a world-class footer out here and honestly take no breaks i mean if you ever get the chance go back and watch usain bolt literally train for the olympics and like they would make this man run and then he would like stop and just like literally just have to hurl because of the fact that he was out of shape or whatever it is sooner or later you run out of gas and or you run out of energy and you need to go and get that recharged so i mean honestly we're at a recharge point let you know let these companies live but again like i said the sands of time are coming so we hear y'all and we have to come up we like to remain like we like our portfolio to be active actively managed and we like it to stay like you know in tip top shape and primped and pruned so you may be seeing some things come out tomorrow possibly latest saturday of new picks coming to the forefront i just want to put that out there it's coming yeah there's a few people asking about that well when is it coming it's coming it's coming all right well you know that was the majority of the questions a lot of uh repeat questions um i do want to make an announcement this is from cousin z mark were you able to see the um second uh meet the cousins video did you see it yet it's so um cousin z has put together a this is for the um the come up cousins facebook group so cousin z has put together a video series within the facebook group um called meet the cousins and she did the intro video she did a great job and now the next video up is coach head nice so you get to learn more about the cousins you know what they what they're up to in the world what their portfolios looking like those sorts of things um so if you are in the come up cousins group be sure to show coach head some love show cousin z some love um and get to know your cousins and this is perfect as we're leading up to the cookout shout out to the event planning committee y'all are fantabulous working hard and full of inspiration imagination i cannot wait to meet all of you in person yeah so i also want to say a few things to jolene congratulations for reaching 10k i mean honestly 10k strong on supporters as well as you know family of people and and you know i wanted to get that out before oh lord what's going on you know we're gonna have to change the effects here like real quick change the lighting set the mood okay we're gonna have to you know just we gonna have to bring it down a notch a little bit oh man i wish i had my it's probably packed somewhere my uh disco light look here let's get some sally and points out of the way shall we yeah go for it we here at the come up series believe in transparency so what we did was we should we showed you a burner account because of the fact that you the people should see exactly what is it that we were trading and what is it that essentially where some of our wins and when's where some of our losses were actually let me remove these we did that because of the fact that we wanted to consistently earn your trust the viewers and the family to make sure that essentially that hey we're not out here captain we're just showing you that essentially that this is what it looks like when you focus and execute now a lot of you uh may there there are a few of you that may feel some kind of way about that out there and that's well i mean then it's like maybe it's that's not fine maybe it's time that we as a people we as a community start being okay with being able to say okay hey well if a person is willing to teach us then let's see exactly what is the like what's their strategy i mean learn the strategy instead of like just doing the simple dangle the carrot over everybody else's head let's just teach each other it's more so in the sense about sharing your philosophy as well as sharing your strategy so that way truly people can learn a lot of folks have learned from me and my mistakes they've also learned from me also in my wins that's what brings it all around full circle so that way each and every single one of you become great traders in my portfolio you saw where i took l's and some of them i took l's on purpose but yet at the same token it's like i had a purpose within my portfolio there was a strategy if you notice if you go back and watch the video there were multiple xlk positions so xlk was always my strategy throughout the entire year and then of course i also had smh arc and xly yep those were my focus now of course i ended up pivoting over to tesla because i felt like it was a better play there's nothing wrong with that the thing is that we got to get to a point where and it's like like i said you know the whole if you bite my style that's fine if you're binding my style biting my strategies and everything else my my thing is just be transparent and just be honest about it that's all i care about and the thing is is like you know if you want to carry my strategies on as if it's your own or the come up series strategies as if it's your own and if that that makes you feel better that's okay the focus here is is that each and every single one of these people who watch us the focus is for them to win it's not about any of you know it's like and i'm gonna really say it like honestly there are folks out there that teach or that make more money through their programs than they may say for example within the market let me run that back for you there are folks out here that make more money doing teaching programs than they do say for example within the market our focus is and what we've always done is have you focused on the market and learned from the strategies and what we put forth that's always been the plan so there's no there's no confusion about it there's no mistakes there's no nothing you know exactly where we stand this is not a shot at anybody this is not a dig at anybody there's no shade here here's the reason why i took these off this is us coming together as family and saying yo this is where we at this is where we're at and the focus is the people and if your focus is not towards the people and if your focus is essentially yourself then maybe it's time that we like you know as leaders that lead the culture it's time that we start having hard looks at ourselves and saying okay hey well what is it that we're doing wrong and what is it that we can do better because i believe that we can always do better and if that's not you and if that's not your speed then that's that's completely fine you know if you want to throw shots at me on ig or whatever it is i mean i don't really care i mean honestly i really don't care these people that i see here that's that i hear their stories that i listen to them i hear about their journeys the thing i notice about each and every single one of you that are on the come up series is that you've gone from beginners to now scholars within a period of time that's ultimately how i judge anything i judge it based upon your knowledge your wisdom and then on top of that i always say the more you learn the more you earn and the proof is in the footing so i mean with that being said it's not it's i just want folks to know that this is no dig towards anybody out there no shots below the belt none of that it's all about making sure that folks who come from underrepresented groups aka us our people they win because if we as a people if we're not winning we're not one taking our reparations out of the market we're not building that generational wealth we're not providing a pathway for the kids that will one day follow us we're ultimately just perpetuating the same type of problems that have plagued our communities for quite some time so for me this is the last word you will never hear me speak about this again you'll never see me even talk about this again even if a person wants to test me to test my shell to see if i'm hard-boiled you won't even get a response from me because the focus is if that's that's the type of thing that you're looking for then honestly you come to the wrong place my focus will forever be about the people and the kids in which that honestly they deserve our time our energy and all on top of that our utmost best and i guarantee you that this year like i said it's all about us being legendary and we really really mean that and then on top of that too we're going to discuss spoiler alert we're going to talk more so about economics quantitative and qualitative we showed you some of the basics we'll still even bring those things in to show you how they play out and that's the reason why we're going through arc and we're going to even bring some folks that come from different areas from around the markets so that way essentially they can also speak on some of these things as well and this isn't going to be a fluff it's like essentially we're going to get down to the nitty gritty and literally because the focus is to give you the people the truth and the knowledge that's it well i can't wait i'm excited you did all right so i mean well clearly we got the leisurely over here like butter is just like in his own butter stays in his zone is he even awake you good yeah he's away okay he's like don't touch me fam i'm still waking up right look at him look at her oh butter all right so y'all thank you for rocking with us i mean honestly it was i mean hopefully you got some significant value out of it we we definitely want to consistently give you value in every single episode um we're excited for the things that are going to be coming down the road um but stay tuned more content is going to be coming because i i hear that uh season two of wealth rituals is making its comeback i hear that new episodes from the breakdown will definitely be making it as they come back and then on top of that you may even see some new bulls versus bear that will not look like me but you never know so um until next time i'm mark monroe and i'm jalen gc and the place to be and this has been your come up on hot day thursday we love y'all", "UkTZac2NFJs": "all right welcome back another yeah I'm good another challenge video for you today and today I thought I'd do the G sauce prints no scent and the same exact crappie slider a little swim bait I thought I'd use the same bait same jig head one sixteenth ounce of jig head same thing here ten minute challenge ten minutes east I'm going to do no scent for ten minutes and then I'm going to do the G sauce this time the G sauce my crappie calm for ten minutes and we'll figure out who the winner is I'm actually on this anchored up on the same brush pile I was yesterday and hoping these I saw a fish on the sonar so I'm hoping they're there at least hungry it's a little later in the afternoon it's about four o'clock so we're closing in on that time when these fish are probably gonna start to bite and I know I usually like doing these during the midday to kind of show the difference between scent force no sense because when you get later in the day like this these crappie especially there's there's a large number of crappie on this body of water and food is a little scarce so when you throw something like this in front of them they hit it but we'll see what happens here all right let's go to my I got the boom buoy throughout through my buoy out again marked on those brush piles let's get back over there throw this in the water we're gonna go no scent first then we're gonna go G sauce ten minutes each let's find out who the winner is here we go first up no scent just like I did last time and there are fish right below the boat so we're just gonna let's just try to vertically jig this oh yeah ten minutes everybody stop ten minutes on the clock I feel like that's I'm definitely caught out of frame there ten minutes on the clock I'm gonna run over my buoy ten minutes on the clock and we are going to start in three two one go I just ran over my buoy that's fantastic oh there's one right off the bat that's what happens you get right over the school one for the no scent and they yeah they're hungry right now they're absolutely choking these slider baits down a little more cloud cover today I'm thinking that's gonna help me hopefully hopefully that's gonna help me there's two well oh he's in the boat got a condom whoo hey hey hey knock it off dude so we got two and we got and we're what does it well most we're a little over we're about two minutes in what is going on there's three yeah I got a feeling we're gonna catch a mess of fish in this between the two ten minute segments we're gonna catch a mess of fish here oops didn't quite get him over the side of the boat there whoopsies copy number three and what we got for time here just three minutes in now yeah we're gonna we're gonna catch a mess of fish here oh no you let go and we got three minutes left three minutes left just when I said we're gonna catch a mess of fish I don't catch any I thought a couple bites but I might drift off this brush pile and give it a break here there's a big line of them behind me here so I might try those there's fish there there he is bigger fish hopefully it's a bigger fish oh it's cuz it's a bass doesn't count I'm coming crappie oh by the way this this is the fish one and a half are probably gotten crappie now bass but if you are bass fisherman here you go if you want to try some small swim baits try try these little crappie sliders loge I was hoping it was a big big crappie it'd have been nice we got time check wise before one minute left ladies and gentlemen one minute left there's a crappie and Tom Cech got about 14 seconds left 14 5 4 3 2 1 5 crappie I believe right there in that corner that's the number we cut crappie we caught okay so now I'm gonna throw some G sauce on then we're gonna put 10 minutes back on the clock that's the number we have to beat right here see if we can do it yeah here we go throwing some G sauce on there Oh yep spray it downwind please all right here we go please put 10 minutes on 10 minutes on the clock right there that's the number I got a beat for no Sensoji sauce starts in five four three two one and go there we go number one number one for the G sauce 40:47 seconds in that's even good number two right off the back no edits I would put the full twenty minutes in it's just that would be a boring video it'll be a really boring video especially if you see like three minutes and not catching anything there he is number two whoo that's a baby crappie was above the gunnel I know some of you in the comment section ever be like that didn't count in the boat that didn't count but it's my challenge my rules plus I'm very confident that this one is gonna blow the other one out of the water especially when these fish are stacked up like this there we go Oh little school moved in little school moved in there there he is four for the sauce time check in just a second here oh yeah time check four minutes left I've got four for the sauce we're already tied up even if you didn't want to count that one don't worry right there well right there number five there we go number six number six for the sauce the G sauce time check one second minute 12 minute 12 left there's a little better one not a huge one but we'll take it time check 13 seconds left 13 I don't think I'm gonna get another one here maybe and that's gonna end it well that is gonna end it for the G sauce versus the no cent challenge you can check out these Charlie Brewer crappie sliders in the description below you can also check out the G sauce in the description below G sauce well G sauce one but if you want to see this challenge again post it in the comment section below also if you got any

alive it's just the gulp but it the baits are soaked in there that whatever scent this is the emerald shiner by the way I'm just getting ahead of myself here I'm Davis this is the flop and crappie channel we do a lot of challenge videos like these today both Berkley products one is the gulp Berkley Gulp minnows and the other is a Berkeley power bait now the Berkeley power babe package doesn't have any well doesn't have any scent that it's soaked in it these are I guess dry you want to call them dry baits these ones have a Berkley Gulp they're actually soaked in some sort of scent and they do dry up after a certain amount of use so the challenge is gonna be a ten minute challenge just like the slab sauce versus G sauce we're gonna do ten minutes with the Berkeley power bait ten minutes with the Berkley Gulp I haven't seen any other crappie fishermen use the power bait Richard gene I've seen a couple different other YouTube crappie fishermen use B Berkley Gulp minnows but not the power bait not that I've seen anyway I'm sure they have and I just haven't seen the video yet but we're gonna start off with the Berkley power bait we're gonna do 10 minutes on the clock I hope I'm recording yes I am and then we'll switch it up ten minutes with the Berkley Gulp minnows find out who the winner is I am over 27 feet of water these crappie are just they're suspended all over the place like there's no rhyme or reason for these crappie to be here to be honest with you I just I was actually driving between spots and I saw a bunch of them on the on the sonar like there is absolutely no reason for these crappie to be here they're just suspended five feet off the bottom not no purpose there's no rocks it's it's like muck it's not even sand then there's a Midlake hump but that's probably a hundred yards away and then there's brush piles probably 400 yards away so I don't know I don't know what their deal is it's okay so there we go guys that's what the they're so far down and they're moving so fast that I don't know I can't quite get on top of them and that's okay so we're gonna start ten minutes on the clock please this is the Berkeley Power Bait and they're both I wanted to get the both the same pattern they're pretty darn close black emerald shad and then this is considered what is this well there's a black shad they're pretty darn close I couldn't find an emerald color for the Power Bait so what are you gonna do all right ten minutes on the clock we're gonna start in three two one go for 12 at the start 14 12 to end it there we go right below the boat right below the boat right there whoo bingo man they're deep though right I actually caught a few crappie somewhere decent I caught a couple 10 11 inch fish AK also caught a couple 3/4 inch fish so I don't know what we're gonna catch today I really don't hopefully hopefully have some more 10 11 inch fish + Oh Adam do they're right below the boo-oop don't get it caught in the troll in order that won't be good there is there's the first one yeah six inch fish well there's a bunch of different schools down there so hopefully hopefully we catch them T bigger ones here but that's fish number one for the Berkley PowerBait no scent we'll call it no scent I don't really think there's a whole lot of scent on it but oh no he had it too there is tighten up that drag it's a little bit better okay keep about an eight inch fish not what we want though but there's fish number two come on big ol twelve oh dang and missed him these are soft bites there is fish number three oh come on there's just so many schools on the on the bottom here kind of roaming trying to get the right one here I don't want to just do a numbers challenge I actually want some decent fish I know they're down there I've caught them already today there's some fish there we go come on serious fishing before and it's still a dink oops 12 home two minutes left two minutes and got four fish well it's no center its non-scented so wasn't expecting much man this is tough right now one their Dinks - they're all over the place you're not locating on to anything I'm just I'm just trolling around with my 2d hope there that there they go they're right under the boat come on something's got to hit it oh boy fifteen seconds left there's a fish this is still another dink so that's a fish number five I don't think I'm gonna get another shot it nope that's gonna end it right now five fish for the no scented alright let's just hop right into the scented bait I'm using same same style LED head jig head quarter out or quarter outs sixteenth ounce little jig head brand new package yes alright let's see if we can get more of these Dinks apparently the bite emerald shad Berkley Gulp here we go and school Rep a load about bingo oh wait 15:05 sorry I forgot the 3 2 1 countdown 1505 so 2020 505 is where we're going to stop on the GoPro Davis good job oh man right right off the bat holds it right off the bat number one still Dinks still thinks one thing I do not like about these Berkeley golf minnows they they get tore up real easy real easy and I'm not a fan of that oh now we took took the bait to not factor in the fact that these are these don't stay on the hook very well probably why they made in that way made sure people could buy them over and over again half the battle with this challenge is just staying on the school is oh that took a while for finish number two it's very tempting to throw some top water and a white bass or hitting top water but we're in the middle of a challenge there he is fish number three I'm gonna count it it was above the gunnel three minutes yeah three minutes left three minutes left for this guy what's it 5-3 right now and this thing's losing the battles been just getting on these fish why can't they be schooled uptight oh they gotta be all over the place I think it hard for my challenge video there he is there he is fish number four baby crappie baby baby baby crappie big school is shad that's what all these white bass are hitting on right now well write it right away fish number five they are not big fish at all what we got for time 10 seconds or 10 seconds left 10 seconds left can I get one more 4 3 2 1 oh I don't know shy count it it's a small crappie I don't think I should count it I don't know what this proves I will say one thing I'm gonna call it a tie even though I don't like ties these Berkley Gulp minnows they do work really well I've used them in other videos the one downside to them is they they rip apart parrot fairly easily but I always like having scent on the minnow so you know it's kind of like what do you do so that's gonna end it for this challenge video Berklee Power Bait verse Berkley Gulp I'm gonna call it a tie technically I might have had another fish for the Berkley Gulp I don't know 5 to 5 appreciate you watching oh so if you have any ideas for challenge videos I know this this one was kind of mainly because I couldn't quite get on the fish when you can get on the fish it's great when you can't get on the fish these challenge videos are not as great but if you have any ideas for challenge videos doesn't even need to be a scent based challenge video it's got any challenge videos at all Michael lures weird lures you know different stuff like that posted in the comments section I do read that I

posts so we are in quarantine and I was very stubborn for a very long time about getting any equipment to do stuff like this because I was like why can't we use the podcast stuff that's hooked up to a big computer that has its own setup and can't do it for this kind of stuff has to stay the same otherwise we have technical difficulties every every week so now I am set up to do this very simply you can make these videos and talk about you know the things that I like for the week this is me trying to help you out during quarantine want you to make it the best that you can I mean how the [ __ ] can you know who knows and before you judge me into off-white is $30 fake completely customized though completely custom that's my dude wavy underscore WX v w x VV y on instagram is the name go check them out one of my favorite painters and visual artists very cool guy good friend of mine so made this way better than Virgil here we go first house party act do you know about it it is for outgoing people I mean I would say if you're not into video if the physician calls at work are driving you nuts and you aren't facetiming your friends regularly this one might be a stretch but it is a really good stretch during this quarantine you have to find a way to talk to people and texting and writing out comments it just doesn't cut it house party lets you FaceTime basically video chat with your friends when you sign on it alerts all your friends hey Brett is in the house it's that way you know that I'm bored I'm checking the ass looking to talk hang around they can come on the app you can wave it people say hey come talk to me on here after you're chatting other people can see your chat and up to eight can be in a room and other people can jump in it's kind of like hanging out at a bar a little bit if you're if you're bored and want to just talk to strangers or people that you don't do it normally you know be video chatting with check out house party I'm on there I'm at Brett Payne be our East et Pai n I'm sure I'm gonna regret sharing that but you can add me in and I'll talk to you I have I have no problem with that oh I would love to house party with some of y'all just don't bother me with notifications alright next thing I love this week slave to the grind phenomenal documentary all about grindcore music basically napalm death was the genesis of a lot of this it's a type of music that's incredibly fast paced around blast beats which is just like this it's just like a hammering in your [ __ ] skull and you know it it was incredibly political napalm death is in there saying that their music was made to incite unease and zaboo quasi and you know going after the status quo they didn't say boo Swasey know i don't even say that I don't know why I did it Jake cut that out but you know they are going after the status quo they were trying to make something that was including inclusive of everyone which is you know I mean I always saw heavy metal as like this very macho straight white guy thing and you know it definitely has that but it's really more about being an outsider and I think that's why so many people identify with it you know the music is about caring for the victims of war I mean a lot of the music is about the people that are suffering in the world so I thought it was wonderful flavors a grind really really good documentary I liked it better than murder in the front row which is the thrash metal documentary that came out this year last year but I think slave to the grind is great and it's free on YouTube so go watch it alright there's only a few days left to this probably like a week by the time this video comes out the as modi humblebundle is out $12 you get access to board games on your computer on Steam like splendor small world Carcassonne Mysterium potion explosion site is incredible collection of games so if you're stuck in the house and you need something to do I have an old laptop like one of those the first time they tried to do touchscreen laptops you know in 2015 so thankfully I can flip that thing around and it's kind of like a board game and you know it's actually caused me to spend more money than I would like I played love letter on there online against people and got so fast on it and I just ended up buying the game so you know it's cheap to get in the board game thus the steam version of these board game but beware you'll probably end up find the full-fledged physical version which isn't a bad thing board games are always good to have around just remember that at certain point you got to start trading I don't know why I'm giving you tips on board game collecting that's an extra bonus for the video people eventually you hit a point where you have enough games and you're just choosing not to play them you can play your games 50 a hundred times they don't get old after two or three times of playing them you should be getting better at them and eventually you trade so I use BoardGameGeek if I want a new game I trade one of the ones that's sitting on the shelves because you know eventually you have too many games I don't know why I felt like lecturing you about board game management but that's what you get okay next on the list the game have you seen a game with Michael Douglas unreal movie classic VHS box if you're a kid it was like right at that high seeing mysterious I thought it was too stuffy I saw the suits and everything and I believe it I never let it permeate but this is like a weed guy special like this [ __ ] [ __ ] with your head it's really neat because the premise of the movie is oh this guy signs up for this game that's supposed to mess with his life and you're following along as the viewer and it [ __ ] with you too it [ __ ] you get [ __ ] with the whole time I'm not going to say what happens I think you should just jump into it it's a great ride it's thrilling there is a lot of intense [ __ ] you'll be surprised and it's it's a definitely legendary movie I'm gonna watch it again cuz it was [ __ ] a phenomenal and the second time through is gonna reveal a lot I'm sure stuff I missed lastly my thing my favorite thing this week is that Olive Garden Italian Italian dressing the original formula a high-octane [ __ ] well you know I became a homeowner and to fit my new life suburban lifestyle I started to go to Costco haven't got the membership yet but my wife is going with a friend and they were using their membership we're already signed up for all of the 30 packs of hello pandas and 44 ounces of testo and all of that [ __ ] raus tomato sauce the nice ass tomato sauce and in a family size bucket full of it but this Italian dressing from Olive Garden is the [ __ ] and I've just been putting it all over carrots every vegetable I can find I'm dousing it in these [ __ ] and this Italian dressing I hate all of garden I wouldn't eat there or order the food on any regular day but this stuff is programmed into my DNA it's like McDonald's at this point and you know it's uh it hits the spot and get you to eat vegetables and yeah I love it yeah I got a couple buckets of it so that's what I've been drinking thanks for tuning in you made it all this way this made it all the way through a high five Friday I appreciate it this probably isn't even coming out on a Friday but maybe you should maybe I should just make it come out on Fridays [Music] so thanks for tuning in to high five Friday I will see you all next week but don't hold me to it because I have problems with mental illness and like manic depression where I would sometimes disappear for like three weeks at a time and then beat myself up about it but honestly I'm trying to keep it more down the middle and hope to keep this moving on a regular pace street fight is trial we have project management software which I'm doing but we had to do it we use this program and it's really helpful for me actually because I can assign tasks to people and I can stay up all night long just like shooting tasks that people to keep everything moving at a quicker pace so the scenes are gonna come back in a bigger way you know they're gonna start hitting every two week every two-and-a-half weeks really every 15 days I don't know probably do them every two weeks is the plan so signing up for a lot but we're also prepared to expand the content that's coming out and make up for all the scenes that we owe everybody so that is happening in a very big way and we appreciate your time and effort we got Colin show on Sunday that's going to be awesome uh we heard from the guitar center guy on last Sunday great call I also love the word recommender I'm also going to start doing a reaction show on YouTube I'm gonna start doing videos of reactions so subscribe to

"Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. This symbol, commonly called a Yin Yang symbol, is a taijitu meaning diagram of the supreme ultimate. The principal of Yin and yang, opposites existing in\nharmony, is associated with ancient Chinese\nphilosophy. But the very first use of the iconography,\nthe classic symbol, actually comes from a shield pattern\nused by the ancient Romans seven hundred years before its first known use in China.\nA connection between the two has yet to be found.\nRegardless of who came up with it first, the symbol was a bright idea.\nBut what's the brightest object in the entire universe? Well, apparent magnitude. Commonly used when stargazing refers to\nhow bright an object appears to us, say, when looking up from Earth. It depends on Earth-centric factors,\nlike how close the object is to our planet. Magnitudes are logarithmic and arranged like golf, where a smaller number means a greater brightness. But today I'm looking for absolute magnitude, a measure of how bright things all over\nthe universe near and far would be if we looked at them\nfrom the same distance. Absolute magnitude will guide\nus to the most blinding light in the universe, irrespective of it looking faint to us here on Earth, just because it's far away. The difference is significant. A 100-watt light bulb placed closer than 8 centimetres - about\n3 inches - from your eye will appear brighter than the Sun in the sky. But that's not fair. If you could see the Sun and the bulb from the same distance, the Sun would be\na septillion times brighter. That's bright. But the Sun shines punily compared to the rest of the cosmos. If you could line the Sun up with\neverything else out there, giving every star and cosmological\nphenomenon a fair chance, the Sun's absolute magnitude would be 4.8. Not bad. But check out R136a1. This nuclear fuelled beast isn't the biggest star in terms of volume but it's 256 times more massive than our Sun.\nIt's the most massive star ever found and it's also the brightest. Remember that lower absolute\nmagnitudes are brighter. R136a1 isn't 4.8, like our Sun, it is -12.6, which means it is 8.7 million times brighter than our own Sun. But R136a1 isn't the brightest thing out there.\nWhen a giant star dies, it explodes violently in what is known as a supernova or hypernova. As I mentioned in my video 'How Hot Can It Get?',\nsupernovas can eject terrifying flashes of radiation known as gamma ray bursts.\nArguably, the brightest electromagnetic events in\nthe universe. A typical gamma-ray burst releases as much energy in a few seconds as our Sun will release altogether in its entire 10 billion year lifetime. If WR104, a gamma-ray burst future candidate, directly struck Earth with such a beam for only 10 seconds astronomers predict it could deplete 25% of our ozone layer and lead to mass extinction and starvation. The largest thermonuclear bomb ever detonated didn't do anything close to that and it\nwas exploded right here, in our atmosphere. Whereas WR104 is eight thousand light years away.\nYou can't even see it with your naked eye or a pair of binoculars.\nBut gamma ray bursts are merely brief events lasting only a few minutes at most, sometimes just a matter of milliseconds. If you want the brightest sustained thing, you'll paradoxically have to look at the darkest thing. Black holes. To be fair, dark matter is ostensibly darker. But because dark matter has been hypothesized to not even interact with light, with electromagnetism at all, calling dark matter \"not bright\" is kind of like calling your peanut butter sandwich \"a not fast airplane\".\nIt's not really even in the same category. Black holes, however, do interact with light; reflecting so little, well, they don't let any escape, at least not in a form resembling the way it came in. That's dark. But the intense energies created by\nblack holes in the process of eating things like stars is anything but dark.\nGas and debris from the stars they eat swirl into arcipluvian cosmic gallows known as accretion discs before making their final death plunge\ninto the black hole. In the disc, debris spins at unfathomable\nspeeds, pulled around by a black hole billions of times more massive than our Sun.\nFriction in the accretion disk generates heat on a level difficult to fully appreciate. Just as hot things glow, the disk does too. So brightly it has its own name. A quasar.\nQuasars shine thousands of times more brightly than even the brightest stars. I'm kidding, it's scarier than that.\nQuasars shine thousands of times more brightly than galaxies containing billions of stars. The first identified quasar, 3C 273,\nhas an absolute magnitude of -26.7, making it four trillion times brighter than our Sun, about 100 times more luminous than the\ntotal amount of light produced by the entire Milky Way. If you put 3C 273 33 light years away from us it would\nshine as brightly as our Sun -  a mere 8 light minutes away.\nBlocking the brightness of a quasar with the corona graph reveals that quasars exist in the\ncenters of galaxies that are larger than them in area, but are, nonetheless, drowned out by their light. Such galactic centres are called active galactic nuclei. The bulk of their energy spewing forth\nin the form of a powerful radiation jet, the length of which puts even our solar system to shame.\nThe visible part of the jet in this photograph, for instance, is so\nlong it could stretch from the Sun to Pluto and back, one-and-a-half million times. Now, specifically, if a large portion of\nthis ajected energy heads toward Earth, it's responsible for what we call a quasar. But if Earth is right and the active\ngalactic nucleus' sights, it's got a scarier name: a blazar. And it's blazar 3C 454.3 that clocked\nin the greatest brightness ever observed.\nAt historically high levels of activity it registered in absolute magnitude of -31.4. To put the brightness of quasars in yet another perspective, take a look\nat the one hundred thousandth picture snapped by the Hubble telescope. This is a star a few hundred light years away. And this thing looks just about as bright, but it is a quasar. 9 billion light years away. Why are quasars so far away? Well, a quasar is not forever. They are billions of light years away, which means the light we receive from\nthem, the pictures we take of them, are pictures of things happening\nbillions of years ago. They represent a phenomenon more common early in the universe's history, when\nmonster black holes hadn't eaten all the stars around them to fuel their\naccretion discs and before those holes became too fat to be active. Neil deGrasse Tyson points out that in order to remain a quasar producer, a black hole must consume about 10 stars a year. Many consume more than a thousand stars a year, 600 Earths worth of matter every single minute. The more stars a black hole consumes,\nthe larger its event horizon becomes until, eventually, it no longer shreds stars apart to fuel an accretion disc.\nInstead, it just swallows them whole in one dimmer, but still terrifying, gulp. Quasars are some of the most\nancient things in our universe. If you could teleport instantaneously to one right now faster than light, it would most likely\nno longer be burning. What we see are just their ghosts. Light that left when they were active that traveled longer than they could live. But quasars can still be born. They can even be born right here, in fact. In my video 'What Will We Miss?' I pointed out that\nthe Andromeda Galaxy is headed our way. In 3 to 5 billion years it will collide with our own galaxy, the Milky Way. And the collision could rearrange stars near the\ngalaxy's central black holes to be consumed, reigniting a quasar right here, in our galactic backyard. Funny enough, right now very few of us even see Andromeda, even though all you\nneed is your unaided eye. Light from our cities drowns out the night sky like a quasar drowns out its host galaxy. Artist\nThierry Cohen mocked up what big cities would look like if all their lights were off and the sky above them could be seen fully. New York, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tokyo, Los Angeles. It's beautiful and rare. In the 1990s, during a blackout in the city of Los Angeles,\na number of residence actually called the police they were\nafraid of mysterious glowing clouds hovering above the city. They were seeing our galaxy for the first time in their lives. At night, artificial lights allow us to see what's around us but we lose what's above us. The brightest places have the darkest, emptiest skies. There's Yin and Yang again. A taijitu\nhas actually been lurking in this video the entire time. The brightest things in the universe, quasars, are caused by the darkest things in the universe - black holes. The process that unshackles the most light is caused by the thing that best imprisons it. And as always, thanks for watching.", "UMngXjJjVuM": "[Music] [Music] [Music] hey guys I'm going to show you just a kind of a little comparison between crappy niblet by PowerBait or Berkley or you know any of those guys that you can get in the stores and the new Potts key crappy fireball this right here is by PowerBait it's a it's a crappy never Neville and as you see it's just a little piece of dough bait you know when this is on your jig it's like I said it's a little dough bait and I can take that and it's just like playdough I mean if you can see that a minute's you know it just doesn't stay on the hook very well especially especially if I'm casting or shooting with that it just won't do it this is the new Foskey crappy fireballs this is a synthetic material it's almost like a plastic and you can see it I can squeeze that I mean I can try to break it I mean I'm squeezing hard as I can it will not break it stays on the hook much much better than just old regular dough bait that's why we use these things that's why we believe in them I don't have to change that thing out every every cast every to cast I mean I can I can sit there and actually shoot a dog with these things tips on my jig and I don't you know it last for a while um you know I'll be honest ten ten to fifteen cast is what we're getting out of one single ball we're getting 10 to 15 dots use dot cast off one single ball and where the dough bait we'll get one so you know just to show you that little comparison there maybe that'll help you out the next time you're on the water these are these pots cue fireballs I will tell you this they are a little smaller and they are slippery but I can tell you once you get these things on the hook I'll take one out and i just take my jig and hook it right through the middle and that's what it's going to look like once that's on that hook you have to really really just bang it up against the pier or fluff or cast I mean you really have to do some crazy stuff to knock that ball off it just stays on so much better than a normal dough bait does and that's why we use these [Music] [Music] you", "ydsbxiAlElY": "good morning folks you know let's just get straight to the point right here in the pointiest cent you know I get a lot of questions what do I think in my opinion of course this channel is only based on opinions nobody knows it all when it comes to the sport of fishing no doubt but cent is really the topic today and I I have a lot of different kinds this is a Power Bait sent it says bass attractive but now Power Bait puts out a crappie sent to I run ours I bought me five or six of them at one time about two years ago now I've run out of it but higher bait is what I've used for years this is a bass attractant but it really don't matter the main thing about sin in my opinion this is only one man's opinion it's very important before you actually get on the water and go fish and there's a lot of things that you handle you know our own natural scent is known to be to be very bad you know when it comes to animals or fish it's been a proven fact however before I realized or in my opinion that scent was important when I was a kid when I was younger I never didn't use it and I still caught fish and still good today but it'd be much harder because of recognizing the fact that we do stink not just us before we go fishing we handle a lot of different things if you'll think about it well pump or ball above will give a little gas smell on our hands all stuff of that nature then we're handling our bait constantly so that's another reason why I think that scent is really important thinking like that you know naturally it would be throughout the day a fishing I believe that I catch more fish because i religiously use sin now that's just the confidence builder in me that makes me believe that I'm gonna catch more fish therefore I do okay confidence is a big key in fishing there's no doubt if you don't believe in it well then you probably won't if you do then you most likely will now here's another attractive right here's a crawfish sent young that would work any bass attractive that'll work but today or I have been in these videos I'm using slab saws now I like this sent above Power Bait which I've used for years like I just mentioned but for the simple reason it has more of a smell to it okay and it seems to last longer i mean i'll throw what you got there a few times in the smelly okay i'll just tell you the truth and i'm still smell it on the bait now there's no doubt on plastics after a few casts this scent is going to wear off but on handmade baits or hand tied jigs which i love to use I'm an old-timer it sticks with it longer account of the material that these jigs are made out of but either way it don't take but a drop or two you don't have to just douse it where it's running off ooh just a couple drops to mask your odor and other odors I am her let's put us on this concentrated fish attracted on here slab salt spray on luring chicks crappie I don't doubt it this stuff has got a stronger scent I just put a little bit on there it's got a stronger scent than the power bait this is some deep stuff I'm gonna be setting it over about 20 feet of water at all times folks look here look in here look in here that fish was deep okay man that's some black crappie and a male ix that Purdy let's let him go right here get on back in one let's get you up Hey let's get in here and get a visual if we can it's a dark day but now this is a chartreuse color I can't without following down the can you see that sea salt type action right there I hope y'all can see that you can cast a jig like that that's that flexible or you can vertical jig it or you can fade like I'm doing today I call this fate I don't know if there's a term for following our tree trunks down and limbs but hey I'm catching fish look them old coot right there all I do is poop and eat grace eat grace and poop there we go now that's a crappie I can tell by them head shakes that law so I may have found something right here before the thunderstorm that's my quarry right there yeah these are big song all right come on boy they may yeah I got I may have some fish found here right here I might blowed the boat I don't know before it starts raining but I want you look what a fish and that's a big it's a beautiful fish too that's what we're talking about right there you don't back in there but let's see if we can't you know there we go there we go let me let off his drag it's a good fish yeah like real good fish or you just mean one he bows he's a good fish and he's man I tell you what they ain't nothing like a sport of fishing come on in here now this is a broad crappie this is what I call a real brown crappie check that out see how girthy and browns that's what it's all about yes I see it right there let's let that pretty thing to go nah I never keep hardly ever during the spawning the reason why I want him to go ahead and do their job and that's all he wants to do right now is reproduce but now the fairs of fact about if I was hungry I'd eat that fish okay that's the contradictory remark but it's true there we go that's a crappie well Richard how do you know soon as you hook them they'll do a head shaker - let me get him out of that corner because it could be another one they'll do that good handshake I don't want to tire that hook out ain't got the two-pound line today Oh so we'll just bring him right over here I believe it's a female sure where is big female yeah we're out of that corner now she's pretty here in the Sun like that let me get right y'all I knew that burst the wind was gonna come in here here we go hey hey that jig just popped out that's good she shook her head that's what they do when you set the hook the first thing they do our instinct is to get that out of their mouth they don't like that that's a nice fish right there myself actually a big crappie say hi the sport of fishing I tell you what let's let her go I'm gonna have to get down there why slay connealy Henry yeah I'm now I'm missing a lot of good fishing that way to get on back there's some huge crop being them two systems right there I won't bid again Elmo there we go - that's what it took and that's the crop ok I mean get over here I don't blow in there for nothing they could be three or four more bites in there you don't never know you don't never know see that away the head shapes they cannot stand that jig in their mouth like that that fish is resenting it right now and I don't blame me I wouldn't want to hook in my mouth but I'm gonna let this fish go so she'll she'll definitely Lee over yeah mom wants some quality crappie I mean Guntersville like has everything huge crappie huge bass huge catfish everything in Gunnar's will gets big let's let that fish go I'm just going back do you job Ichi not today Hey look here yeah drop it head shake head shake out come on out here see what we do we loosen that drag a little that's three fish without tying that two pounds flying again that's dangerous to Poundland I'm gonna start doing that one pound line here pretty shortly now that's a lot of fun you talking about a lot of sport look here that's a good fish right there Oh yeah I know what we're gonna get you right now come on you're done I can tell when you're done I've done been through this before us a huge crappie wow it's big I can't when he gets into that head-shaking thing I can't already hold him there there that is a huge fish we must let that one go going back you Tennessee River fish you know back in folks I tried to move I was gonna go across the river and try to catch a few or find some but it's just too rough so what I'm gonna do I know there's some bites in here I know that what I'm gonna do is change colors what I'm gonna do right here we'll see what else we got we got all kinds of stuff we got 2.5 s but today I want to take a finesse approach and there's a reason it's because of these funds I believe a smaller bait catches more fish that's just my confidence that's just in my confidence so I'm gonna go ahead right here and put this little bitty white one on with a size 8 hook and a float and see if we can get a couple more fish to bite now this is a good color too I might use I'm gonna pull one of these out all right now like the 1.75 because they have a small body and a lot of whip in that tail so I'm going to pull one of these out and then one of these 4 inch point 5 inch and a half baits which I've done well on these right here under float see this is size 8 hook so what I'm going to do is take it and bend it at an upward angle just a little bit more of an angle so it can get a better bite because it is a small hook and now I'm ready okay everything's ready there we go see they can't stand that I've made I don't know how many cast in there with a jig just by casting they cannot stand to bait to be right in front of their face now I've studied this for years years and years now I got a size eight hook so I'll just take my time but now that eight will hold him just as well as any other size the reason I've got that eight on there is because of the size of the jig so you want to match the jig head to the size and hoop size to the size of your jig you wouldn't want a jig head that had a size four in it for such a small jig now would you or I would there's a good crappie see that hook is planted and I mean planted well that's a big fish right there and I used that color right there the 1.75 I love them I mean I I mean I love them things golly I'm what a fish that's letting go you know back in there boy I can't stand it that will make an inactive Fischbach just about every time floats go I mean don't drag me just loosen it just a little clay crappie crappie speckle perch what else what else we call this I got a lot of names fish I simply love the catch now he don't know or you don't know I believe that's the female will see right here in just second I changed to the inch and a half the white one I got real finesse for and got that back time on science a hook doing the job Etta normally I always get them right here besides a tuile but not always but normally alright perfect day today I guarantee nothing like it let's let that fish go floats come I turn to the boat right earth the boat I thought I say I said my last goodbyes right there but I looked at the the radar and I got about thirty minutes left before this thing's on the hip that'll give me time to load this boat up keep from getting wet out here give me plenty of time the helm I was out here now he would be panicky but I'm not I've been wet before now it's a good fish I take it real easy with my count of this size eight hook it's not a recommended size hook at all but for these small baits it's perfect whether it be bluegill or crappie if you'll just take your time you'll you'll get them just real so we're real little hooks to them talking about that size a to get him right there every time and they're not gonna come unbuttoned just lift your rod and gentle hook sweet and then reel and then you got him it ain't no problem let me do that lice good-bye again now you see this this fish here I'm on barely sees pea and see that now these crappie are spawning there's a small group right here I couldn't get no word today account account this rough weather so I had to really pick apart just this little area mainly and right back here I did go across the light catch two or three and I was limited today so I had to figure out these fish just like I do every day but let me do that goodbye again y'all know what I'm talking yeah wait now I'm gonna put you on tape and say watch you okay here's the riots home goodbye [Music]", "KqAA-Z676Mw": "[Music] all right all you crap ease welcome back you asked for it so here it is the scented versed unscented jig challenge so what I got here is a 1/32 object jig head with the some sort of minnow plastic lime-green crappie slider charlie Brewers and I'm gonna rig up two rods with the exact same setup I'm then going to spray one with the slop sauce from crappie calm and one I'm just gonna leave as a plain plastic then we're gonna see which one catches more let's get to it alright so on my nine foot crappie hunter Pole from Shakespeare I'm going to spray on some of this slop sauce a little minnow lime-green minnow paddle tail thing didn't have a name on the bag so OH we're you so why I always have a towel in my boat okay so now I'm gonna throw both over the edge I'm gonna throw both of them as soon as I get this thing untangled all right so now I'm going to throw both of them over do a little vertical jig style see which one comes up with the most fish tonight what what is that No okay how do I got a snag from vertical jigging that doesn't make any sense there we go gun it out like I hit right away well maybe I can't throw it over right over the side of the boat cuz there's a big brush pile there that's where the crappie are that's also where I'm gonna get snagged up there's a fish on the slop sauce feels like a decent one cuz it is a decent one there we go just solve it start right there nice 10-inch fish I'm gonna throw him back though hope had another one in that I'm the one without this sauce alright so I don't know I'm gonna count this one fish in the boat for the slob sauce but I also have one bite on the non slop sauce this also could be a test to the actual bait itself I don't know what they're called another Charlie Brewer but I don't know what they're called well there's a fish on cripes I'm doubled up nope I'm snagged on this one snagged on the slob sauce and wow that must have been a big fish I know I still got him oh yeah that's a nice one that's a nice fish that's a nice fish I'm thinking this is more of a testament to the actual jig itself that's probably a 13-inch crappie right there that's going in the box and I'm snagged again come on come on I felt like he came off there for a second I don't want to break off it's gonna ruin my challenge and knock it off you log all right since I broke the one off and that's the only kind I only have one of these ones I won with the same style of bait only it's a white and a chartreuse tail is everybody recording now good look I'm just hitting bottom oh there's one there's one even slob sauce he doesn't feel very big though oh maybe is never mind never mind it's a decent-sized fish right there it's another he's probably a 10 and a half so what do i what do I even have so far I'm have to look through the video I think I got two on the slob sauce one in the boat on no scent and then I missed one on the nose scent I'm pretty sure that's what I got so two to one with one miss the misses are on me keep them throwing back I know there's some bigger ones in here now thinking that paddle tail effect as it floats down to their sinks down to the bottom that floats down to the bottom it's not even a thing oh it's slowing that it's that slow drop I think that triggers a nice bite but you got to be watching your line they're old I couldn't tell I think that was a bite I think there's a Miss on the scent so I got two fish on the scent we want on no scent and one miss on each there oh my goodness okay two misses on the scent there's one there's one on the scent you know they're they're decent fish it's just they're not as big as those last ones don't get me wrong these are nice fish this is an 11 inch crappie I'd take this every day I just there's some 14 down there I know they're down there all right so three on the slop sauce resented to - by the way no three two one right and then I got to miss Sun scented one missed on non-scented I should write this down good thing I got this on video but this is gonna be a pain in the butt to look through looks at all the footage just get my numbers right [Music] I got one Oh had one on the non-scented so that's two misses on the non-scented that one felt like a good fish to go right below the boat I got someone around here oh there's one on the non-scented yep yep you still there I think he's still there oh I was messing around with a nonsense oh no he's still there all right got one on the center - they don't feel very big nope they're not well that one counts I was messing with my drag so I got four scented three three unscented there's one on the scent not a big one uh-oh lots of school nothing good what in the world there's one in the scent but I lost the biggest doesn't feel very ya know what I thought you'd be eight incher there's one scented I think there's a six-month scent that's a decent one that I want to since I'm not catching these uh-oh these four teams anymore I'm gonna throw this one alive well because I don't know where they are it's about a ten and a half inch fish right there he'll still eat pretty good oh we got one on the unscented to a little bit smaller it's about a nine inch or nine and a half he'll go back I'm gonna have to really go through these visit these video clips cuz I have no idea where I'm at right now I think I'm at six to six to four maybe unscented he won't sense it again tiny tiny tiny fish is not even a six-inch crappie why do I have my title back there I should really just keep this in my side don't sent it again till I get him no no that's a Miss on the unscented one there's one on the scented I'm in the wrong school there we go there's one on the senton uh nine inch fish ouch and got the hook in the hand I know he's probably about an 8-inch actually there's a good one that's a good fish on this one scent it feels like one anyway there we go huh nine and a half well thanks all right next fish whichever one and then I'm done actually I should be fair and have a rebuttal for the one that doesn't catch one but more Nicole bass fishing there's one on on the crawfish loss not very big though nope he's a dink not what I want another one for the other side which is not the crosswalk alright that is gonna end it for me I think the four last two fish one of each on the scent adversity unscented so like these videos these kind of challenge videos smash that like button and as always if you're not a subscriber at the end of the video see my face holds a crappie you click on that to

", "De6H0eFrfvY": "so in this video we are going to be getting set up with foundation using Bower and gulp and if you're not sure our and go our don't worry we are going to go into that briefly just so you can understand the benefit of why we use this otherwise if you know what Bower and gulp are this is just going to be very much a follow along just so you can get set up properly and start to customize foundation in the right way rather than overriding lots and lots and lots of styles and creating additional styles so first of all let's just take a look at foundation I'm sure if you're watching this video you know what foundation is front it's a front and framework lots of components some JavaScript libraries as well that run off jQuery so we're going to be getting setup with what you can see here we've just got a basic navbar this drop down here so actually control with CSS but we are going to be including scripts here as well for things like alerts and the other components as well and you can choose which components you want to include in your project to reduce your JavaScript file as much as possible so Bower on the other hand is a package manager for the web so what we're going to be using Bower for is pulling in foundation as not a dependency but as a package and then with gulp what we're going to be doing is we're going to be building our front-end requirements or front-end files we're going to take the Bower components folder and look through that find what we need put it in the right place push files together or and concatenate files together and then we'll just end up with an app dot CSS file and an app J's file and this is really useful because it means that you can do things like eventually down the line minify CSS all in one go we're also going to be briefly looking at watching as well so gulp gives you the ability to basically watch files so all the compilation of files and all other processes are just done as you change files basically that's probably the easiest way I can explain that so this is what we're going to be doing we're gonna get started completely scratch and we're gonna start to build up everything that we need and and end up with this result and just make it a lot easier to manage your front-end and manage foundation in particular so before we get started let's take a look at what we're working with initially within my text editor all I have is just a basic document there's nothing here at all and you'll notice that I'm working within this root directory project but then I've got a public folder within this with my index to HTML file in and this is really important because all of our node modules Bower components the assets that we create which will be our custom scripts and custom Styles files will be outside of this directory we don't want we don't need them to be publicly accessible it's not massive it's not a massive problem if they are but it's best to keep everything tidy like this so the public folder that we're in here is going to be your your root directory your publicly accessible directory so you're obviously going to need to install certain things to work like this depending on how you're going to eventually be hosting your project you're going to need these installed on a server as well but once you get to grips with this that shouldn't be too difficult when you do get to that stage so the first thing that we want to install is Bower so if you head over to bower i/o it gives you very clear instructions of how to install this and you need to use NPM to install this so make sure NPM is installed as well so checklist item one is NPM number two's Bower and then third you want to install gulps if you go over to the github repo you can see exactly how to do that with NPM so that's pretty straightforward once you've got them installed globally we're pretty much ready to go so the first step then is to initialize a bower project so we're going to head over to our text editor we're gonna keep this open we're gonna bring up a terminal I'm currently within my directory here and not in the public directory in the root directory and I'm gonna type our in it and this is going to create a bower JSON file for us this might take just a little minute but it's going to prompt us for our project name so I can just type project here we're gonna give a version so I'm gonna say nought point one point zero or something a description a project all of these are optional by the way main file we don't really need to specify here we don't need to specify the types of modules either we don't need specify keywords authors or license home page set currently installed components as dependencies we don't have any so let's just skip past this and add commonly ignore fast ignore list I guess we can do that as well would you like to mark this package as private we're gonna say yes and does that look good so you can see here we've got our name of our project version the authors we've got a description the licensed private is true and we ignore like commonly ignored files so I hit yes and that's going to go ahead and create a bower JSON file for us now the reason we have this is because inside of here eventually when we start to install things we're going to have things like foundation as a dependency so what we need to do then is next install foundation so we're gonna say bower install foundation save now the save will store it inside of that Bower JSON file so if we wait for this to finish you can see here that it's actually set dependencies to foundation now this could be a div dependency so we could say save eV instead this is probably a much better option since you're not going to use this for anything else other than development so we can go ahead and just get rid of that and you'll also notice here that we've got a bower components folder that's been created for us and there's a lot more in here than we expected just by installing Foundation and we've got things like jQuery which foundation requires to be able to run its JavaScript we've got things like j.crew placeholder on cookie which I'm not going to be using we've got moderniser which we are going to be using because there are checks within the foundation javascript files that detect features using moderniser and obviously we've got the base foundation which contains our s CSS files which we're going to be using within gulp to compile using gulp sass so it this might all sound a little bit confusing if you're very new to this but don't worry it's going to become very clear as we go through all of these steps so the next thing we want to do then is go ahead and initialize NPM so we're gonna head over back to our terminal I'll just clear this and I'm gonna say NPM in it now the reason I'm doing this is because we're going to have to install node packages things like gulp gulp sass belkin capped and these just help us with our build so here I'm just gonna say project I'm gonna give it another version a description entry point test we're gonna leave these all empty and it will warn us about things but don't worry too much about this because it's not in the scope of this tutorial so now that that's done let's just clear that we have a package JSON so the package JSON then is going to contain all of the things like I said gulp sass gulp itself and we can go ahead and and start to use things then so we want to install gulp now so we have a back over to our terminal and we're gonna run npm install dope and we're gonna save that as a development dependency because obviously we only need it when we're developing ok so now that we've run that command we've got our node modules folder here we've got inside of here we're gonna fill this up quite a bit because we're going to use different old package it MPM packages to do with gulp so now that we've got that done we're going to go ahead and create our gulp file so under project let's create a new file here and we're gonna call this gulp file dot J s so inside of our gulp file we're going to create a default task now eventually what's going to happen is within our terminal we're gonna run gulp and what that's going to do is it's going to take Foundation pull it all in for us pull in all the scripts put them inside of the public folder within CSS J s directories all nice and tidy so we can just include them in our page so we need to create our initial gob file so we need to define gulp here we need to require it in so we're going to just requiring goal remember goal is now installed because we just installed it with NPM and we're gonna create our first task and this is just going to be an empty task we're gonna call this default we're gonna within this callback we're just gonna do a console log so you ran go so now we can run gulp so if I type don't and hit enter there we are so you can see that we get a few things happen here it tells us which gold file that we're using which we know it tells us which task it's starting this is the output from the task usually you wouldn't output from the task but in this case we just did to test it and then it tells us that it's finished and gives us the time that it finished in as well so it gives us useful information here so the next thing we want to do is we want to just copy over some markup for foundation just to look at it in its original state so let's close our glow gulp file and let's go over to Foundation and let's search for the navbar and we're gonna just copy and paste this code in it's going to be a little messy the indentation it's not gonna be quite right but we're only really just testing here so paste this in let me just kind of reinvent it and let's preview this in the browser and it looks rubbish because there are obviously no Styles included usually what you do with foundation is just plunk it in your public CSS directory or something like that but then you don't get the benefit of being able to update it with Bower you don't get the benefit of being able to concatenate everything together minify if you want to etc so we'll look at doing this a bit later we're not going to minify but you can work out what you need to do from from then so now that we've done that we're going to create an assets directory within our root directory just here so let's create a new folder called assets these are basically all of our scripts and styles but they're not the public files that are going to be accessed these are what they're going to be read using out got using gulp and then something's going to happen to them along the way so we will concatenate files we'll minify them we'll uglify javascript if we want to and then there will be hooked into public j/s and then we put into public CSS so we'll create them files now folders now so we've got them there so inside of assets then what I tend to do is I have a Styles folder and I also have a scripts folder so now that we've got our public j/s and CSS file folders and we've got our styles and scripts directory we want to create our goal Styles task to actually pull in the styles then we can include them in our head once they've been put into this CSS directory so let's go ahead and do this now let's pull up our gulp file again and this default task here we don't really need this because we're not going to be running a lot of stuff in here so when you get rid of this temporarily we will bring back the default task because the default task is basically what runs when you just run gulp like this so we're going to define a new task so we're going to say gulp task this is going to be called styles styles and this is going to obviously have a callback here and we're gonna do something so in this case all I'm gonna do is console.log you ran styles now we're going to find our default task and tell it what other tasks we want it to run so we're gonna say go task default and instead of a callback we're going to pass an array of different tasks we want to run so we're gonna have stars from for now but eventually we can have things like scripts and then anything else you want to include in your default bill as well so let's change up two styles now what's going to happen is when we run golf on its own is going to say oh we need to run styles it will run this and then we'll console.log so let's take a look let's clear this and let's go ahead and run gulp and there we go so you can see here it says starting styles you ran styles finish start starting default finish default so we know that this is running the Styles task so what we now need to do is install gulp sass which is going to be able to compile sass for us or parse sass so we need to install this by going ahead and running NPM install gulp sass and we want to save it as a development dependency so we wait for that to finish and then we'll check out our package JSON file and see that that's been installed in there in just a moment so that looks like it's finished so let's head over to our package JSON you can see in here we've got gulp and we've now got gold sass so we can use this in here gulp oh let's call it's just sass is a lot easier so we're gonna require in gulp sass there we go so now what we can do is we can take our foundation sass which is in bower components foundation SCSS we can take all of this we can run it through our at this task and we can go ahead and do things like pipe it well we pipe we we pipe sass through and then we can do things like concatenate on which far we want to add this to we can put it into a destination we'll see how this works in just a moment if that doesn't make sense it's pretty difficult to explain so what we want to do now is we want to actually create our first custom a CSS file so inside of scripts then I'm gonna create a new file sorry inside of styles I'm going to create a new file and this is going to be called a PS CSS and this is where we're going to require in found a from we're not going to do that just yet we're gonna take a look at a basic build here so what I'm gonna do is just write some normal CSS inside of here and we're gonna say something like body background color and we'll choose a nice background color so we'll say something like e d e f f zero and our goal is to take this run it through sass and then place it inside of our CSS directory as apt or CSS so what we want to do then is go ahead and use gulp sauce to choose this so we're going to return gulp dot sauce and inside of here we have an array of source files in this case our source lives in assets styles at that is CSS that's the file that we've just created over here so this isn't going to do anything it won't fail we can still run this so we can still run gulp it's just not going to do anything but what we're saying is we want to take this and then do something with it so what we need to do is pipe sass through which remember we've included up here that's going to go ahead and compile our sass and then what we want to do is we want to place it inside of our public CSS directory now what I'm going to do is I'm going to install Vulcan cat which allows us to concatenate files we're not actually going to be concatenated any files but if you did have any additional file scripts that you wants to concatenate and put into one place this is a really useful package to have or module to a driver so let's just finish that line there we'll finish this off in just a moment let's go ahead and install gulp concat and you can google for all of these just to find out more information if you if you want to find any more information about them and the different options that they have and what you can do with them so now that that's finished it's obviously been placed inside of here so what we can do now is we can include this so I'm going to say far and cats and we're going to require in go it's perfect so what I'm gonna do just to demonstrate it is I'm going to say oops I'm gonna say that pipe concat and I'm gonna choose the file name so we can just do this if we want to so I'm gonna say I want this to be stored as app dot CSS but you can obviously have different options here to combine different files if you want to and then we're going to pipe it into a destination so we're going to use gulps dest to do this so we're going to pipe I'm gonna say dope best we don't need to install anything from this is part of gulp and then we choose the file the destination so in this case it's public CSS so let's just recap what we're doing here first of all we're returning all of this that's just going to let gold know that this task has finished we are initially passing an array of files out sort of source files we are compiling our sass we concatenate in this case we're just choosing the file name and then we are piping through the destination and we want this to go in public that's public slash CSS so let's run gulp now what this is going to do then is take this compile it put it inside of this CSS directory so let's clear this and run dope and there we are so you can see that that app dot CSS file has been created with all of our styles so we're now ready to include this file into our page so let's do this now so we're going to include CSS app dot CSS that's it that's all we need to do and then when we refresh we get our nice background color there so what we're now going to do is actually pull foundation in which is the point of this video so what we need to do here is inside of app s CSS remember not app dot CSS we're going to include foundation in fact first we need to include foundation paths in our goal file and this will make sense in just a moment so inside of sass just here we want to go ahead and pass in out food paths so include paths and we want to pull in Bower components Foundation scss sorry this should be an object so the reason that we're doing this is because we don't want to manually include all of these files from this apt or CSS file what we're actually doing is we're saying well when we when we pipe through this sass or when we compile our sass we want these files to be included as well and then we can just use them as we like so let's just run gulp again so nothing different has happened here we've not actually included foundation within our app dot CSS bar and the reason for that is because we've not included them within our app dot s CSS file and this is where the include paths come in because now what we can do is we can just say import foundation settings which we'll look at in more detail in a moment because we're going to customize our settings and this is the beauty of working like this and we're just going to import foundation so the settings are going to be what we can override in order to customize the foundation framework to suit our needs without having to write lots of additional styles to override all of the CSS and that's the benefit you get with this rather than just having the foundation dot CSS file download inputting some kind of public directory so now what's going to happen is when we run gulp all that's done is it's taken the foundation settings it's imported them and the actual framework and it's now placed that within this app dot CSS file here so it's taken the settings obviously there are lots of variables mix-ins and things like that that are replaced at the same time so now we see the following so we've now got this up and running so we're now gonna look at this custom settings file that i've been talking about and and this is you know why i love doing it this way so inside of our styles we're going to create a new folder called Foundation and then we're gonna create a new file in here which is going to be an SES s in s CSS include called settings s CSS so this is going to be our custom foundation settings file and we find that in bower components foundation s CSS foundation settings so we're going to copy this close this off we're going to paste it inside of here so let's take a brief look through this before we start playing around with anything all this is is for each of the components that foundation gives us as well as things like the base stars the grid Global's and media queries we can customize any part of this of these settings and that's going to change the way the foundation components look without having to write lots of additional CSS which I've already mentioned so let's look at just go ahead doing a head and running gulp again we get no difference here because most of this stuff all commented out there are a few things I think that are not but generally everything is so when a refresh we get no difference but what happens if I want to start customizing this navigation bar all I do is over in my settings I go ahead and look down this menu for nav bar which is also top bar so I'm going to find top bar and we get to the top our section here and you can see we've got all of these lovely settings that we can start playing around with and to allow these settings to take effect all we need to do is uncomment them and you need to be really careful because if for example I wanted to change the top bar background color this oil variable doesn't exist at the moment it's commented out at the top so what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to scroll the way up let's check which line we're on first of all let's go back to the top bar so we're on line 1 3 8 4 let's remember that and I'm going to say well I want the background color to be JA I know it can be anything we don't really care let's say snow so I'm going to uncomment this this variable and we're gonna get back to the line that we were on before I think that was one three five four no it wasn't okay so one three eight four so I'm going to change this now to that that variable I just uncommented which was snow so let's go down and let's find this again and change that to snow so that's all we need to do we've now got this snow variable and we've changed the background color now this isn't going to take effect straight away because we've not ranked gold we're gonna look at watching for changes a bit later on that's gonna make it a lot easier during development but for now let's just go ahead and run gold manually and there we go so all that's done now is change the background color pointless in this case because we can't see anything but then you could go ahead and customize the colors of the buttons the text on here you can just customize anything so I'll leave that up to you to do so let's just uncomment these again for now we'll just go ahead and get rid of all of them changes but now you know that you can have a really good look through this massive settings file and start to customize all of the elements foundation that you want to control so let's go ahead and add this watch task now actually just to make it a little bit easier for us and we'll see how this works so this is really straightforward we don't need to install anything particularly with NPM for this because gulp has a watch task already or watch functionality already so I'm down here I'm gonna define a new task and I'm gonna say gulp task and this task is going to be called watch and here we have our call back all we're gonna say here is gold watch I'm gonna choose which files we want to watch out for in this case we want to watch inside of assets inside of styles and we want to watch all scss files so what's going to happen then is when that does happen we want to run a particular set of tasks or a tasks so in this case I'm gonna run styles so what's gonna happen is every time I change an SPSS file it's gonna run this task recompile everything or rerun everything build everything and then we can just refresh our browser so let's take a look at this in action we'll go ahead and change the color of the nav background again but inside my terminal I want to run gulp watch now and we're gonna this is gonna do something a little bit different it's not actually finished because it's watching this is never going to finish unless it errors because it's just going to run that Styles task every time you change something so let's go back to our settings file here so settings stop s CSS inside of here and let's go to our top bar again and let's change the background color I'll just choose the CSS color now just say FFF hash FFF and what's happened here is because I saved the file while this was around this doesn't exist so what we're gonna do is we're gonna run go watch again I'm gonna just change something and save this time it hasn't errored because there were no errors but you can see that as I saved we started this new Styles task or it started this Styles task and we finished the Styles task and without having to run gulp manually this has changed so I can go ahead and change this to say 2 to 2 and just refresh my browser so now we can just run gulp watch when we want to start developing start changing things and then we can just refresh the browser as normal so that makes it a lot easier than having to run gulp every single time so what we're now going to focus on is foundations scripts so we've handled all of the styles we know that these will work let's go ahead and get rid of this again so we're gonna focus on scripts now so what we want to do is come over to foundation here and we're going to search for alerts and we want to obviously we have our style so this is going to render properly but we won't have the functionality like that so let's copy and paste this into our index.html file let's post this in and in then this and just say hello there so we have the Styles but we can't click this button so let's bring up our console just so we can debug if anything goes wrong and we're going to start to build our scripts now so this is a little bit more complicated but it's not massively complicated that it you know it's too much trouble so we wanted to find a new task so just under here I'm gonna say gulp task scripts run out callback and the first thing we want to do is pull in jQuery or we want to define jQuery as a source we want to define Foundation jus as a source and foundation but alert Jes as a source as well you can pull in all JavaScript files just using an asterisk if you really wanted to from foundation but if you don't need it then there's no point and bear in mind there are a million of different ways you can write your gulp file this isn't exactly how everyone would write it so you can choose how best looks and works for you so let's just take a look inside of foundation then inside of this j/s directory we've got foundation KS which we want to include we're not going to include the minified version because if we do want to run a minify on this task we can do so we don't need to do this and we're also going to pull in foundation and then foundation but alert dot j s as well so we're going to do that from our components foundation J s we're also going to pull in jQuery concatenate that into one file and then dump it inside of our Jas public directory down here so we're gonna say gulp that sauce again we're going to choose within this array the files that we want to include in the source so we're gonna say bower components forward slash jQuery dist jQuery KS remember that jQuery is installed along with foundation because it is a requirement so we're putting in this far here we also want to include Bower kanpai Foundation J s foundation J s and we want to include our components foundation J s foundation foundation dot J s so there's a lot there okay so you may have noticed that we're repeating ourselves here with this bow components we are going to tidy that up a little bit later just so we don't have to keep repeating the path because if the path does change you use a different package manager it's going to be really annoying to have to go through and change it so we will be changing that in just a moment but the first thing we want to do well the next thing we want to do after we've chosen the source files is to pipe through concatenation which we already have included up here which we used down here as well and we're going to just provide the file name here now what we want to do is we want to pipe this through into a particular destination in this case it's going to be public j s so it's going to take jQuery it's going to take foundations base JavaScript file and it's going to take the JavaScript functionality for alert boxes call it up J s and place it inside of our JavaScript directory in public so we're nearly done what we also want to do is include moderniser as well so the last command I give I'm gonna return gold sauce I'm gonna choose the source this is bower components moderniser moderniser Jas and I want to pipe this pipe this through destination so I'm gonna say public j/s now the reason that I've done this is because modernizr need to be included or it doesn't need but it's best included in the head of your document so we need a separate file for moderniser so we're taking all of these and putting them into a PAF's and we're taking moderniser and putting it into public j/s as well so we'll end up with two files inside of our public jeaious folder so let's just cancel this and let's just run gulp as normal now what's happened here is we're not running our Styles task because under our default we're only running a scripts task sorry we're only running our Styles task so that's just included scripts here as well so let's run gulp again and there we go so we've run scripts we've run styles and if we look inside of j/s here we've got app KS which contains JavaScript if we scroll down we've got foundation here as well and we've got the specific functionality for our alert box as well so we've got everything that we need in here now so what we can do is on our index file we can go ahead and include moderniser so j/s moderniser ojs and we can scroll down and down here we can include J s FJ s so now if we refresh we shouldn't get any errors because we've got everything sort of included modernizers being included at the top if we just have a look at the page source here that's all there and at the bottom there we've got a plot J S which we just looked at a moment ago so now this will work or hopefully will work ah it won't now the reason this is not going to work is because we have an initialized foundation now we need to include inside of let's just close this off inside of our scripts directory we're going to include something called just app dot J s again this could be CoffeeScript and you can come CoffeeScript using gulp as well but we're just going to create a normal JavaScript file just to test this out so we're gonna say document dot foundation that's going to initialize foundation that's all we're going to do here we are going to be adding our JavaScript files to our watch task as well so we'll take a look at that in just a moment if you needed to just write some code in here and have it automatically run through gulp so inside of our gulp file then we need to include this new file within here so let's go ahead and do that now so we're gonna say assets scripts fjs assets scripts is that's gonna also be put into our main app jeaious inside of here so let's go ahead and run gulp again and let's go ahead and refresh and it should work now there we go so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and add this to the watch task so I'm gonna duplicate this line down I'm going to change this to scripts and we want any JavaScript files to run our scripts task just here so now what we can do is test this out so let's clear this and run gulp watch and we're gonna go over and modify our app.js file in a console log hello without running gulp we refresh and there we go so we've got our updated JavaScript files and you can see here that's run script it hasn't run styles as well because there's no need to we only update to the JavaScript file so that's just a little bit more efficient so now that we've done this we're just going to tidy up our gulp file a little bit because I'm not happy with the fact that we have bower components repeated again and then again and again we're also repeating assets as well what if we change this directory name it's going to mean we're having to go through and update it again and again and again so I'm going to create a path object here and inside of here I'm just going to say Bower that's going to be our components and I'm gonna say assets and that's going to be assets so now what we can do is we can just reference paths bow or paths to assets down here so let's get rid of this and say path stop Bauer and let's just copy and paste this just so it's a little bit quicker so let's paste it in here get rid of this paste that in get rid of this paste this in and down here as well like so and that looks about it so let's do the same for our paths to assets so we can get rid of this and we could say paths got assets and we'll do the same for this so anywhere where we use assets here and we also use it just down here as well pop that in there and let's pop that in there so let's just clear this run go up again just to make sure we didn't mess anything up let's run go watch again just to make sure we didn't mess anything up let's add a console log back in here and we'll go ahead and refresh that looks like it's fine and let's just change something in our settings file as well so a nav bar top now rather top bar now and let's just changed the background color again to white and there we go so that's all working so we now have a fairly efficient table file it's very basic and we are being fairly explicit here about what we are putting in there are like I said really clever ways to do this you can do all sorts of stuff just to you know tidy this up and make it a lot more efficient but you're now in the position where you have a Styles folder again bringing this specifically back to foundation Styles where you can update your settings you can import additional s CSS files inside of here either to overwrite foundation styles that can't be changed with settings and you can start to create all of your own stars for your application as well they're all going to be put into a plot CSS you can reuse if you want to the variables from foundation here so in this case we're setting a body background color but what we could do is we could go ahead and just pick something like a color from here so say you define all of your colors here let's say something like let's pick black so we're going to uncomment black out we're gonna save that make sure we've got gulp watch running let's just clear this and go watch save that oops we've got an undefined variable oil so we're if we included that top bar yes sorry we included that there so it's uncomment this and let's clear this and run gulp watch again so back to this color that I've on commented out which is black inside of inside of my app dot CSS file I can now reference black if I wanted to and what that's going to do is it's going to take them stars from foundation and apply them to my document so you wouldn't really necessarily always want to do this but it's a good thing to know that we can reuse elements from this settings file and what I find most useful is the media queries from here so if we just have a look at the media query ranges what we can actually do is we can reuse these variables inside of other stars that we manually create so we can keep this in sync with foundations media queries ranges so it you know it's really useful to be able to have things set up like this it does take a little bit longer to set up after you've seen but in the long run this is gonna save you a lot of time and a lot of hassle and it's generally generally a really pleasant way to develop just saves a lot of time in the and a lot of effort in the future once you've got this set up so that is how we set things up with foundation using Bower as our package manager and using bolt as our build system to get everything set up for our front-end development", "unHr3zKVJ2c": "we're here ProCare right now we're going to be talking about a new blend that they just came out with and it's not a gel it's not an oil so explain to me what exactly is this Jason go and pull a couple of them off the shelf here and let's let's take a moment here to talk about exactly what the applications are for this and what you guys have come up with so go ahead sure we're all it's a super sauce so it's still made with 100% real bait right so but it's there that our super gel so this will stick on beautiful the lures and it will work well on babies as well we put attacked a fire in there so it's kinda like a bar oil where it's really stringy oh sure sticky but cordless so like this garlic here even putting it on still has the same application will last you know 25 to 30 minutes putting out set when you put on your lures but we want colors because our regular ones are brown or black or not attractive so we found a pigment that will change the color of it without altering the odor and we anticipated this will just be huge well and you guys you're your main focus is to have real bait on every single one of your products as pure as possible so that's exactly what you've done here with the super sauce it's again a mix between the gel and the oil and it's going to be used for not just your lures but you can also use some bait and one of the things that you brought up was the fact that you can put it on top of your eggs and because it's not that heavy gel you can actually absorb into the membrane a little bit so that's another great option but you also mentioned that the bait oil this will always be best with the eggs correct so where what application you see folks using this the most so we have three major products the oil and you're using real products the gel if it uses you know all imitation you know I quit fish hard base sure soft plastics but if a guy just wants that one the super sauce like I said just thinner than our gel so it's gonna it's gonna put more sin out there quickly on a quick fish right so just first quickly but it'll go on bait you can put it inside the anchovy mouth and it will slowly leach out of the anchovy here your herring you can put it on salmon X you put on San shrimp so and the cooling this is colored so when it's dispersed the author's living neo green or rather Ruth trails coming up and some of them are UV all of these although UV everything we make the last five years has you beatitude it all have some bytes to it although that it's 100% real big well in the applications that I see this working is like you mentioned of course putting it on a hard bait so I'm gonna be putting all my spinners down there at Billy ten the guys that run the super baits and Pro Tools will absolutely be using it not just on their approach hole you can put it on the Dodger or your flasher but they'll be putting it inside on top of their tuna or whatever other baits are using onto the styrofoam so there's a lot of different applications that we can use this and it's just another tool in tool box along with the oil and the gel now we have the super sauce right I said it just it's gonna be a home run right I mean and and it's pretty right pretty colors you got well I said we started with ten skiers of this next year up IV 15 yes oh cool yeah we went with our top 10 song excuse for this year very good go well that's the super sauce here broke here make sure you go out thing you'll fix them up and give it a try", "SvNF2hpn5ao": "Preview Hi guys! We got some sushi today Oopsy, up side down It's Ajinomoto soup powder that my Japanese friend gave a few months ago It's my first time eating it so I hope I can just mix it with hot water How are you guys doing today?

if you subscribe to it and hit that notification bell this way you know when i put out a new video so with that being said let's go ahead and move forward and start it off today on the right foot oh my goodness we are going to talk about a topic that has been debated for years artificial bait sense what scent is the best scent that i believe that is on the market today to put on your artificial lures now of course there's different scents for different situations but i'm talking about the all-around scent i'm talking about the scent that you could put on a top water that'll bring a fish to bite that bait without further ado i want to introduce and by the way i'm not sponsored by them they're not paying me to say this this is my view okay i think this is the best scent on the market so i'm bringing it to you again without further ado here it is pro cures beet sauce in the shrimp flavor as you can see the whole bottle i believe i picked this up for 7.99 and i have nothing but good things to say about it i mean it has caught so many varieties of fish i put it on every lure i throw whether it's a paddle tail whether it's an artificial shrimp whether it's a myridine whether it's a of a top water i mean you name it i use it on everything and it produces fish and it doesn't just produce one type of fish it produces all of the big three the snook the redfish the sea trout so let's dive into it and and discuss the the pros and the cons of this pro pro cures bait sauce let's start with the pros number one it's sticky it stays on the bait it's oily okay it leaves a oil trail when you put that on your lure and you throw that lure along the grass flat it's dispersing scent over the grass flat and it is pulling fish towards that area number two it has uv flash in it so that means when you put it on your lure and the light hits it correctly it actually helps the lure it gives it a little extra uh panache if you will number three it stinks okay hands down you know you get it on your hands your hands are going to smell like it for a while okay you put it on the lure it sticks to the lure it doesn't wipe right off um it goes a long way yeah you know it's eight dollars eight bucks you know for for for this but it's worth it if it catches you an extra redfish that day or an extra two or three trout or maybe that big snook that otherwise wouldn't have hit that lure but that scent maybe brought them in it's worth the penny now i'm not saying that it's you know the best thing since sliced bread because nothing is you know if there's no fish there you're not going to catch fish but what it's going to do is if there aren't fish there it may the smell because it's so strong okay is going to attract that red fish okay it may bring in that trout that snook may be cruising the mangrove line will be in the mangroves and catch a whiff of it okay or see that uv flash and come out of the mangroves and hit it so for eight bucks it's really not a bad investment okay i'm not saying it's going to guarantee you to catch fish but i will say this i guarantee you it will help you catch fish so now the cons the first thing i've noticed about it do not and i repeat and if you are a waiter and you are using a waiting bag put it somewhere that it's not baking in the sun put it in the bag deep down in the darkest part of the bag uh wrap it i put it about you know with a little ziploc bag i put it in a ziploc bag and i put it deep down in the bag so the sun isn't baking on it when the sun bakes it okay it becomes a little less consistent it gets a little watery so therefore you lose a little bit of that stickiness it doesn't stay on as long so try to keep it as cool as possible i know if you're out there waiting or you're on the flats you know the boat is going to heat up but keep it in the shade as much as possible another con the price um yeah it's eight bucks you know it's not it's not a hundred dollars for a bottle of it but it's still eight dollars it's a little pricey i believe it's worth every penny some people may disapp you know disagree with me but for eight dollars um it goes a long way a little dab will do you i put it on everything and i used to use the regular procure formula and i thought nothing you know would beat it you know i used the blue crab i used the shrimp and i used the mullet and now i only use the procure bait sauce this is it hands down if i give it a scale to 1 to 10 it's an 11. um by no means does it guarantee you to catch a fish but it will attract them now i have an example that i'm going to be showing you here in a few minutes of me i put the pro cure on a top water plug in the middle of the afternoon in a hundred degree weather and we'll see what happens so let's go ahead and take a look at that video right now mr trout decided to say hello that's a good one that's a decent sized trout all right buddy hold on come here show you off to everyone in a second come here buddy all right all right calm down oh that's a decent sized trout a little thin and get that hook out of your mouth all right guys huh there's our first trout of the day i'd say i don't know 17 18 19 somewhere around there that's 12 13 14 15 16. that's 16 17. nice got three uh got three nice little daggers on the front of his mouth well stay tuned hopefully we can get a couple more see you all right guys well i'm going to end this video i hope you enjoyed that little you know that little clip of the trout hitting that top water um again this is my view you know i take it for what it's worth i've got 20 years on the water i know it works i know it doesn't the procure bait sauce in the shrimp formula shrimp flavor fantastic get it at any local you know bass pro or on amazon or any of the tackle type of warehouse anywhere where you order from pretty much they have or go to the poker website and they'll have it there pick it up give it a shot um i'm sure it's gonna you know put a couple of uh steps up in your game but thank you very much for uh taking the time to view this video my name is mark waste deep whitefish in southwest florida thank you for liking subscribing and sharing i hope to see you all out on the water

another kendama crewed review just for you I made it all the way down to the overcast City of Vaughan at 7-eleven to do something that I've never seen at 7-eleven before it's called the New York Deli meat lovers Pizza I gave them phone call see if they can make it they said yes so let's go in there grab that pizza come back here and eat it in front of you but first before we go let's put on the gloves because we've got to be extra careful around here and I'm gonna be using tap somebody said don't use cash because the cash they might be giving you back might be tainted so I'll be using my credit card on this one now you guys ready let's do this [Music] hello I like to order a whole deli pizza please the deli won the New York deli meat lovers yeah the new one as you can see they got lots of other foods here and isn't pizzas frozen or not frozen dis refrigerated you could buy a ticket home make it yourself alright I'm gonna grab a favorite drink over here somewhere there's got to be a big coke section there there we go yeah well and they've got the frozen ones here so the other ones RIS refrigerated this one's that oh there's the New York so if you guys are interested grab one go home cook it yourself but I want to eat mine now [Music] some ways it's a more slice pizza I got all that taquitos hot dogs mini donut [Music] yes and the coke all right what are you guys off yeah I'll do a ranch that'd be great yeah I had the ranch would be probably my favorite thought to that perfect thank you very much have a great day all right people a team all right ladies and gentlemen we are back in the car as you can see she was using gloves the whole time I'm using gloves the whole time but I can take my gloves off there goes one there goes two let's get out the trusty steering wheel tray and start eating shall we I have been fasting for the last 44 hours and I am definitely starving on this one let's do our little sanitizer get that going being safe as possible dry that off you don't eat that stuff so I didn't get a breakdown on the bill but the the pop and the pizza came to 1524 Canadian plus the dipping sauces I grabbed ranch I always like to ask you guys what dipping sauce do you like to do with your pizza I guess the depends on the pizza I'm gonna put my napkins over there quickly crack open my cloak oh my gosh I am probably not the best thing to eat and drink after a 44 hour five but I'm doing it hmm all my body's like one oh my gosh ladies and gentlemen check out this beautiful pizza freshly cooked right in front of me we've got looks like sausage little chunks of pepperoni definitely red onions this pizza is gonna go down really really well if I missed any ingredients I'll list them out all right let's goin for the first slice I'm gonna at least attempt to eat half of this pizza for now maybe the rest later mmm I really do like 7-eleven pizza I was very surprised when I first had my first pizza when there was the 7-eleven in Bradford close to my home but I'm glad I'm back to do this one for you the crust is nice and soft in the middle crispy on the outside all the toppings so far seem really savory and juicy [Music] mm-hmm nicely cooked on the bottom damn look up I don't know what they call them like a pressure oven or whatever kind of like what subway has where you just put the thing in it but just super heats it really fast so they they cooked it pretty quick not a whole lot of waiting time the marinara sauce they put on there it's pretty good sweet so one of the reasons I wanted to make this video is this the remind people that there is still places out there that are serving food let's try this ranch and I still want to make content for you somebody suggested like TV dinners so I might go to a Walmart or no-frills or something and buy a bunch of TV dinners for the next couple weeks and we'll see about that maybe duo beruete sand things like that oh look at that slice people look at that slice is that making you want to go out bar to release phone or 7-eleven or ubereats and say get me one of those pizzas people mmm it's nice and greasy probably from the sausage shoot I love to let people know in the comments below what you're doing to get through this cuz we might be doing this for the next two weeks two months six months nobody knows I don't know how many cases there are in Canada right now there are not in this Ontario I know last night so this is a Thursday afternoon and they said there was a big spike yesterday or today let's try this ranch was there a specific brand running old style sauce creamy ranch she's going to give me three only three nobody needs three if there are three people eating it got three mmm not as creamy mmm I'm gonna do that in two bites and I said screw it one bite once again I wouldn't normally eat this after a fast this wouldn't be the first thing I would eat after a fast I would break my fast with a salad or some like granola bar type thing just to get my stomach used to food again but I got it work yes this is my job and I love it that is that's a nice thick pizza the ranch is nice but I'm old school and I just love pizza crusts to me the pizza is your dinner and the crust is my dessert hmm I don't usually like spoiling it with a dip okay I think we're gonna do one more I don't have to take the rest of them I thought for sure I could eat the whole pizza but it was much bigger than I thought can really taste the spiciness of the sausage now like I saw this because it's picked up just just sausage when you're biting with everything else it gets kind of all mixed in you can't really tell that all the difference is if I'm enjoying this thoroughly see all those spices mm-hmm the cross is awesome guys let me know if you've eaten pizza from 7-eleven when agree or disagree with me I think most people would agree with me it is really good pizza two more bites of dessert it's nice and crispy on the outside oh that's a little toasty crunch love it last bite people hmm that's all she wrote well there you go ladies and gentlemen 1/2 pizza from 7-eleven after a 44 hour fast and I am definitely one of their percent full all right guys on my rated scale I'm gonna be giving 7-elevens New York deli style meat lovers Pizza hey go out and get it now if you have a 7-eleven near you you're in Canada get on uber eats if you don't want to go out you can go in there they'll make it for you there are wearing gloves use your credit card grab that pizza get home or eat it in your car all right ladies and gentlemen if you love me doing these videos just for you hit it with a thumbs up being ding ding ding but if you're still hungry for more check out this playlist bring your hunger", "q1lp1WuP7Rs": "[Music] [Applause] welcome back ladies and gentlemen so today we're doing another slab sauce verse G sauce challenge got the bottles right here so slab sauce first G sauce so this time I'm actually gonna go with slab sauce first because I went with G sauce the last time the first you know what I meant so slab sauce is gonna get the first 10 minutes and then G sauce is gonna get the second 10 minutes and today I'm using a chartreuse Piko cent ring this guy so both of them are gonna be chartreuse I got two rods tied up basic LED head jig head it's a 1/16 swim jig style jig head right there and I'm anchored up just off brush piles there's a big school of fish I've caught a couple they're not very big but that's not this challenge so this challenge is the most fish in ten minutes either the slab sauce or the G sauce this is the rematch I know last time I think some of you said well you caught two fish with the G sauce but that was before you went to a single-pole jig rather than that weird t rig that I just threw in the trash because it was absolute garbage and you're right technically slab sauce one but it's my video so I can do what I want we're gonna do slap sauce first then the G sauce on the chartreuse too you know the rule is ten minutes one cent each most fish in ten minutes is the winner let's get started here we go gonna spray on the old whoa tangled up in the rods hold on there we go spray on the old slab sauce two of them should do the trick and these fish are right in front of me as you can see I got buoy marked out here that's actually a brush pile but these fish are kind of pushed off around it they're not on top of it so I'm gonna have to do a little bit of casting to kind of get it to figure out where these fish are around it but this there's like two different schools and they kind of move around this brush pile they're feeding on a little bait fish on top of it you can I could see them on the little bait fish I could see on the graph there's Muskies pushing shad up to the surface because I can see the shad busting around me so there's a lot of food right here I forgot to do the three two one go okay ready ten minute crappie challenge ten minutes slab sauce first G sauce challenge starts right now three two one let her go I'm seeing these fish on the back of the boat now they're swimming all over the place so I definitely needed a casting rod today seven six acc sticks there's a fish there's a number one for slab sauce I gotta tighten up that drag this guy is not big at all thinking an eight inch fish throw him on this well this this isn't about sighs what am i doing 8-inch fish at best I do have to fix this can we call a timeout is that legal it's illegal to call timeout that only took three seconds no timeout no timeouts Airi well that was a awful cast there behind the boat halfway through halfway through I only got one fish yeah there he is - oh come on buddy time is everything today hope Adam Adam there he is there under the boat these ones are this is a smaller school it's three three four the Schloss slab sauce they're right under the boat these things are definitely getting pushed around they were they were back there now they look like right on the under the bow of the boat I've seen a couple muskies pushing shad up a lot shallower so I'm thinking these these crappie are definitely getting pushed around by some predator fish today which it makes it really hard to get on top of them thankfully they're right underneath the boat right now there I don't think they're very big that's just disappointing there he is got him that time what's that for where we got for time here two minutes left well two minutes in two minutes and 27 seconds left to be exact hey hey hey stop stop stop one minute left one minute dang I forgot how many fish I caught for someone number five or am i number six fix it in the editing room I guess there he is there he is oh you probably got it all over the camera lens well it's either 5 or 6 whatever I'll put it up on the top corner it's not corner of the screen there what do I got for time here oh boy 15 seconds 15 seconds left can we get one more fish oh oh no Adam 5 4 3 2 oh I don't know as a count I had them on I don't know if I got him in in time don't know well that's the end of the slab sauce let's put the G sauce on I'm gonna tie a different jig head on completely new scent so I'm gonna tie jighead new tube completely new scent yeah let's do that and then we'll start the 10 minutes for the G sauce alright here we go got a new jig head tied on new tube there's the old tube I'm gonna put some G sauce on two squirts that's what I gave the slap sauce even though the G sauce is a little more potent probably don't need two squirts I only need one and we will get after them here in just a second let's get my time check all right so this is this is how many slap sauce had that's how many G sauce has to beat to win I say this is how many because I lost count again it happens all right we're gonna go in 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 and cast didn't have to cast very far the right below the boat no they're not yes they are maybe they're moving something's pushing these things probably a muskie there he is there's number 1 number 1 on the G sauce you choked that thing - holy smokes no stop he got me good got me good gotta watch out for those spines those will get you home and a musky just smoked it right here at the surface well that's a dead crappie I don't think I got that I'm footage I think my camera Lange angles a little too narrow it was right by the boat as soon as I threw that fish back crappie must have been right at the surface I wouldn't be surprised if i hook into a muskie right now there he is there's one this would be number two all in the G sauce oh he's barely hooked well that was I'm gonna count it it's my video I'm gonna count it I was really taking care of landing these fish I would have reached down and grabbing them in the water if I get them over the gunnel that counts there is number three dat bitty crappie now don't be like your friend and spine the crap out of my hand three for the G sauce halfway through this thing a little more than half four minutes and 26 seconds left that's what we got there is well whatever number that is it's really I should be able to keep count I don't know just focus on finding these fish and lose count on these things what we got for time here 2 minutes 7 seconds 2 minutes 7 seconds left that's what we got there he is there he is again these aren't very big crappie but the numbers game today wow there's a either a lot of bass busting up top or these are muskie hidden shad 1 minute 13 seconds 1 minute 13 seconds that's the time check time time check time left so we got oh no I think I think slab saw has had more I think slab sauce is gonna come on top today you know it's it's really nice when these fish are actually stacked up on a brush pile and I can just anchor up in vertical jig these things right now they're moving all over the place I'm guessing because whatever is hitting top water right now is pushing them whether it's bass or muskie so it's really hard to stay on the school 37 seconds left 37 seconds left I don't know gee sauce is uh it's not looking too good not looking too good buddy don't worry you'll get a rematch if you lose it 11 seconds left 11 whoa that's not good 6 5 4 3 2 1 that's the challenge that is the challenge well that's the end of the challenge part 2 the rematch slab sauce versus whoa easy there buddy hold on folks there we go so that is the end of the challenge slap sauce first G sauce the rematch slap sauce is the winner yeah just wasn't G sauces day also a lot of a lot of predator fish pushing these fish around pushing these crappie around as you heard throughout the video musky I saw a three different muskie hit top water I think I saw a bass hit top water it's tough to stay on these schools of fish when they're getting pushed by so many predator fish but I did my best and I think we got 11 or 12 total not bad for 20 minutes not as not as good as last time last time I think I got 13 or 14 fish in 20 minutes again these aren't the biggest fish but that's not the challenge the challenges the most fish so I will link both these bottles the G sauce and the slab sauce I'll link them both in the description below you can check them out please do

"hello everyone welcome back to the video of key in this video we'll be discussing on king's gob build tools and how you can customize it so first thing we need to do is to purchase and download keen and once you've downloaded and unzipped it it should look something like this and we what we need to do is to go ahead and open this folder within our ide of choice what we're using here is visual studio code as you can see right here we need to open up the theme folder and go to tools and in there we will see the gulp config.json file now in here we have a few fields that we need to take note the first thing we need to take note is this config field and what this does is for us to define whether it's a debug mode or you want to turn on and off debug mode and what debug mode means is when you when you run the gob command within your your command prompt or your terminal it just gives you more notes and more messages uh as it runs and then compile it's just to say how do you want to compile your assets so when you have rtl enabled at the moment is set to false by default but you can always turn it on like so once you have rtl enabled you would basically compile and build a right to left version of key what right what right to left means is for languages such as arabic where you need to read the text from right to left so it kind of flips the entire page so that your language can be displayed correctly next thing we see here is the skip and in skip what we're just defining here is all the plugins that we will skip within the rtl version the reason we're skipping all this plugins is because there's no reason to have an rtl version of for example like a icon an icon whether it's right to left or left to right it will still be displayed as a single icon so these are plugins that we're skipping for the rtl version um you can ignore this in this leave it as it is if you want or if you include your own plugin then you can and your plugin does not need an rtl version then you can also include that here next comes this for fields which is as as pretty self-explanatory uh like js uglify css minify and source maps for for both css.js you can just turn it on and off right here next comes the path field and what this does is it just defines where the source is coming from for example if you go into the demo one right here so this is the source folder so what we're defining here is if we are running a gob command for demo one it will just grab all this files from this source folder if it's demo two then it will grab it from this source folder so it's just to define where the source is coming from node modules similarly with um source it's just to define where the modis is coming from in this case is this folder right here if your node modules are sitting in another position like another path then you need to update this field to wherever your modules is located next comes or this demo api url this is um you don't need to worry about this simply because this is for our demos for example some of the demos require some api callback such as our data tables or some models or some other validation type plugin uh when we require an api callback then we will use this url however you don't need to worry about this simply because if you guys are using your own api callback you'll be injected within the js itself rather than within this uh within the config the gap config lastly in the main build or the main config field is the dist field this field is important is because it defines where your assets is going to be built or deployed to in this case when you run a gulp demo one command it will deploy the assets to our demo folder this and assets which is basically within this folder here which is empty at this point of time so let's try to first let's try to just um run the gauge command to see the assets get built so we go to our tools folder open up a command prompt by typing in cmd in the address bar and then running gulp and then demo one and let it run all right it's done as you can see our assets got populated based on whatever source that we have within this folder here so we have our js our media plugins and sas gets converted or compiled to css so basically this is how all this the config works now if you have your project outside of this path you can just define it to your project's path so in this case for example let's just put a new folder here called project say this is your project and then within your project folder you have an assets folder like so and what we're going to do is we just need to change this to project and then essex so what's going to happen here is all of our source code that we have in here in demo one for example we then compiled and built and then deployed into our project assets folder as when we do the same thing here you see this uh file get populated like so all right it's done and then you can see all of our css is all built here so this is a very powerful tool on where you want to set and define your assets your project assets folder all right so that's the conflict next thing we're going to talk about is the build now in our build we have five main fields which is the main vendors pages theme and media so right off the bat this field here called theme this only exists within demo one demo two does not have a theme simply because demo two does not require a light or dark theme so what a theme actually is it's just skinning on top of the current demo so if we look into level one and we go to six minimize this and we go to our sauce into the themes as you can see we have light and dark light and dark themes or skins for demo one but if you go to demo two and go to sas there is no theme here so this is only applicable to demo one so the moment that a demo doesn't have a theme this field gets ignored so don't worry about that so let's look into our main field our main field consists of two main uh okay let me rephrase that so all fields within the build will consist of two main field types which is the source and then the bundle source is basically to define where your css or sas is coming from and scripts uh is coming is to define where all your js or javascript files are coming from and then once you define all this you just then to bundle it up bundle the styles and the scripts into individual files either uh as a style.bundle or script bundle so this is the format of how we're doing our bundling so in this case what we're doing here is we're just defining that all of our styles are within this style.sas file which is this file right here and we're going to bundle this style into this file into this css file so if you look into our assets css and you see this file here it's basically the result of bundling our sas so in scripts similarly with our installing we're just defining all of the components of the js files within the components folder which is this one here all these files here as well as all of the js files from layout which is this one here bundling all the all of them up into a single file called script store bundle which is right here and that's pretty much it so if you want to add your own um js file globally all you need to do is just add your own js custom js file within the components or layouts it depends on what kind of script you would like to include in your project right moving on to our vendors vendors is our it's a field for us to define every single plugin that keem users so we have two types of plugins within key we have a base which is this and then we have custom and within the base plugins we have it splits up to two different plug plugin types we have a mandatory plugin types and optional plugins mandatory are plugins that king uses all the time and is required for keem to be functional if you remove one of this like for example if you remove jquery uh most likely kim will stop working so we highly recommend for you guys to not remove anything from the mandatory plugin list however our optional uh optional plugin list is where you can remove any plugin that your project does not require for example if your project does not require a bootstrap time picker all you need to do is just delete that save the golf file and then run your command and you're good to go now if you want to add your own plugin globally all you need to do is just scroll all the way down to the bottom of this custom plugin list and then enter your own plugin and then what you do is follow the same format if your plugin has um css you add styles into it if your plugin has fonts you add fonts into it if your plugin has scripts like this add scripts to it and that's pretty much it and what happens after that is it gets all of this all mandatory and optional plugins all of those plugins listed within these two fields gets bundled up into a single either a js bundle or a css bundle so and then what you do is you can include this bundle file globally within your project so when you add any additional plugins into this base field what you're doing is you're adding plugins globally within your project so if your plugins being used for every single page or very often you edit in this list here now if your plugin is only going to be used once or twice uh within your entire project we highly suggest for you guys to add it into the custom field so if you open this up let's minimize the base as you can see we have plugins split into individual fields and each individual field we have the same format of the source and bundle so what this does is we're going to grab all the scripts or js files or even css files from that single plugin and bundle it up into its own individual bundle and what we do after that is we then include this single bundle for that specific page that requires it so for example like if you look at full calendar we have styles and we have scripts and then it gets bundled up into its own css and its own js so similarly if you require this um css or this plugin you edit it you just leave it as it is but if you don't you can just delete it like so if you want to add your own custom script or plugin scroll all the way down and just follow the format add a comment to it and then put it say my plugin pixel and then start putting your source oops and then in your source after your source you need your bundle and then what you do is you just form follow the formats that we have here define the styles define the scripts and then set where you bundle it and how you read the bundle pathing is it's going to deploy this bundle file into this path basically your destination path which is what we defined up here if you recall right here and then following from this path it would then add on the remaining path name so in this case it's going to our demo disk assets and then going to plugins custom proper and then the bundle file name so let's have a look uh this is a css so it's going to our disk assets go to css um go to plugins oops not css just go into plugins and then go to where's this custom and then cropper and you see the two files right here which is this two files so that's how you add your own plugins to your project using keys build two of gogs bluetooth next comes our pages so let's minimize this yes blenders and open pages so pages is a special case um what pages uh how keen defined pages is like for example if you look into our examples like let's look into our html here so pages are like all these pages here so that you have a login page a wizard page pricing table invoices and error pages so what this means is for example a page is like a single individual page that doesn't have any like following layout or it has its own assets its own styles and its own individual components so what it does is it will grab all of the sas file from the pages source which is located here so it's going to grab all this all the folders in all the sauce files which is all this and also all the js files within this pages which is this one here and then we're going to bundle it up into its own js and its own css so if we look into our compiled assets where it is going is going to our dist css pages so this css pages as you can see our css is here our rgs is right next to it which is here so if you're creating your own page all you need to do is just add your own page uh first you need to create html for it so you add your own html within your project and then what you do is when you add your sas files you just create it's like a new folder like so say this is my page you can call it and then put your sas files within it similarly with your js you do the same thing you create your own folder save my page and then you put your js files in it and then when it compiles it goes and it deploys into one of this and then what you do is on that on your on that html on that page on your project you then include those um those css and js files so for example if we look into our login page if we look into our source as you can see where is our page see this this is our page css right here and then if you look let's go all the way down we see our pages right here so just have to include it into that single page and you're good to go so let me just delete these folders so we don't confuse ourselves uh where's this we don't need this as well okay so that's pages and themes as i mentioned that it only demo one has this and it just compiles the light and dark skins for that one now if your project has skins then of course you can use this build tool as well your render this field and what it does is just grabs all of the css files from the theme folder which is here and grabs all this and puts it into the css themes so if you look into our assets uh let's close paid themes and then we see all the stuff here so if you open the site you see lighting.css black and dark white and dark oops here and then if we look into our source files we see similar structures like so and lastly is our media field what it does is fairly simple it grabs all of our media files whether it's uh images or svgs and we're just going to deploy it into our dist assets folder so if we have a look into our source folder we have a media folder here which which has all of our like background jpegs logos even svgs um stock images and so and so on and we're going but what we're going to do here is we're going to copy all this and then deploy it into our assets here and that's pretty much it if you want to remove media files like for example if your project does not require maybe client logos for example you say your report doesn't require any of these files all you need to do is just delete this folder and then when you deploy when you own when you run the gap command you will just want to copy that or deploy that since it doesn't exist in the source folder all right so that is basically how you read the gulp config file the next thing we're going to discuss is how the additional command line options that you can write when you're running when you're running gog so if you look at our official documentation here so the build config is what we just discussed and then from here you can actually read up on what each field represents so in case you missed out like what i just said you can just read up here it's refined and now comes the build tasks now we've when we've gone through the yarn task and the cop uh there were one on the gob and then the demo flag commands so the demo flag is just to indicate which demo we want to build but besides this simple command we can add different things so what this does here is how remember how i mentioned that rtl is set to false by default we can change this to true and then we can save our and we when we run gulp demo one it basically does the same thing however since it's set by default and maybe you don't want to always compile or build a rcl version all the time then all you need to do is just add rtl equals true at any given time that you want rtl to be built so similarly with all the other commands here if you put a just js flag what you're gonna what you're doing here is you're just going to compile js files so let's do a demo and let's go to them one and go to ss indeed everything all right our ss is now blank and then what we're going to do is we're going to run a golf and then just and demo one as per this this command line right here and what's going to do is only going to do and deploy js files so let's run that put this aside and let's look into our folder and watch it get built okay it's done as you can see only the gs is only js assets are being built and deployed so if you open here of the gs only gets built now this is especially useful if your project is rather large and you only did gs changes or js modification to the code and you only want to deploy and build the js files then you just run with the js flag similarly with sas if you just need you sus changes then you just deploy the sauce again if you have only media changes that means say you remove certain media files from the human source or you add a new media files into the source then you just do this and it will just only deploy the media folder now comes to comes to this flag called prod what prod means is a production build and what it does is just minifies all gss and css so let's go ahead and first rebuild all of our assets all css media files in js files all right our assets are built so if we look into our code let's choose our start bundle as you can see it's still very neatly written and readable so let's say if you want to i'm i'm done with my project and we've done testing and you know if it got it got its uh approval anything like that and we're ready to deploy it for our production and what we do is we type in gob fraud and then we select our demo uh let's open up here and then one and then we run that all right it is our product build this done and as you can see our css is now minified and the reason why we do this is the moment when you minify items or files it basically becomes a lot smaller so at the moment our css bundle is actually 1.7 megabytes whilst this might look rather large simply because keen as a as an entire project or entire website it consists of many different components many different pages to to showcase our also demonstrate all the widgets all the components that king has therefore it's quite large however in within a real world project you may be removing certain things and you will not grow that large so let's go ahead and run our regular gulp to see the difference so now we have 1.7 kilobytes and as you can see whilst it's still compiling you can see actually see that the the file size increased by probably 300 kilobytes so that's the benefit of having a production build so next thing we have is watch tasks what this does is when you turn this on any changes you do within within the source folder like any changes that you make it will automatically build and deploy the assets to this folder so similar with this what what this is doing is you're just watching any js changes and for this case you're watching for any sus changes so if you plan to if you if you don't really want to uh keep writing the gap command all the time you can just type in got watch and then the demo of the demo that you're working on and then what it does is it will just automatically compile and build and deploy all assets every time you make a change but finally comes our localhost commands to start a localhost environment all you need to do is just type this command which is got localhost and then the flag the flag basically says which demo you you would like to build or showcase in your localhost and what it does it will automatically use the part 8080 or the 8080 now if you want to change this part to something else for example let's say this part is being used for another project or another environment you can change it within the gob watch file which is if you scroll down to our tools uh gulp in the gulp folder we have a watch here and then we have a connect basically here so all you need to do is you need to add your new part so you just type in parts and then the number that you want 8081 and that's it save this file and then you're good to go well of course once you save this file you need to um run the got localhost command again to refresh the localhost environment all right that's it for this video i hope you found i hope you find this video informative if you did give

bad day it's chumps is back", "wFB3xLXCkDY": "I'm John Skinner and this supports my book fishing sure boat and kayak and you can learn more about the book lounder book.com at the bottom of the rig is a one-ounce John Skinner SNS bucktail above that is something new for this trip it came out recently it's a tsunami glass minnow but it's got a silicone skirt and we're going to be using curly long otter tails also and the nice thing about this tsunami glass minnow is it's got a new longer hook with bait holder barbs on there so you saw that six inch sculpt Grubb went on there fit beautifully of course it does they designed it that way but the bait holder Barb's really keep it on there this looks really good and this is really it's the second shot that I'm getting with this on the previous trip I had tried it a couple times on a few fish and it seemed great so I'm going to stick with it this trip and see how it works out all right so look at that i've got a gulf grub but the tails bit off and anybody who fishes these things has this happen all the time and sea bass other things they bite the tails off and then what do you do with them well it gives it a great solution so they can auto tail over it so you'll still have your gulp grub you'll still have that scent that otter tail just gives fantastic action and makes a great combination because I moved in the off season this is yet another piece of water I have in fish before I had to fish to ensure a little bit on this trip and I wasn't doing well decided to move out here and I dropped into about 40 feet of water I know I've got a slope behind me I could see on the navy onyx chart on my fish finder and I was surprised the 1 ounce bucktail got down there it didn't stay down there very long I hooked up immediately so yeah you know a trip starts like this and you think oh my god you know this is going to be great well this is a lot of fun I'm going to catch a lot of fish on this trip but fluke wise this was a tough one but eight this was a fantastic start I just dropped down first time a new spot like a pelvic Stoney reach over grab a GPS mark before I even had to fish like halfway up because I wanted a mark on this spot so great start here and this fish did indeed grab the bucktail with that stub of a gulp it was actually a five-inch gulf swimming mullet with the tail bit off and then I laid a otter tail on the large ones some six and a half inches curly tail all of that the great combination works well so by the time I got that fish into the bleed-out bucket it was I just ran right back up current I've got about a 1.6 mile an hour drift so it's kind of fast so is even more surprising the one out stay down but yeah with a start like that I'm real anxious to make that next drift and see what I've got how low and behold I'm hooked up well again although it didn't take long for me to wonder what this was because I didn't feel the familiar fluke shakes on there and what came up was kind of a surprise holy oh my god so yeah I'm talking to myself out there over this one - beautiful feedback and of course you know within days of when the seasons going to open so both of these fish have to go back and boy both of those fish would have been great cooked up and on a dinner plate but oh well they're going to have to go back but yeah as a couple of beauties [Music] [Music] and here's trip number three on the spot so this one's rip in line huh probably not a fluke on that feel in the head shakes that's going to be one heck of a sea bass but it's going to run like that so it does not feel like a bluefish you know I just don't get too many stripers with the rapid vertical jigging like this with Luke I know why that is but here's one and yeah I could take this one home if I want the limit is 28 inches this one's definitely over I really prefer eating Luke and I'm hoping to be eating seabass a couple days after this one the season opens so this guy's going to get to go back again hit the bucktail with the auto strip on there so I'm dropping down in about 40 feet of water at the beginning of the drift and then I'm coming up a slope and there's a high spot around 30 feet 28 feet or so then I start dropping back so that's what the drift consists of you start deep you go up the slope you go across the top down the slope once I hit like 45 feet I pull up and redo the drift so this that striper hit early enough in the drift that I'm able to put back down again let's go sitting in probably 30 to 33 feet of water when I release that bass and had time to hook up again so I knew the hook on this teaser was going to be a real winner then the one concern I had was how well the silicone skirt would hold up so this trip was a great test of that because I caught a lot of fish the skirt held up fine occasionally it will get pulled down off the head and it's not a problem you just push it right back up on the head and it stays there just like it was when it came out of the package but what I like is this right here that you can reset that door I'll push it up there and the bait holder Barb's keep it on there amazingly on this trip despite the fact that I end up dealing a lot of sea bass I only go through two of those six inch grubs on that top hook so that's a real winner so the rod is tsunami classic six and a half foot rated ten to twenty pound test line the reels of quantum accuracy it's filled with fifteen pound test spiderwire ultra cast at the bottom the rig is I'm using twenty five pound test fluorocarbon on this rig a loop on the bottom for the bucktail one foot above that as a dropper loop for the teaser and there's a video on my channel shows exactly how to tie that the John Skinner buckles are made by S&S to my specifications in several tackle stores now the one I know for sure JH tackle okay Long Island in the store and online is another really nice sea bass boy it's one after another I have to wonder if these things are going to hang around long enough for the season open it always seems like when you get on stuff like this and it's out of season as soon as the season opens it's almost like they know when they disappear but I'll find out I'm not done catching fluke yet but I got to tell you 50 after drift after having that first one so quickly you know I just had it in my head that you know it can't be the only one it certainly got to be more out here to be caught I got to think it may have been a little more difficult with so many sea bass around because you know spending a lot of time on them and you know you hooked up on those and maybe the police don't get as much of a chance now this was fun anyway that suggests a lot of fun on this gear but the main target is definitely blue and the hit was different on this I I knew this was going to be something different so I certainly don't want to encounter too many of these on a fluke trip because they could make a mess of the rig so yeah I don't want to net this one can't swing it so kind of trying to get it to calm down a little bit I'm just grabbed by the tail hoping not to lose my buck tail on this so that was an extremely cooperative bluefish this is really important have to catch a bluefish check your rig make sure it didn't pray something it could easily Nick Nick the line and that could cost you nice fishy so there it did bite that outer tail in half yeah I don't think I'll hold up quite well normally what hey blue fish you're tough and that one just snipped it right off and to keep an eye on this is similar to when you fish with pork rind a lot of times the fish can come over the strip and then you end up setting the hook through the strip and you know it's probably not how you want it hooked on there so when you get a fish you just you know take a glance on it make sure everything looks right all right so finally got a second fluke a decent one at that but I got to tell you no matter how hard I tried there was no getting that third one the limit is three fish and I certainly wanted to get a third and it did not happen I did however end up catching more sea bass and more big ones the total on CBS for this trip was 16 and there was nothing that was below what is the the minimum size limit of 15 inches a lot of them were 18 to 20 inches maybe some better just really nice one size so you know we'll see if they hang around and I'm sure they won't will disappear but yeah this was a great trip nice mixed bag and that tsunami skirt held up extremely well so all right hope you find this useful and if you enjoy these

that i learned in queens new york there was this pizza uh italian restaurant uh it's probably about a city block long it was called pizza city it's out in queens anyway um i got this recipe from them uh it was a very popular dish it's called fried shrimp marinara you can order it sweet which means no heat you can order it with uh medium heat or high heat so that's what i'm doing right now before we start frying the shrimp i'm going to make the marinade sauce i've got my ulta cucina whole pair of tomatoes i'm not going to use this whole can because it's a little bit overkill so i'm going to go ahead and put about a 28 ounces of these tomato in the blender here and then i'm going to go ahead and puree them about 10 seconds good enough now put about a quarter cup of olive oil in my pan here pan is already hot so uh i'm gonna go ahead and add one tablespoon of chopped fresh garlic and this sauce here only has garlic it doesn't have any tomato not tomato but uh of course it has tomato it doesn't have any onion in it so it's just garlic fresh basil and the tomato obviously and then we're going to heating it up a little bit with some red pepper and depending on the heat that you you can endure you know you can put in a half a teaspoon a teaspoon or two teaspoons but i'm gonna go on the medium side and put like a half a teaspoon in now i'm gonna add my black pepper about a quarter tablespoon i mean teaspoon sorry and then i'm gonna add a half a teaspoon of red pepper crushed red pepper now you can add less or more whatever you prefer i'm gonna let that fry up for a second all right now it's ready for the tomato i'm gonna get a little golden brown the darker it gets the more better it gets so you want to be careful of that all right okay now i'm going to go ahead and add a teaspoon of salt and i've got four large basil's actually five large basil leaves and we're gonna go ahead and let that cook up now i'm getting ready to bread the shrimp but first i gotta make my egg batter or my egg mixture and then i'm going to go ahead and mix up my bread crumb and flour and season it so i got a cup of flour here i'm going to put that in my pan then i've got to put a cup of bread crumbs so it's 50 50 basically breadcrumbing flour i'm gonna add a little bit more garlic because of course it wouldn't be italian if we uh didn't add the garlic to it so i'm gonna go ahead and add a teaspoon of garlic to that and then a little bit of black pepper probably a quarter teaspoon of black pepper and a teaspoon of salt i'm going to go ahead and mix that up okay now i'm gonna get my eggs ready got four eggs we're gonna bread about uh 25 shrimp so we're gonna put four eggs in there without the shells beautiful i'm gonna put about a quarter cup of milk in it and we'll go ahead and feed those around okay all ready to go all right i'm going to start breading the shrimp this is the process i've got my flour batter ready here my egg batter you can hold the tail and then go ahead and put some of the breadcrumb and flour on it it's all ready to go looks good thank you paul's holding a wooden spoon every time i see one i get uh a little nervous well thank god my mom is in here because she used to beat us up with those that's right our sauce is all ready so i'm going to go ahead and scoot this over and now we're going to get our oil ready for frying the shrimp all right now i'm going to go ahead and put some olive oil in the pan just enough to fry about 25 shrimp and we'll get that heated up all right oil's hot let's get these shrimp going so beautiful yeah these are real nice and by the way uh these are gulp shrimp and they're uh they're not the farm raised [Music] yeah there's nothing like wild cause shrimp i mean it really does have a different flavor than a farm raised spring nice and brown all right just about uh about a minute on each side really well it needs depends on the size of the shrimp too now these are the uh 2125 which means 21 to 25 uh shrimp per pound oh yeah very nice all right simply done go ahead take this oil off the heat those are beautiful perfect all right we're going to go ahead and plate this i uh lined out some toasted italian bread and i'm going to go ahead and lay the shrimp on top of it okay that's plenty of shrimp and now i'm going to go ahead and put some of this marinara sauce on just right in the middle of each bread perfect there you have it very nice fried shrimp mani nada let's go eat all right time for the uh old taste test yeah dog dig in all right here we go this looks so good some italian bread looks good look at that shrimp eat up let me taste it is that good it brings back memories hey thanks for watching happy eating and we'll see you soon and please don't forget to subscribe for more

were to check out 7-eleven hot dogs and see what it tastes like so you know what I did just that so when you're this morning to 7-eleven you know cuz I don't usually go to 7-eleven you know I have no reason to go over there so but anyway I went to shatter 11 and what caught my eye was the the deal they have for two bucks you get a 1/4 pound hot dog as well as a big all my good size for 2 bucks so I couldn't pass it up plus I got a chance to win something here I'm gonna peel that out later alright so you got a big bite right here and see 100% beef hundred-percent - delicious and some writing in the back over here alright so let's take a look at it now I had to put my own condiments okay and well here it is basically here it is right here as you can see I put some ketchup mustard sauerkraut and so relish that's basically it it's on a regular hot dog bun and this is apparently your quarter power hot dog now once again you know I'm a big hot dog fan I love hot dogs check out my my my Burger King hot dog video and also my my checkers and rallies hot dog video but um yeah my first time trying to survive a hot dog and you know cuz I usually buy hot dogs at the grocery store you know and I'm an and I make it up you know I make it myself at home but let's try out this quarter pound hot dog from several Evan all right so let's go okay now this hot dog was not grilled it was roasting under the lamps on the circle thing you know all right it tastes like here's a Gobbo um I like the size it's nice and big see you get a whole lot of meat in there so it's a tasty as you can see I don't have any tissues with me because the guy didn't give me any tissue so am I supposed to take it myself I have no idea I'm you should go to set when I'm here now okay now what do I think about it uh I think it tastes alright is that the best tasting it tastes alright for what you get the soda and a quarter pound hot dog I think it's a good deal on a scale of one to five for that alone I give it a I give it a four the price for this Anna soda the air pickup I give it a 45 which is good taste wise I give it a three it's just average it's nothing special you has a goodbye to it there's the first time we're trying a siren of a hot dog look okay so um several Evan hotdogs I just had it's not the regular size one so I don't know how that one tastes properly next time I'll I'll get that separately but for a quarter-pound hot dog I'm just gonna with the fire once again I give it a three it's average nothing to write home about it's a nice size that's basically it and a four and a half for the soda that comes with it so that's it basically for the 7-eleven a quarter pound hot dog review big bite and so it's Bob from food you said thank you for watching also made a video before this

take care", "7aYS6Sbf0TA": "- You challenged us to make a whole bunch of giant candy like this. Check it out. Boom, look at that! - Whoa! Wait a second, lemme try! Oh! - Nah, bro, you kidding me, man? All right, no more magic. It's time to make some giant\nkinder eggs, so let's go. We have the kinder egg mold,\na whole bunch of chocolate-- - Wait, there's mold? Where's the mold? - Devan, these are molds,\nit's how cooking works. Come on. - I'm just kidding. - Time to fill it in, so here we go, ooh! What is that? - This is cookie dough that I dyed black to look like a geode. There are three parts to the kinder egg. There's a chocolate outside, the filling, and then the truffle on the inside. I'm making the truffle on the inside, you're making the chocolate exteriors. - I feel like a chocolatier right now. Oh! Dude, I'm like one of the three musketeers but with chocolatiers, man! Just a whole bunch of\ndudes covered in chocolate. - Oh, dude, since this is\ngonna be a giant kinder egg, I'm gonna make a bunch of\ntruffles on the inside. - Okay. I'm just trying to get this-- - Are you kidding me, dude? - Oh, man. Well, that wiggles a little bit more than it should right now. I gotta grab this mold over here, do a quick little flippity flipadoo. One, two, three. (crashing noise) I kinda bailed mid-way. So here we go. So, I'm just gonna take it like this, just gonna squeeze it down. What are you doing? - I'm putting these into the oven and letting them expand. - So as your geode truffles are baking, my egg is gonna be shaking. We call this the shake and bake. Wow, that wasn't fun. Time for me to shake this around. So here we go, wow. - Wow, all right then. - Coat the inside like that, okay! All right, that's pretty tiring, so there we go, egg is-- - That hurt? - Yeah. Now we just gotta fill in the filling as well as the little truffle\nthingys on the inside. Is yours done cooking yet? - Not yet. (elevator music) And we're done! - Okay, you didn't need to\nwake me up like that, man. I was having a great dream. - Careful, the oven's open. - I wake up to such a dangerous world. - All right, gonna pull\nthese things out of the oven. Here, thank you for\nclosing the oven for me. And now, I have these halves. Having some troubles there? - I got it. All right, well my egg is all ready to go. So now, it's gotta let it-- - Whoa, you're already done? - Nope, what I meant to say,\nwas it's not ready to go, and I need to put it off to the side to let it set in the fridge. - All right then, well. - It's my child. - As you do-- What? - Nothing. - As you do that, I'm gonna hollow out the rest of these, here, and then fill em up with these nice rocks. What are you-- - Somehow I forgot the\nfridge is over here. - I got a shaker here that\nalso doubles as a hammer, so. - Yeah, well I got a hook that also-- - Is a hook. - Doubles as a hook. - Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no! I think that's one of those pressure point things for your back. - Yeah right, man. - Yeah, seriously. (makes painful noise) Oh, geez. Here we go. - Oh my gosh. I feel like I just got like tasered. - You've gotten tasered before? - It was a rough weekend. Gonna take the bag like this. (banging noise) - Got a problem, bro? You just stopped. - I feel uncomfortable right now. - How could you feel uncomfortable? - Who are you? You've changed! You are now me! And I'm you! - Yeah! - This is weird! Here we go, gonna add in a whole bunch of sour patch kids right\nnow, in here, like this. Whoa. I can't talk over that, man. - Yes, you can. - No, I can't. - And you will. - I got a whole bunch\nof sour patch kids here, so now, I just gotta melt all these sour patch kids down again. This is gonna be-- I can't even right now. This is gonna be the inside\nfilling for my kinder egg. - [Devan] Look at this, man! This is looking sweet! - I melted down all the sour patch kids. I had to add in some blue food coloring, 'cause it was looking pretty funky. - I've got half of the geode truffle done, but now, I have to coat\nit all in chocolate. - The next part of my kinder egg, I'm doing a filling with this jet-puffed marshmallow right over here. - Wait, I wonder why\nthey call it jet-puffed? - Oh, you've never seen it before? It's this signature look, man. Here we go, three, two, one. Boom, look at that jet engine, man! - Whoa, are you kidding,\nit's like the arm rocket! - It's awesome, bro! - Okay, then. - And the best part is boom, look at that, it can fly by itself, man! - Is it pointing at me? - Yeah, it's building\nup a little in the back. (explosion noise) No! - No, no! What did you do? - Nothing! - I have a hole in my chest! - Well Devan, as you figure that out, I'm gonna continue making\nmy kinder egg right now. - Are you kidding me? You gotta help me out! The next thing for my mousse sauce is putting in this cool whip. - The next part of my kinder egg, I'm doing a filling with this jet-puffed marshmallow right over here. Yeah, we had a very bad\nexperience with this stuff. - Yeah. - Time to tear open\nsome pop rocks right now and just add these in. Oh, boy, okay there we go. Dude that sounds so crazy, man. - Whoa! - All right, well now\ntime to mix it all up. - Also coated the inside\nof these bowls here with some chocolate,\nnow I'm gonna add this-- What are you doing? - Hold on. - What are you doing? - I gotta inspect it. - Why? (sniffing) - Yep, it's chocolate. You never know with Devan. You just never know. - You kidding? With me? Whoa. Okay, there, yep, yep, yep. - You wanted us to use this, if you're not even using a piping bag properly. (gulp) I'ma keep mixing this over here. - Yep, the piping bag doesn't really work. I'm just adding it in like this. - Oh, wait, wait, wait! Oh, but wait! Oh! I get it now! You're doing for the truffle, you got chocolate on the outside, chocolate mousse on the inside, and then you're gonna use\nthese geodes inside that. - Exactly! - Holy cow, the whole dish\njust increased exponentially. - Got the two domes done, now it's time to grab\nthe geodes and put em in. So, there's one right there. - For my truffle, we've got a whole bunch of jolly ranchers over here. That was a quick grab. Oh! - That wasn't supposed to open yet. - Oh, are you kidding me, Devan? - Oh, man. - I'm gonna take a whole\nbunch of jolly ranchers, place em down over here,\ncreate a beautiful pattern, and turn it into the\nouter shell of my truffle. - Nice, well I-- - It'll make a lot of sense. - Are you done? - Yeah. - For the filling of my kinder egg, I'm making nutella, but better. - How are you gonna make\nbetter than nutella, man? - I'm gonna home-make it. - And you think you're really gonna nail the recipe more than the nutella brand? - You know, when you say it\nlike that, it sounds unlikely. - All right, well I'm gonna continue constructing this absolutely\nbeautiful masterpiece here, and let's speed it along. - Yo! Wait, whoa, I switched places with Devan. Wait, where'd Devan go? - Huh, wait, what? Why am I over here? - Oh, sorry, I've gotten\nreally rusty at this. You should probably take\nback your sack of hazelnuts. - Hazelnuts. - I was trying to avoid\nthat, but all right. I'm gonna take this right here, and again, I'm gonna use it as the outer shell of my truffles. We're gonna flip it over, here we go. Three, two, one. (screaming) okay, there we go. That's so satisfying! - Yo, that looks cool! - Wait 'til you see what I\nfilled the interior with. It's gonna be saucy. - Like, is it actual sauce? - It's not actual sauce,\nit's just going to be saucy. - So, sauce. Got the hazelnuts all blended up, now just gonna add the chocolate. - All right, for my truffle, I've got some peanut butter that I'm gonna pop inside. It's still got the cover\non it, so here we go. Three, two, one. - [Devan] Now just gotta blend this stuff. - Well, we've got everything we need, so now it is time to fully put our kinder eggs together and\nsee their gloriousness. We've got the kinder eggs,\nand dude, look at this! This is absolutely massive! - Dude, they are really heavy too. - Exactly, so right now,\nwe've got everything we need to fill it up, but first, we've got a chocolate layer, and then a white chocolate layer\nwe've added on top of that. I've got some candy slime over here, and as you know, there's\ngoing to be a surprise inside the kinder egg, but right now, let's put these together. The giant kinder eggs are all made, and bro, this is an engineering\nfeat of genius, man! Like, they are so massive! - These things are huge. - But the best part is wait 'til you see the surprise that's on the inside, man. Like that's really what takes this whole thing to another level. Here is the big reveal, three, two, one! Tada! Look at these, bro! - Dude! - These turned out to\nbe absolutely insane! So we're gonna be\ncracking these things open and eating them at the end of the video. You challenged us to\nmake a giant Butterfinger and Snickers bar, so let's go. First thing I'm doing is making the inside of my Butterfinger, so I got a whole bunch of peanut butter right here. - And I'm making a peanut for my snickers. - I'm gonna add my peanut\nbutter in here like this. Here we go, three, two, one. (grunting) That sounded like a pterodactyl. Wait, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. - What? - There's corn syrup? - Yeah, man! - You are the worst\nfarmer of all time, Devan. You couldn't farm a peanut,\nyou don't even know what it is. - Why would I want-- No, what? - As you can tell, we got a little bit of peanut butter over here, so now, I think I can\nmove this off to the side. - What? Just a little bit? - Yeah, I gotta get pumped\nreal quick, so here we go. All right, there we go and then-- All right, so there we go! Three, two, one. (grunting) Easy, totally easy! Whoo, I feel exerted. The whole thing with the\ninterior of a butter finger is you gotta make sure\nthat it's super crunchy. So, got some corn flakes here. We got some chick-o-sticks. Whole little tower right over here. Stay. I've never even like,\nheard of these things. - Oh, they're right here too. - My stick, no touching my sticks! Bro! Devan has butterfingers. - Watch this. (crashing noise) - I'm a little scared. - I meant to point it at you, but. - I feel rather uncomfortable right now. - All right, this thing is heated up, now it's time to add\nsome baking soda here. - Here is Helga the hen. - Whoa, yes! - Gonna smash up the\nsticks with Helga the hen. This is gonna act as the crunchy texture on the inside of my butterfingers. - I'm putting this into the mold here. - That looks so gross. - Collins? - What? - Can you help? - I finally figured out\nthe perfect mixture, now I'm gonna pour it into the mold. - You hold onto that for a second. No, no, no, no, no. - What? Collins! I don't wanna hold it, it's all you. - Okay, so here, no, no, no! We can't just set it-- And we're back to where we started. - [Devan] Oh, wow, this is\nreally not going in very well. - [Collins] And that's\ngonna create a peanut? - Hopefully. - All right, here we go, just gonna scoop out a little bit of peanut\nbutter over here like this. Oh, yeah, just give a nice\nlittle plop down here. Boom, bigger scoop! Call me the peanut butter dude! - Haha, I don't know if I wanna call you the peanut butter dude anymore. You're like a pokemon. They say their name\nbefore they do something. And if you're a pokemon, that\nmeans you could be caught! - You can't catch peanut butter dude. - Oh you can't, well let's try it out! Three, two, one! - Ow! Holy cow! I almost wish I was caught, 'cause it probably woulda hurt less. - Bruh. - What? - Can you see how slow this is going? - Did you just say bruh? - Bruh. Oop, I missed. Completely missed. I completely missed. - I mean, it looks kinda cool. - It kinda looks like a goober. Right, isn't that a fish,\nor something like that? - What? (stammering) - It looks like one of\nthose fishes that go. - Peanut butter man does not\nseen one of these fish before. Next up, I gotta melt down a whole bunch of candy\ncorns for the caramel. - All right, just gotta let the mold set and then the peanut is done. All right, next up, I'm making my nougat. - To find the illusive candy corn, I brought along the silly scissors. - That was a voice crack? - Nope, that was just me. - Okay, well, what do they do? - They cut a hole in the\nspace-time continuum! So silly! Time to cut open the\nfabric of time, you ready? Three, two, one. (zapping noise) Oh! Snap, yo! - That looks like you. - That looks like me. This is alternate universe me! - Haha, yeah. - Where is the candy corn? - It's been here the whole time? Just gonna put in this\nmarshmallow fluff here. - There is one other use, and that is you can use these to slice off the top of your recently found candy corn. - Just what scissors do. - This is what I call the\nbasketball dunk spike. Excuse me, I'm going backwards. All right, here we go. Three, two, one, dunk! Oh, snap! That was pretty cool. We got even more candy\ncorns, and here we go, gonna add that in like that. Boom, there we go. Then we got this one over here. - Are you making this on\nthe floor, or in that? - I know you're not really\nasking this question, Devan. - I'm not. - And that hurts. I've got some dark corn syrup I'm gonna add into my candy corn. Is this gonna be the nougat? - Yes. - What, whoa! That looks like-- - [Devan] No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! I'm gonna get a new one. - We've got the candy bar molds, and the first thing I'm doing here for my butterfingers is the topping. - And the first thing\nI'm doing is my nougat. - This is very heavy. Three, two, one. Oh, let's see, okay a little pour. - [Devan] Look at the rolls, dude! - [Collins] Dude, that looks beautiful! Mine's actually looking\npretty good as well, man. All right, so here we go,\njust gonna pour this down. - Now it's time to add the peanuts. - [Collins] Those are the peanuts? - Yes. Gonna try to plop it outta here into here. Yeah! - [Collins] That looks so cool, man! - Now it's time to add the caramel. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! We can go at the same time! We can be bros! Okay, three, two, one. Just pour it straight in the center, oh! That's a lot of peanut butter. - Dude! - Time for me to get my hands in here and kind of mix this up a little bit. - [Devan] Wait, what? - I feel like I'm doggy-paddling right now to get all this stuff in here. We gotta douse all of this\nin a lot of lovely chocolate. But right now, we'll\nget it all finished up and then it's time to see how they taste. All right, the giant\ncandy bars are all done. I gotta say, I was expecting big, these are massive, bro! - These are not any\nnormal candy bars, man. - Oh, no. - Holy cow! - Trying to take a bite of these things is gonna be next to impossible. Right now here is the\nbig reveal, three, two-- Wait, a three-second like challenge. We wanna see you like this video in three seconds, you ready? Here we go, three, two, one, done. Three, two, one. What's up? - I messed up. - Well there's mine, reveal yours! - Tada! - There we go. - You get to comment down below, which one do you think will taste better, and we'll be eating them\nat the end of the video. - You challenged us to make\na giant donut and nerds rope. So the first thing I'm\nmaking for my giant donut is the round donut-shaped dough. - Yup, and the first thing I'm making is the nerd of the nerd rope. So, to make my nerd, I got a jolly rancher on the tip of this hot straw. Just gonna try to blow it up real quick. - Oh no! - You broke the faucet! - I broke the faucet! - Are you kidding me? - That's an issue. - Bro. - This is an issue. Yeah, let's just have-- - Bro, are you kidding? - Haha, whoopsie! I don't think it's that noticeable. - Are you kidding? I'm actually gonna use a mold instead. That might work out better. - All right, all I gotta do is just take these\ndifferent cakes right here, like this, just gonna let it go down and-- Devan? - What? - I need this space right here. - Okay. - Three, two, one, let's see. Oh, there we go, that's\nwhat I'm talking about. Sweet moves, bro. Oh boy, yeah, this is-- - And you got it on my arm. No! I knew you wouldn't do it. - My commitment level is weak. - So, before I do this, I have to wash my hands, but Collins? - What? - I would normally wash\nmy hands right here. But now, I have to go all the way over there to wash my hands. Look what you've done to me, bro. - I'm sorry. It was the cakes, man! - Shame. - Blame them! - I'm all the way over\nhere, washing my hands, and I'm totally separated from the action! - Yeah, you can't even see how cool my donut is starting to look, man! - Actually, I can see it. - Well, what do you think? (laughs nervously) - It's looking good. - What was that laugh? - All right, so I've melted\ndown the jolly ranchers, now I've gotta pour em into the molds. - While you do that, time for\nme to move my donut over here! I tried to talk normal, but that is a very heavy donut right now. So, next up I've gotta\nmake some cotton candy for the toppings on my donut. All right, here we go, cotton\ncandy machine is turned on. - [Devan] Just pouring\nit into the mold here. - Let's see if this works, here we go. You ready, three, two, one. Whoa! Yo! - Yes! - Wait a minute! This is what I'm talking about! - [Devan] This is the real stuff, dude! - Yeah, man! Look at that sight! - Calm, calm, calm. That was too much. All right, it's gonna\njust take way too long to cool this stuff down, so\nI'm gonna use liquid nitrogen. - Okay, don't try this\nat home, by the way. I think the cotton candy was much cooler, just saying, just putting that out there. Can you do this with liquid nitrogen? Boom! - It's always the coolest. Did you get that? It's really cold. - It was a joke. Next, I'm gonna use a\nlittle bronca-ya-jus-just-- Bronca-saura-donk,\nbanca-donka-donka-brunkis. You got it, here we go, three, two, one. Just gonna pour it in\nlike this, here we go. - Okay, do I just hold it here? - Yeah, there we go. Oh, no, no, gotta catch this! Yep, keep it going! - [Devan] Do I spin it? - Yeah, just keep spinning it. I think we're reaching the limits of what the bronky-donkyus can hold. This will be perfect\nfor the top of my donut. - This looks like a wand with\na spell on the end of it. - Yeah right, man. - Abra-cadabra, you shall\nnever do the dab again, bro! - What? That's not a real spell. - Yes, try it. Uh-huh, I told you, bro. - Third time's the charm. - Oh man! If that's what happened\nif he tried to dab, I'd hate to see what happened\nif he tried to floss. All right, so now we got these two halves, it's time to heat these things\nup and fuse them together. - Sorry about that, man. Okay, caught a couple of peeps. Wait, I wonder if this\nworks with other stuff, like hot cheetos for instance. Let's try it, here we go. Nope, more peeps. It's infinite peeps. - All right, so, why are you\nusing these things, Collins? (crickets chirping) - That's a good question. Oh, sorry, to make a topping for my donut. - This is made now, now it's\ntime to move onto the rope. - This ain't made, this is wack. Well right now, it's the moment I've always been waiting for, time to yeet 150 chicks at once. Yeet! Picked up 15 chicks just like that. - And I'm just picking up\na big tube I made here. - What did, where? - This is for my nerd rope, bro. - No, where did that come from? - Collins, we aren't playing around. - Devan, on a real note,\nwhere did that come from? - From the ground, it's\nbeen there the whole time. - I literally didn't see it at all. (gasps) (stammers) Gosh, it's so tough to open, holy cow. - I thought you were strong. I thought you could pick up 100 chicks. - 150. Whoa, peep slide, bam! Tilt it! Look at that, bro! You just made that peep's day. - I hate to say it, but this\npeep is about to be eaten. You do not wanna give this\nthing life and a name. - That's so dark. - All right, so I'm\ngonna fill this thing up with some jello, then let it set. Three, two, one. Okay, it's going in. - I can't see anything. - All right, there we go, got one. Hold up, stay there. - Bumped me. I don't understand why\nI'm always being bumped. - Karma. Pouring this one in here. All right, you're gonna let\ngo on the count of three. Here we go, three. - No more three, two, ones! We are banning three,\ntwo, ones on the channel! - Oh wait, but first! (laughing) Sweet baby Yoda. Well, time for me to mash\nup a whole bunch of peeps! - Next up, I am making a red nerd with a red apple, some candy\nmelt here, and some nerds. - I think these peeps are gonna act as a lovely texture for the\ntopping of my donut, man. - Lovely. Beautiful, glorious. - It is. Kinda disturbing, I've got like a peep's eye just chilling on my hand. - Hey man, that's a little\ndark, don't you think? - I got peep vision now. - Whoa, wow, okay. Whoa, getting a little close there, bro. - So it's basically\nlike a candy apple, man? - Kind of. I got a bunch of different\nflavor profiles, you know? (spatting noises) - You shoulda just poured\nthe whole box on it, man. It's like you break open a box of nerds. Ooh, missed that. - Collins, I think the key\npoint is you don't break it! - There we go. - Collins! You're not supposed to break\nit, you're supposed to open it. There you go, there you go, there you go. That was like, nothing. - Exactly, they must be filled with air. - It's almost like you\nsmashed it on the counter and lost everything that was inside. - I don't know why you\nwould think that, man. This just in, nerd boxes are\nfilled with 90 percent air, and only ten percent candy. - Wait, wait, wait, dude,\nwe don't wanna get sued. You can't say that. - Okay, yes. - You can't say that. - Just kidding, fake news! - Exactly. - Back to you Patricia! Okay, right now it's time\nfor me to glaze my donut. - And time for me to\nfinish up my nerds rope. What are you saying, dude? (grunting) - What is that? I've got the glaze, bro, you gotta chill. Three, two, one. - Oh, that's a good coat, man. - That looks chunky! - It looks like a smoothie. Oh no! It's going down the\nfront of the table, dude! I just gotta remove this nerds rope. - Oh my gosh, dude! - Yes, wait, hold it, hold it! - This is so dope, bro! Time to finish things up, and then we're gonna be eating em. Giant candies are done, and bro, that nerds rope is absolutely insane. - It is massive, bro. - Like, the nerds are\nlarger than my fist, bro. - Seriously. - And this donut, I gotta say, I think it's 800 pounds, to be honest. - It's pretty huge. - I've had a lot of trouble lifting it. So here is the big reveal. Three, two-- Oh, wait, five-second subscribe challenge. We wanna see if you can\nsubscribe to the channel and turn on the channel post\nnotifications in five seconds. Are you ready? Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one, done. If you were able to do that, comment down below Keyper squad right now, and let's see how these turned out. Three, two, one, tada! Look at these giant candies! Finally time to eat the giant snickers bar and the giant butterfingers. So Devan, which one should we eat first? This whack, square-looking snickers bar, or the beautiful, shapely butterfinger? It's the shape you want. - All right, let's do yours first. - Thanks. - Let's be disappointed, together. - So, to cut it open, I've\ngot an ax right over here. - Are you kidding? - Here's the thing. If you you ever got a giant candy bar, do not try this at home. Just gonna kinda give\nit like a downward dog. Here we go, three, two, one. - Wow. - Okay. - [Devan] Dude, yes! - Holy cow! - [Devan] That works! - Boom, boom! Yeah! Ax-man, I'm the ax-man! - I won't, I won't. - And don't worry, we will not be eating all of this by ourselves. We'll be sharing with\nour friends and family. Holy cow, this actually\nlooks really, really, wow! Hey, hey, hey, hey. - What, what, what, what, what? - Use your own fork and grab\nyour own piece of the bar. - My fork is on the floor. - Well, it was your decision. - [Devan] Just gonna grab off. - So, you're the first one to get the feeling of the texture. What does it feel like? - Yeah, terrible. - Let's see how it tastes. Ready, here we go. Three, two, one. Whoa. It tastes like a butterfinger, man! It can't be that bad. What, it's that bad? - It tastes great, but wow, is it crunchy! - Well, yeah, it's all about that crunch. So, I think I have a strong chance of winning this round, but Devan-- - So do I. - I like that. - I mean, no. I'm actually going to undo\nit from the back here, and do a nice little reveal. - Don't worry about me. Tada! - [Devan] Yeah! - [Collins] Look at that! - Yeah, the back's not so great, but, you know, the\nfront looks pretty good. I have no idea how I'm\ngonna cut through this. - [Collins] You need a bigger knife. (elevator music) Three, two, one. Oh, oh, it's going! It's happening, it's happening! Look at that! Holy cow! It's beautiful. - It looks great. - I might actually cry. - Okay, maybe don't cry. Just gonna pull down here, yes! Got some of that off. That's a chunk of chocolate. - That's like a full\nchocolate bar, normally. So, I'm gonna take this\nlittle piece of chocolate over here, I'm gonna be tasteful. All right, I'm gonna place\nthis down and layer-- (grunting) - Yes! I just wanted to do that. - Holy cow. (yelling) - I want the peanut. - It's definitely wedged\ndeep in the crevasse. Hey, don't bring that up. - All right, here we go. Three, two, one. Whoa! - The peanut is too hard. - Whoa, whoa! Are you kidding me? You crushed it, bro! Creme de la awesome. Well, as you can tell, my egg is starting to fall apart, so now it is time to crack it open. So, here we go, three, two, one. We have made it into the egg. Here it goes, we're moving pieces. Tada! - Wow. - First, take a look at\nthe surprise on the inside. It's got a balloon in it, here we go. Oh, it's getting a little bit stuck. All right, so this is the surprise that Devan made for me on the inside. - Yes. - What is it? - You can't tell, dude? - Well, it looks like a little jet-engine-propelled telephone. No, no, this is how you handle\ncustomer service calls, man. Hey, so my car phone isn't\nworking, and I'm mad. - It's a car, Collins, but it's okay. - I think you should probably grab like a slab of chocolate first. Let's try to remove that ball. It's like a game show. Remove that ball! Oh, yep, this is nice. \u266a Scoop-de-doop-doop-Doop \u266a Okay, there we go. - [Devan] You got it. - It's been scoopa-dee-doo-- \u266a De doop doop doop \u266a Wanna cheers it first? - Sure. Three, two, one. - Whoa. This thing here-- (evil laugh) - That tasted like a\nsandwich with chocolate! - That was pretty phenomenal, man. - I agree. - With the filling on the inside, combined with peanut butter and jelly, the chocolate on the outside. Woohoo! - All right, let's do this thing. You ready? - You want me to help out at all? - Yeah, definitely. - Do it with the spoons. - That's what I'm gonna do. Three, two, one. Oh, it's very soft. - I gotta say, this is\na resilient egg, bro. - It is, man. I make em good! - I smack it, I smack it hard! - Three, two, one. - Karate chop! Ow. - Tada! - These truffles look\npretty delicious, bro. - Yeah, they look a little dented though. Honestly might've been your spoon. - Couldn't have been. - I think it was. - I don't think it was. - What should we serve us first? - The surprise! - Wait, it has a rope on it? - Yeah, well I don't know if it'll get-- It makes sense with the whole thing. - A pendulum. You're getting sleepy. Hold onto this. - Okay, cool, here we go. Two things here it's a climbing man. - Oh! - He can climb the rope! See, look at that. - Look at that! - Boom! - He's getting to my hand. - So right now it's time to\ntaste the delicious kinder egg. - I think you take one of\nthese massive truffles. - Don't touch, it's mine. - What are you doing? - That's mine. Okay, so listen. Oh, that's uncomfortable. It's like reaching into a pudding. - Yeah, there you go. - Ba-bam! You need to move yours off to the side. - Move my egg? What are you doing? - I help with my foot. (crashing noise) Okay, well I'm gonna try right here. Three, two, one. Oh! Look at that! - Yo! Yes! Three, two, one. Oh! - No! - That was close. - That scared me. I feel like you're doing something wrong. - I made these things, bro. I know what I'm doing, I think. - I don't think so. I have it already open. You hurt your pride\nmore than your fingers. - [Devan] Yeah! - [Collins] There you go! - Look at that, man! Remember I got those geodes on the inside. - Oh! - Yeah! - Oh, dude, I'm over here\nlooking like a prehistoric dude. Three, two, one. Oh! - [Devan] That looks so cool, man! - Here we go, brute strength. Boom! Why does mine look so\nmuch whacker than yours? - I'm gonna dip it into here a little bit. All right, here we go. Three, two, one. This is so good! Holy cow! Wow. Our friends are gonna love this. - If you were only able to eat one of these giant kinder eggs, which one would you wanna eat? Let us know in the comments down below, and we're onto the next giant candy. We've got the giant donut, and the absolutely insane nerds rope. Devan, which one should we eat first? I think let's do yours. - All right, so here's the thing. I'm gonna lift it up, you're\ngonna give it a slice, okay? - Wait, wait, wait, where, where? (yells) - [Collins] Don't try this at home. I don't know why you\nwould, or how you would. - Why is it blue, dude? - You should never cut towards the person. - This looks gross. - Forget this, yeah, wow. - That looks like soggy bread. - Well, that's kinda actually what is was. - I'm a little queasy. - Man up. Grab a fork. - Bring it on, brother. - Clink it. I want the pink! I'm gonna take off, here we go, boom. One of these cotton candy balls. And then put the peeps on the top. - You crazy. - Whoo, it's falling apart! - Are you ready to go, dude? You're stalling. - All right, yep here we go, can't wait. Three, two-- Wait, if you wanna win\na 15 minute video call with Devan and I, text the\nword best to 81800 right now. After the video. Text the word best to 81800. You will automatically\nbe entered in to win. Let's see how this tastes. Three, two, one. - Dude, this is so good! You got a big peep in your mouth. Way to go, man! So many different flavors, this thing-- - It just tasted so good, man! - So good! - I am over the moon with my creation. - Wow, now it's time for the main event. So, Collins, can you move your donut? - Devan, can you move my donut? 'Cause I can't. - It's your donut. - I'm not strong enough. - I'll give it a shot. - Lift it all the way up. Are you actually able to lift this thing? - I think so. - Holy cow. Need more leverage? - Yes, okay! - Holy cow! Dude! - That was definitely very heavy. So, I'm just gonna cut a small part right in the middle here. - What about me, what do I do? - I actually cut yours,\ndo you wanna cut mine? - That would be a pleasure\nand an absolute honor. - Man, these knives are really blunt. - Yep, they are definitely not sharpened. - You might wanna not cut so fast. Reveal the toothpicks. - Check it out, I'm a magician. It's gone. - This is the nerds rope here. - Another toothpick! - I couldn't make it stick, all right? And remember, I made a bunch of different nerds with different flavors. This was cheese popcorn dipped in-- What are you doing? - I want that. - So I'm just gonna\nbreak this guy in half. Wow. - Ooh, that was good. - We gotta split this in half. You know what, I'm just\ngonna pull it apart. Just say some words man, fill the time. - So, Devan's clearly\nstruggling so hard right now. Your hands have been all over that. I don't even wanna eat that anymore. I'ma slice off a new piece for myself. - Are you kidding? This is really not easy, bro. That took you like a solid-- - Oh! - What, what, what, what, what? - Little bit of a oopsie. - [Devan] No! - That's not rubbing away. - Let's get into it, man. Let's eat this thing. Three, two, one. (mumbles with mouth full) - Okay, that one was good. Very good. - They're really good. - I mean it's like, it's a rock. You choose your life,\nbut all together, good. - Dude, all of the flavor profiles in this thing were insane! - That purple one! - I know, but seriously,\nall these were delicious. - Even the popcorn. The flavor profiles were\ndefinitely on another level. Don't worry, we won't be\neating all this by ourselves. We're gonna be sharing all of it with our friends and families. So, you get to comment down below, if you had to eat one\nof these giant candies, which one would it be? You wanna see another video,\nclick right over here. You got five seconds, here we go.

of white pepper a half a teaspoon of chinese spice or chinese powder and a half a teaspoon of ground ginger powder but you can always use um fresh ginger so i already have my mixture here so i'm just

give it a nice herb oh it smells wonderful already and you can add your green beans if you have green beans or if you're using the green and the peas you can add these but i prefer to use green beans you want the carrot to soften up a little but not get too soft you want your heat on high but you don't want your veggies on steaming you want your veggies really cooking not steaming you want them

somebody says does the rice have to be very firm good question well it depends on how you like the rice i like firm rice but if you like it salt you can have it a little soft but your fried rice is going to be really sticky if it's too soft so i think the rice should be a little firm yes um somebody said how ripe was the pineapple the pineapple was super ripe it was very very right the skin was really yellow mullet you can just smell it it was very juicy it was very ripe fresh pineapple not canned and this is the fresh pineapple i used um someone said can you send a virtual sample yes yes

i just did a little tick tock on this but i'm eating an asian salad asian chicken salad it comes with like this you're dressing this is the one time i'm like thankful i don't like sauces oh i mean overall i'm glad i like dried food i don't like sauces because they're extra calories and i know they say like dressing can be like super unhealthy on a salad so like i'd probably put dressing on a salad just to eat a salad but i don't even like dressing or that that texture of like wetness i did put futons in but so i was thinking about this this is the day after my cheesy stick binge where i had the mcdonald's the chick-fil-a and the cheesy chicken one day and for me i used to just like not eat for two days and go on a binge and eat basically what i did yesterday i just eat a bunch of things in a row and then two days off and it's super bad for your i have i had gastrointestinal bleeding last year which can actually be you know deadly so that's why i start eating like salads and just trying to incorporate a little healthier but it was directly from like binging like purging they're not like your organs get all messed up it's like really really bad aside from not being able to lose weight messing up your metabolism etc and i do have an issue with food on a couple different levels obviously binging is completely normal to me if i eat food in my head i'm like okay the next day i don't eat food but you have to eat every single day so that's been like hard for me to grasp so i was like you know what i have to eat every day let me just do less portions so maybe i would eat a grilled cheese sandwich but only have half of it with like chips or something and a handful of chips and it's good for people who are the disorder recovery like you have to eat so don't like the first step they help me with is like don't judge yourself for what you're eating just make sure you're eating every day and by doing that not only was like set in my head but i didn't want to binge because i was getting the food i wanted and i was feeling better so now second level leveling up for me is just trying to eat something healthy like two healthy meals like hard boiled eggs in the morning or special okay kind of i love special okay with like almond milk i try and have like a salad now and then even my dinner i try to do more portion control but like my breathing and i'm getting going to a doctor i actually have to go to an ent doctor and a cardiologist sometimes my chest feels so tight and i get the shortness of breath and i haven't had coven but that scares me warm when you start feeling it am i dab my dad had a weight problem when he was like in high school i guess i don't know he never looked that big to me i saw a picture a couple pictures in high school we didn't have a lot but i saw a couple and he can't look that big but he always had like his weight under control you would never consider him a fat i'm it was probably like six foot six one 180 his whole life and now he's very thin you know he's just he walks a lot he really doesn't splurge ever i think i've seen like dessert like twice in the past 10 years but remember when he switched from like maybe he had been eating out now because he used to eat burgers but yeah maybe he just wasn't always eating burgers you know whatever but he started switching like salads and stuff and i was like i know you're looking you don't really understand yeah why aren't you getting a burger you know and he's like i just don't feel good when i'm eating them and i was like i've always felt so good but the idea of putting fast food invited him literally was like oh my god my my chest hurt my stomach hurt like i i feel so what you know so i think that salad is so boring i stopped putting mukbang in my channel because like my things really are like make a cloud style a spread of food and hey i love watching those i think they're really stephanie sue has a great spread those are my thing when there's a lot of food involved but this is now just me eating that's why i try a lot of things like i need to talk about eating this because i don't want to be like a mukbang where it's like i'm gorging myself i'm binging watch me eat i'm trying to switch it more like hey eat with me have a meal with me and if you're in eating recovery eating anything is great whether you have binge eating overeating and recipient like eating something's great but if i can encourage you know to eat healthier for me it's me like physically feeling sick but hey if it's for vanity and fast food is an addiction like i do crave it it's somewhat of a blessing and a curse i guess obviously i don't want to be sick and i want something to be wrong with me but my body it is true once you're about 30 like okay start start listening to your body if your body's like i can't breathe maybe chill on fast food we relatively healthy not healthy but i don't really eat fried dinner i know pastas and stuff are not the greatest for you but and we always split it so we don't usually eat but one thing i learned is don't feel guilty for eating we have to eat and binging is a real it's so interesting because right after in the moment you get like a high i do but then after you have like such garbage i was so hungry we were sushi last night which i like having sushi because i only eat like two or three pieces of sushi and that's not like honey sushi i only need a few pieces so that's my portion control hmm i got this playboy bunny it's like a crop top it's actually really cute i have cute leggings on to him got my tic-tac-toe checklist idiot i showed my leggings but this stops from misguided usa am i just making up that's called misguided usa we're just misguided i said this guy to go saying i have no idea why but it's so cute playboy has such a cool logo that's what i always wanted for my sad boy brand um obviously my band is at where she hasn't five but i wanted the brand to like stand on its own right i should have addressed this sooner we're on delay with the shipping of the subway merch it's just embarrassing honestly they are definitely going to ship it i have a phone call today it's just been it's supposed to be out before christmas and with covet and stuff in china it's frustrating but if you place an order you will get your merch obviously if you wanted it for christmas or you want a refund for whatever reason there's a customer service email and the merch company will will help you if you want like a refund or you don't want anymore whatever it's really disappointing because the merch sold really well like i'm better than any other merch it is my favorite merch i love the look of it and i don't i'm not giving up on it but we definitely have to figure out something else where i put money up in advance and just pay for everything at once so it's made and ready to ship a's up because that's so embarrassing it's so embarrassing it really is embarrassing but now that i know like sales and numbers i can kind of use it as like leverage now to get like better quality things just knowing what we what we're what i'm capable of selling which i also didn't know because i never really sold merch merch i had like shirts like my face on it i like sweatshirt but this is like a logo design like working with a designer boom while i write down this it was so cool too i need to go to a dentist oh my god i need to go down touches i'm so scared to go any doctors now because i call them this that was actually everything i needed i can't stop eating it um chop stop really good talents fun fact i think the ceo shop stop actually the ceo not just like the tick tock ceo of chop shop i mean see you guys it was really he reached out was like oh we want to be able to like hook you up and give you like free salads which i mean like that's so dope but i always post make my salads i never go in so oh man i should email them back though but either way i love chopstop they don't have to give me free salads like they're really that good i was very excited wow all right guys i hope you guys are well i got like three cups of these today here's a fun way to drink more water one obviously i love starbucks cups i love like sippy cups i think they're just so fun and cute to carry around like they they're just a cute accessory so reminds you drink water but also like the more you can gulp in one because sometimes i just forget to drink water so if i have it in my hand i try and drink like half of it what i try and drink like six of these a day but yeah i did my makeup today i feel a little bit better about myself that helps a lot too you can get up put makeup on your face you kind of feel like you're a little more put together i don't know again this is just for people like well i mean this is just for me honestly because i'm okay like if i could have just had like chick-fil-a nuggets yesterday and that was it i had to go and get the korean fried cheese which is really really good but i had just been eating so much so it wasn't like a splurge it was kind of like kind of still sick so we're on the salad kick if you want to see me eat salads i can film them more or i put them on my second channel i haven't really vlogged anything on a second channel but i don't know i don't even know the difference between secondary channel anymore i just kind of put up whatever i feel we got this off etsy shop small businesses mt.com all right guys be good drink water and um be kind to yourself love yourself you are not your weight you are not what you eat you are a

made beach by you guys [Music] all right people there we go the old surfboard taxi okay let's tie this up maybe to that sweet I got I got a setup right with your name on it here you go bro that's you gotcha plug y'all these blue fish are so fun this is like in the mid-atlantic Virginia North Carolina this is kind of like almost like what's to come for summertime fishing you know blue fish yeah we know it's not the most attractive fish out there in the ocean to catch but personally I think that blue fish are heavily underrated Kristi and I we love catching these blue fish and like we were saying there's tons of different ways that y'all can catch these blue fish you can catch them with hard plastics you can catch them with soft plastic they'll hit anything there yes maybe these are so fine actually got to get you on one girl alright y'all got my first bluefish actually second one of the day about first one on the gotcha you got your plug action all right you guys first blue fish into the boat Jeff's got one del got one fish oh all right this one's pulling good man my dragon am pretty good these guys fight so good alright these guys have no size limit to keeping them there's one there we go that's a good one come on in here these blue fish are such a blast to catch it's got me boat huh oh it's bow hooked that's why alright people let me show you what we're using right now a 3/8 ounce jig head with the z-man Wow Kristi's uh so these three bouncing jig heads are getting it done there's one hope there is yeah all right people little blue fish this guy will eat just some fun in the Sun out here all right so we came out here for a little blue blue action these are so fun oh he's a wily one all right all right got another blue fish and I'm holding onto this guy on my might so he does not get away all right so y'all when I first heard of plugs I don't know why I found them intimidating but honestly it's probably one of the most fun ways to catch a fish you really can't mess up this lure it's super easy to work the only thing is you guys just want to make sure you work it quick see Jeff is already on a fish stop plastic seems to be producing a little bit better for some reason so I'm gonna work this guy a little bit slower and see if I can get I strike alright y'all so what we're using today is a 3/8 ounce jig head and I'm not even using a leader line these blue fish they're so wily they're so crazy they're almost like hyenas of the sea that's pretty much what blue fish are like they will eat anything so we're not even using a leader line leader line yes it will help but if you do use a leader line then you want to up it you're usually using 15 pound test for speckled trout or 12 and you want to use like 20 to 25 just because they have their teeth chompers and you want them bitin through your leader line we're just using a Zemon minnows ewwww so a lot of people use these they'll use gotcha plugs really popular metals spoons just as long is it fast and it's honestly like as long as it's fast and it's um erratic then you're gonna be catching fish so typically what we're doing is we're just kind of reeling it in got a nice retrieve nice healthy speed to it and then we're just giving it some nice twitches of the rod just like that and these blue fish they are absolutely destroying it so when you guys cast it out you can use style of a retrieve you can use a faster tree Bluefish will eat a slow retrieve but typically they like it faster it's almost like playing Mortal Kombat I got something chasing it right here yeah it's almost like playing Mortal Kombat like you just hit buttons just do anything as long as it's fast and just crazy there is that's crazy look at it oh he bit me off howdy oh we got him yeah yeah we got him yeah you are Jordan up on the rocks thank you thank you I love it there does y'all captain Christie's on the wheel that's how you wrap up a successful day of fishing right there alright y'all so here we are we are back at our place and we are about to I'm gonna show you all how to make these blue fish tastes super super yummy we're going to smoke this blue fish and we're gonna make a bomb blue fish dip so let's go ahead and here we have our blue fish in the cooler we've been having them on ice for actually just one day but what we did is we did kind of cut their gills so you do want to do this as soon as you catch blue fish if you plan on eating them you want to bleed them out cut their gills so these blue fish are pretty dang small comparatively speaking to other sizes of blue fish that you can catch but yeah so blue fish they tend to be a pretty underrated eating fish and they do get a bad rap but as you can see their meat actually does not look that bad at all if you bleed it out then their meat turns out really clear not bloody not too fishy tasting or anything like that and we're gonna make sure these fish just like Spanish mackerel and king mackerel they do have a lot more that like oily texture to them for their meat so that's why I like see that doesn't look too bad at all so that's why I like smoking these fillets is actually like some of the better ways to prepare them so at king mackerel Spanish mackerel and bluefish they tend to say that these fish tastes the best smooth but some bluefish dip is actually a favorite of a lot of people up in like New Jersey in New York all right discarding the bluefish in our plastic bag keep the wife happy people don't put your fish around in the trash can or luckily we all set traps tomorrow because nobody's likes because nobody likes to smell their stinky fish all right so if you all never remove a bloodline it's really really easy so the bloodline right here just runs down the middle of a fish you have to do what all fish but it's but for bluefish we definitely want to do it because as you can see that right there that's kind of what gives a little bit more that fishy taste to it we just want all the clean meat that we can get so removing the bloodline is really easy just this red right through the middle so all you're gonna do is take your knife and you're just gonna start I like to start on the tail end of the meeting you start wherever you want I like start on the tail under the meat and then just cut down pretty deep and they're just coming all the way down just like that and Alex it turned my knife at the end and then you're just gonna do it on the other side of the red line and it'll come so that's how your made so I want to show you all this whole process it's pretty easy since actually since we didn't have time to put our filets like on a brine that's okay it's still gonna taste and smell really good we're gonna go ahead and just season these with some garlic some oregano boom so that's it charcoals we've got some embers on them alright so put the top on and we're just gonna pretty much what are we gonna do now longboarding we're gonna leave it here and just I don't know go onboard and hang out and this thing is gonna smoke for about two hours on what wait until gets about 200 yeah hey oh man that smells so good so this fish has been sitting on the smoker for actually about I don't know two hours or so and check that out so there it is that is our smoked bluefish fillets right there that we are gonna go ahead and we're gonna take this upstairs into the kitchen we're gonna make this into an awesome smoked bluefish dip you guys gonna be so easy super simple alright y'all so check this out one more look at these blue fish fillets no if you're just gonna eat this normal just this is with no Brian no nothing look at that nice and moist on the inside got that smoky kind of crust on the outside no fishiness none alright now I'm gonna show y'all how to make this smoked bluefish dip it's gonna taste amazing alright so first thing we're gonna do we're gonna take an onion right here and I'm just gonna use about half an onion and we're gonna dice this up okay so the first thing that we did diced up some onions and we've got our mixing ball really easy let's dice up some onions put it in the mixing bowl the next thing we're gonna do I'm not measuring by the way just kind of there's I'll put in the description like the actual like specifics for this recipe but just to show you how easy it is just I don't know got a handful half of a onion I'm gonna even plug in to use all half of it just a little bit of onion in there now we're gonna do we're gonna take our fish fillets and we're just gonna take the fish take it off the bone as you can see comes off very easily okay so there it is we got a blue fish and our onions but that's all we're doing is just use your hand just break up these fillets alright so the next thing that we're gonna do is I'm gonna cut up this lemon and just to add a little bit of flavor we're gonna squeeze a whole lemon over all our fish give it a nice kind of lemon flavor to it alright next thing we're gonna do we're gonna add some Worcestershire sauce and just one tablespoon but since I'm cooking or making a larger amount we're gonna add a little bit more so that's about a tablespoon and a half and we're just gonna mix that all around looking nice looking nice coming together alright so now we're gonna do we're just gonna glob a whole bunch of this cream cheese in here about that much okay this is where I'm actually gonna use a fork I'm not gonna use my hand yeah so this right here is gonna create that like fish disk texture we're gonna add a little bit of dill okay then we're gonna add just a little bit of mayonnaise alright y'all I don't know how well y'all can see that but that looks pretty legit and then we're gonna add some parsley to this just for a little style points last but not least spice things up a little bit little hot sauce this is just my personal preference y'all do not have to add this at all but I'm gonna add just a little bit of hot sauce to it next all you do is just take your crackers make yourself a lovely spread on your plate are you kidding me this is bluefish right here people look at this bluefish look how good this is this is insane smoked bluefish

tell a difference this is insanely good not to mention I might have added a few little style points as well with my presentation you take a little lemon squeeze it on there or take a little hot sauce come on people y'all are missing out y'all have to do this a little bit of hot sauce a little bit of lemon on there that's so good y'all you guys have to try this please trust me this tastes amazing

guys mark Holmes here always thank you guys for watching commenting and subscribing to the German sports support with my day job and keto cooking and everything that is the Dallas Cowboys it's hot there's like 200 million people the United States that are gonna be in our heat advisory starting today and through the weekend of stuff it really hits in tomorrow today it's really really hot and I've been busy working like crazy and so I'm not cooking outside today and in fact I'm not really that hungry today at my fat coffee this morning had a little couple of slices of lunchmeat things and I'm good to go but I ain't gonna make dents and so today one problem with the keto diet is you don't have bread so you have to make substitutions you don't get the carbs you don't get the sugar and things like that but you know I still like a lot of flavor and so what I'm actually doing is if you've ever had a front step sandwich which is like you know and all that yeah but we're gonna do something that's gonna be just as good and like I said you get used to it what we're doing is we're doing the French dip but we're putting mushrooms and onions so that way we get those we're gonna saute those and butter first and we're gonna dip our rare roofie into that and we'll put it on there and we're to use house or reddish cheese and a horseradish sauce on it then we're gonna put it on lettuce we'd have that and a nice kale salad now here's what's interesting is so people were asking because I'm kind of doing this on a daily basis so you guys can follow along I started out at 270 and I'm about 244 245 somewhere in there depending on what time of day it is and somebody had asked me they said well is this keto diet is it expensive well if you buy everything in but I'm doing the chicken last night the mushrooms so that is good it's a real simple quick easy meal that is filling so give me time to go do some videos but I'm gonna saute my mushrooms onion first I took a bit okay now for my salad bought a bag of kale from BJ's as well I think it's going like 2 bucks wash the whole thing in there I buy some of the tomatoes you know those are like that heirloom tomatoes so I think it's like four dollars for a big pack but it will last me a whole week puts the final moves on there and some a few crazy just to give it like a little sweet taste and I make cheese dressing Lucy's dressing if you make it at home I tell you what you will never ever and I'm telling you you will never ever have a bottle of blue cheese dressing from the store so here's what I did it's actually really easy you go to the grocery store you buy some buttermilk and I know buttermilk isn't exactly what you should use for keto but you're okay cuz you're not using much of it but you're gonna take about equal parts of mayonnaise that's the great thing about keto lots of Managed mayonnaise and sour cream and about the same amount of blue cheese like I said if you go to like BJ's you know like this is like five bucks but you can make a lot of blue cheese dressing like this so then you'll take about that much of this blue cheese and put it together I put garlic powder I put salt I put pepper I put parsley a little bit of lemon juice Worcestershire sauce and you get stir or shake it so here this is blue cheese dressing yeah I want you to look at this this is truly keto because you're getting all your fat look look at that blue cheese dressing okay now you put in the refrigerator it's gonna thicken up a little bit and this is heaven literally heaven on the chicken wings I should've made some hot wings damn it damn it Carol but that's perfectly keto good thing about doing this it's only gonna last about a week and a half in the fridge you're not getting all the chemicals and stuff that you normally gonna get in place okay so that's where this diet is really really good the way I'm doing because we're eating at home here's the thing about when you go grocery shopping when you go grocery shopping you want to shop on the perimeter okay perimeter because when you get into the middle you're getting all the stuff that's been processed okay you know I know everybody loves some Hamburger Helper or you know like the potato chips and stuff but it's too many chemicals too much process and things like that you want to try and get some Whole Foods and like I said I'm broke so I don't shop at like Trader Joe's and things like that I can go to BJ's I go to the world market which is like you know they got the Korean out of a Mexican Spanish I of the Japanese aisle and the Peruvian I also they have lots of great produce but that's me any cig look when I have pepper Albania's you know it's like 50 cents a pound at the world fresh world that calls ready so I like fresh slices all right so we got to make our sauce for our for our Sanders yeah buddy see you again this is okay this is what's crazy it sometimes things don't make sense okay what was told you want to you know your fact you want to eliminate fat so you don't eat fat and you'll lose fat because you're not putting in fact right that's what it sounds like it makes sense but when I started doing this my body fat was like 35 and I'm eating fatty foods I'm using heavy crab alotta I'm a lot of heavy I'm going through like a half a gallon of heavy cream a week I'm going through you know like one of these things of sour cream I'm using a lot of mayonnaise I'm eating fatty meats you know getting bacon I'm getting you know my ribeye steak and eating the fat you know I'm eating the chicken skin dude my body fat sound at 25 does this seem kind of strange to you I mean that just doesn't make sense yet it makes perfect sense because my body is burning the fat for energy but now if I go ahead and eat some sugar it's gonna go back to burning sugar and storing so go make some sauce for this what's happened in Maui how are you doing so take some mayonnaise gonna take about equal parts then we're gonna take some horseradish so this is gonna be gonna be creamy and it's gonna be spicy and I tell you this is great on your steak too you put this on your steak oh I love to take pick a nice piece of rare steak and dip it in some horseradish sauce all right so boom Jobos date job and what I'll do is I need to start because right now I'm getting a lot of content and I want to kind of start separating that because some people complain and say you know I'm getting alert because you're doing cooking and I don't care about your keto diet or I don't care about your you know being up on the roof so I'm gonna try and separate this was originally my cooking chance I'm trying to do best again I try to make everybody all right so here's the star of our show okay so this is a pound and a half of slice relief and see if only $11 nice and rare that's ready to rare now you can use Swiss cheese but DJ's have this horseradish cheese so it's got a so it's real real nice now here's a little tip okay you know every every bit of work that you do counts okay normally I'm outside cooking I'm sweating but I ain't trying to sweatin 95 degree temperatures though okay but spicy foods help you lose weight because one what it's real hot you're going see you got stuff in your face and you're drinking more water and the water is the helping you fill yourself up okay okay second if it's real hot you're sweating and all that that's burning calories too so make your food spicy now here's the only killer on this is the dog goes home on it always rinse your lettuce okay you don't know if they're next door to like a hog farm or something like that and they've got all kinds of raw sewage and stuff that's around running on there so you don't want to get sick and of course always wash your hands a lot after touching raw meat okay just do that we're not trying to make anybody sick I'm up a little more butter in it that's right if you like but you like mayonnaise if you like cheese if you like heavy cream then this is definitely the diet board and this diet is not new this diet was developed back in like the 20s or 30s to help with Holi no MS or something like that because they found out that something about this diet mentally worked good Cho boost a job homes yeah that's it there's no other job ooh and homes I think that's it take a look look look let's get close all right so here's what we got we got our onions next to the battery we got our onions and mushrooms here there something about a little packet of our time baby it's basically see that Tom - Tom Tom Tom okay there we go all right here's what we gonna do look at that oh boy gonna take some of that roast beef and we're going to put it in the arsy get a good wet and then I pick some of the cheese see all the extra liquid in there the steam the meat that handy chief mother Jill who doesn't like to be on camera you see that every single time because they want to see your face a always a show you want to show your wife me amiably what you see that hello Simba I'm doing it and we got summer a kale salad here yeah good so I cheat a little bit because I put a few creases in or make it a little sweeter cuz kale is a little bitter and we got the heirloom tomatoes little salad you want you're selling all right she wants to make her own sadly okay so here we go let me grab some mushrooms [Music] there you know and now put some of our horseradish sauce and a couple of slices of jalapeno peppers that is blue cheese no that sort of sucks the blue cheese dressing is right here just grab a little bit and that's it so here is the finished meal look at that I got a nice tip nice kale salad look look at that blue cheese on there mmm and then the roast beef normally I have a knife but the roast beef in there that make sure you get one of the jalapeno peppers and some of the sauce on there see still get the meat still rare but it's also got all the flavors you get your onions get your mushrooms in there look good no I know it would be better on a French roll dipping in the Arzu but hey this is not bad so this will be you know like one of those nights where you just we don't feel like cooking a whole lot this is a really easy easy meal that you can do quick onions and more of the sauce all right so chicken-fried steak mmm well I don't know if there's a key to recipe for chicken fried steak but I'll look it up oh yeah look that up so let me know if you guys try any of the recipes somebody tried my steak recipe they said they didn't like the marinade oh the Starlin vinegar of the red wine and the Worcestershire sauce they may have marinated it too long where it got wine that's my voice that maybe they're just one Oh dad jalapeno peppers hot remember what I was telling me about eating spicy foods it'll slow you down all right whoo when she gonna be on camera it's a question she does exist I do have a wife there you go all right you guys have been treated to an extra special treat that's dessert hmm all right so what do you guys have for dinner I'm having beef it's what's for dinner you're very welcome I was gonna do shrimp and grits but I was tired so

"NDlQ09mmvu8": "hello everyone welcome back to another video of medtronic in this video we'll be discussing on how you can customize uh the gulp build for medtronic 7 and above so let's get right into it so of course you need to produce medtronic and once you've purchased medtronic you've unzipped it it should look something like this and in here you just click on your just enter your theme go to your html and then go into your tools in your tools this video will be talking about gulp next video we'll talk about webpack so stay tuned for that so for gulp what we'll be looking at mostly will be this file right here so open up and open that up in your ide so you go to tools let's go to gap config and this is where you can customize medtronic's uh metroid 7's deployments well not really deployments like what assets would you like to build and be compiled and bundled up and then gets pushed as assets for your project so what do you have push as assets for your project so if you look into our demo like any demo in our source we have our sas js media files plugins and whatnot all these files will basically get compiled bundled up minified and then gets deployed or rendered into this assets folder so this is what we mean by getting pushed into assets so all this are already pre-configured to basically compile sas into css as bundles and then js also bundled up as this so here we have scripts and each page will have its own uh bundle so each page will have like say in a calendar you have some background and google and whatever what not base you have things so in this video we'll be discussing on where does all these assets come from and how you can actually configure and customize your build so that you do not need to include all of these plugins for your project because of course since medtronic is a large demo your project doesn't necessarily need all these files so first thing we need to look at is the main um the main configuration we i can we let's call this the root configuration the root configuration basically says the name the theme description of it and the current version so in this version we are on version seven um so in our configuration we have a false debug what this does if you turn it on to true is when you run a gulp gulp demo name you basically get more information when you're building it and then this is what we are defining to skip if we are building a rtl version so at the moment rtl is set to false so whenever you run the gup build nothing happens like you do not build a rtl version if you want an rti version you can just change it to true and then you will build the rt the rtl version of it now what rtl means is right to left it just swaps the metronic layout so let's have a look in our layout so let's just have a look here so at the moment everything's reading from left to right basically you're reading this way so what rtl means is it be swapped away so you'll be something reading from right to left it's it's good for certain languages like arabic so yeah if you need it you just turn that on if you don't just leave it as false now if you turn it on what we're doing here is we are selecting some of the plugins to be skipped or not included within the rtl the reason why we don't include any one of these plugins into rtl sim is simply because there's absolutely no reason to do that for example icons if you read it right to left regardless what icon you're looking at an icon will still look like an icon whether it's left right or right to left so this is all the plugins that we are skipping in a right to left rtl version uh of course what you can do is if you want to add more you just type comma and then type your plugin name like so and all this is uh additional settings if you want to turn on js aldify or if you want to css minify and you're going to turn on like js source maps or source maps this is all configuration you can use you can turn it on and off it's set to false by default and this is our path so our path is basically a a set of paths of where you're getting uh the first one will be where we getting the source so the source is set to the specific demo and then source so if you're looking at demo one which would be demo one source and what demo one source is you go to demo one this folder so everything in here gets pulled into this gulp build and node modules is your node modules if you're just defining where your note modulus is sitting if you're not more this is sitting somewhere else what you do is you just change this path to where your note mod is is located uh demo api url you do not need to worry so much about this this is mainly for certain tools or certain plugins or certain functions or demo or widgets components within medtronic that uses api callbacks like some of our data tables requires apis like um maybe an api data table like let's have a look here so if you go to data table we have some [Music] data sources that we can do a server-side ajax call so this is um an example of an api callback so what it does is it uses this url to get the data again this is only for the demo if you are using the api server side example for your project you actually do not need to do this all you need to do is you need to customize the js file to pull it from your proper backend server uh we'll discuss that on the later video where we will show you how you can customize certain things within medtronic and then this uh this field here or this node here is another important one is what this is is essentially where you want to deploy your assets once it's compiled that means once you get all this these two things it minifies and bundles everything together and then you want to build the asset folder now where do you put it so this is the path of where you want to place it so it by default is placing within each demo so a demo will have a disk and we'll have assets so if you're doing one two three or so on so forth it'd be the demo number and then this and an asset so that is where all the assets sit however if your project is sitting on another folder and it's not within a demo so what you do is let's say you customize certain things here like say you don't want um like you don't want form validation for example you can just remove that plugin run up the gup command and then change this to your project folder and then all the assets will then be deployed to your projects uh i can show you we can show you a quick demo on how that works uh shortly but let's look into what else we have here so in our build field of build parameter here we have two things we have main vendor a few pages and theme and media so in main what we're doing is we're just defining which sas file will be grabbing or whether the style.sas is located and where the all the scripts are located like what are we grabbing all the js from components all the js from layouts and then what we're doing is we are bundling all this which is just a single sas at the moment but of course if you want to extend this you can you're bundling this into style.bundle.css so essentially let's look at demo one let's go to source oops that's not that source sas and then style with bundling this we see what is importing all of init our bootstrap and all of our components and all that so what we're doing is we're importing all this into our singles style.sauce and then what we're doing you're bundling all this into our css bundle which is within the assets css style bundle so all this is this whole entire thing basically and this is the same concept with our scripts so if you look into our source just components of everything in here because we are taking everything like yet all the extracts represents everything and from our layout everything in here as well everything and bundling it into our scripts and bundle so if you minimize this you open js this file right here all this gets bundled from these two gs files so this is essentially how you read it so there's a certain formula to it's all a certain template of how this works every source will have either a styles or scripts and then a bundle uh basically you have source and bundle so source will have the uh the the styles the scripts are where the main source styles and scripts are located and then in the bundle um field what you're doing is you're defining where all where all these files are getting bundled and deployed to okay so that's that for our main um you don't really need to do any changes here because this is what we are defining for me trying to work if you remove like one of this or remove one of this there's a pretty high chance that metroid will stop working so if you want to modify any of this then we highly recommend that you know what you're doing so that you can customize this yourself but if you don't we highly recommend you to not change anything from the main okay so now comes the vendor so vendors are medtronic's third-party plugins now vendors we have a few things we have base and custom so in base we have mandatory plugins and optional plugins so mandatory plugins is like jquery popper bootstrap moment and all this all these are mandatory plugins that is used constantly or very frequent within all of metronics components and pages so we highly recommend for you to not change anything here unless you know what you're doing however you are free to add more if you want but if you want to add more again you don't have to put it in here you can put it under somebody's optional so optional plugins are well it's pretty self-descriptive it is optional plugins that may or may not be used within medtronic in in in certain pages or not for example like a bootstrap date picker a bootstrap breakpicker may not be used in certain pages in metronic it may be used in our form demo pages but it might not be used in say an error page sample so an error page would not have bootstrap data picker so we don't uh need this in in in our main global function so all these um are optional for you to remove so in your project let's say you're building your project and the project does not need so many pickers like yes you may be needed you need a date picker but you don't need a date time figure you don't need a time picker you don't need date range picker so what happens here is what you can do is just select all this and delete and it disappears completely from your project assets the moment you run the gulp command so if you want to add your own um there's two ways to add the first way you can add is by using the npm package manager by just typing in npm or yarn add basic npm install or you're under add and then the the plugin name and then you install into your node modules and what you do is you copy this uh this is the the path to your node modules and then this is your plugin that you just installed so what you do is you pull all the way at the bottom just before the bundle like after this put a comma and then you define your new plugin let's call it new plugin for example and then say your plugin has starts like certain css it needs to be included and then you put your let's say like this you plug in say yes uh something like that and then if you have scripts put the scripts here whoops and then let's put this i can adjust so that's it so what what you're doing here is you're just including your new plugin into your build okay so let's minimize this optional and let's have a look at what's happening here so everything within the memory mandatory and optional we'll get bundle up into plugins.css for all styles and plugins.bundle.js for all scripts so if we look into our assets see our scripts and then we see no no sorry you go to plugins and then we go to global you see that these two series two so all this will be added into these two files so as mentioned if you do not need certain things all you have to do is just delete them and then it gets bundled into these files or this two bundle files with less code because you just removed them all right so those are um global plugins so all these plugins are included globally these are global plugins that every page will be including these two files then comes page specific page versus specific bundles page specific bundles are basically our custom so we have base and we have custom so if you look into our custom here assets custom yep no here so we have all these plugins there are we call it it's the third party plugins but they are considered customs simply because they are very large plugins and we do not want to bloat our global plugins so we will call any one of these plugins as and when we are using them within a page in medtronic for example tinymce 10mc is a uh we see week editor that we only use for a single page we need the whole of medtronic so if we look in our demo and we go to uh where is our forms and then form text editors and as you can see tanyamc is only listed here or shown here and that's it so what we do is if you view source or if you don't have users we can look at this html so let's look at that so let's go and find it's in crud form editors and tiny there you go so scroll all the way to the bottom as you can see we are including our plugins bundle and then any additional bundles this okay our plugins our scripts and prism this is uh it's a custom uh plugin that we are inserting globally but we are also putting our paged uh page vendor uh plugins like attorney bundle and this is a script that we are using for ourselves to initialize tinymc so going back here plugins are essentially custom sorry custom are essentially plugins that we are bundling by itself independently so if you look into draggable for example we have our source and then we have the location of where we are bundling it the source will be all this um js files or yeah that we are getting from modules we are bundling all this into a single file called drivable and if you want to have a look what that is or how that looks like you go to plugins you go to draggable you see this bundle is the same exact file if you open that up is all this basically all the code from all these files bundled up so again if you want to remove anyone this you can you can just delete and you're good to go and if you want to add your own let's say you have a plugin that's only been it's going to be used for a single page for your entire project you can just add your own plugin let's say new plugin again a new custom plugin right and then you put your source because it's a custom it's going to be deployed into a single file or a single independent file you need to have a source and then you need to define your bundle name and then all you do is just follow this exact same structure you have your styles to define your css and then your script to define your js and then you need to define your bundle css and js and what it does is you just um once you run gup the gup command you will just compile everything into whatever you defined into one of into one of these folders and all you do in your html after that is then just include it into your html just like this like this to include the actual plugin bundle file and this for your initialization js file so that's basically it's for custom so just to recap let's just remove all this let's recap the difference between the two okay let's yeah you know what so we have our base and we have custom just to recap so in our base we have mandatory and optional so if you add your own custom plugin within optional you'll be bundled up within the global like with the global plugins bundle so this will be used on every page so if your plugin is going to be used constantly like i say it's within the header or say it's within the footer or it's one of the menu items something like that it's been used for every page we put it in the optional in the optional part of it and then if it's not so if it is only a single page uh plug-in like if you only need it for a single page then you put it in custom but in custom you define the source and the bundle in the global you only need to define the sources like where is it coming from that's all you need to do simply because we are defining the bundle globally at the bottom like here all right so that's that for our vendors and then comes our pages now our pages if you look we have our source so let's look at our source let's minimize all this and then we go to and then we go to pages so all this all these files within here which is our error pages our login pages and our wizard pages are all going to be bundled up into a single uh not single they'll be more bundled up into individual um css files okay maybe i shouldn't say bundle yep technically they're just getting output or compiled or converted from sas into css so what it does is let's minimize this let's look into our css you go to pages you see the same thing here let's minimize this okay so we have our errors logins and wizards under pages so all the all the files within here oops will get pushed compiled and pushed into this path so it becomes css like so so we get our we have our sas files converted or compiled into css and then js we have all our of js files which is within our js pages and all of this here so if you go to our js pages and then you see the same structure the correct custom features crowd custom features builder minimum build them in this is the min uh minify.js of this so all these files will get uh deployed into the assets folder so that your project can use it whenever it wants so if you want to have a new say a new custom source like say you create a new page and you want to add your own sauce for that new page all you have to do is go to pages maybe add a new folder and a file in here and just that's it because all this does is gonna look for everything within the pages folder and then compile it and then deploy it into a single into a single css of that specific sas file like so so this is the error 3 css so if you look into our source sas and error 3. so basically getting this and making it to this that's what that's all that what this does and theme this is a similar thing so if you look at the source where is it coming from it's getting the theme from our source let's minimize this go to themes and all of these um files within here like in our site or brandon etc will get uh deployed into that folder which is open themes so i all that so essentially it's just converting or compiling sas into css now the media is a bit different because media there's no compilation needed all it's doing is it's going to grab all the media from the source and then deploying it into your assets so let's minimize the css and this salesman might say so all media for backgrounds or demos or error pages and everything will be deployed into our media so the exact same folder will get pushed into uh the assets now you might ask what we do what are we duplicating our files we have source already but you know is what we do beginning but that's because when you customize medtronic you are essentially going to be working within this source folder and when you when you're working within a source folder um your project is not using the source folder your project is actually using the assets folder and as i mentioned earlier in this video your assets folder gets deployed in a specific path that you can define so if your project is sitting in say another folder like say it's in your c drive or it's in your desktop or in somewhere else and you want all of this that you've that you've worked on and test on using mechatronics demos and you want all these assets to be deployed into your projects you just need to change this run the gog command and you have this entire assets based off whatever you just edited in your source be deployed into your project so this is the essentially the power of what mechatronic build tools can do so to make a quick demo let's go ahead and go to demo one and let's delete this okay and then what we do is we go into i'll just show you again that out this folder has no longer any uh assets folder so we go to tools we run our cmd open up the command prompt typing up dash demo one and what we're going to do here is we're going to have a look into demo one and this and what we do is once this is done you'll see the assets folder okay it's done um as you can see look at that we have our assets so now let's say let's say in our html right we have let's say we have a new folder let's say it's new project okay so what we're going to do here is we're going to change this part because we want to deploy say the new project this is our new projects well so we have our html html our project files our index and whatever everything will be here and we want to deploy all of our assets everything that we've worked on within the source folder like everything will talk within here all this all the sauce all this whatever we change we modify the edit we want to push it into our new project so we do is we change this to we call it new project we save our gulp and then we run the gap number one because we are working on demo one as you can see we are going to demo one what means we can do we are using demo demo ones layouts and assets and whatever so do that and as you can see our new projects all of a sudden have a disk folder and in there we have our assets so what we just did is we just deployed all of demo one's assets into a new new path basically a new project path so let's say if your project is sitting within this folder you will basically have all this all of your predefined um plugins dependencies uh all this uh customization your sos files files to media files all this that's really defined within mechatronics source will be deployed into your project directory as you've built your project okay so i think that's it for this video i hope you enjoyed uh i hope you find this you find this video informative give us a like if you did follow us on our social medias like facebook and twitter links will be description below and also please subscribe to our youtube channel so that when we release our next video you'll get an update i'll see you guys in the next video take care you", "5NU3yCG8QRs": "hey everyone welcome back to my cooking channel today listen today we have an amazing mexican traditional dish called birya and i'm going to be showing you all of these different ways that you can serve it and enjoy it with your family it is out of this world so stick around and i will jump right in we're gonna go ahead and start with a nice hefty size pot not too big not too small but it's pirea so you're gonna make a decent amount make sure you have room for it in your pot so here i have it filled about halfway with water and here i have one large beef bone i went ahead and asked my butcher to cut it up in three pieces for me just for easier cooking so i don't have to put a big piece of bone in there once my water is looking like it's starting to heat up i am going to add my beef bone directly to the water with nothing else to that i'm going to be adding some beef neck bones i am not trimming any of this fat that you see here it has a really big piece of bone but it also has some really tender beef in there that's going to be delicious with your beer so we're adding those directly in with the beef bones i'm gonna go ahead and let this cook on about medium high heat for a good five to ten minutes to come to a roaring boil in the meantime i'm going to dice up my chuck roast in about five pieces i want about palm sized pieces that way it cooks quicker and it's much more tender after this has been boiling for a good 5-10 minutes i am going to remove all of the impurities that rise up to the top before i add anything else so i just have the beef bones and the beef neck bones once they come to a boil you'll be able to see all of this skim on the top make sure to remove most of it now that i've removed all of that i'm going to add five garlic cloves and i've just kind of smashed them so that they can release the flavor quicker and i'm gonna add a whole white onion now it's time to add our beef chuck roast in here now we're going to go ahead and start the seasoning process here because you want to elevate the seasonings and gradually start adding levels of depth and flavor so we don't want this to start cooking with absolutely nothing in there i'm adding two heaping tablespoons of chicken bouillon and i'm also adding two tablespoons of salt that way as this starts to cook and boil you are already getting a level of seasoning and flavor inside of the meat stir that really really well make sure it is nice and dissolved and then we're going to let this sit for a good hour we're going to just let it cook in these basic seasonings until the meat starts to get a bit tender so cover it up leave it alone for about an hour i did turn the heat down to about a medium now we are going to start on the magic all of the dry chili peppers that we are going to need to make this dish what it is i am using chile ajillo i am using chileancho and i'm also using chile pasilla so here is my guajillo some of them are huge and some of them are tiny so two to three ounces will do the trick i ended up using 13 but between small ones and big ones i have three chileans and three chile pasilla next i'm going to remove all of the stems and devein and remove all of the seeds as well so that i can wash them and clean them properly here there is nothing in them i have scrubbed them and washed them really really well they do come dirty sometimes so make sure you clean them properly once they are nice and clean i'm going to dab each and every one of them on a paper towel yes time consuming but do you want clean cheese for your sauce or do you want dirty chilis raise your hands clean cheerless thank you very much totally worth it okay so let's move on to get the actual sauce going i have three pretty large roma tomatoes i have four to five garlic cloves and on this comal here on the side i have it on medium heat and i'm gonna go ahead and be toasting these so every single chili pepper we are toasting we want to make sure that they don't burn so make sure that you're kind of pressing them on one side and then flip them over and give them a nice press on the other side they're going to start darkening up you can see that some of them will start looking a little black on that means that they're toasting really really nicely don't let them get too too dark because then that means they're burnt and then that's the type of flavor that you're going to add to your meat and that is not the flavor that we are looking for so i have both of these going at the same time in the back you can see the the tomato and the garlic is already you know cooking or about to come to a boil and then i'm toasting these in the front so we're multitasking here because hello that is what we do this dish already takes all day we don't want it to take any longer so once these are nice and toasted go ahead and add them to the water boiling in the back now once they're toasted what we want to do is achieve that flavor of smokiness um to each pepper and each pepper just it tastes so much different once you toast them so that we're achieving that flavor by toasting them here a nice smoky rich chili flavor and then we're adding them to the hot water so that they can rehydrate and they are more blendable obviously and i'm just doing this in in steps you know however many i can fit and we're toasting and we're adding to the back and we've got a nice little assembly line going so i don't know why i recorded this clip and it was so long sorry guys but obviously it was it's important that you see how we're toasting how we're toasting this so let me jump ahead just a tiny bit as you're toasting and then adding to the boiling water in the back i have already turned the heat source in the back burner because it's nice and hot so we don't need it to come to a boil it's hot enough to rehydrate all of our chili peppers now once i toast all of my chili peppers right the guajillo the chileancho and the pasilla the next thing that we are going to start toasting is going to be some of our dry seasonings i'm going to do the clove the pepper the bay leaves and the cinnamon stick this is going to be super duper quick you're going to throw them on there roll them around for all of 5 seconds and then flip them flip them and then add them directly to the water so those can soften up enough to blend as well kind of cool huh so i'm going to let this sit here for about five minutes okay so this has been sitting here for about five minutes everything is nice and soft and pliable and ready to be blended i am adding everything directly into my blender do not forget use a spoon to scoop up the cloves and the whole pepper because using this little tool that i'm using here is only going to pick up the large pieces you don't want to forget about those dry seasonings those whole dry seasonings we added at the end so i could see the cinnamon stick did come along but the pepper and the clove i'm kind of stayed at the bottom of this little juice here so be sure to use a spoon spoon those out and then add them directly to your blender as well i didn't record that clip guys i went in there and i said oh wait there's the garlic or the pepper and stuff i have more seasonings yes flavor upon flavor i've got oregano cumin onion paprika salt chicken bouillon amounts will be in the description bar below you know i don't ever leave you hanging so be sure to check that out for exact amount we're adding that in there and then we are going to add vinegar i have apple cider vinegar sounds a little off but let me tell you it goes well together and then just a splash of the same water that i boiled everything in only enough to get the blade moving and to get the salsa kind of going and incorporated i just didn't want it to be like super duper thick where it wasn't moving and you can see it's kind of there but then you can also see that it does come to grip with some of those tomatoes and then starts blending really nicely so i want to blend this for a good minute to two minutes you want it to be as smooth and as blended as possible very very smooth so now just to add a little flavor and just to get it moving a little bit more i'm gonna add the same broth that i'm cooking the meat in because this is already somewhat seasoned and it already has that beef flavor so why not right it's better than just using water alright so once we have our sauce nice and well blended we are going to strain it into our birya this is going to take not that long i add some of the broth and it just helps me move everything through the strainer a lot quicker and move move move stir stir add a little more broth until you are done straining all of the salsa in now we are gonna let this cook for about another two hours so this has already been cooking for about two hours in the sauce one hour without the sauce so a total of three hours once you are nice and cooked you're going to remove like you can see i'm doing here all of the excess fat and grease that the meat has released naturally we are going to put that to use later so remove as much as possible take a look at this broth though like look at the consistency of the broth it almost doesn't even look watery it kind of looks like it has a bit of texture and consistency which is just so delicious look at this meat this is how you're going to check to see if your birya is done can you pull apart your meat with just a fork and not a lot of struggle you can even rip a little piece off and taste it if it's a little chewy and just too tough leave it in for another 30 minutes and work your way up from there until you realize that everything is nice and tender look at this beef bone yum yum yum yum leave me a comment below and let me know if you guys actually eat the bone marrow this part here do you guys eat that do you throw it away what do you do yes i just put that piece in my mouth delicious amazing so we are looking really really good here about three hours three hours and 15 minutes in everything is nice and tender and i'm just showing you clips of this so that you know what to look for in your meat like this beef neck bone the meat is pretty much falling apart it was really hot guys i was trying not to burn my face with the steam and show you at the same time so it looks like i'm struggling but i'm really not but this broth oh my god you want to talk about flavor look it beautiful so good so so good so next thing i wanted to show you guys because a lot of you um were trying to guess what i was making when i posted a picture of beef bones on my snapchat and this is what i do to my beef bone i take the marrow out and then i remove all of the nice like tender meat around it and then i add it to my meat and pretty much discard the bone or just throw the bone back in the broth but i do do that to all of the beef bones i remove all of the meat and reserve it to serve it uh and i chop it up and mix it up with the rest of the meat so my beer is still on the stove on low because listen if it cooks another extra 15 minutes it is not going to hurt so in the meantime i'm gonna get my toppings ready for all of the amazing delicious dishes i'm about to show you that you can make with this one meat i know you're wondering why is this video over 20 minutes long well hello i'm letting you know everything you can make not just one dish you can make four dishes well you can make more than that but i'm going to show you four ways um that we eat birya when i make birya so white onion cilantro lime boom don't forget your salsa which is the video previous to this one so check that salsa up too i'll go ahead and link it in the description bar below so you guys can make the salsa that goes with this dish as well so i've got the chuck roast this small piece i'm adding now is some of the the neck bone meat super tender so i like to cut both of those and do a mixture and then i also add some of the bone marrow in the there as well at the end just to kind of have a little bit of different texture that is what this is all about different flavors depth of flavors textures in the meat just an amazing dish and look look look at this watch that's my husband because he had been smelling it all afternoon and he was like oh my god when can i taste it is it ready yet so as soon as he saw me pull out a piece of meat he was like can i taste it so of course this is for us for the family so yes he can put his little fingers all up in the food and taste it so once i get it to a nice chopped up consistency i like to add a little bit of the broth just to get all the flavor of the because that's where it's at guys the broth is where all of the flavor is so i like to add that in there mix it up and let's get ready to start assembling some dishes number one this is the typical classic way to eat birya like a soup so you're going to add your chopped up beef in there three different types right some marrow some neck bone some chuck and then add plenty of the broth you hear me plenty of the broth and go ahead and top it with your cilantro with your onion squeeze some fresh lime juice in there and add a nice hefty spoonful of this delicious salsa specifically for birria yes i have the recipe on the channel for you already do not panic i got you covered and then you take a spoon listen and you go to town you hear me you take a spoon and you just slurp this up like a soup and it is amazing trust me so there you go dish number one easy peasy complete and i hope you guys try it this way this is classic traditional can't go wrong yum you can also serve it with rice and beans but listen does nobody has that type of time when you're making birya all day long okay next i'm moving along to super easy this is going to be your birya taco okay so you just add a little bit of the um grease that we reserved in the beginning remember you add a little bit of that and then you add your beef you add a little bit of broth and now you're just waiting for your tortilla to get nice and crispy i like to add a little bit more of the a little extra grease a little bit of the extra fat that kind of helps it get a little bit toasted a bit quicker so you can see i'll add a little bit more of that now and you just kind of want it to be crunchy right so that you don't have a soggy taco so you flip it you can start seeing that it's turning brown on one side add a little bit of more of that a little bit of that grease and then flip it a couple more times till it's nice and crispy now you're going to open it up add your toppings remember don't skip any of the toppings on any of these dishes i'm showing you onion cilantro we're going to pull this out to the side and then i'm going to make some consomme this is where you fix up the broth so that you can dip stuff in it yes so good so i grabbed just a cup and then i fill it up about three quarters of the way i'm gonna add this to my taco and then i'm gonna go ahead and add the same toppings to the consomme because this is how you eat it here you dip your taco and you dip it in the consomme you take a bite of your taco and then you take a nice big gulp of your broth of your consomme and it is delicious flavor upon flavor so this is another way that you can eat your birya birya taco and consomme yum dip it all up in there get all the flavor get all the juices and i got half of the onions on my hand so let's clean that up but let's come back and take a bite because it's so good all right that's the second way to eat this third way we are making quesabilias which is pretty much quesadillas with birya right so i am using that reserved little extra grease right that we reserved in the beginning we are putting it to use that is how and why most tacos or quesabilias have this beautiful flavor and color on the tortilla because you're using the ingredients that most people would dump and discard no sir no ma'am we do not put anything to waste we reserve it so that we can fry up the tortillas at the end right so this one i am doing a double tortilla you can do a double tortilla with the taco as well personal preference i really like to do a double tortilla when i do the quesabilias because there is more filling on the inside of these right you're adding a whole bunch of cheese so you don't want it to fall apart so i always make sure i do double on this one so traditionally you would use queso oaxaca oh get it for the gram girl get them snapshots queso oaxaca it's super melty it's delicious it's pretty much what goes with this dish queso oaxaca is very difficult to get your hands on so if you cannot get it queso which is cheese for quesadilla which is just a super melty type of cheese that cheese will work as well and you add your meat you add a little bit of broth and then you start flipping so you can get that nice little crisp on this quesabilia as well so good a little bit more of the oil flavor there just so we can get it tonight oh yes girl get a picture for snapchat let them know you are in the kitchen today whooping it up a little behind the scenes for you guys you know okay so you're just cooking this down until you get it nice and crispy on both sides now keep in mind i would usually be making more than one at a time but i'm doing one at a time just for you guys just to show you just for the purposes of not crowding up the screen and you guys can really see what i'm doing with each individual dish but of course you're feeding your family you can be making three four or five of these at the same time look at that beautiful crust on the cheese and on the tortilla omg so good now keep in mind you can also make the consomme the little broth in the cup you can make it and dip your quesadillas in there too it's not just for the tacos it's for whatever you want to dip in there i'm gonna go ahead and open it up and you know what it is cilantro sevoya and some of this bomb.com salsa i hope you guys make this salsa because this dish it just it has to go together make the salsa the day before make the video the next day and you are ready look at this delicious grab it dip it in the consomme and you are golden last but not least our fourth option with berea is gonna be berea yes it's a thing trust me so i am adding some of my diced up meat on the top you know the drill cilantro and onion and then i'm gonna fill this cup up almost all the way with the consomme with the broth that i cooked the meat in that is where all the flavor is and i'm going to be very honest with you guys because that's how we roll on this channel right if i were to do the birya ramen differently next time i would use a ramen that does not have the seasoning included in it already the only reason i say that is because when i made this one here the ramen itself already had that beef flavor already in it so it was just a smidgen to salty just a little bit not enough for me not to eat it because i ate it but just keep that in mind cover it up with a plate and i would say maybe five minutes give or take five to ten minutes so that your ramen can get nice and cooked then you can remove the plate and start mixing everything in so you can in joy of course add the salsa and the lime right before you eat it and dig in wow delicious or what it was so good besides it being a bit salty because of the seasoning that was already in the ramen it was still delicious it was still amazing so i hope that you truly loved this recipe because let me tell you it took a lot of work to make but i love to share these with you so leave me a comment below and i hope you enjoyed i will talk to you next time bye", "gwLTvyRRRGA": "hey guys what's going on so this video we're gonna pick up where we left off and we're gonna talk about essential Chinese sauces that you must keeping your kitchen let's start off with them these two right here there's like the double whammy right here two soy sauces you need two soy sauces some of you might be like well is a soy sauce just a soy sauce no my friends there are different types of soy sauces random fact did you know that the soy sauce was actually invented by Buddhist monks anyway although there are different types of soy sauces you really need two kinds one is light and one is dark soy sauce this is my favorite brand this is chin line where Kim lines soy sauce one thing I try to do when I go to Chinese grocery stores and this is not any knock against my beloved country this is just fact okay I tried to buy sauces that are not made in mainland China I try to get them made in Taiwan or other countries because in reality there's just so many issues with that package to food items in China that I can't trust what they really put into them if you don't believe me go Google search China food scandals anyway I like these soy sauces because there's no MSG in them and the reason why you get light and dark soy sauce is because the light soy sauce is thinner and a salt here than dark soy sauce which also contain caramel caramel this is mainly used for its coloring and a lot of times in Chinese cooking we'll use this instead of salt because soy sauce actually brings out a very unique umami flavor as the Japanese would say war in Chinese is same way that's kind of the term that describes savory or meaty flavor our next let's talk about moisture sauce what I love about oysters sauce is that it can make simple dishes tastes awesome first of all this thing like the name suggests oyster sauce you know it's made with minced oysters and the oyster juice so that's a little icky but you know it's briny it's dark brown has a smooth consistency and when I say that this makes really simple dishes tastes amazing if you just go and steam some vegetables and put this on it your vegetables gonna taste really really good you can also put this on salads on cold noodles next mesial Chinese cooking wine I'm really simple what I use Chinese cooking wine for is to really get rid of the gaminess of the meat if you don't have this you can always kind of substitute it with that dry sherry the most famous Chinese rice wine is a shawl seam shield which is something that's been aged for 10 years and it's something that you can drink and also cook with alright next let's talk about Heights India or hoisin sauce this is essentially Chinese barbecue sauce and you can use it the same way you use barbecue sauce in the West you can glaze your meat you can marinate those of you who love Peking Duck this is where you can dip your Peking duck in this thing is sweet a little spicy a little garlicky is crazy because it even has like sweet potatoes in here and this is a great sauce to use as a dip you can almost dip anything if you're like meat noodles vegetables all right this item is something that I burned through about a bottle every couple weeks this is a Chinese black vinegar this is a brand I typically get is at Chin's Jung sang-soo this is very different than the vinegar you'll find in the West typically in the West the vinegar is very acidic well you can kind of compare this to is multi-window gur this is made from glutinous rice and we use this a lot in soups stews use it for dipping this really counteracts spice really well so if you're cooking something and it's too spicy you kind of want to counteract that a little vinegar really helps also this is something essential if you're eating dumplings I mean you cannot make dumpling dip without vinegar and the next time you have a big bowl of beef noodle soup added maybe a couple of tablespoons of vinegar into the soup and add some hot oil if you like olive oil that's going to make the soup even more flavorful and I'll tell you a couple of other uses for Chinese vinegar one is that in Shunzhi which is famous for Chinese vinegar they actually make their vinegar a little differently some of the vinegar you can just outright drink also what my parents use this for when I was a kid was that I would get like a fishbone stuck down my throat and they would make me gulp this stuff and what that does is that it kind of like dissolves the bowl a little bit or makes it soft and the bowl will kind of wash down this is another bottle of something I go through every couple of weeks and this is my favorite brand it's actually made in Japan this is sesame oil and there's so many uses for this oil I use it in just about anything my stir-fries towards the end I splashed just a little bit maybe like a half a teaspoon teaspoon on and that will give us such a nice fragrant sesame flavor this is also a must and basically every type of Chinese soups so after your soup is cooked drop a little bit of this in there it's gonna make the soup smell fantastic one thing you don't want to do with this is you don't want to overheat it because this does not have a high tolerance to heat and you don't want to add too much because this flavor is going to overwhelm a lot of other flavors what I've been using this a lot in is that I make Korean barbecue at a home and all I do for the saws is I take this salt and pepper and that's how I can sue my meat like by the pounds this cute little baby here is one of my favorite things and you're not going to find too many uses for this this is Chinese barbecue sauce it says barbecue sauce cha-cha-cha it's really nothing barbecuey about this is basically soybean oil without grill fish and that dried shrimp inside and what people usually use this for sometimes is marinating their meats or as a soup base most of all this is used as a sauce you make to dip your hot spot items in and that's exclusively why I keep this thing around you see the little size of this this is part of my emergency hotpot kit you know those days when it's snowing outside it's freezing cold you finally get home you're drenched you walk in the door and all you want is a nice hot pot but then you don't have the sauce which is you know that's sad so I always keep this around in case that particular scenario happens which it has happened before all right next is dough buns young more broad bean paste in this case soybean paste because sometimes they use soy beans in this particular operand uses both broad beans and soy beans and this has been described as the sole of citron cooking so a lot of citron dishes you run into you like the Mapo tofu video recipe I just did utilize this dough bands yeah this sauce is so flavorful you know what people sometimes do all they do is heat up this sauce with some oil and though with rice and that will literally transform your rice so it's really handy to have around when you don't have a lot of food at home so if you're like me and you always have a big bag of rice laying around and if you have this then that's a meal this also goes really good with instant noodles next time throw away that seasoning pack and just add a little bit of this all right the next item people usually love or hate and I love this is fermented tofu tofu and there's a few ways I like to utilize this thing one is like to cook this with our leafy greens gives it a really nice flavor and also this goes well if you want to make a hot pot sauce dipping sauce this goes well in that but what most people probably use this the most is as a condiments for their rice dishes so you have a bowl of rice you have some dishes you put a piece of this into your rice because this has a really creamy texture in its uber salty and that's why I blends really well with the rice and I bought this one which is soaked in hot oil so it's gonna be salty and spicy but I always like to keep this around because I'm a rice eater I don't know how many of you guys out there are rice eaters and sometimes I run into the scenario where I have a lot of rice but I don't have a lot of the dish and that's where this Korea Lee comes in handy next we have sesame paste if peanut butter had an Asian cousin this would be it is basically the same texture as peanut butter it goes on has kind of the same consistency and technically you could put this on a sandwich I know some people do this sauce is utilized a lot if you love sesame peanut noodles or cold noodles and you can also make all sorts of dipped with this sauce especially for your sky pancakes and your hot spot okay next one of my favorite sauces black bean sauce if you watched my video on Mapo tofu we utilized black bean sauce in there I'm not the same kind this is one without garlic these are really salty fermented black beans and they are heavenly you know how people always say hey that shirt really brings out your eyes well this sauce really brings out the flavor of any meat it touches so whatever your stir-frying pork chicken beef trust me guys add a little onion add a little green pepper at some of this it's gonna make that dish taste amazing and again because this is pretty salty you can basically omit salt in those dishes that utilizes dis and finally last but definitely definitely not least because it's my favorite thing in the world and it's in a really cute cat mug yeah like that hot oil again can see easy ah I told you guys in the Chinese grocery store video that um you should not buy hot oil in Chinese markets because a lot of it could be just food coloring you don't know what's inside of that it's really simple to make that's why I keep my chili powder on hand I can make this any time I need Oh smells so amazing just that one sniff made my mouth water in hot oil you guys see all my videos this can't go on basically anything like anything except for like sweet stuff but even sweet stuff sometimes you want a little sweet as spicy but really you shouldn't add this on sweet stuff where you can up to you so there you go guys in human terms these are my immediate family the one you cared the most about so I make sure to always at the least stock up on what you see here in my kitchen and with these essential ingredients I can basically make anything taste you know halfway decent work pretty darn good I know some of these might not be considered sauce like okay rice wine that's not really a sauce fermented tofu it's not really a sauce sesame oil vinegar but I'm gonna include it anyway so guys I'm gonna put all this stuff in my description box so the next time you go to a Chinese supermarket definitely try to collect all this and what I've also done is I found some of these items on Amazon so I included the Amazon link down there for you so you can buy it online because I know a lot of you guys don't have access to Chinese supermarkets and of course in this video I'm only talking about Chinese sauces of course there's like other Asian sauces that are really awesome like sriracha fish sauce those are all really good to have as well alright guys group hug thanks for watching I'll see you later", "UUJAagFmifU": "oh crap my eyes are burning hello I'm Ken from KBT Productions TV welcome back to another kendama crew review just for you and just for everyone who left a like on the last video last Monday we were here doing the Big Bite hot dog and I asked for 2,500 thumbs up and you guys gave me 3000 thumbs up so thank you very much for that I appreciate the support and in that I asked you guys do you want me to come back and do the Ghost Pepper wings and they have a deal on right now $8 for 10 wings I'm not sure what the other prices are I didn't I didn't know I should have said oh we haven't I'm on special if you want 10 it's like a buck so I'm after talks is 840 which is pretty good and their wings are quite large I grabbed a jolt from home save save money use all to jolt up from my home before I buy any new ones and they're not available until the 21st of September in the States alright for the next video for 2500 likes I will come back to 7-eleven once again because she says they have a spicy pizza so it's a large pizza and it has I guess jalapeno peppers on it however she says it's a very spicy pizza I'd love to come back and try the spicy pepperoni pizza at 7-eleven let's give this video 2,500 funds up and I'll come back next Monday and do that but today we are doing the Ghost Pepper wings the lady in there she is East Indian and she says she can't eat them they're too hot and that's a little bit scary cuz I know some East Indian people and they have to dumb down their food for people like me to eat because it's way way too hot so I'm a little spooked about it when I asked for these she pulled them out of a bin and they were in a freezer so they start off frozen then they put him in that oven for minutes she flipped them a few times during the the 4 minute time and I'm just gonna put that there I'm like I need a place to the bones and then they were done let's give it a shot I know wings are half decent size oh boy stove hot pepper hot Oh Nelly I'm waiting for it to really start doing damage if it does before I tell you exactly how hot it is the flavor is really good and that's a little bit of a sweet barbecue kind of flavor but not really smoky um but it's definitely like a sweeter sauce on it it's like 30-plus degrees here in Bradford Ontario and the windows I had to put all the windows down the back that one's open this one's almost opened us a crack but that if this one's open the wind will come through and mess the mic up so I wish I could have all the windows fully open because it's hot in here and I'm eating hot wings stove hot we're in there spicy hot so so far they are bearable they're not as frightening as she made them out to be for me maybe she's a little more sensitive go hot or I'm eating hotter stuff I I still can't believe some of the foods that 7-eleven has come out with that I never knew existed but I never knew tasted as good as they do again for fast food I don't know do I know any place that sells wings like this for fast food most of them are where you'll sit down restaurants these are dynamite people Wow zip oh stop the pause the video zip over to a 7-eleven grab some wings ask for ghost pepper let people in the comments below know if you can get the ghost pepper in your area or not but it's not on their website so I look what to look it up on

and gentlemen on my rating scale I'm gonna have to give those a go out and get it now for heat flavor freshness I know it's frozen but the freshness in the fact that it tasted like fresh chicken call me a liar I don't care oh my gosh that I'm I'm on the fence as to whether or not I see I'm still tearing up that is the hottest fast food item I have ever tried I'm not sure if anybody is like one of those super fans that have watched a lot of my videos let me know if I'm wrong against the fast food stuff not Paul stuff and not restaurant food while the lady in there is right very hot but they were doable I ate all 10 didn't have to stop and put them aside like Paul's vindaloo curry Wow insane you want a crazy hot meal come to 7-eleven ask for the ghost wings off there in your area guys

bittersweet i'm just gonna cut right to it this is the last time we're going to see the trio one in any of the videos yep the project is almost over in fact after this video it will be so the trio one that is my 2018 camaro zl1 right behind me that has been through quite a lot in fact the name trio 1 suggests something with a tree yes a tree fell on it and really banged it up it kind of sucked well today is a little bit of a send-off video because it's uh going to one of my customers i wouldn't sell it to one of my customers if i didn't think that it was good so it is uh it's gonna ideally it'll be in good hands and we'll see it again in the future right now as it sits it has the texas speed 427 cubic inch engine uh texas speed ported heads the uh the magnuson 2650 uh the rotofab big gulp the csp bigger boy cam shaft it's what we tend to put in our stroker engines and uh kooks headers the factory exhaust a csp low side fuel system and uh an inner chiller the force inductions inner chiller almost forgot about oh and the csp trunk tank it does have meth on it but not running so i had a couple switches uh i'm selling it to a guy who just wants to be able to run 93 octane which is what we have it set at with the factory exhaust i had a different exhaust on it it's a smorgasbord of testing and this one makes this particular uh one makes 850 rear wheel horsepower and 93 pump gas only and kicks ass pretty good now recently we've been doing some traction control stuff uh really dialing that in and oh my gosh that has turned out really really well in fact racing people oh my gosh the traction control on the run flats has been insane i mean it is just insane spinning is not a thing anymore for me and uh it's like maximum acceleration in every single gear it's wild in fact that's one of the things that we're going to test in this video is we are going to maple grove tonight for their street night on the run flats and we're going to see if we can cut a pretty good time and maybe pull off something crazy like a 9 second quarter mile pass on run flats i don't know that it's going to do it but i'm confident we're going to see tens and i'd be really really happy to see a nine second pass i'm just going to find out i'm probably going to get kicked out because the mile per hour should be in the 140s and above 135 you need you just need a lot of stuff so wish me luck this is gonna be the la again this is the last video this is the last time i'm gonna race it and uh i'm kind of sad but at the same time it's uh it's i have some stuff going on in my personal life that it's time to cash out and the project's done so it's not like i'm cashing out i'm just like i've spent a lot of money on this thing but it's been very rewarding considering we do a whole slew of camaros everything's closed behind me so there's not a lot of stuff outside at the moment but yeah and camaro fest was canceled this year so didn't really get to run it down there either was going to take it to ls fest but that's next week and the customer really wants it before then so this is the best chance i have to do something pretty cool with it okay i've talked a lot let's get to the send off with uh racing a thousand plus rear wheel horsepower c7 that uh unfortunately is a manual okay so we are probably about to have the last race the trio one will ever have in my possession uh i've come up with uh an agreement with a customer of mine who has been wanting to buy it for a long time and that's exactly what's about to happen he's going to buy it so we set it on low boost it's making 850 wheel horsepower on 93 pump gas and uh yeah we're gonna go race something that's way above the league a c7 that makes over a thousand rear wheel horsepower but the catch is it's a manual so we're gonna hope to god that what we have going on with inner chiller and uh 10-speed automatic is going to hold them off for you know good enough times oh and uh we're on run flats not uh drag radials so uh and he is so i don't know exactly how it's gonna go but hopefully we put up a respectable fight i'd say that's a win run flat one two i'm back for the win baby on run flats i could tell that he was coming up in the top end like i could pull hold him off down low but in the top end he was going to come sailing by that's where my gearing no longer has that advantage but i'm pretty happy with how she's performing making papa proud before she goes to the wood chipper so i want to do a quick test on how quick the card 0 to 60s i don't know if this is the right spot but it's the spot we got i think it did pretty good i think on run flats and the power that it's making i think we're going to see a pretty good time excited to see it i don't know what it is right now but i'm going to find out so we were able to achieve zero to 60 in 3.6 seconds which is pretty awesome on run flats i'm pretty happy with that it's uh a pretty soft launch i think i could get it a little bit better maybe get it down into like a three four or a three two but i think this is how i'm going to give it to my customer just so he doesn't get like too squarely and mess things up so i'm pretty happy with that on red flats and not a mid-engine car it's pretty awesome now we're off to the track i need my helmet my jacket which have been in the car since the last time i raced i hope that's all i i need because that's all i got i hope they don't say hey you need a cage because that would suck i have a feeling that if i get it i'm going to practice a launch dial that in a little bit more and hopefully run a really good pass at the end of the night and make me proud before she leaves kind of taking it all in knowing that this is the last time i'm racing it's sad pick the customer up tomorrow morning at the airport and then she's gone and all his so one of the cool things that i figured out in the car was how to do a second gear launch a lot of people in fact i'm pretty sure almost nobody except the people that i've told how to do it i figured it out and i'm gonna reveal it right now because the project's over i'm not gonna reveal the traction control thing but i'm gonna reveal the second gear launch and it's pretty simple when you think about it it's a little bit of a hack but here you go first you got to be in manual mode and what you're going to do is in the manual mode section of the tune you're going to set the two to one shift to zero mile per hour that way when you come to a stop it stays in second you cannot get in the second once you're stopped but you can stay in second and that's how you do the manual launch by changing that in the tune pretty cool so before the race we're gonna fill up actually because i want as much weight over the rear tires as possible a little trick at least for street tires and of course just 93 no e85 or anything like that see they only had 93 it was meant to be we are at maple grove i've been sitting in line for about 40 minutes now uh it's been a bit packed we are rolling in there's a little sliver i guess they have a nice concrete wall up here and it's it's a lot of people it's definitely a lot of people i'm hoping that we can do something good like two or three passes that's that'd be great two or three passes is all i'm really looking for that's a lot of people though dang okay so just went through tech i'm going to try a second gear launch real quick uh no i'm not i'll try it after the pull after the first run run and we'll see what happens they estimate that i'm going to do a 12 flat which i know is gonna be a little bit better than that so hopefully i don't get booted right away that would suck because we're in true street car fashion we're going to let some air out of the tires how much air don't know it's going to be 10 seconds per side okay 15 seconds per side because that's scientific [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hoping to get a first run soon that'd be nice hopefully it's not the only run at like two to three i think that's all i need to know if this is gonna work or not and i think it will so it's eight o'clock and haven't run yet the sun is set and one of the bad things that's happening right now this is scary for cars look like this power is we've hit the dew point this is that's not a good sign i'm gonna try to run it with traction control on but uh yeah i'm not too thrilled seeing this that that we got to be very careful about that so looks like the inner chiller's working it's nice and cold oh yeah very cold that's awesome sauce let it work a little bit longer might see some ice now one of the things that i can do on here okay is uh it has to do with that green light right here this green light turns off the it bypasses the blower so if i click that it will bypass the blower and allow the tank to cool down even further it's really wild then this one does the ac and this one does the meth now because i don't have the meth tune on we're not running it in fact i don't even think i made a meth tune for low boost so i can't even throw it on i could take a guess but i'm not going to um so we're just running it to the inner chiller to the blower only and that's it okay it is nine o'clock the line is moving again so hopefully we get the run the dew is getting a little bit more sketch so it might be a one run and done depending on the track condition and then it leaves tomorrow so that sucks i just spit on myself but i thought it rained i was scared for a sec we're gonna get moving forward i set tire pressures where i want them low well mid-20s in the rear you know stock up front hopefully that works well okay forgive me guys uh the phone may fall my mount has broken but for the most part you're going to see what we do on the pdr so i don't know that that's going to be an issue i mean the the picture here probably looks like anyway because it's so dark out now it's almost 9 30 we're gonna be running at 9 30. so that's that's unfortunate but ideally we're going to be running now looks like we're running up against this thing right here so wish me luck where is it there it goes ready well i think that works pretty good ready [Laughter] [Music] well i think that works pretty good there's a little softer the launch i think it could do better thank you not too bad well i think there's more on the launch so guys we did a 10 6 and 142 1860 foot not bad for just punching it i added some more power to it let's see what she does it shouldn't help the mile per hour but it should help that 60 foot which will indeed help that final time maybe we could get down to a low 10. i think i'd be happy with the lower 10. okay so we are getting one more run i added some more power in every gear hopefully it's worth it i don't think we're gonna hit the nines with what i added but i didn't want to go too far and then just completely blow the run and they said this is going to be the last run so if i see like a 10-3 or a 10-2 i'm going to be real happy i'm going to know that i probably have enough in it for a nine second pass but not going to be able to do it but it's a good end for the story i like completing the project and i think that we've done about everything now so i'm i'm pretty happy i'm i'm satisfied sadly [Music] attraction control back on because why the hell not [Laughter] smoked up that felt really good i can see the belt slipped in the very top of uh top gear so that sucks but that launch felt freaking awesome i definitely outlaunched him so if he had any kind of good launch this is wild what do you guys think what do you what did we run did we run anything good thank you nice nice so on run flats we did a 10-3 at 143 i think i could get it a little bit better i think that nine seconds is out of the the uh equation in fact i think we're just driving home in fact i'm i got my slip and we're just driving the hell home right now because it's over this is it the project's over this is the last time i will have raced this car and it's kind of hitting me i'm sad because we're so close to doing it i'm sure if i had just a smidge if i had higher boost on i'm sure i could do it but i don't and is what it is a tighter belt i'm gonna recommend a smidge tighter of a belt for uh for my customer well new owner now i'm going to turn the interior ac back on here it is this is the send-off this is the last time going to pick the new owner up right now and look at my beautiful wife okay new owner should be up here somewhere said under the united side i don't know where is that him oh my gosh there he is look he's videoing me he's ready to do the youtube ow i just got my finger stuck look at this should we let them in oh boy what's up man you excited yeah i thought it was gonna be louder i didn't even hear you coming up yeah well it's in quiet mode right now that's good okay well i'm gonna stop videoing so we can actually go all right [Laughter] [Music] this is it's beautiful i'm glad it's going to somebody that like actually is going to enjoy the hell out of it oh yeah we're going to enjoy the hell out of this a lot yeah it's sad but it's bittersweet this is this has been with me for a little while we've done a lot together tree [Laughter] man javon's in the passenger seat of his own car the deal is done it's done this is yours problems and all good luck he's getting like like more official than i was with this gopro i got a no pro press the lock button first and then the remote start that's the unlock press lock and then hold the remote start are you holding it look at you oh that's crazy guy remote started all over the place there is no gas tank but this is in the 80s man or the 90s if you're a corvette uh he's in drive here she goes goodbye my love dude you missed the fun like i'm just chilling here like at 70 miles an hour on cruise control chilling and it's like bmw rolled up next to me and i'm m series so you know i could tell they had the big breaks and stuff you know he rolled up all out and i was just looking at him and he slowed down so i slowed down too so he slowed down to about 40. it was honked it off and it oh man i left that dude in the dust so bad it was like bustling [Laughter] he had no idea [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "aS7YRaOtaZ0": "welcome to today's lesson today we're going to look at food and cooking it's not my speciality but we'll try so here we have some ways of cooking you can boil something in the saucepan which means heat it in water heat it up warm it up in water until it boils until it reaches a hundred degrees and boils and the food is cooked in water so you can boil something in the saucepan you can also simmer something you normally leave the soup to simmer and it means just leave it a little bit boiling not violently boiling but just a little bit boiling just before the boil and when you leave something to simmer so it's another verb like boil but not so extreme fry something in the frying pan it means cook it in oil so you usually fly something in the frying pan yeah you put oil in the frying pan and you fry it maybe bake and maybe steak maybe something else you can bake something in the oven you only really bake cake and biscuits and bread related things you can bake bread as well but you vhost vegetables and meat so you can roast chicken or roast turkey in the oven you can also roast vegetables roast potatoes roast carrots in the oven you can also cook things on the hob and you put things on the hob and you take them off the hob okay remember that put on and take off our opposites just like with cloves they're opposites but you put something in the oven and you take it out of the oven so notice the put in and take out like always our opposites okay you can also mix the ingredients together remember the ingredients it's the list of different food you need for the recipes to make the recipes you also stir now stove isn't is it's less violent than mix mixes you normally use a whisk to mix the ingredients together you certainly do if it's pancakes or something like that you use a whip a whisk to mix the egg and the flour together but if you're just stirring something you're doing it slowly and you also stir a cup of tea when you are stirring the sugar okay you can pour your mixture into a bowl now pour just means when you put liquid from one container into another container that is what you mean by pour but a bowl I want to meet be clear a plate is flat a bowl is like this you eat cereal or porridge from a bowl or soup okay you can chop onions and carrots that means go like this with a hard cutting motion we normally say cut the bird but we say chopped onions chopped carrots you peel potatoes that means peel the skin off the vegetable peel off and peel the potatoes you grate the cheese which means take a grater a cheese grater I forgot to write that one up here a cheese grater take a cheese grater and grate the cheese make it into little bits maybe to put cheese on your pizza or something like that you may then sprinkle the cheese on your pizza or sprinkle some herbs on the top of the pizza sprinkle whatever you want but it's going to be little and it's when you do that on top you add something but by just picking it up and normally it's herbs perhaps parsley perhaps dill okay um and lastly you can drain your rice in a sieve which is also up here as sieve drain the rice in a sieve a sieve is the place where you put the rice in order that the water drains away falls away so it's how you get rid of the water after you have boiled device you drain it then in a sieve okay before we do recipes it's going to utensils you can also have a chopping board for chopping your carrots or onions you have a sieve for draining the rice you have a ladle which is for taking soup out of a saucepan and putting it into a bowl you need a ladle to take the soup out of the saucepan and put it into a bowl okay you also have a whisk for mixing the ingredients as we've already done for example flour and eggs in pancakes you have a baking tray and this is what you put in the oven um often when you're perhaps you're baking cakes or so things like that you need to put them on the baking tray so that's just a tray which you can put in the oven you don't have to just cook you don't have to just bake on a baking tray you could do something else you could just be roasting something in the baking tray but we call it usually a baking tray casserole dish is much bigger and it's often made out of ceramic and it will hold the whole casserole if you're making something together you're making a nice stew or a nice casserole where you're you want all the juice from the vegetables and the and the meat to mix together then you put it all in a casserole dish dish so it's much bigger a spatula and I believe in the UK sometimes it's called an a fish slice or an egg slice me and my brother always called it a burger flipper when we were younger because we didn't really use it for much else but this is what you use perhaps when you're frying eggs in the frying pan you use the spatula to move them around or to take them out and a cheese grater you use for grating the cheese okay verbs now when I eat my soup I like a lot of bread with a lot of butter on the bread and I like to dip my bread in the soup is just how I like to eat soup if your food has gone cold you might like to heat it up in the microwave we might like to warm it up in the microwave some food can be very heavy in your stomach and we say it fills you up yeah it fills you up if you decide to eat not at home then you eat out and we've got some good verbs actually for eating itself if you wolf something down you eat it very quickly and you can also say gulp something down it means swallow it very quickly and if you knock something over if you knock a glass over then it means that you spill a drink all over the place so you spill something over it's very very similar spilling is just the verb that's used for the liquid covering an area coming out of the container and covering in it covering an area knock is more about the container you knock over the glass but you spill the wine boil over this is when you're boiling something and the water goes over the edges it boils over and I sit in another lesson you can also use this for conflict when it goes over the board or something like that it boils over okay lastly to spit something out perhaps sometimes you don't like what's in your mouth and so you spit it out if it's if it's disgusting if it's not delicious if it's not tasty you might spit it out lastly we've got a good idiom here to bite off more than you can chew if you take on a very difficult task perhaps a project at work which is just too demanding for you to deal with and you're not able to get things done on time you're not able to you know reach your targets or whatever then you have bitten off more than you can chew and it means you know you've put too much in your mouth and and you can't chew it also you probably end up like my son and spit it out that's what he does with when he gets a big mouthful of food okay lastly recipes for breakfast something like scrambled eggs this just means eggs which have been mixed in on the flying pan to make a kind of mixed up a mixture it's not when the egg is fried or boiled which will be the other two ways you could have bacon burnt to a crisp it's just an expression to be very very burnt very well-done some people like it like that not me and you can have toast dripping with butter and this would mean it's covered in butter there's loads and loads of butter and at the weekend I actually did some cooking for a change I don't usually buy cook some dumplings so for dumplings I needed to make the pastry first and I used flour eggs and water to make the pastry I then I'd been to the shops and bought some beef and pork mints because we were going to mix it together and we added some onions as well and then I put the beef importance into the pastry into little bits of pastry then once I got the balls of pastry with the mints inside and the onions I boiled the dumplings not for long for about five minutes with some bay leaves I sprinkled some herbs on top and they were actually delicious okay thanks for watching there I hope those verbs have been useful for you please like the video and I hope to see you all soon you", "hh9xpS80pYs": "hi I'm Anna wall trades and today I'm going to tell you about how my friend Steve dando and I made this rube low style of frame saw it is a fantastic project very little involved really but a great way to practice all of your hand tool skills plus if you don't have a bandsaw this is a fantastic way to restyle your material obviously I'm pretty well covered in that department but here we go anyway [Music] [Music] you may remember the name Steve dando from a few of my other projects he was one of my favorite teachers when I was friend woodworking program at my heart center so anytime he has a project he would like me to take part in I'm always down so a few weeks ago when he got called and I said I wanted to build a few frames solve it and I said of course we went to CrossFit Market in Seattle and picked up the lumber and then woodcraft was very nice to let us use Asia to create these cream sauce you'll also see Jeff Martin who's another friend of ours in the back side of somebody's lips and the three of us had such a blast making these brand sauce together [Music] [Music] one thing I always have appreciated about Steve is how economical is this is all of our scrap the entire project so far [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now that I have all of the power tool work done I'm going to finish this all by hand which we can cut the Tenon's finish up we're finding the mortises and basically just get this whole thing so that it's ready to put together over they clear a lot of this away with a really sharp chisel and then that's gonna save us a whole lot of time with a rasp later on so one thing I really want to emphasize here is that power tools are definitely our helpers there's still actually quite a bit of work that needs to be done to refine and to perfect these joints even after you've used power tools to create them so as long as we view the power tools as you know our apprentices or our assistants and we are still able to perform the work ourselves we'll be in a lot better position my knife line deep in it and to make room for my saw I always want to cut on the outside of my line use my thumb to guide the cut looking in the saw plate reflection to make sure that I'm staying nice and square and my cut very gentle with this rope you only see one line but I mark - just in case just take a little peek and check to see what's going on over there [Music] just taking away that little hair watching that reflection sighing with confidence using my whole soft if I get off I'm not gonna try to make the saw fix the cut I will adjust it after with my chisel [Music] we're going to make ourselves a little and I saw [Music] then want to check it square make sure that we're not gonna have any bad hang-ups once it goes time to assemble the joint very much exactly what we're like [Music] before I get too excited about any of this I'm going to assign each mortise to a specific tenon and then I'm going to work on fitting it to that tenant one really important thing to check before you put any of this stuff together is just make sure that the depths of all your mortises is the same and deep enough because you'd hate to have anything hang you up and you're trying to assemble it if it's shorter here that's fine because it's not gonna hang anything up if it's too long here you're gonna have a big problem we just check all of those before [Music] right so now comes the moment of truth when you're assemble everything [Music] oh yes okay that's [Music] so thank you so much for taking the time to watch this video and for supporting my channel if you would like to support me on patreon you support the creation of more projects and the video editing so that you get to see those projects I'm looking forward to bringing a whole bunch more awesome content your way in the next few weeks and months and I certainly

opened it up out of the bag and i'm like yo this is huge online it says it feeds up to three people this definitely does feed up to three people i definitely do believe that it's saucy it's meaty i'm definitely excited for this and this one here is a lunch size version of a big city i love baked pasta because it gets a little crispy and i've also got house bread two of them let's not waste any time i'm ready to smash this i hope you guys do enjoy this video drop a like subscribe if you're new and let's get all of this food in my belly right now that's saucy wow look at that oh my god hmm whoa the mood is out of the way that's good it's not like mushy i always get nervous when i get this stuff because like i feel like it could get really mushy like the pasta like the ravioli their meat sauce is really good a bit sour it's meaty i could taste garlic or onion in it so the ravioli is cheese filled if you're bulking in the winter you need to put on like 30 40 pounds this is the spot oh this is meaty this is going to be this is the bite that's the bite so so let's do this i heard italians do this after when they're done eating the meal they get a bread use the bread to gather up all this extra sauce that's left on the plate um with the bread so that is so crispy look at that pool a cheese pool that's the big z i think it needs more sauce though but it's delicious it's crispy it's cheesy so so i have fun story for you guys when i was driving to get this food is what i saw on the street on my way there it was hilarious okay it wasn't holiday hilarious because the people who got impacted are probably really pissed off but it was just like kind of like it was kind of funny but it was kind of bad at the same time so so this one here this white stuff here is ricotta and when you go into this restaurant i think it's like one of those old school restaurants where they used to get a lot of celebrities being there because on the wall they had pictures of people who ate there pretty cool we don't have like restaurants like this in toronto so this top part here is breadcrumbs and when you eat it with the pasta oh it's amazing so so oh so oh so so oh my god i'm almost done them i'm pretty shocked i don't think i could eat it though i don't think i could finish the entire thing though it looks like i'm almost done but i'm getting pretty damn full so got the ziti to finish okay so you guys i was driving down to get this food right i was driving through a side street and the side streets are pretty tight here in l.a especially when there's cars parked on the side and we're i'm going this way and there's a there's cars coming this way so when when we're driving this way the car is going on coming should stop so you could go through because both cars going through at the same time when there's cars parked on the side it's literally impossible you're good it's really tight especially with me i have a truck so um we're going we're going and then there's a car coming on coming up it was so tight luckily this happened in front of me so the car is driving side swipes a car parked on the street okay this same car drives right by me and i'm like really nervous because i just saw this person just side swipe a parked car so i like kind of turned really quick so it did they don't hit me and i'm i'm stopped at the red light and i'm just looking at this car because they're still trying to go through the street i'm looking through my mirrors and i see this car pop a u-turn in that tight street this car is trying to pop u-turn and it's not a small car either it's a pretty big car so pops you does it you turn and obviously doesn't complete the u-turn because the car's so big and the streets so tight so backs up and hits another parked car parked on the street so this is the car backs up like this like that right on the door so the car goes forward hits another card going forward okay goes back into reverse hits the same car again on the door the exact same spot where i hit it on the first time hits the car again for a second time i'm like wow and then after that i just left because it was green that was wild that person within like literally like a quarter of a mile not even a quarter mile like that's like 0.01 mile hit three cars when they were driving by me i was so nervous i'm like you better not hit my car to be honest i'm enjoying the rav ravioli more than the big z this is really good this is amazing i should have videotaped that car backing those cars up that one that's that's that's a viral video right there that's literally a viral viral video when the car was backing up for the first time i'm like this car is gonna hit that car parked on the street and then literally one second later boom unreal that person's gonna have a shitty day as soon as he walks out the house and you know what sucks that person that hit the car is probably gone by the time the other person finds out and the other car and the other two cars that were parked here i asked the guy i'm like is this gonna be enough food for one person he's like yeah man it's gonna be a lot because you're probably gonna have some for dinner so this is the carb overload if i was bulking right now this would be literally perfect so do you guys know what i'm doing kinda like dipping it in the meat sauce to make it kind of like saucier how much is that literally one more bite left he's gone hmm wow what's up hmm i love pasta look at that that is it that is the one you my italian friends are all going to be happy for me for this bite um i'm like why is my arm where oh that was i love this this was okay tasted great but a bit more sauce would mean oh i hope you guys all enjoy this this was absolutely delicious this ravioli was amazing this was really good too eat whatever you guys want to eat but in moderation but we'll see you guys on to the next one have a great day peace [Music]", "PzW2tCXNBcY": "hey guys welcome to the new episode of tackle insider today I want to show you how to make your own fish attractant to spray on your lures to give them that added scent so here we got Crisco extra virgin olive oil right here it's in a spray it's a lot less dense than the real level that's why I use it and we have some coffee here also garlic powder or raw garlic doesn't matter which one you use salt mortar and pestle and something to put your stuff in so let's get started okay guys our first step is to pour our salt into the mortar and pestle that's good now we're going to grind okay now I've ground up the salt it's basically like powder so now we're going to move on to step number two okay guys now we're going to add our coffee and if you don't know there are a lot of baits that are made to smell like coffee I know strike King has some so I thought I'd add this flavor and scent in there and probably good next were going to take our spray oil and really hose this down for all right now let me get a spoon here something now we're just going to stir this up okay guys it's stirred now and you can see the oil is mixed with the coffee very nicely now we're going to add some of our salt that we ground up I'm going to add about a spoonful salt good and you may be wondering why I added oil directly to the water well it's going to make it water-soluble if you ever looked at Berkley Gulp products they say it disperses in the water it's not just the oil I've made this before and it is very nice you spray it in the water and it doesn't just flow to the surface like oil does it just kind of lingers in the water and leaves a good scent trail so that you're wondering that's why we do that all right now we're going to add some garlic powder if I can get this right garlic powder we have a spoonful down as well all right so I got tires that go bump up as you can see now it's all starting like one liquid the oils now mixed with the coffee and this will be a really awesome attract I'm going to add a little more oil in and there we have your very own fish attractor put this in a spray bottle spray it on your lures it'll work nicely thanks for watching this episode of tackle insider see you guys later please rate comment and subscribe", "9BhCFrPSY5U": "[Music] [Music] and I am here with a tutorial I am going to show you how to make me stay in Sarajevo or in civil y'all whichever way you say it um I do have I believe like two or three I believe maybe two I don't know like a whole bunch of recipes in my channel two or three um recipes on how to make steaks and onions but this is my mother's recipe and I love the way my mother makes hers is like so so good you are going to love this recipe right here okay so um yeah so let's get started real quick and let me show you what I have here I have here right here let me show you extra virgin olive oil you produce any extra virgin olive oil of your choice I do have here some white vinegar adobo oregano parsley I also have here fat phones now they have different brands they have like the north ones they spell KN o RR or you to get the Goya one whichever one you prefer buy that one okay and if people packet has to okay it's like this I might use two or three let's pick up and I have here some tomato sauce you could use any tomato sauce of your choice it doesn't have to be glad you could use the cheap stuff too and some garlic powder and I have here one big onion now I will tell you to use the red onions but that's not the way I my mother makes it she makes it with like a Spanish onion or white onion it's never the red one and to me I think this onion is better then all this recipe goes well with white or Spanish onions it not the red one but if you want to use it with the red I mean is your kitchen you do what you want this is my mother's recipe and it is so so good I'm so happy I finally got the recipe like every time I go to her house I'm not one to like eat the fig out of the rice you know like the fig out is the bottom part of the right stuff like the time of birth part of the of the bottom of the rice I never eat that you know but but my mother makes these steaks I love it so much especially like the sauce I will put that on figure out and I will eat two or three times no lie it is so good so I am so happy to be sharing this on my channel and when you try you're going to be like oh my god you are so right that steak was so good so let's get started on this recipe okay I am really sorry I forgot to show you the star item in this whole dish I forgot to show you the steaks all right now usually I buy it in a pack and I put it in a ziploc bag be able to have more space in life in my freezer and these are beef round cubed steaks so that's what you want okay and I believe that's like maybe 405 in here I will let you know I'm going to put the hold water on and you want to clean this meat in ice-cold water [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'll try to use a little bit of vinegar or you got like lemon or lime squeeze a little bit of it to clean up the liter from water you want to make sure that you clean it into the water is a little bit clearer you know cuz Pink's are like no not that they dirty but it does have like a lot of like blood and all that stuff so it's not going to be 100% clear but mostly clear you don't want it like a little blood okay so as that pick up a little bit of water there okay as you can see that these cube sticks do have like these little holes and ridges like I don't know you can see and I'm going to be disgusting holding States what did I give you a detail this is how it is that's the way the stick look alright and basically that you know when you when you pile the stake out is usually with something like this you see how they do it like this and they just to to to to make it more tender however let me tell you you cannot cook this for like at least 10-15 minutes and six you're going to have a nice soft state that's just not going to happen I will be cooking this for at least 30 to 45 minutes because I want a nice soft tender steak so there's four pieces in here I was going to do a come cook with me videos and I was going to show you all of this in one complete dish which I was going to make on white rice the steaks of course white rice dates sweet plantains and like a tomato onion kind of salad and I still got a little bit of being left over from yesterday but I don't think you probably want to see like a video that's an hour and even though I'm making these come cooking videos that is about an hour because I'm showing you the whole complete dish I don't know if you guys like those type of videos so I said let me just show them the steaks I will show you a plate of this towards the end cuz I think that every time so if you still want to see it come cook for me again and I'll redo the whole steak rice and all that you let me know so this is the way the space look there's more space in here and you want to season it first by Louisville don't add too much available you could always add and feel like you need more garlic garlic powder try not to use garlic salt garlic powder is just for the taste of powder it doesn't have more salt in it oregano and I'm eyeballing everything just add everything a little at a time I'll be in my family do not measure parsley I wish I could show the camera right there when you could see one exactly doing and hope that helps you could see exactly what I'm doing okay then I put the garlic powder yes I did I'm gonna add extra virgin olive oil about like two teaspoons and I'm gonna ask you vinegar I'm gonna add a reasonable amount you're not because this has more of the taste of vinegar okay so it will make sense and I'm going to start off first with two packs of Stockholm all right so satsang I'm gonna start off with two and if I feel like I need more than I and more the last time I made this was when I trust me in here and I get a bigger pack and I use three packs but this does I think the other one had like six thanks this one only has four so let's just see first that's why I didn't add a lot of Stockholm because no my cell phone that's why they had a lot of my co-workers Volvo has like a lot of salt in it and I'm going to add a platform and our song has two so with my clean hand I will be mixing this around [Music] I feel like just by looking at it I feel like it needs more oregano and maybe garlic power like I said this doesn't have no floor like oregano so you can add a little as much as you want and garlic powder also I'm going to add the other sacrum so you know try to taste it even though this is raw meat just try to dip your fingers in like the water and just put you just with your hands just taste it a little bit you're not gonna die he likes for real you know but you do got a chase business all teachers know how to do need to add anything extra you know that's just part of cooking you know I don't know if I should add a little bit more I'll go about what I'm gonna do I'm going to mix this up a table night [Music] now I know people and I've done it because if you watch my other videos you will see that I added for people that asked for free thought to this now I'm doing it the way my mother does it when my mother gave me the recipe the first thing I said was mom no sofrito nice you know we need to home fries all up in here you know she was like I never asked for people all this time I thought that she did when she used to make the steak she never does so I'm doing it the way my mother does it because it is really really good so no sofrito guys I know you're listening I like wah no no so people but trust me it is really really good so I am going to add water to this all right and we want to put enough water for it to cover the fake alright this is going to be the four that's going to be in the involved and the face when it's cooked so that's good right there make sure that you could see the steak a little bit but make sure is about this thick all right and that is what you're going to do see the onions I ready turn it up to it you know to save some time and you know for the video could be a little short you want to cut them so our onions and very fat like slices I will tell you like do like if you want to come thin fine it's your kitchen but man if you do it like this and then the way it's going to be cooked imma show you how it is towards the end you're going to love the taste of the onions trust me through them at least is this nice and thick alright so with that you want to add all that in there and yes add a lot on you because whom the onions are so good and pick him up and now even though I never do it with a spoon you're in general always use my hands I'm trying to mix this up try to mix this up make sure you put all those onions in there okay and yes you're going to have to taste it to see every nice maybe more vinegar more of any things before you put this in your refrigerator for at least a good 20 to 30 minutes to make sure it marinate and make sure one of that is blended if you can pull it a nice the night before even better alright put it like in a bowl like this or like in a really tight ziploc bag and like and put up put it on a plate under this is way better if you do it like a day before okay alright so all right and just showed you how it looks and it is so good hold on marry me you're going to see how it's going to taste alright someone put this back on my tripod okay what we need to do now is use your clean hands and just okay so just by tasting it we're going to need to add a little bit of vinegar because since we just added water we got it and I guess the user had a decent amount of vinegar because you know and I am going to add a global I didn't want to add module before because I didn't know how this was going to taste and a little bit of extra virgin olive oil as well I'm going to add I don't need to add nothing else [Music] again for the tastings okay that's perfect I got a lot of taste I mean multi takes a little bit of a water you real I need to grab a big spoon and just take a big gulp of it just put your little fingers taste it just to see if the seasonings is right okay just to see if you need to add more unknowable or whatever also even though this recipe is you know you know Puerto Rican basically if you want to add the salt and pepper that's fine we'll season saw my opinion you should you know use a mobile for this recipe you know but is up to you so I'm going to put a lid on this and I'm just going to leave it in the refrigerator while I cut my sweet plantain start off with the right and all that other stuff and we'll be back when it's time to put it in the pot I have my pan preheated I have it on medium for now and I'm watch that pot no you need a pan for this up rattle for have a little bit extra virgin olive oil but we're going to add a little bit okay we would have extra virgin olive oil in the marinade so just a little bit but I like a team to school maybe yeah and we must wait until we get my top so let's wait for that and marinate it you can add a little bit less water than that all depends on much like sauce you want I'm gonna just sweat it already sprinkle a little water just to see where me said sizzle sound okay let's test it out with this fork just dip it in the marinade and see if it makes any sounds any sizzle sounds it's true to leave a little bit but not as high as I as hot as I want to put it in there because we are going to cook this for two minutes on both sides without no marinating when I'm wrong nothing just the sticks okay starting to make us go okay now we're ready but there has to bump up the heat a little bit for a smile on medium-high don't add the onions just the steaks all right [Applause] [Music] okay so you want to cook this on both sides or at least two minutes okay and they will get smaller by the way the steaks never get big - trust me tamales cook this party two minutes on each side even though I just flip the other one I'm trying to move it different directions because now they're shrinking a little bit so so cookies two minutes hi both sides okay at this point it's been cooked both sides for two minutes and yes there's still a lot of juice in there of course now there is some people and like some of my family members do this then you don't have to add the tomato sauce all right you can just leave it like this put the rest of the tools in there and just cook it on low for like 30 minutes all right and just you know either like that The Onion's always go last and we add the onions like at least three to five minutes when is almost done all right oh so you could do that as well all right like my former boyfriend that passed away she did not like when I used to make sure with the tomato sauce she would eat it but he preferred it without the tomato sauce so I will have to make it like both ways because my kids like it with the tomato sauce I like it will please well he didn't like it like that and you know so I will make it for him like this simmer it reload also same in the heat go like a good 30 like I said 30 to 45 minutes then I'll add the onions and then I'll give it to him like that without no tomato sauce on the tomato sauce to thicken it a little bit you know so just you have to possible you know you got two different ways you could do it all right it's what I'm saying so is it really cooked and gun okay you could also tell by the way your fork seals going in you know it's not you cannot you know it's not raw so it smells so good my house so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to add the rest of this sauce I'm not going to add the onions though try anyway oops wait a minute hold on I'm trying to record and show you guys all right try to put all of the juice but it definitely a little bit of juice in there that's fine alright so I'm going to reserve the onions for last so I'm a little TV on under the steak dip or trans male come together and I am gonna have the tomato sauce alright so I'm still going to leave this on high oh I should have used probably a bigger pot but I'm going to still leave this on high for like maybe a good 15 minutes into a thickens up a little bit and reduce some of the water then I'm going to simmer it down okay so I'm going to show you that next okay the more time all the fake clips cook it on high for 50 minutes I got five more minutes left and I'm going to show you how the looks of water evaporated everything looks lovely I'm sorry that the team appears almost in Japan alright so making some white light when I must leave the timetable for my table wait all my plants and stuff when I know [Applause] in department I don't worry about everything all over again so this is my classrooms I got a please a big of hot sauce on kettle pot oh that's more like a fan you come over it all me and my kids my critics all the political I also have my sweet plantain and I'm going to make like a tomato tomato onion kind of a salad I'll show you their necks and I'm gonna show you the creeps okay so I have a little salad here or just a mix up everything cucumbers different types of tomatoes and some red onions and also I did it with my marinade that I have here my salad dressing emeriti my salad dressing only salad dressing and that's how I did that and I'm going to check up on the steaks we got three more minutes left okay so as you can see you turn that off it's a 15 minutes on high the water evaporated just like is gonna happen let me tell you you put this on low before keep still evaporating and I want all that juice only yes top I do so we want to put this on wrong all right now let me explain something to you I get a lot of cleaning because it was just too much how you call us for four quarter for this which I'm not going to lie like on that okay because we we that we love the floor you know so yeah I'm just saying next time you know try to use a bigger pan like I said I'm working with what I have I already have a lot of pot and a lot of pans because I gave most of them away on my milk from the other part so now I gotta redo everything all over again so you're going to make this but a lot of like nice goals use a bigger pen okay so don't want to smack them on the board can you taste it a little bit it's giving a little bit more vinegar because at this point you just want to check busy if you need more available or more vinegar those are the two main things you're gonna need all right and I know it's a really really sick Napa once we add the onions it's got kind of you know ooh you know all right so let's just taste this oh my god it's so good I don't feel like it needs anything else I don't think in these are doable because there's well-seasoned I am going to leave the vinegar here's oh um so when I add the onion I'm going to see even which may be you know once I add the onions and I still got a little bit of that you know a little bit of that water that's in in here which is our sorry you can see some of the water and stuff like that you know and see if maybe I gotta add a little bit of vinegar that's Ted and we'll be back by the way since I'm busy like cooking and doing everything else I'm forgetting so much things to say here um you're going to want to put this with a lid on very low okay and also you're going to want to leave this for an additional we already left is it 4:15 I'm gonna try leaving it there for like 20 minutes okay we'll check up on it in 20 minutes so I'm going to do that now and [Music] alright alright 20 minutes I'm going to leave it because like I said it's from 30 to 45 minutes and put a lid on it leave it very low in your stove don't touch it nothing will be back I'm also going to make this cake and I'm showing that everything but the video is about the the the space and onions but you know me I like to always show you what I'm looking

Brandy. In the family tree of alcohol Brandy is one\nof the big six in the spirit line. Brandy is distilled from wine or fermented\nfruit juice. Its name is derived from brandewijn. There are several types of brandy, and the\nkey distinction between them is their root ingredient. Let's make a chart. Now technically anything that ferments can\nbecome brandy. However there are the main types. There's Grape Brandy (Grapes), Fruit Brandy\n(any fruit other than grapes), Pomace Brandy (pressed grapes), and Brandi with an I. The most widely consumed brandy is grape brandy. That's where your cognacs, armagnacs, and\nmost of the popular brandies are categorized. We'll talk about those in different videos. We don't exactly know when or how brandy came\nto existence. In all likelihood it was mistake. It's generally believed that Brandy was the\nresult of cost cutting. Wine was extremely popular in the Middle Ages,\nand back then they didn't have the most efficient transportation. Now some winemaker, we'll call him Carl, figured\nhe could reduce the water content of his wine, ship the concentrate, and add water to dilute\nit back to wine once it got to Arch Duke what's his name. Somewhere along the line someone decided to\ntry Carl's Concentrate, and they were like, \"Hey guys, this is kind of really good.\" So good in fact that Carl decided to produce\nit as it's own liquor, and by the 1500's Brandy was one of the most popular spirits in Europe. The process for making brandy has been refined\nsince the days of Carl. I'm not going to dive into the details of\nproduction, but rather I'll explain the top-line difference between fine brandy and not-so-fine\nbrandy. Fine brandy is always made in pot stills in\nsmall batches. Most are double distilled meaning they're\ndistilled... twice. The more times you distill a juice the higher\nthe ABV and the lower the flavor content. Not-so-fine brandy is mass produced though\na different process called fractional distillation. This process uses column stills rather than\npot stills. Essentially there's this big ass machine and\nsomeone is standing at the top with a shovel constantly scooping ingredients in, and at\nthe bottom there's a guy with a bunch of bottles filling from a constant stream of product. There's not as much play with the subtle notes\nof texture and flavor with column stills as there is with pot stills. After distillation all brandy is stored in\noak casks for however long the producer sees fit. During storage the liquid soaks up flavors\nfrom the oak, and also loses some alcohol content. Before bottling the producer will dilute the\nbrandy to an ABV typically around 40%. Now that's what brandy is. So how do you drink it. Like all drinks you could cut it with diet\ncoke and dump it in a big gulp, but agghhh please don't. The best way, in most opinions including ours\nis in a snifter, straight, slightly above room temperature. That's how you get the most flavors, the best\naromas, and you look like such a freaking bad ass. You can also enjoy brandy in a mixed drink. A Sidecar or Metropolitan also known as a\nBrandy Manhattan are two of the most famous. Recipes down in the description. As always we encourage exploration of the\nfine stuff and the cheap stuff. Do you have a favorite brandy or have you\nrecently found one -- leave us a note in the comments, so we can try it. And remember that it's better to have a little\nof the good stuff than a lot of the bad. Always drink responsibly, prost.", "WixOSmaVlUc": "hello everyone welcome back to another mukbang with me bartend fresh how are you guys today i'm eating california sandwiches i've got a fried chicken cutlet sandwich here with tomato sauce onions and sweet peppers i've also got onion rings and i've also got a fried eggplant with tomato sauce and cheese all right which one do we start with which one would you guys start with this or that i'll let's start with the chicken look how girthy the sandwich is like it's so thick wow look at that nice piece of pepper roasted sweet peppers are so good it's probably like one of my favorite things to eat like roasted sweet peppers on a bun with some like salami or like some sort of cold cut the tomato sauce is tangy the sweet peppers makes it nice and peppery but the chicken isn't crispy most likely because of the sauce and i took it to go mm-hmm these guys know how to make a sandwich so good so you physically can't eat this clean it's literally impossible hmm oh my god oh wow i was looking at it and i'm like wait it's not open how dare far to not open the diet coke all right so let's try this eggplant so i've never had this sandwich before i usually go and get this chicken cutlet sandwich it's my favorite one but i'm like let me get something healthy so i got an eggplant sandwich hmm wow it's super light it's kind of weird because it's super light like when i eat it if i feel light but this would fill me up nice bomb the eggplant is creamy with that sauce oh how's it feel i try to take a bigger bite did not work it definitely didn't work so this spot is an italian owned restaurant there are 13 locations and i think they're all family owned but this is not like i don't think i doubt this is like traditional italian sandwiches it's probably like just like a canadian like a toronto thing electron italian toronto toronto italian for some reason when i eat this it tastes like spaghetti just this sandwich when i eat it it tastes like spaghetti all right maybe i'm tripping out how does eggplant taste like spaghetti you a while back i tried making this at home similar sandwich it wasn't bad it kind of tasted like the actual one and i didn't deep fry it i just seared like pan fried the chicken cutlet i added provo and cheese so this is so bomb and they also have a veal sandwich uh same exact same way but a fried veal cutlet but i'm not really a fan of the veal one i like the chicken the chicken it breaks up better when i eat the veal sandwich when it when you bite into it it doesn't break up easily so like you're pulling the entire cutlet you so bomb so bomb oh i hope you guys all enjoy this if you guys are ever in toronto and are craving italian sandwiches kind of like italian style sandwiches check the spot out you won't be disappointed but we'll catch you guys on to the next one stay safe you guys be well and we'll see you guys in a bit peace [Music] you", "U1XSyBpvncw": "[Music] what is going on all you crap is out there today I'm going to do a challenge video live oops this one's live bait well it's dead now but it was live versus artificial plastics and to give the artificial plastics a little more well to make sure it's a little more fair to make sure it's a little more fair between the live bait scent and the other first plastic I'm going to be using this slob sauce from crappie comm I'll link it below you can pick that up and I'm just gonna spray a little bit on the plastic it's an oil based spray holds on there pretty well and stays on there for quite a while so spray a little right there what do I have going here I have slip bobber setups for both of these rigs they're both set up for slip bobbers it's fine get one here right there and I have them pretty close to the same depth as close as I can get them everybody I'm in about 18 feet of water brush piles and then a deeper drop-off it goes from about 15 feet to 20 feet I'm sitting right on that edge from where it goes from hard bottom to soft bottom and this is where these crappie are going to be set up this fall they're moving from their midsummer locations where the brush piles in that 15 10 to 15 foot range to that deeper water structure or just open water right now they call that the aggregation period of they're moving from the the shallower the shallow water to the deeper water so let's try to catch some of these big slabs that are moving they're transitioning into their winter homes all right let's get these lines in the water so I wanted to be as realistic as possible and keep everything the same so I using live bait but it's not actually alive it's it's dead and then I'm want to put these bobbers pretty close together so they're fishing the same structure alright so that was my artificial bait the artificial minnow and here goes my real minnow straight down it's gonna be a little difficult here but I think we can make it work no so there is my real minnow there's my fake minnow I'm gonna kind of move in the same I got a little I got a fatal fake middle comes up first on that slob sauce one to nothing artificial minnow with the slob sauce one to nothing right now alright had to retie something there alright so it's one nothing getting out my fingers artificial lure with that slop sauce and versus the minnow minnows at the regular the live minnow well dead minnow live bait is at zero right now I don't want to get caught in my I don't really want to get caught in my there we go all right trying to put them as close together as I can get a solid comparison here Oh missed one on the artificial mr. won on that crappie sauce that was my fault though I just missed the hook set I had too much line out oh there's a live bait evened it up oh when he came off oh and I got one on the fake one holy smokes two two one artificial oh it's a nice one to two to one with the artificial crappie or with the artificial crappie the artificial lure okay so we got two two one artificial is my blue bobber here and my live bait is my pink bobber so let's drop them back down oops I might have been a little too far to cast somewhere right there I get this artificial one back down there bro should have set a time limit you know I'm gonna do that I'm gonna set it on my phone ten minutes this is more of an impromptu challenge I wasn't really planning planning anything you're gonna stop watching my phone here Oh artificials got one and it's a bluegill does that count I don't know oh why Bates got one too oh no you let it go you took it though bluegills goes back I think we're doing crappie challenge I mean bluegill still fish but start okay we got ten minutes on the clock put a middle back on I'm hooking them the same way through the mouth so I wanted everything as even as possible for this little little challenge of mine here all right let's get that live bait down and let's get the artificial lure down there pretty much hook the same way drop that down there I might need to spray some more on some more that slop sauce on there but I think we'll be okay for right now oh there goes the live bait rig Wow rip it right off there that alive they rigged back down there they got to get in the boat to count so far the artificial with that slop sauce is uh is up two to one I'm gonna need to spray a little more on their thing when we do that technically 301 but I wasn't going to count the bluegill so there we go drop that down there I think what's helping is the waves actually moving the bobbers up and down it's kind of jigging it for me so it's but it's even though I mean they're both about doing the same thing I got him set at the same depth about two feet apart right now so two two one come on crop he's only got ten minutes here fellas better figure it out let's try on this side of the boat Adam had him on the live bait to to to will counter to the - I'm bad considering it's artificial something's on the lab bait no I don't know if they're small or what the deal is that big one I had was on that artificial it's a good thing I put a time limit otherwise I'd probably be doing this all day and I can't can't be doing this all day I might have lost my mental about a video on doing a how-to of more of what I'm learning for fall crappie with minnows and I had a really good hook up ratio hooking them underneath the underneath the lip but right now man they are just stealing this thing from me there there's one on the wide date little guy though alright artificial gotta catch up three to two now well that was not good ouch he's still alive he's spiking the crap out of me though got me again got it again and there's ten minutes hmm all right so that ended the live bait versus artificial challenge you like these challenge videos be sure to hit

take care so long [Music]", "sMhpM4LYrU0": "all right so we're out here at the dock we're going to catch some mullet real quick for potentially some snook fishing later but also i'm going to do a whole smoke mullet recipe give it a thumbs up if that's what you want to see hopefully we can get some let's go how does that cast have a hold on it oh that's the old one i got the biggens god bless a big old mullet those are going to be perfect we made it back here i have my mullet here stephanie was kind enough to put them on ice they've been pretty much in ice water this whole time now we're going to preheat the smoker to 200 degrees and i'm going to pretty much butterfly these and get them ready for the smoker and open them up just like that don't get much fresher than this they're a little squeamish may want to look away viewer discretion is advised there you go so now we got two fillets right here boom so now i'm just washing the fillets off as you can see big difference from there to there and i'm not i'm gonna leave the rib cage and everything on i'm leaving the skin on just like that i'm not gonna take that off we're gonna smoke it and lay it skin side down scales and all so i'm gonna set the temperature now it only requires one fish for this particular recipe and i'm gonna set the temperature at 200 degrees all right so what i've went ahead and done and added a quarter cup of kosher salt and a tablespoon and a half of sugar and mixed it all in so now what you want to do is lightly coat your fillets you want to make sure you really get an even coverage on the fish the meat itself so now that we have it evenly coated our fish with the combination of salt and sugar we want to allow it to cure for 30 minutes and ultimately dry out before putting it into the smoker the smoker's preheating it wasn't 70 degrees we need to get it up to heat to about 200 degrees and that takes about 20 to 30 minutes i'm preparing the fish baby sure are you are you hungry sure the fish are you hungry you ready for some fish all right guys stay tuned so what we're gonna do is we're gonna put it in the we're gonna set the smoker for two to two and a half hours at 200 degrees and that's what i'm doing here so two hours 23 minutes it's gonna heat up i'll put it in there for two hours at temperature and uh then we'll check it i don't like to overdo anything now what i did do is pre-soak my wood chips so you usually let these wood chips pre-soak for about 15-20 minutes and this is just going to be hickory guys is the smoke flavor so in about 15 minutes i'll put those into my smoker about a half a cup at a time and uh we'll be ready i'm going to take this olive oil spray i'm going to spray my pan put a light coat and i'm also going to spray a little bit on the fillets after that i want to take my ground pepper and just put a light coat of pepper coat it to your liking no right or wrong here i like a little bit more pepper so now i'm gonna go ahead and put my fillets on my pan everything's preheated at this point with the smoker check that out all right so i couldn't show you us pulling the fillets out of the smoker but it's two hours later yes that is the beauty of tv magic so what we got here are two beautiful flays a little dehydrated wouldn't you say what we're going to do is flake off this meat right off the look at this look at that falls right off the skin guys how crazy is that all right let's pull it out make sure there's no bones look at that bone this is all meat right here so i can literally pull any of the bones out and the meat right off the the skin so that's all meat there go over here i'm going to do that to this one here as well this comes right off so just so you all know another thing that you could do and this is a preference thing some people like it some people don't you can remove some of the darker meat and the darker areas this is going to give you more of your fishy taste this recipe uh prefers that you remove it so that's what you see me doing here all right so now i'm just throwing the fish in the bowl here guys it got me a nice clear bowl and while i'm putting it in i'm just double checking triple checking that there's no uh extra bone or trying to remove all the darker meat off of the fish because i prefer it not to be as fishy tasting so we have two eight ounce bars of cream cheese and they've been set out for about an hour at room temperature this is what you're going to want to use let's go ahead and open this up just going to go ahead and put this one in oh yeah look at that and one more eight ounce serving of cream cheese look at that squeeze it out of there like a pastry chef so now i'm going to do two tablespoons of mayonnaise there's your one and there's two now we're gonna do a little squirt of some mustard and that's you know that can be determined based off of your liking of mustard but don't go overboard there now we're gonna do a tablespoon guys of garlic powder so let's go ahead i'm gonna unscrew this one tablespoon and let me tell you garlic powder is delish so there we go i'll go ahead and just pour that in there so good old relish here we're going to do a tablespoon of relish guys all right so now we're going to slice up a nice beautiful piece of lemon here and we're going to hand squeeze that oh yeah it's gonna have a little zesty flavor to it

Its slippery lol I was going to dip it in the sauce right away but give me a minute lol Look at that cheese pull lol It makes the sandwich even better...hahhaa I was actually going to get chicken nuggets as well but wasn't so hungry lol I want to actually finish my food you know? Love ya, see you tomorrow!", "4efr1tcd3SI": "hey there today I'm gonna be making an oven fried chicken tender there's gonna be instead of you know cooking them in and grease we're going to bake them so to make them taste good we're gonna need to marinate them so I just have almost C size do I have here guess this is about yeah doesn't say this is my package of chicken tenders that I got on sale and that's something you can always look for is you know sometimes they'll mark them down because they need to be sold or frozen by a certain date and that's what these were so I save two dollars and six cents so I would say this is probably about 20 ounces of chicken tenders I don't know how many and you hear all that walking around that's my bird in the background being nosy about what I'm doing so anyways to marinate these and you want to marinate them for at least a couple of hours and what I do is I add some Hellmann's olive oil mayonnaise and we're not gonna use all this but we're gonna marinate it in there so just put a big gulp down in there no measuring because you're just gonna eyeball this anyways so I would say that's probably about 3/4 of a cup full and then you want to put a good amount of louisiana-style of hot sauce and depending on how spicy you want them that's how much you're gonna add and I like mine spicy so do my kids and my husband so I'm gonna add a good amount and this is just gonna be the marinade remember and it's gonna help the light breading that we're gonna put on their stick as well so you can start off with I don't know maybe equal parts about 3/4 of a cup the hot sauce you just want to whisk it around you get it all mixed up you don't want to see any clumps candy knock it off no clumps of Manny is in here so just whisk it really good and if you see I have my gloves on if you know me well you know I don't like touching you raw chicken with my hands I don't know not only does it feel funny but it's just easier not to cross contaminate anything we just touched your gloves afterwards so that looks good but I am gonna add just a little more because I want it just a little oranger and I'm also gonna add some fresh cracked black pepper because I really want these to be spicy today's one of those days that I just want some spice in my life so a good amount of black pepper keep mixing and that's all you're gonna add - hello back it off I thought you're gonna add to this for now yeah she's inside because we had the hurricane that never showed up here which I'm not upset about that by the way I'm glad but that's what I'm looking for and I'm gonna add my chicken tenders and break them up they're still slightly frozen so I took them out today but that's okay so say you got three four five six eight eleven twelve tenders which is perfect you want to get them all nice and evenly coated with your marinade here and since they're still slightly frozen not a whole lot and not all of them I'm gonna leave them sitting out I'm gonna cover them with some plastic wrap and I'm just gonna leave them sitting out here on my counter and when I'm ready for the next step I'll be back to show you okay I'm back and my tenders have been marinating for a couple of hours and I'm gonna be making tenders for me and I'm gonna be making tenders for my family so they're gonna be made two different kind of ways which of this is a good video to show for those who are you know going without as many carbs as possible which is me and those who eat as many carbs as they want which is my family so anyways the video earlier I marinated my chicken and this is what it looks like oh nice a marinade and what I'm gonna do first is mine to show you and I'm gonna try to eat two tenders but I don't know if that's gonna work out but anyways all I have is just some grated Parmesan cheese so I'm gonna take a tender and pull it out of the marinade and I'm gonna leave some of that marinade on there toss it around I hope this isn't frame where it's coming out let me take a look really quick okay good so you can see it so I'm gonna flip it around and get it nice and coated with the Parmesan cheese and I'm gonna take it and just place it on a lined baking sheet here just like that fine a small one this is about as small as gonna get here the same thing with this one I doubt I'll be able to heat two of them but I'm gonna try nice and coated with the parmesan and that's it lay it down right next to this one and now for everybody else I have parmesan and panko bread crumbs and I've already mixed them all in so I'm just going to do the same thing get them nice and coated lay them on the pan and that marinade with the hot sauce and the mayonnaise is gonna help them get nice and crispy and they're gonna have a great flavor too I have had this combination before you see the difference in mine and theirs but mine will be just as good without all the carbs I have a little fruit fly flying around that's driving me nuts that's the price you pay for having all these fruit trees in your yard and what I'm doing this at a but the prize get out of here I'm using seasoned fries that I got from Aldi and the whole bag was like I don't know a dollar 39 or something like that on sale which is a great Buy so all together not counting you know the breadcrumbs and all this other stuff it's like $6 for this whole entire meal you know bread crumbs I've had for a while so just stuff I've had around the house anyways well something about the fries is I let those defrost because I'm gonna bake those as well so I let those defrost and they'll cook a whole lot quicker and I've lined a baking sheet just like I did this one for the chicken lined a baking sheet I sprayed a little nonstick cooking spray on there just like I did with this and put the fries on there I'm going to show you you want to make sure that you spread them out I'm going to show you what I've done so these are all breaded and they look good I can tell they're gonna be nice and crispy this little guy would eat them home I'm on there too I take off my clothes you see you still have a whole bunch of this leftover so yeah it looked like you know you've been in a bunch of minis and you know whatever as many's that good for you no it's not but I've done what I could have used olive oil mayonnaise and you know just to get it coated so this is what the chicken tenders look like and they're gonna go in a preheated oven 425 really about 25 minutes or so until they're nice and golden brown flip them once halfway through just to make sure that they're cooking evenly on both sides so I'm gonna put these to the side I'm going to show you what I've done with the fries I've done the same thing and here's another you know it clean up it's gonna be really quick because I've lined both of my pans here so little cooking spray on the bottom and then I'm gonna take a little cooking spray and just go over the top and that's gonna help get them really crispy and in the oven and we're not deep frying so we're cutting the fat here so we're still gonna have nice crunchy french fries chicken tenders no frying whatsoever so I'll show you pictures when we're done and I hope you try it and tell me what you think you", "sz3AnDvN8sI": "Preview No hand challenge with pasta too, yes!!

one better Chris let's make billionaires bourbon bacon for our recipe we have some beautiful bacon that we're going to slice up let me slice up the pellicle first and then we'll start slicing our bacon the reason that I bought a hole cut of bacon is that I get the opportunity to slice the bacon as thick or as thin as I want it to be in Europe most bacon is more thin than in America so what we'll try and do is slice it ourselves just a little bit thicker then you would otherwise buy in the supermarket now it's time to create the sauce that we'll be brushing on during cooking the bacon so I got here half a cup of brown sugar a little bit of mr. Lee Perkins his Worcestershire sauce there we go that's about two teaspoons it's just for a little bit of extra flavor don't put too much in there because it's very salty and the bacon itself is already salty we'll add about two tablespoons of maple syrup and we'll add about a quarter cup of bourbon mix that up and we're ready to put on the bacon we are creating this recipe on the Napoleon rogue I turned on the left and the right burner I have the center burner off and this is where we'll be putting our bacon we really want it to be indirect so the bacon gets a chance to render off all that beautiful fat and crisping up we've set the napoleon rogue to grill over indirect heat and around 180 degrees Celsius which is 360 degrees Fahrenheit when the bacon starts crisping up that's the time where we want to start brushing on us it's been around 20 minutes and the bacon is starting to crisping up nicely so we'll turn it around and start brushing on our sugar and bourbon you can really start to smell the bacon now so we'll try and brush on as much sugar which hasn't dissolved yet as we can we really want to dry up and stick to the bacon so in the end it will caramelize and we'll make your bacon even crispier and sweeter so we'll close the lid on the bacon and we will continue to let it crisp it up [Music] I'm breasts of baking for around three time it's been half an hour now Wow look how nicely the bacon crisp and up caramelized you can even see the sugar getting sticky right so it's transfer the bacon on a cooling rack so let's do a quick taste test on the billionaire's bourbon bacon Wow super sweet salty this stuff will go great with a beer mmm but what if we use it to create a billionaires bourbon BLT that sounds good right so I got a nice rustic bread here well slice that up those are beautiful slices of bread well drizzle a little bit of olive oil on them put them back on the grill I start grilling them direct until they are nice and toasted we'll need a couple of slices of tomato to create a BLT we've got this nice crust a toast or put a good amount of mayonnaise on it there we go beautiful leaves of lettuce now we'll do the same for the other side big gulp of mayonnaise with slices of tomato and then we'll put on our billionaire's bourbon bacon gorgeous let's flip the lettuce upside down and there we go the billionaire's bourbon BLT that doesn't get any better than that [Music] thank you Chris for requesting this video recipe I had fun making it i enjoying the sandwich I hope you guys like the recipe that I created with it give me a big thumbs up and leave me coming down below if you have a great recipe for me please let me know I'll give it a try and time to finish this one see you guys Cheers [Music] you", "-MbvhTMXWX4": "Airness always thank you guys for watching commenting subscribing and being part of the Jobu sports support and keto cooking channel I guess I ended up doing a video earlier where I prepped what I'm doing because a lot of times I'll come out and I'll just start cooking this up and you guys don't know what I necessarily did to get to this point so when I did the marinating I got the beep flap steak look at this look at look at that okay I ended up taking this is about two and a half pounds of meat I ended up putting the seasoning and stuff on here so you can follow how to do it instead of just like buying packets of kiaba fajita seasoning I kind of made my own so it's like cumin its chili powder its onion powder its garlic powder pepper salt Worcestershire sauce olive oil and so on so if you watch that video you can see exactly what I did and I did that about oh maybe about three three two hours ago so that way the meat well absorbed all that goodness in there and I've got some peppers I've got some hot peppers exercising that I grew some onions in here so we're gonna grill this stuff with some butter and we're gonna basically make like I do with my shrimp ball just gonna do meat fajita Bowl so it's gonna be a little bit of lettuce on the bottom some cheddar cheese some of the picante I got some tomatoes from my tomato plants over here so I've got that and we'll end up putting the meat on it so it's kind of a steak salad or if you go to Chipotle they'd be like a steak bowl so that's what we're gonna go ahead and do and I'm gonna go ahead and get me out about 2/3 of a stick of butter on here and start melting that before the peppers and onions and then slap the take home does well we like steak grab some olive oil got our good old boy so when I get that stuff going how's everybody doing I am happy as can be because it's Monday which means I got my livestream tonight and we got a lot of stuff to talk about between Zeke Elliott being butthurt Jerry Jones Sam Lee who fans saying the hell with thee that's the the great thing about doing this this meat does not take long to cook this is gonna be a short video and you know I like it rare and flavorful hey oh that's not nice oh that smells nice I'm gonna get our peppers and onions on here clear I know one thing it's hot out here man and I think it's more humid now so I'm gonna turn that because let it get real good and hot and I'm gonna get some salt and pepper to put on that so we got all kinds of stuff going on with our Dallas Cowboys we still don't have a contract for deck what's up from Arkansas how you doing k9 Cowboys dinner we're having feet of Bowl so we're doing some flanks a flap steak and we've got some peppers and onions we're gonna put that in a bowl with some guacamole some sour cream some cheese and picante sauce and it's gonna be really really filling and it's gonna be very very flavorful so we could you can look and see what we got here put some salt and pepper on No it's hot out here seek is not even close to the same as those guys happy Monday fajitas time oh I've always put my foot in my man you know I listen I love to cook and I love to eat so two things that go together real well let me clean this out real quick all right so you guys know I'm about saving money okay one of the things you can do is late in the season for stuff seasonal see last year I got my smoker boot now all of you guys that don't like propane turn away turn away don't listen okay but I got my propane smoker which has a thermostat in it that keeps it exactly at whatever temperature set up it goes up to 375 but if you want to keep it at 150 it will stay exactly at 150 out of here whatever your wife says the keto diet is bad for me screw her I believe in you mark okay well let's listen a little lane I guess that I'm I'm new to it I started in November and you guys can judge for yourself if I end up having a heart attack you know a month or two down the road we can say it was the keto diet but I gotta say let me move the camera back a little bit here some of those pants that I couldn't fit in I can in this belt this belt is four notches tighter than it was before four notches okay so I guess said I know that having 30-plus pounds more weight that was not good for my heart so you know though it is they it's up don't want Firma me here's what's funny I have people I have people who are at McDonald's eaten dinner saying I hear cute Oh diet ain't good for you now here's what also tell you Chuck my mother like none other and my father my mother was a country girl my mother when I was a kid we used to have chickens in the backyard chicken no joke we'd have chicken eggs and not only that my mom would actually chop the chicken's head off and would pick the feathers off and we have fresh chicken I remember a couple of times we'd have a half hog that she would butcher up a son okay and still today my dad just turned 80 years old 80 let me say that 80 they garden he starts off at about February starts growing his plants and everything else puts them all out and everything right my mother cans everything probably right now as hot as it is should probably have like you know thirty quarts of tomatoes that she's can okay they gardening I'm not talking about just a little teeny garden I'm talking about a big-ass garden okay and they grow everything my mom cans everything she cooks every single day you go down in their basement they got peach preserves - peach brandy down in there okay you've got you know green tomatoes and yellow tomatoes and red tomatoes she's got homemade spaghetti sauce and everything up she's got chest freezers plural more than one where she's growing lima beans as I put it in there right let me say again he's 80 she's 78 she decorates the house she gets out a 26 foot ladder and she climbs up and puts lights all around the house the two garages and the whole neighborhood at 80 my dad's been in the hospital once my mother has only been in the hospital to have us kids and what they eat is good meat and a lot of it and I look at them and say I hope when I get to be 80 that I'm still here much less going through and doing the things that they do what I'm gonna tell you is bad for you this all the that we eat that we claim a spook seriously when Taco Bell makes fake pepper oh you got a and nobody knows what the ingredients were why you got to make a pepper why subway was putting in a binder in for the bread that they use for mats that shit's bad okay so you can see over here let take a look here look at it whoo look at that we'll take our check that temperature cuz you know I like my stuff burn I like it about 135 to 140 because that's where it's medium rare is kind of a hot red center I am that was definitely good all right now the thing about this grill is it's really really hot in the front not so much in the back because all the burners are tied in with like one burner that crosses to each one of them okay so how you buy things can save you money so I've been eyeing this it's called that's uh that's one of the griddles I know you guys have seen the big outdoor grills you go to Home Depot you see those things right there about 250 $300 350 or so right and it's a big griddle so you thinking you cook pancakes you can cut burgers on there and stuff but you know it's still a grill I mean a griddle which is great but if you go to Dick's Sporting Goods they have one that's a can't cheap this piece right here this is a camp chief double burner stove and I actually have riddles to it but the problem with it is it has a circular burner on it and it has a bad hot zone on it in the middle and it's cold on the outside it'll work just not real well all right the camp chief one it's 32 by 19 that's a lot of burgers you can put on them but it's different than the other ones because the cast iron top comes off of it and basically you have 4-h burners that are in there and regular griddles so here's my thickened for the tailgate because it's a one o'clock game I'm gonna do is we're gonna show up have the grill there first right hey we can cook bacon eggs pancakes and all that stuff on there for breakfast and then we can start cooking Jobu wings and have black and blue burgers for lunch so we can make it an all-day event so it's breakfast it's lunch and all now here's the thing that one is 350 dollars right now if you go to Dick's Sporting Goods you go online it's like 350 to 400 plus the delivery because it's heavy but BJ's where I shop would actually do a lot of my grocery shopping too because it's the end of the season they don't want to keep this through the winter they have more clearance for 249 bang so if you're doing if I have a happen to have a party that's a breakfast party it's gonna sit right here okay but I'm also gonna have it for the tailgate so that'll be another piece of equipment that I'm gonna buy that will cost be reasonable and so that's where I save $200 so I got my smoker last year cuz I bought it in September so this is the time of year like if you want shorts go buy short snap dirt cheap oh that's uh cicadas that buzzing it's cicadas I can hear them there yeah it cicadas alright they go take a look at that look at that look it oh we slice this up real nice put it on the peppers with the cheese and stuff on here oh man come on look at that I almost lost it let's take a small piece here and what we'll pull it apart look at mmm you want to cut it across the grain mm-hmm wife is being an official taste tester hey how is it my wife says it's best off the grill so let me ask you while you're standing there have you ever had any problem with me cooking the propane do you miss the charcoal taste to it I guess all right so that's it that's it guys I'm gonna slice some of this make my stick move and then I'm gonna get set up for my livestream coming up 9 o'clock so you guys take a look real quick let me grab a knife grab my knife here so we can actually take a closer look at this I love my outdoor kitchens I'll tell you guys look at this look at this yeah now what you want to do with this lap steak is always cut it across the grain if you cut it with the grain it's gonna be stringy and it's gonna be tough this isn't the best knife in here Mike oh look at that Oh junebug look at that man tell me that's not pretty look at Oh the lish that's what I'm talking about now here's what's funny each of the blue was mad at me cuz you remember I was talking to e to blue about steak right because he said he likes a steak well-done and I did a video I'm not worried about Z she could big boy and I did a video showing him how to cook steak I saw him today he was like damn it mark I said one bring some steaks over he said I followed your recipe and stuff with some New York strip steaks the other night he's like they're delicious  you you had to be right didn't you it's like yeah I do [Music] $5.99 a pound for that flap stick and I'm gonna tell you this hmm that's better than what you can get it to take out or a lot of places now what you can do with this is it doesn't have to be for foetus you get in a billing as tacos now again the problem with tacos is you can't use corn tortillas or flour tortillas and that's why I do it as a bowl you can chop it up make it a steak salad or you can just eat it just like this or you could do that same seasoning on that for doing shish kebabs so this is where and this is what's good for me is I'm learning to go ahead and cook multiple things at the same time this is more than what we need for dinner because really what you're doing a keto diet you're really only eating about 4 ounces what we're supposed to eat unfortunately what's happened with the American diet is people are over eating we're used to eating now huge portions and it's part of the reasons why we're fast see what I grew up I remember when you've talked about getting a quarter pound it was like dude you go get a quarter pounder burger that's a quarter pound of meat man that's a lot of meat there and now you got triple quarter pounders that's where proportions have just changed and blown up we used to check this out big gulps before practice in a school then we'd have an hour of full football practice we've walked down the set eleven and we get a big gulp and the big gulp was 32 ounces and it was just like damn man I'm getting the big gulp it was like damn dude you get the big gulp you gonna be able to drink all that maybe we should share that big go and now it's like 64 ounce big gulp and that's one of the reasons why people are having the problems that they're having we're eating to the point of just being gutted so the people who are saying that I hear that keto diet is not good for you well I don't know how many regular eating and regular places we eat are actually good for us most stuff we get is crap I can say at least this much I will eat this and be happy with lose thirty forty fifty pounds and take my chances and then keeping the weight on in eating garbage how about that all right y'all I'm done I'm gonna go in here and slice some of this steak and make a nice keto Bowl so remember once you get this done if you wanna have the true keto Bowl go ahead and put a little bit of lettuce you know you don't to put a whole lot I like putting a little blue cheese on it and then I'll put some cheddar cheese I'll put some guacamole I'll put picante sauce fresh made homemade and it's real simple to make you've seen me doing another one some of the

legit fire can't believe I forgot to get a Mcflury \ud83d\ude2d see you next episode guys \u2764\ufe0f", "LYyY4mYUIsQ": "hey this is Tony here with salt strong and in this video I want to answer a quick question as to whether or not you can use procure gel with gulp products or gulp baits and the answer is actually no what I found is that when you're using these procure gels they are a gel they're kind of oil-based and if you know anything about the gulp products or water-based water and oil don't mix they separate themselves so when you go to put this gel onto a gulp product what's going to happen is it'll go on there but then when you go to cast it it may fall off or as you're retrieving the lure in the water this gel will actually fall off of the lure because these are water-based products now when you have your other lures at our oil base such as z-man or do a or Slayer or any of those other products the gel sticks very well to them and I'm going to go ahead and show you right here a demonstration where I put some procure gel on one of these oil-based lures bounce it around in the water and you're gonna notice that gel stays on there as opposed to when I put it on a go product it almost comes off immediately floats up to the surface and falls off the lure so let me go ahead and show you that real quick so just to visually show you how the procurer stays on these oil-based lures such as these paddle tails this is a slayer SST i'm going to show you how well it stays on these and how it will actually fall right off of the gulp products so first let me show you the paddle tail just going to take some procure smear it on to the side of the lure you can see you have it smeared on right there and then I'm going to just put it into this little thing of water here and a jiggle it around it a few times and as you can see the pro cure is still on the lure you can see that brownish color on there that is the procure just to do it again I can show you there's nothing coming off into the water it's not falling off the lure so again you can see that procure is still on the lure so now let me go ahead and show you with the gulp product this is a gulp shrimp I'm just gonna put it on this jig head just like I had that paddle tail lure on there like so there we go and I'm just going to squeeze some procure onto it as you can see it's already wanting to fall off there it's not really going on - well I do like so same thing I'm just going to bounce it around in the water here and you'll notice if you can see that it's actually starting to fall off the lure and there it goes just fell off right there now there is some stuck to the hook as you can see at all it all pretty much went to the hook and stuck to the hook right there and there's also some of the water here that's floating around so if it didn't catch that hook it would have just fallen right off as you can see there so let's do one more test with the gulp just going to wipe all the procure off that's left on there it's all on the hook that's the only place that seems to have stuck too so let's try that again it's going to dab some procure on there you can see I have the procure right there going to bounce it around in the water and it just came off right there you can see there's no more procure on that gulp shrimp so it doesn't hold on to these gold products very well so as you can see procure gel and gulp pretty much don't mix you have a gel or an oil trying to mix with something that's water-based and again water oil gel they don't mix together they're gonna separate themselves now gold products have pretty much enough scent already in them because they do absorb the liquid that they're sitting in and they slowly disperse that liquid as they're in the water and you're fishing with them so you don't really need any type of additional scent with the gold products but again procure works very well when you are using those oil-based products or pretty much any other lure aside from gulp or fish bites or any of those baits that absorb the liquid that they're sitting in now I am curious as to whether or not there has been anybody out there that has used procure on their gold products and had any success so definitely leave those comments down below if you have any experience with that also if you have any questions or comments please leave them down below until then thanks for watching this video and I'll see you on the next one [Music] [Music]", "cuzmZsrKVmg": "hey how ya doin is sick girl get lady ykl a diamond and welcome welcome to my

it and no um sifu boy yo enchiladas i'll calls I'll wait cuz when I told my family they was like what wait who I don't think so but yes see some go up into roles and I can't wait I think it sound you mean me come and let me know how it's time you seafood boil enchiladas and that's what I'm making yes yes yeah I have all the ingredients here this is my first time ever making seafood boy inch lines I have made enchiladas before many times one of my favorite foods my family favorite food so it is what a deal so let's get to it um first I I have all the ingredients here and as you know as I use the ingredients I'll let you know what I have but we gotta get this little thing warmed up make it warm huh so I have crab meat crab meat corn sausages sausages have to be cooked and um what's this shrimps and the beloved our yes baby but you love something I have other stuff but fresh should I start off with the salt and you know getting the meat cook and give the peels and all like that so what I'm gonna do by this is heating up we don't take this top off so we don't eat that time while this heating up I'm going to go ahead and cut the stuff up now everything has already cut deschanel whatever but I'm gonna take you through the steps of how I'm doing it so this is some sausages which we going to go ahead and add cuz that's already cut up wait am i forgot y'all forgot so I was gonna say like when I said I forgot let poor man let me put on my foot BAM so we don't use cuz then I keep these in the in the song which is called in ass ain't nobody ain't using these but me so we got the small me many lovely me me knife so I'm gonna get the cut cut the sausage up like this it was all kind of in bite-size well I guess smaller than by fire I cut them in four words each slices I cut them in four remember these are inter latter you don't want no chunky mean unless you want it you can have it that's your preference so we just cut them in four sliced it and cut it for it so I'm gonna add that get that to cooking remember how this leaders already cooked everything I've already cooked without do the shrimp I had already cut some strips but I want to show you guys set up and we just too deep some jumbo shrimp style we just cut up like your small consider fight back but [Music] balls like this okay cool either you can use corn oil call that point on the car or you can use canned corn but you want it to be separate on the console of the people boys people boy here for going on go so you just cut it off the car like this oh we got seized me and that's it throw the other way you don't need them users once the corn cook and they're gonna be stuck like this but you just pull it up or or you can just wait till you're ready to cook it and it will follow the car which is corn is already cooked I'm gonna get some [Applause] [Music] next week going to now me I had snow crabs already and I'm just going to take the meat now I'm gonna be Shelia I already have some already here detail out you look at time you show up pull it out with um a chuck that meet up pull that meat up pull that me down make sure you just get the meat nothing um I don't know these things here they're holding me together I guess they send the pieces get all that meat down yep meat this is just like IUD shelling it that down and you pull it out now these big pieces of meat you want to kind of chop that up you want to chop that up don't you want sizes if you want to use that crab meat that you are ready then already come like chopped up there's stuff like that which i think is imitation crab I don't know yeah that's it let's chop these up no particular way just good enough we can get into it we dread do this build an enchilada just like that side now you know this kind of imitation crab and just the real deal baby okay now we're gonna add the shrimp go ahead nap the shrimp like that the cooking turn that five back up so everything was about a pound of meat a pound of sausages the packed breakfast that a pounds of sausages a pound of shrimps a little more pounds shrimp isn't some jungle struck a pound of crab meat kind of cool for us to cook we want that to get the cooking okay next we're going to add the corn and like I said it's gonna break apart they're gonna break apart when you cook it or worn without the food is already cook some point now to break that cool one up you don't have to be broke I mean if you feel together you don't have to break it all up but you know Remy's everything gotta be kinda like the same size not perfect but the same size [Applause] that's better good now we're gonna add the crown meat lay that that crab meat real crab meat setting is baby now as you saw on an ad not know what no same thing I don't have no season you'll put some chili powder and taco season I think I might not add no chili powder because y'all know this be love songs got a lot of wood season so you don't need no extra season stare down so they're gonna ask you I don't know how much let's start off with I half a bag which probably above well try to like a cup let that go bad so let's say about two cups of B blocks all the sauce once we mix it up because I made a big bowl and I packaged them like this uh-oh maybe getting lose no fooling around here oh we got it okay next we're going to add what some tomato sauce just your regular tomato this is tomato paste sauce right about a cup a cup full and that's the main size of loop you're gonna do some taco seasoning now I was meant to have some um enchilada season like they sell enchilada season I thought I picked up a package but I didn't so I'm gonna use a package of choco sauce because we want to give it that you know that Mexican flavor and we're gonna mix that all up baby yeah it smells so good in here so yummy well get me firm economy yummy for my tummy see fool boy yo yo yo yo yo now I'm gonna keep the can of tomato sauce because I probably want to add more but I don't think so I think there's a perfect consistency that I want so don't let this cook for about right like simmer for like about five minutes just to get everything incorporated with the cooking and the heat in and it's infused in the corn the lobster I mean no I don't have the lobster the corn the crop the corn the snow crap to move to the cocktails they ain't making a homemade tortilla just about store-bought tortillas we're gonna move that over there why that's doing this simmering and then we're gonna get this heated up because what I'm gonna do is warm up the tortillas you have to want to talk to you because if you don't and you need them warm because you need them flexible and that's what the warming part does because it's not it will crack or the eve not cranking but sometimes it will crack it head so you're just gonna warm them up a little just throw them on there that's all you have to do just throw it on your grill if you don't have a real sometimes I actually in your life warm oil and bring it out but you just want to kind of warm you don't want to cook them just kind of woman if you have like a steamer - uh with a little tortilla steamer that's even good so we're gonna turn this off for that done turn your um your meat off you gonna turn that off let me show you how it look yeah good smell good it's been like a mixture of seafood and enchilada so we gonna sit that to the side it's not funky on me and like I said we're just gonna warm these up probably like a minute on each side or a little less than a minute because you just want to warm don't want to get them all crunchy or cool I'll pull this off now yeah when I make it to Lana so I don't know I I just be in here cooking no pull these off I don't know how many liked or two I need I gotta get it close but all the time a few left you prefer few of them left over then you don't have enough but that's how I'm kind of like with Tom when I make a little sign guys cook their lasagna pasta in a house yeah well those are my vows so much of that milk because I'm really not trying to estimate like what the pan of how many I need how many never make but maybe that's all it always comes out or wrong but let us say you always want more you prefer more than trying to go back and cook some extra you prefer to have extra so let us let that steam and then see how flexible that is uh see that's ready to roll baby we're gonna do a couple of more tutorials get them ready then we can render the what we can render a role drop and roll but what they say well drop Rolling Rock drop rolling round drop rolling round we're gonna get rid of the stuff of Rome and bacon baby bake it in the hood okay what so we can have thee oh yeah and the throw me okay so we have the the seafood boil we have the tortillas and we have I have mozzarella cheese and I have a little short chiller I'm gonna sprinkle this on the the outside the top a little just a little mozzarella cheese just a little and a little the feeling oh that's my mother I'm always over stuffing and we're going to just roll it that's it I'm the cheese go online and just spend behind you like it I'm always over stuck in mine oh yeah look at them shrimps get some corn get some shrubs get some sausage yeah my family was like sleeping boy that's a lot of oh yes baby I don't like it look at this that's a shrimp young right you know we're like that spicy but it's even good yeah I'm gonna be a lot of this stuff yeah I probably I have to make two pants so grown it we're gonna do one more one more yeah cheese in the middle and the seafood boil sit it down to one side to the other because mine's it's bleep stuff and push it to one each other so I'm gonna speed this process up you guys and once when I finish um filling the pan out with the road of stuffed interline I'm gonna show you how I'm gonna top it off and we don't put it in the oven so I'll be back okay wait a minute let me show you how closed up before I'm due done let me show you how close up so we got the cheese and we got the pop put one right here like in the angle to fill this little corner cuz we wanna fill it up baby okay so after that we want trying to just get the sauce which I should have strain but hey it is what it is get the sauce and kind of spread it around yo yo yo yo yo yo yo and just get them okay now remember the can of tomato sauce I had leftover we gonna pour that on top start around the edges so all around the edges and then down - down with put it on sprinkle the trial cheese the trip cheat the chapel cheese baby nothing like shadow cheese honey I like how the cheese and some mozzarella bitumen thriller okay yeah there you go that's high look we're gonna put it into the oven for about on 375 for 10 minutes 10 to 15 minutes cuz what you want to do everything is cook you want that cheese the milk that's it okay so you want to melt and get kind of like look how's things on the edges and stuff and that's it we're gonna put another I'll see you in

Now we're going to add some\nfreshly charped, chopped, not charped, chopped garlic. I mean, it's an Italian dish, so\nwe got to have some garlic in there. >> [LAUGH]\n>> This is three large cloves of garlic, it's absolutely,\nalready smelling heavenly. >> I'm ready for you. >> This was three cloves,\ndid I say that, I did say that, okay. >> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] >> So now, we are going to add some\nother classic ingredients. Of course, basil, garlic,\nbasil, it's Italian. >> [LAUGH] Yeah. >> So we've got, that is a quarter cup\nof fresh basil that I've chopped, and then I've got three tablespoons of\nfresh parsley that I've chopped. And now this, this is red pepper flakes. If you like things really spicy, you can\nincrease the amount of pepper flakes. If you don't like it too spicy,\nyou can decrease it. >> Throw some in there. We like it spicy. >> I go anywhere like about a quarter. It does really increase the heat, though. So, but I do about a-\n>> But it also increases the flavor. >> It does increase [LAUGH] the flavor,\nI totally agree with that. >> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, now we're going to get to the really\nexciting part of this Penne Alla Vodka. >> Yay.\n>> We're getting to the vodka. >> My pyro side is coming out. >> So if there is one thing that Wesley\nknows how to do, it's how to flame. >> [LAUGH]. >> He was born flaming. >> I know how to light a fire. >> [LAUGH] That's a good way of saying it. >> Thank you.\n>> So what we're going to do, let me get my,\n>> [LAUGH] >> Trusty hot plates. Now you want to do this off of the flame. >> [LAUGH] Yes. >> When you're flaming with the flame. >> [LAUGH]\n>> You don't want to, you do have to be- >> All right, they get the point. [LAUGH]\n>> You do need to be careful with this, I know, you get it. Okay, so\nI'm just going to bring this over here. Of course,\n>> Yes. >> You could do this on your stove, but it's much more fun to-\n>> Yes. >> So we're going to add now,\nback, kind of do this carefully. And that's a quarter cup of vodka,\nso it's probably not, so sometimes if your skillet is really hot,\n>> There we go. >> If your skillet is, yeah. >> Yes.\n>> If your skillet's really hot, it may flame in the minute\nit hits the skillet. >> Love it. >> This technique is called flambe,\nobviously. It's just the signature, I think,\ntaste that it gives this dish. >> Yes. >> Is it just,\n>> It burns it off that vodka. >> That flambe burns and,\nobviously, the alcohol burns out. >> And it gives it a nice, just, yeah. >> It gives that, it enhances the flavor\nof those herbs that are in there. >> Mm-hm. >> And it is so much fun to watch. >> It is.\n[LAUGH] >> We're flaming here, though. >> I'm so cold. >> [LAUGH] Let's all\ngather around the skillet. >> [LAUGH]\n>> So, you're going to let that flame, >> Burn out. >> Burn out and then we're going to\nreturn it to the stove in just a moment. >> Yeah, well, I can't burn out. This one can burn out. [LAUGH]\n>> No, no, that's one flame that will never burn out. [SOUND] The flame's gone. >> The flame is gone. >> Okay, but the party continues. >> Yes.\n[LAUGH] >> So, now we're going to return it back to the heat. >> Yeah.\n>> And what we are going to do is we have, this is what really makes\nPenne Alla Vodka spectacular. >> Yeah. >> This is our homemade marinara sauce,\nso I've got four cups here. And what I'm going to do is,\nI'm going to bring that to a simmer. And it's going to simmer-\n>> That- >> For about five to six minutes, so while-\n>> That marinara's so good, y'all. >> Let us show you how to make the best marinara-\n>> Yay. >> In the world.\nYes. [SOUND]\n>> Starts off with San Marzano tomatoes from Italy. You gotta make sure they're certified. >> Certified.\n>> They are the best. I get a colander and I put it over large\nbowl, and then I dump three 28 ounce cans into that colander and I let that liquid,\n>> Drain, mm-hm. >> Just drain out for about five minutes. Then I'm going to heat up a quarter\ncup of olive oil over medium heat, and then I'm going to take some garlic,\nabout a quarter cup. That seems like a lot,\nbut that's what you want. >> [LAUGH]\n>> And you're going to put that in there, and let that simmer and saute for about five minutes until\nit gets a golden, golden brown. Then I add in some parsley,\nI add in some basil. >> The basil.\n>> And then I'm going to take some kosher salt,\njust because I love kosher salt, it's so good. And then I take some freshly\nground black pepper, and then let that simmer and\nyou will not believe the smell. Then I take those tomatoes,\n>> You get messy. >> And I crush them with my own hands,\nthat's the way to do it. >> [LAUGH]\n>> And you put those all in there and then you let those simmer until\nthey really start to break down. And then after about 15, 20 minutes,\n>> The rest of the tomato sauce. >> You put in the tomato sauce, yes. And then let that simmer for\nanother on high for about 12 minutes and you will not believe\nthe smell in your kitchen. >> And then you let it come\nto room temperature and, >> I'm dying. >> Look at that gorgeous,\ngorgeous marinara. [SOUND]\n>> So isn't that the most amazing\nmarinara you've got? >> [LAUGH] That is the best sauce. >> So\nI'm telling you this dish is spectacular, really because of that marinara. >> It is.\n[LAUGH] >> And you should make the marinara ahead of time,\nI make it in like quadruple batches, because i'm using it all the time. >> So good.\n>> So anyway, this has now been simmering. And another thing,\nI sometimes get, people ask, people ask all kinds of questions,\nwhich is great. But someone has asked me, well, why do\nyou already saute parsley and, what, basil and\nonion if that's already in your marinara? Well, it's because, like we did,\nwe did the flambe and that, it all works together and yes,\nit's also in the marinara. But it's just the way-\n>> It's just you need a oopmh. >> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH] >> It's good to do it separately, anyway. Okay.\n>> [LAUGH] >> So now I have got some heavy cream because this is what you call\na traditional pink sauce. And this cream is what's going to make it-\n>> Make it pink. >> Pinkish, we love Pink, anyway-\n>> [LAUGH] >> She's so good. >> She's great. [LAUGH]\n>> If she was here, she would be loving this, I'm sure. >> She'd be like,\nall over this pink sauce. >> And she'd probably love it because,\nI have a feeling that she's vegetarian. >> [LAUGH] Yeah. >> I don't know, I just think,\nI mean, with a body like that. But anyway,\n>> Who knows? >> This is vegetarian. Now, I also love Penne Alla Vodka\nthat has a little prosciutto in it. You could cook that in when\nyou're cooking onions. >> Yeah, that'd be good. >> That's really good, too. But this is,\n>> This, yeah. >> Pure delicious. All right, so I'm going to let this come\nto a boil and it's just going to cook for about three minutes. Meanwhile, I've got a pot of penne. >> That's getting ready to come out.\n>> 16 ounces of penne pasta and let it boil until it just becomes about\nal dente and that's about 11 minutes. And then we're going to add it to the pot,\nwe're going to add some cheese, >> Yay. >> And then we're going to eat. >> Yes. [SOUND]\n>> It is good, it is done. >> The smell, I mean, it smells like\nan Italian restaurant in your own home. >> Yes.\n>> Okay, so now I have, like I said, I've cooked my pasta, it's perfect. I am now just going to,\nyou're going to want to drain it. Either do that over your skillet,\n>> [LAUGH] >> I mean, over your sink. >> [LAUGH] You kind of\ndisappeared into the- >> Sorry, I had to do my pasta. >> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, we're getting down to the crunch time now. Well, no, we're almost ready to finish. So now, the finishing touch is I've\ngot a half a cup of Romano cheese. You can also use Parmesan,\nbut I just love this. >> I'm so excited, I am so excited. [LAUGH]\n>> The smell is absolutely heavenly. Okay, so let's take this. >> I'm like a child over here. >> I know, I know. [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I don't have anything to do over here. >> Sit tight, Loon, it's almost ready. Now we're going to add, I know, he's\njust like, I don't have anything to do. >> You've given me nothing do today. >> Except to eat. >> Except to eat and light things on fire. [LAUGH]\n>> I just like to leave it to the what you know best. >> I flame and eat. >> Flame and eat. >> [LAUGH]\n>> He's a flaming eater. >> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, now we're just going to, >> Kills me, kills me.

[LAUGH]\n>> Well, I'll see you all later. [LAUGH]\n>> I just love it, like I said- >> Can you all see that? Yes, it looks so good. >> This has always been one\nof my favorites, you love it, I absolutely love it. >> I don't really need it in a dish. >> I mean nine times out of ten,\n>> All right, you can [LAUGH] >> Gosh, Wesley, we're just going to- >> [LAUGH] I could just fork it. >> Well, I know you could fork it. That is beautiful. Okay, I'm telling you, you serve that, >> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay. >> [LAUGH] Here,\ndo you have your little thing again? >> Yes, hold that. >> Okay, [LAUGH] get your little things. >> I've got my little things, okay. >> And I'll move this, too.

"gMUbZMdDRCo": "hello everyone welcome back to the video electronic in this video we will discuss on Medtronic scope installation for version 6.0 point 8 and above so let's get started first thing you do is purchase and animatronic and you can do that by going to team-first on that and then go to HTML and you find Medtronic right here and once you are Medtronic you can like rear it or just purchase it and when you've purchased Medtronic you will look something like this you'll be downloading the Medtronic zip file and once you unzip it you will be welcomed with three folders design doc and theme InDesign you have the PSD and sketch files where you can just look at find our designs in Photoshop and sketch our official documentation folder and our theme which has angular classic and default versions the angular is quite self-explanatory is basically it is metric using the angular framework and then classic and default which are similar but for classic you do not have any built tools and in the default package you will have built tools built into it we currently have two built tools which is go and web pack but for this video we'll be talking on what sorry we'll be talking about gulping solution so before we hit further let's look into our docks and open our documentation which is the docks dot HTML once you once you opened it the doctor HTML you'll be greeted with the Quick Start which is very simple nine steps of how to basically kickstart or startup Medtronic using go and in here you also have another section here called built tools and if you look at gulp you see Morton full-on gum we will get to that shortly so first what we need to do is we need to purchase download the little steam sauce from the marketplace which will be eaten first and if you haven't already download and installed jess nodejs you have a Windows and Mac installer so just pick one so low that suits your machine and go from there once you've done is holding not yes we can then move on to installing NPM yarn and go now let's look at our theme and default and once you go to the default package we seem to have different demos for now you'll be adding new demos in the future but we have Chiappa now and HTML is basically an individual project by itself therefore if you need like if you need to use them one or demo two or some seven dollars for your projects you do not need to refer to any other folders you just have to go into the specific demo folder and everything be in there so in order to like to select your demo you can just go into our main website which is Keene themes that comes - Medtronic or you can just go to our operational documentation here and go to index and you see the latest versions of all our Medtronic demos so here give them a one two three all the way to level 12 and 13 and 14 is coming soon so once you select the one one memory you want you can just drill into the demo folder you want and you'll find the sauce and tools so if you look at our QuickStart documentation we will need to navigate to the tools folder within the specific demo that you want to use so in this example we will go with demo one so once we and then one go to the tools folder and then we need to basically type in CMD to open up the command prompt with the path if you're using Mac's you just open up your terminal and then navigate to this path and what you need to do now is we need to install NPM here it is install yarn and we need to install go however if you already have NPM VR and got installed in a machine you don't really need to do this but it's always good to keep your versions up to date so to do that you can she run NPM - - version or yarn - - version similarly gulp you can check the version to see if your update if you are upgrading Medtronic from an older version we also highly recommend you to run an upgrade to make sure that your yarn updates all your decoder to paly dependencies and in this clip everything is stable okay since I've already have NPM yarn and gum installed my machine I'm gonna skip those steps but what I'm gonna do now is I'm just gonna run yarn to basically install all our third-party dependencies okay our yarn is done the next thing we need to do is we need to run gum build but this does they will just build the demo demo of the folder that we are in so in this example you will be installing demo one stem of rocks so if you go to number one and keep this portal open and we run got build you see this folder up here in this folder okay we're done building our demo as you can see this photo appears and if you go into it you see all of my drawings demo is fast we have the assets here on the CSS J's via plugins they're all here and in the other Buddhist we have with our components HTML files our crud or custom files everything will be neatly organized and arranged it in its own specific folder so in order to preview this you can just double click on the index.html to open up in a browser and that's pretty much it you have Medtronic demo1 working on your computer so you have to do here is just to see any other any elements that you would like to have in your project and then look at the file and then put it into your project now this is an example of how you can use demo one for your project but let's say if you want to have a like you wants to use them or tree for example of your project to do that is basically do the exact same steps you go to symmetry you know tools you find the exact same cup cup Falls anything that it's not been CMV you'll run yarn to install dependencies and once yarn is done you run golf built to build the demo Wow or the demo folders and that's pretty much it you will have Medtronic working Medtronic demo files working on your machine right off the bat however this is not the end of this video we have we've got installation we have a lot of configurations or customizations that you can use to make Medtronic even better for your project if you go back to our documentation you go to a bill to single to go and in here you see a bill conflict and each demo with in Medtronic will have its own individual cup config file so let's have a look in our IDE here let's go to default okay then one we go tools and you go to go don't convict on JSON you see Medtronic a config file config file for them or one similarly if you go to like an add another demo for example let's look at demo seven there's also a tools folder and also another cup conflict or JSON and here you might see that it's similar like that the configurations here is all similar but there may be some minor differences between each demo for example of course the plugins may be similar like HTML will have similar plugins that we use that will be used but the styles the GS layout the GS files for each demo will be slightly different because the source for each demo will come from his own demo folder so for example source for the sass files here in demo 7 like this solid sauce and in demo one go the SS single sauce and go to stall the sauce so as you can see it's similar but with the moments we see the content within like in the config or in the layouts or even the number of includes like they might want to have a different number of includes and demo 7 will have also a different number of includes so each demo is independent for one another so once you've decided like which demo you like to use SEO base as your core layouts then you can just pick the demo and work with their specific demo itself you do not need to worry about any other demos and there are independent from one other but let's just go true how do we read the cup config file so in cup coffee pot we have our basic descriptive with descriptions here we have our the name the description diversion and we have a conflict node and a build node in the config node we have a few fields here which is the demo which is we can leave it as blank because this is sense which that we want to build debug basically is for you to toggle true or false if the bug is toggled as true when you run golf bill like what we did earlier like here when you run when we ran called bill you basically get more descriptive text or descriptions of what's happening the bedroom and then we have a compound like this entire thing here it's just this - to indicate what we're compiling as you can see our TL here is set to true by default so what this means is every one cup bill you will build an RTL version of text demo so what do we mean here is if whenever we run gulp bill you will create a destination folder with all the SS and issue of false in it so in that destination folder will have an assets and if you look at the CSS you see style bundle dot CSS a regular one and an RTL one the reason 1 we have an RTO RTL one is because we enable this if you disable this to toggle is it false then basically when we run your built this folder will not be here makes to be all this different plugins that we are skipping for the RTL built the reason why we're skipping it is because all these plugins don't really need an RTL version for example if you look at font awesome or flat icons to suggest icon plugins they don't really need to have an RTL version because it doesn't really matter if it's left to right or right to left and also we have some ugly five mini Phi and some GSN CSS source maps that you can toggle if you need it you can just turn it on if not you can just leave it as it is next comes our calf this is basically how matrix metric knows where the source is coming from so this is the source assets which is basically this folder here everything in here will be used as the source so like the GS would be compiled and bundled up and you plot the destination but this also be here the media files here this transpose will be here so just it's just to define where the source path is and the node modules is again just to define where did you polish is located which is right here the demo API URL is mainly for for matrix demos and some of matrix demo pages will require some silverside callback which will need this URL to make the call some some pages such as our data table may mean some suicide communication so yeah this is this basically well does next will be our disk which is basically our destination path now at the moment is set to the set to employ destination to within demo demo folder like here in this basic compiled deployed to within demo for myself so if for example we were compiling then won't rewrite so if you do got built on demo tree if you look into the more tree you'll see a dist folder up here here as well so this is the default destination location or path of where you're gonna put all of the demos assets which is a CSS GS media files and all the demos HTML box as you can see this the destination photo was created and it's not really done yet but in here we have all of the assets HTML and one months but when you're building a project you can actually change this path to your project folder so whenever you run got built instead of deploying all the assets into the default location within the demo you can should deploy all the SS into your project folder so to do that you can actually just type in like C Drive and then say folder on say my project they my project folder slash like yes someone it gets this wood and then it would just deploy it to get this dislocation and that's pretty much how this work so you you can pretty much do anything you want as you can do plug anywhere you want in a computer and you just place the essence for us as falls all there we'll be on to a bill we have a few special things here are special notes here they have plugins with teaming media so media basically describes everything from the media source folder which is Sarah here which is Sun right here yeah all the images from here to be deployed into the destination path right here with an essence and you see all the media files here so this would be defining where the source is and where it's going to be outputs to but that's just this media let's move on to theme theme we'll have a few things here the theme is basically defining the Stars or the GS configurations and certain schemes for the demo and each of this is different from one demo to another although the filenames are the same but configurations within the files are different as mentioned earlier so for demo one for example since we are in Oz our system tree the bottom entry will takes the stars they take other components and the layouts GIS files what we're doing here is we are bundling them up into individual paths so that your page will be better organized well it does here is the Stars we have the Star Wars us and you bundle up into star bundle of CSS and then we have two J's files here she's not really - Gina sauce is quite a February as false because we're getting on J's files of this folder and all J's files from this folder bundling all them up into a single yes file called script stuff on Delta J's within the destination which is right here so if you go to the destination because the GS assets as years you find it's here and the CSS yeah so is to understand the concept of the gum conflict formats we have the source and we have the bundle the set of two main things that we do look at in the sauce we have a few types of sources star sources and script sources and there will be some cases where we have media and a media we have three types of media we can have images or we can have points so in skins is basically just defining different skins types skin types for Medtronic so skin taps are basically if you look at our demo the dashboard your skin's and then we see two that were skins we have a light basically the same layout is demo one just that the color schemes changers if dark again same layout color scheme changes so this are basically how skins work in Medtronic the layout is pretty much the same is that team colors change and if you go back to our code and this is what the skin dust and then we come back to our last layout or our lasts themed stylings of theme configuration which is our pages that we go to our SAS pages go to sauce pages and you see a bunch of pages here or rather page types so for example with the wizard we have four types of wizard box or wizard pages so we go to I just wizard you can see for wizard teachers here so it was a wizard one this wizard one and you go to our code is a1 sauce is here and we have certain scripts as well or specific pages so people too is this you good SSG s you go to pages and we see some folders here which is some of these components some crud and some custom pages able to wizard we have again what - for what we does is once it's plugged composite deployed it just goes to the destination location which is the for example CSS go to pages the Willis you see CSS 1 to 4 with the RTL version because we configured it to them we enabled RTL so essentially this is how we read come complete the JSON part once we have the idea of how the format works and we have source with bundle and in sauce we have different sources we have star net script sources that we go to plugins we see a few things we have faced and custom to get into what this tool really means charlie but in base we have like mandatory and optional plugins are basically all of been chronics third-party plugins that materna users for a variety variety of things mandatory plugins are basically plugins that medtronic absolutely needs if measuring tests one of these plugins missing its medtronic may not work as as issued but mentoring also what we do is we also sort of give you an option where you can actually remove certain plugins that you may not need in the in the events that your project does not need it so in the option optional options here like for example is gonna maybe if your project does not meet a good strength time keeper or time picker again should just remove it and once you remove it if you remember what we mentioned by having the source and the bundle the last minimize this is way too large bundle so what this means is once you remove a certain plug-in you would not be bundled up within the plugins bundle which in in turn makes you a bundle for a lot smaller so it depends on your project if your project does not we need we take time paper for example the one we just removed you can just go ahead remove it however if you do want to have add your own plug-in into Medtronic it's actually pretty easy all you have to do is just put a comma at the very end and then type in your plugin this is your plug-in and then you define the sources which is either stars or scripts for example like this I'll check where repeater just scripts this name stars a sweet alert has stars and scripts and you end this sources are basically kept in array so you can just keep adding their nests much as you want you can have like three for example or just one so it depends on the plug-in also if you notice that there are plugins there are caps or stores within repos like NPM or yard where you can just do an NPM install yarn tad and when you do that it gets stored into the node models folder since we define the path of no modules like at the top here we can do a simple shortcut to say grab the body part and then ejs files and CSS files that's your newly plugin but a newly installed plugin for exam so for example here here this is my plugin here input like styles you and then we could put a say say you stole you by APM here this and then / say you plug-in sISTAR holiday plug it a CSS and then if your script you and then do this - again - again that's yes if you have more this is comma and then and you can just keep going as you want so well how do you understand how this works if you look at our up this if you look at our format again everything in our source we bundled up into the single file so what this means is all of the styles within that mandatory and optional so all the stars will be see doesn't have much tiles in it so it's optional they call this tiles this and this and like all this will be bundled up into a single power cord plug in start bundle and all the GS file scripts will be bundled up into running start bundle but yes now this is basically a global flood control meaning that all these plugins will be loaded globally on every page within Medtronic or within metrics demo that you selected so if you put your plug-in within the optional or you can put it even you can put it in mandatory you can do that just adding it here in here you can do that but adding plugins within this section basically means you are adding a plugin globally throughout your entire project but if you do not want to do that and the reason why you may not want to do that is perhaps the plugin that you're using or only be used and maybe one or two pages from the entire project and you don't really want to build your google plugin bundle but to do that you this is where custom plugins comes in and some plugins basically defines their main BD plug-in that you want and then bundling it within its own bundle so if you look at jQuery UI here we have the source which defines the Stars scripts and even images that comes with jQuery UI and then bundles it up into its own CSS bundle is own GS bundle and it's on images folder you look at 4-under yep you see the same concept source is basically defining all the stars all scripts and the wonderful so now where do we find all this wonderful we can she look into our destination our destination assets folder and let's look at full-color biscuits right locates fruit renders bundle so we look at our destination two plugins and then go to custom and folk lender and you see them right here again this RTL because we said party on true yes bundle is also here so if you want to have to create your own or adhere or plugin that is not going to be compiled and bundled up within the global plugins we can just add a new one right here so let for example say in this ad that's just put here for example with something like I'll still plug it put a comma here and now we do is you define your sources and did you find your bundle you and then you basically put in all the necessary sources resource and necessary look under locations that is going to be deployed soon that's pretty much it of how become complex so now each demo as mentioned has its own cup config so if you're saying configuring this for example I am actually configuring gump country or demo one give number one as this which is this one here so this valve is I'm doing this configuration for demo one but let's say I want to have say a different layout for a different section of my project right and I would like them or tree to be that's layout and what I can do is I can actually go into the more trees demo trees tools and go into its own gum okay and then do the same exact customization here and each gum config will differ from one day when they add into the one demo to another is completely independent one another and therefore easily maintained organized and deployed all right so let's have a better look at our documentation again we went through what what where the company is located for each demo and also what each field thus if you need more reading or more understanding can read our opposite of meditation is basically all listed here like what it does and the best of all is when you run gulp bill we have certain shortcuts so go build is what is the different way of building the demo of building an essence but you can actually set different shortcuts that if you type up build with two dashes and an RT R equals false what this does is if you look into our demo config here but this does is just a shortcut to disable this option so running this essentially is the same as running got built with this configuration set to Fox so if you want to just generate GS files you can just write compute s GS you just generate GS files if you just missed CSS and then you just write computer sauce and you will just deploy CSS Fox same goes if you just want me near parks and lastly we have this called - production which basically just mini files all the yes and C yes yes s you can go ahead try this one let's look at our demo one and let's open this up and it's here you and open terminal go to our demo one here and cycle up shift rod okay it's done and if you can see our files are now minified which will be perfect if you are going to deploy your projects to a production server of course you can also do that with other shortcuts by actually slowing up changing this to true like this and this to true and then you basically get the same results so right next thing we can talk about is the cop watch command god watch comment is basically a turn it on every time you save your sass or JS files within the within your project it will then re render or rather recompile and redeploy the assets to is the destination you can also watch um just just watch Jess if you want or just watch on sass fox also if you also want if you do want a looks environments you can just go ahead and type top local host and you'll get your local host environment of course if you do have your own look of those settings or software such as stamp or web and again it does the same thing okay so um that's pretty much it for this video I hope you found this video informative if you did please give us a like it will really help us out also subscribe to our

you do standards a shoe size 12 to 16 John the sock man look into the camera and say thank you John well socks and underwear yeah [Laughter] [Music] so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna take this fancy 2016 cts-v and we're gonna do some tests on it we're going to add a roto fab intake to it and and then we're gonna add headers to it but first we need to baseline it and to keep the to keep the test consistent between all of them what we're gonna do is we are gonna put it on the dyno tonight and then we're gonna let it warm up to operating temperature tomorrow morning and run it that way heat soak is not really a factor and we're gonna do the same thing when we put the roto fab on and we're gonna also do the same thing when we tune it and we're also do the same thing when we do the headers and also do the same thing when we tune it again so we got a couple like night things going on here but we're we're gonna get her going so this car is stock - a Corsa it is on the stock tune and the stock headers stock intake all that fun stuff just not the stock exhaust so guys she is strapped down to the dyno and ready to go for tomorrow again what we're gonna do is we're letting it cool down overnight and then we're going to warm her up to operating temperature and baseliner and then we'll run it again or a couple times for good measure to show how much heat soaked actually affects this thing and then we'll get to work on the road of fab and plug and chug okay guys it is a new day we have not started this thing up yet and we're gonna start it now and get that baseline poll so we're letting the car warm up right now as you see it is the stock airbox stock everything - a course a catback and we're gonna dyno it so we have a good baseline number okay this is a very fancy car look at that so we're almost up to operating temperature the cool attempt is almost said we're going to run this at 180 and we're running it at 180 every single time for comparison purposes that way when it's cooled down and warms up doesn't have to have a chance to eat so and we get good comparable numbers club one run to the next now once it heats Ochs you know I'll show you that on the baseline here so you can see how we're actually losing power [Music] the baseline comes in at 577 to the wheels that's pretty damn good I was thinking is going to be 570 comparison purposes my CL one kind of 575 [Music] so we lost a little bit power we lost eight horsepower and like ten foot-pounds of torque and see how the power loss is across the entire rpm band and it really starts spreading the high in that is only going to get worse as the car runs full more and more so that is why we're going to compare it only to a cold start warmed up to 180 degrees and then ran there so we have good apples to apples comparison at least condition wise or as close as we can condition wise this is also Vaughn tuned you can see how even the tune changes a little bit with a little bit of heat so okay we ran it one more time and you can see it's still knocking it down a little bit at any time that's heat so it looks like he left me a present Arizona Arnold Palmer baby thanks James okay so the intake is off and Mike is taking some equipment off of the factory one so we can use it on the roto fab now see what the numbers are without any tune changes so for you guys that have a CTS b3 this this the numbers that we're going to show up first are going to be the numbers for no tuned changes whatsoever it's starting to look like a roto fab so roto fab does not offer the dry filters for the CTSV at least not yet you can only get the wet filter so that's why we have a red filter instead of like the white one that's on my zl1 I'm expecting some some decent gains from just putting it on I'd like to see 15 to 20 Mike what do you think she's going to put down the stock that's pretty restrictive I mean it's gotta breathe out of that so I definitely take 1520 wheel okay way to be different so what's this so it looks like they've updated their kit slightly on yours zl1 I actually had to pull the stock one out and modify it but new kit they have they do it in-house looks a lot cleaner voice will look cleaner than what you did I why use regular hose clamps it won't sit we don't have these connectors he's giving me I'm gonna have to go back to my my zl1 and like see what kind of hack job you did there it is it's really nice it fits in there really nice then they if you have a 103 on your car already they will send you a straight coupler so this one's a reducing coupler that way you can actually get it on without like losing your mind somehow Eric has the uncanny ability to stretch any coupler to any size throttle body look what they gave we're gonna put this over as rim over it okay guys it is a new day we're going to Dino the road a fat intake on this beautiful CSV it is a gen 3 she gets me it's a 2018 so has the better better supercharger like intercooler setup from the factory and we're gonna dyno it with no tuned changes now we're gonna do this the same way that we baselined it we've let it cool down overnight and we're gonna let it warm all the way up okay we're starting nice and cool well very cold manifold their temps everything's like I mean this is exactly the victim dishes that we baseline her in and this is exactly what we're going to do for the test to take heat soak out of the the comparison okay guys let's see what she does [Music] [Music] the initial results are in you guys want to see but no changes 20 horsepower gain and a 10-5 torque you can see that the majority of the gain is high end so like where you're going to shift that and into you have more power anything under well you probably didn't need more power anyway but that's an excellent gain and exceptionally going to show some some awesome formitz pickups for sure and the air/fuel ran just a little bit richer with tuning I think we get a bit more out of it so for good measure we got this thing a little bit eat silk now we're gonna run her again and see what kind of power lose this screen is wild [Music] that's Anna ball digital display [Music] and we lost a 4 horsepower and one torque and the more that we do this we'll just keep on getting worse and worse I hope you liked our comparison with the Rodef EV intake alone we have not done any tuning on it yet we have just run it with the rotor feb showing you guys the effects of heat soak and also what the rotor feb does with without any other changes it ran really good a nice gain in the high end 20 basically from 4,500 rpms on that's I I got to admit that's really something that's that's something that you can like add I think with tuning it'll do even better and then when we have the headers obviously a good bit more and well and that's what will be coming on this cts-v 3 project shortly next video on the project will be a baseline on on the tomb where it sits now and then then we'll bump it up with headers do that comparison so we can see the exact gains of the headers and then where it'll sit with headers and tune and then we'll be done with it I hope you guys enjoyed this video hit that like button and subscribe and don't forget to reach out to Rhoda Feb if you have a b3 because that that intake is definitely worth it have a great day [Music]", "jLn3QQtxxhk": "greetings all today we're going to make a Polish traditional classic called gulp tea it's cabbage wrapped with meat in a tomato sauce let's get to it I will be using purple and white cabbage minced beef tomato paste collection of spices and herbs and chicken stock now you're just gonna core the cabbage digging down doing it in maybe a pentagon shape just cut down as deep as you can and it should pop right out what up purple cabbage is actually healthy for you has a higher nutritional content than the white cabbage [Music] so now we have a rolling boil and you just want to dump in the cabbage directly you're gonna boil these for about ten minutes all right it's been about 11 12 minutes we're gonna pull these out and start pulling apart the leaves so now you just peel the leaves off of the cabbage try to be gentle a little trick to help it be more malleable just cut the back part of this vein it'll help you to fold it better same goes for the purple cabbage [Music] look at this just beautiful for the meat filling you can use pork or beef or both mix in the fresh herbs and spices with an egg if the piece of cabbage is curled a little bit just slice off the thick end like so if a leaf is not big enough you can join two separate ones to create one rule or tuck it in tuck in the sides like so and then just roll it up [Music] and if the leaf does not want to stay in place you can abuse it with a tooth [Music] tomato paste I'm going to show you a quick little hack you open up the backside of the pastes jar first hold it in place with your finger and then open the top part and then just push it on through and to the tomato paste we're gonna add some homemade chicken stock that I made a few days before 3/4 of a cup I would not use water because water is too weak at this point you want to pour the tomato paste and stock mixture over the rolls and use whatever leaves were left over to cover the whole ensemble so you're going to throw this into a 350 fahrenheit oven or 175 Celsius covered with foil for about an hour and a half and just a pro tip when you're deciding which side of the foil to wrap downward make sure it's the shiny portion because that's the one that will reflect the heat into the dish all right it's been baking for about an hour and a half turned off the heat and let it stew for another 30 minutes there it is beautiful moment of truth hmm is it good it's so good that is so good Andy all right moment of truth for daddy first time I'm gonna be trying this let me see Oh God that's incredible you're gonna pour some of the juices directly onto the rice so I hope you guys enjoyed that video a second let me go oh sorry about that I hope you all enjoy that video and I also hope that my Slovak in Polish friends were not too offended tonight I'm gonna finish with the Tito's handmade vodka from Texas probably the best luck in the world no offense and an age upman vintage Cameroon cigar keep cooking until next time", "TkaJviMn4gE": "all right welcome guys I know this isn't the right habitat or the right scenery or what this video is about but what you guys about to watch is we're gonna go search perch fishing we just decided to pull over on the side of the road just gonna hike up this and just see what's around the corner this is black tails in Roosevelt elk habitat so it's very green considering it's almost August it's gonna pick up here and then we're gonna go to the ocean and we'll catch some surf perch so stick along and I'll catch you guys let me get there [Music] [Music] my rig get that much good look [Music] one thing I love about the beach is so much living things around you well this one's dead but this signifies there was something living here that's a crab I think that's a Dungeness crab this is just just the shell so I don't know much about crabs so maybe he shed or this guy is completely dead I don't know how much of an expert when it comes to the ocean well I always love to then I'll just come on learn all right here we go we are going to try right next to this jetty first and that will just slowly move our way down that way but high tide is at 12:00 right now is I'm not sure but it is this effect so we're gonna walk out there try to catch as far as we can just trap close first if they're not there I'll try to cast farther finally Chris all babies become off I think no I don't think oh well I don't think I lost them he's on there we go first one it's not bad Wow that here all it takes is one or fish on it fish off me you don't want to do this guy's big god this guy's huge yeah this guy's huge I thought you always think but it's just I'm coming in this guy is big well at least he felt big oh yeah back-to-back oh yeah this guy's nice oh yeah this guy's big let some lion loose Kaspar there oh yeah back-to-back baby I think I think the schools here we're finally here alright let's try to get a dad just missed one if you come back for it about a bit what feels very heavy though I might have a fit I don't think I do but I knew it's by a small I thought I heard him going so I didn't know this guy was on I just felt like the smallest vibration keep it all right finally fish on after like hour and a half yeah dude this guy's big dude he's playing right my upper lip I ran out of bait so I caught three so I'm gonna put them into or deposit them into our bucket then we'll go out there with an empty bag there's no one yeah all right there we go feels like a decent one killing drag killing drag it's a decent way take them we are done top three my brother caught six we got total fishing kind of slowed down this morning when ills perfect which was like right before high tide and going into a high tide we couldn't find the fishes so we started all the way over by the jetty we slowly worked our way to our right as I said and we eventually found them without a little too late so we're gonna head back to the car and basically just go home guys my clothes details the wobbegong signing the fish are [Music] we just got home and gosh it's so stinkin hot right now after a fishing trip like this what I'm not used to doing is like washing stuff so since we're fishing saltwater I'm like freshwater if you don't rinse your stuff off with like tap water or fresh actual fresh water and you just let your stuff sit there it's gonna rust because of the salt from the saltwater and so one thing that I'm not used to is getting home and then just rinsing out usually I just get home put the rods away put everything away but now I it's like the the work never ends so I'm still taking off some stuff from the truck company in the backyard so I can run rinse it real quick things like my Gators my fishing poles my cameras my or my GoPros anything that touched salt I have to rinse and apart from that there's sand everywhere from when you're fishing on the beach and gold minimum the first time I wanted to do I got sand everywhere else of mask all right so right now I'm gonna actually prepare this little fish right here so this is a good you know just a good decent-sized little surf perch and I was actually planning to just scale this fish and then just deep-fry the whole body but when it comes to cleaning fish scaling up fish is probably my least favorite part of the process it's easy but it's more so of the idea that it gets really messy cuz scales fly everywhere so what I'm actually gonna do is I'm actually just gonna fillet this fish and I'm just gonna batter it up we're just gonna do some fish fry but yeah here we go this is the surf perch I'm about to cook up just gonna cut into the head like that just go on flipped around go like this poke it out poke it out the other side BAM like that and just follow the bone cut right behind the hand like that follow up like this poke it all the way through and just get through I guess a surf perch I will describe it for those of you who don't who aren't familiar with like ocean fish just like me I will just I will just describe it as a saltwater crappie alright alright there we have it these are my two boneless lays alright so here's some fish seasoning so that can go for that get some of this excess just slide around that way we don't waste as much [Music] that's more than enough sure we get some flower since I only have two pieces up the ladies I don't need a lot of flower just shake it off put it to the side the other one in and there we go promise I [Music] don't want to do too much vicious so there's my eggs here's my bread crumbs fish go into the eggs just mix it around [Music] [Music] all right so oils ready here's my two pieces of fillet found my perch perfect and the other one right there as well [Music] there we go it's a waiting game [Music] all right and there we have it those are the two filets off the serf perch I am actually not that hungry so literally I was gonna make something else but this looks like plenty of food already so I'm just gonna eat it real quick with this and then I'm gonna finish editing this video and then yeah that's pretty much it for this video boom alright so here it is just a quick little snack but you see I just put on a paper towel let the paper talk drain it so oil a little bit and so this way and then we're just gonna eat it with some good old tartar sauce cuz that's like essentially this is my favorite way to eat any kind of fish you give me any kind of fish that's battered and just deep-fried and then just add some tartar sauce to it I will eat that all day as long as the fish as long as the fish doesn't taste horrible which I don't think I've tasted any fish that tastes as horrible all fish can be good depending on how you prepare I think you can never go wrong with just simply battering it up and then eating it like this but what I will do is I will just eat it without tartar sauce first and then give you guys basically why I think of them meat from an observation standpoint only you got to look alright so that's how it looks the me is really flaky it reminds me of just like a crappie so you know it's flaky some fish such as trout they're a lot more like just mushy meat but this is actually very flaky right that yes see it's a very flaky and when you heat it and well that was good when you eat it it doesn't taste like flaky like the crappie so even though it looks like it's flaky when you eat it it's almost like it melts in your mouth so it's more of a texture about the walleye so in terms of texture when you actually eat it it reminds me of a why when you just look at it it reminds me of a crappie but when you talk about taste it reminds me of a mixture of taste between the wall and the crappie for you freshwater fishermen out there I guess that's the best way I can describe it this is basically a mixture of the walleye and a crappie and it is pretty dang good we're just gonna tartar sauce just break off another piece here we go just dip it like that mmm that is so good so I guess this is a better representation of how I actually looks it's like small flakes versus crappie where it's a little bit bigger in terms of flake size but do this thing is bomb I can eat this fish for the rest of my life if you told me I could only eat one fish for the rest of my life in a little surf fish I would have no hesitation this stuff is good even though I said it tastes like a walleye and a crappie mixed together for some reason that there's something unique and distinct about this meat right here that I guess my description of walleye mix with crappie would kind of be inaccurate although for the most part liman generalization that's true in my there's something about just this me in general that makes it a little bit more unique it's hard to be just fish fried and tartar sauce this stuff is bomb all right guys that's gonna do it for this video I just killed those two pieces of fillets for my surfboard I should have cooked another one that because it was just so good I didn't feel hungry but soon as I started eating outside man I should have cooked another one but I just wanted to quickly show you guys basically why I bought a cert perch in terms of that meeting a lot of fish I eat I eat exactly how could this just batter it up with breadcrumbs and then just eat with tartar sauce I felt like it wouldn't have been a fair comparison if I could surf for a completely different way and compared it to how some of the other fish tastes because when you took two different recipes with two different fish you're not getting a very fair comparison so I just want to cook surpirsed the same way I usually cook fish and just give it you know a very fair comparison and the bottom line is surfers is delicious if you ever get a chance to just come out and fish for surf Church I highly recommend you to do so they are very delicious and they're pretty big too so you get good amounts of meat on them you get even more if you don't fillet them but any questions just feel free to leave it in the comments and yeah that's the bottom line sir perch is delicious definitely in the future I'm gonna come back and fish more surfers but for now this is it as always thank you guys for watching and I'll see you guys in the next video [Music]", "GPprvrPzg-c": "hey what's up everyone today we'll be doing a catch and cook for Porky's let's go [Music] [Applause] [Music] for those who don't know what a Porteous hey Google what is it party party a deep fighting fish related to the sea Bream's typically silvery but sometimes changing to a blotched pattern he usually lives in warm coastal waters so in today's video we got to do something a little different it's gonna be a collaborative catch and cook my friend Roger he has a YouTube channel as well he's from New York cooking and fishing and he gave me a call and said hey why don't we go catch some Porky's because they're hot and on fire I tell him I couldn't cuz I was actually gonna be in New York City to do something that day and he told me to stop by and he'll give me some fish so that gave us the idea to do a collaborative catch and cook video he does awesome catching cook videos his cooking skills is amazing so in this cooking video what's gonna happen is I'm gonna share a clip of him catching some Porky's then I'm gonna reference one of his recipe from one of his catching cook and then I'm gonna give a shot and see if I can replicate one of his cooking dish so let's go okay so we're using the 2 inch slab wrap weighs about a quarter of an ounce and we're fishing I'm casting into about ten feet where I am is 25 here I'll show you the jigging motion it's it's a very basic lift and fall and this bait will swim on the retrieve and also on the drop the key is giving it almost complete slack line and the poor use will hit pretty close to the bottom and today the takes are very subtle you have to watch your line and they tend to attack the tail of the lure so there the hook size I upped from a size four to a size two owners single replacement hooks and I can put a lot more pressure than using the size four pound-for-pound these these porgies fight pretty nicely the rod I'm using is a zodia s-- 6-8 light it's made by Shimano the reel is a Shimano strata kfk 1000 it's pretty nice all around spinning set up both salt and freshwater I did a lot of drop shot on this rod wacky worm stuff like that this board is over 16 inches and that's a pretty nice hook placement we're not keeping this one I did end up keeping a couple for Jimmy a little bit smaller like between 14 15 inches so I'm always checking the hook point you're fishing this kind of rocky structure having a really sharp hook just buys you more time to set the hook these poor geezers kind of slash out the bait normally people fish for porgies with baked clams sand worms squid I personally feel that these little crank baits call out the larger porgies they're also just a lot more fun to fish this one is a little bit over 14 inches and we are keeping it we're gonna bleed it out on the clip and transfer into the cooler so I'm interested to see how Jimmy handles this fish cooking along to one of my videos I never know if people can actually follow the instructions as shown in my catch and cook videos I've never written recipes for the home cook so I look forward to seeing the results hopefully he comes up with a good dish all right so I'm bleeding out this Porgy they take about two minutes to bleed out you don't want to cut too deep taking care of your catch from the moment you land the fish is all part of the cooking all right that's about it so good luck to me so yeah the porti looks like a big big freaking crappie of the seat but it's like all silver and it's amazing looking fish he gave me a good amount so I'm gonna go clean some fish right now and then I'm gonna cook one of the porgies I have looked through a couple of his videos and I believe I want to do the lemon caper he actually did it with the fluke but I'm gonna do it with the porgy so if you guys want reference to the video on a top right hand corner it's gonna show you guys exactly what he does when he did the lemon caper for its fluke anyways guys let's get to the kitchen and I'll do some fish cleaning and some cooking I'm trying to keep the cooking and explanation short as possible because I want you guys to check out Rogers page because he does do a lot of Awesome catch and cook anyway guys let's go you gonna watch me do something a little different and it's gonna be a weird angle sorry it's on the tripod that doesn't really have much settings but I have a big bucket right here I think this is a five gallon bucket soy sauce  it out whatever bucket it is and I'm gonna scare my fish into water so I don't have to have the scales popping all over my kitchen my wife would really really appreciate it so if you guys want to yeah this is try whenever you guys can go ahead and give it a shot so I have a bucket of water here right got some cheap scaler and you just leave the fish in the water and you just scale them so one thing I didn't do actually which I'm gonna do it right now which is imma take kitchen sheet see your shears all right big scissors are here and cut some of the fins off so I could get to a spot so hats off you know all the good stuff alright so who's gonna get this guys in the water and just swiss yearling and it's kind of hard I can see the skillful falling rate into a bucket of water and when you're done you find your neighbor you don't like the most and just pour right in his lawn I mean tons fertilizer all right so I got majority of everything scaled down and I was gonna the latest guy again the mesquite on just drying its little bit cuz there are some imperfection because these guests are freaking amazing they're just so hard I don't I don't know uh you know why they have to scale it that hard but you know saltwater fish scup it's something that's unfamiliar to me I got thank you Roger for giving me some awesome fish and to try some of this catching cook videos you know it's a awesome collab so let's see how this goes cutting it's a lot easier than the first time when it did other flight because there there are no what do you call that the scales are not there so definitely a lot easier all right those are mostly stomach bones stuffing I don't want any dough's I think there's some meat right here there's butthole let's not keep that so that's wonderful lay there there we go two filets but do some cleanup so there's some set of balls right here so I need to get rid of those guys you feel different right here you listen to it all right so let's get rid of these guys here make sure you get all the scales off I just missed a couple they're pretty thick on the scale so it's definitely really really difficult so I got these guys good pretty much and I think some scales were it just actually on the board and just got stuck on it so I'm gonna lead us onto some paper towels and soak up some blood some slime yeah nice and dry guess that's the best way to fry your fish or pan sear it which I'm actually doing the lemon caper sauce that Roger did on his channel so check out that video of him doing for fluke but this this is it man this is it all right guys so for the ingredients for the actual sauce I got some butter I got some shallots capers lemon juice with some pieces of lemon flash and some parsley [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so the next step is you want to quote the world but don't wash your your pan because that's where the flavors gonna be at we got thrown a butter on and melt it and cook the rest of the stuff [Music] alright guys check it out is it man moment of truth let's taste this awesome looking porky Wow skin is crispy might be a little bit too soft is I put a lot more lemon in because I thought I might need all of it but it's actually really really good hey why what do you think it tastes like dude she says it tastes like fine dining guess let's go right here hey Roger thank you for the recipe and thank you for the for jeez this is really really awesome guys you guys don't know Roger he's cooking and fishing check out the cars check out description below I'll link the exact recipe I used and I'll link some of his 40 fishing trips that he do in New York but man I'm gonna devour this this is awesome FOMA Bon Appetit you have any questions feel free to message me in a comment below or go ahead and subscribe to Rogers place and ask him any question I think you guys will love his channel especially with that catching Kooks crazed lately look at some of his videos you know he goes in-depth so you guys wanna learn some nice recipes our fish that you guys catch definitely check his chair out I'm gonna finish this lunch right here and catch you guys next time on next video peace out [Music]", "qXsnznRNIPQ": "[Music] [Music] it's profs kitchen [Applause] [Music] it's profs kitchen oh look at me in this closer store I look like an idiot digging ingredients for props kids in the night does that mean anything to you those ingredients so tonight on props kitchen is a beast and it's gonna take a while so it's 7:30 right now your boy better get started so I just opened his chicken up it's been marinating for over 24 hours and it smells like a mother it's good as hell very potent very tasty I'm doing a rendition of one of my favorite dishes of all time inspired by a meal I had in Baileys Caribbean stewed chicken in Caribbeans through chicken usually you sear it on a pan and then you add a bunch of juices and sauces in there and continue to cook that that way I'm not gonna do that and we'll change it up I'm going to try to instead of searing in the pan see her super hard on the barbecue and then finish it in the pan with some other different ingredients this time so I might but it might be delicious we're gonna get some coconut rice popping on the side I still don't know like how to open up cans so one side this one got it I don't know put some water in there too I don't know I had coconut rice and I had I was like why the would anybody have any different rice than coconut rice it is the best so that's nice and hot that's hot enough mmm go for the breast first cuz it's the biggest you want that to cook most first the smell my neighbors are gonna hate on me like the char here it is a first for provocation big cup rice completely burnt I didn't put it back down to simmer I was just outside going to chicken this is that is unusable I think I might throw this in a different pan the usable stuff throw some water in it and start again I don't know well I just spooned all the good into that one and we'll see if that works I added some water and it's still very very al dente so it looks like I'm good to go I bet this will be all right barely caught the chicken outside too barely caught the chicken so sometimes it's trying to snapchat and cook at the same time Oh so I'm just gonna start this off this little stool that the chickens gonna finish in finish cooking in I'm just gonna freewheel it I want the freestyle which I peaked it in the pan healthy amount of garlic right there right here and tiny bit more right there out of that I'm about to add some chicken stock like that much however amount of cups 1/4 and 1/8 little coconut milk now this is a it's time for time this is power that's a Power Move that's fresh herbs that's power now this is about 1/2 of an entire onion going in now this might surprise you but traditionally about 2 tablespoons of ketchup now this is that browning from focus mark what the this is the Browning from the from that marinade just a little bit just a dab will do you butcher Browns spicy jerk sauce just a cherry on top that quarterback put it all together not not a lot of this it's very hot paprika like that much so now you see it that that browning really gets it dark that's where you get that flavor a lot of that Jamaican taste that's what that's that's what it comes from so this chicken that I seared outside is completely raw on the inside I like a good crisp outside but it hasn't been cooked on the inside so that's what this is for I'm gonna stall in there's still more I want to put in but I want to get these I want to get this chicken and as soon as possible so these juices can will start working with each other so I want that sauce to be a little bit higher maybe about halfway up the chicken so when I flip it both sides I'll get a complete little basting in it whatever that were it is alright so so far that stew is pretty close to like traditional Caribbean stew chicken recipe I'm pretty it's pretty loose though I kind of did whatever oh but now your boys about to break all the rules dawg whoa dude some cream in there heavy whipping cream in there so now the look is just to stir it up just a little bit and make sure all the sauce is kind of even and getting everything yet I mean see this is a little burnt but that'll come off it's good all the time is that you want to taste this sauce you just made because this is before we let it sit in it for a grip you want to try this you got tasted food while you eat mando around so what we're gonna do here is we're gonna let that take about 15 minutes then we're going to flip it another 20 minutes and it should be should be ready my station is a mess now we take this time to check out the gang that we've been missing oh Braun Braun and company Cleveland damn look at that score alright I got I got some game to watch so I'll watch the second half with food someone flipped these bad boys it's been about 15 oh you can tell the color Oh [Music] appreciate that bro so this is this is also something I'm changing up from the original in the original recipe it has it has it has you putting these in right away and then that made the peppers real soggy and thin so I'm putting them in later back out the Watts the Raptors get the cake for 20 minutes I'll see you in 20 minutes I did that I did that painting I'm not gonna lie I'm a veggies dude and there's no real vegetables in this meal besides there are bell pepper but I thought about so I think right when you put in the chicken into this tube you could throw some Brussels sprouts in there it'll change the taste of a lot of stuff but you can throw some Brussels sprouts in there and cook along with that chick yo I forgot to add there's like a tiny little dash of sugar in here that helps with the that goes a long way with the taste just tiny little dash of brown sugar just onion is huge though man I ain't got no shrimp II hands either all right we're back and cribs smells like a hundred bucks a million bucks look at this is a thing of beauty all that flavor all that marinade 24 hours all that all those ingredients have just been soaked up into this man it's hard to describe okay now this is an important moment in all of our lives take that sauce all the drizzle that over autumn little baby boys so here goes the coconut rice someone said that if it was burnt it might smell burnt or taste burnt that was not the case total save this so I'll cut in here the white meat cuz that's always the hardest to keep moist and everything so that's a good test no oh you already know this is an incredible commune this is really good I wish I was like a snob and I could like tell you how good this was I'm on a food snob or a food critic so I can't really like describe you but the time you can tell you know this was marinated 24 hours you could tell it cooked in doing this and it was done right so man I stay undefeated in France kitchen props kitchen", "6AqW6NWg6is": "all right you guys

closed they're not adapting to the new norm so um i signed up at 24 hour fitness there's a bunch of 24 hour finished gyms outside now so they are open for outdoor workouts i'm so happy i was so so happy because 24 hour fitness is more affordable than those other like independent gyms the intimate independent gyms are charging like 100 a month 24-hour fitness is half of that more than half so this cheese is getting hard that's what she said oh this is mukbang this is a mukbang worthy bite right here i'm so excited i woke up at 4am today because i was so excited to work out i like work out

say this is like the probably the most authentic philly cheesesteak you'll ever get here not this one but the other one i was eating would probably be the most authentic you'll get here in la but in toronto we don't even have like anything like this it might not be like how your grandpa made it in philadelphia but my oh uh so there's a guy yesterday at 24 hour fitness um squatting at the squat rack and we don't have that many options for machines because they moved all the equipment outside they're not going to move every single machine out so there's a few squat racks very limited there's like i think two racks or two yeah there was two racks and one smith machine there was a guy on the squat rack for the entire how long was it like 90 minutes he was there for an hour and a half the entire time i was there he was on that squad rack i'm like yo some guys must be so mad hogging the machine like that for an hour and a half he was on that same machine it didn't bother me because i wasn't doing it so i mean i didn't need it one but i'm sure some people are so mad when i saw people waiting for me for a machine i'll go pretty quick not really fast i wouldn't go real really fast but i'll speed up the process i guess i don't know speed up the process that was good oh oh i'm gonna eat more later i'm still pretty hungry all right guys i'll catch you guys on to the next one i'll see you guys in a bit stay safe i was i forgot i almost forgot what i was gonna say stay safe be well and we'll see you guys on to the next one peace [Music] [Music]", "4WNVRE-vfEA": "hello and welcome to this cope video tutorial where I shall be showing you how to convert SVG icons into fonts using gulp so let's jump right into this let's again do sueded and normal system you're on NPM install save death goal I component type in a password and then do two there we go right and now what we have to do is we have to go up here include icon font equals require go icon fonts do they call task to have a look to do icon fonts cuz us we're going to call em semicolon to close off do our gold sauce let's put in an array and do - gugu pre-assess which i have up here which is just a bunch of SVG and icons where were we so we'll target icons and use a wild-card for everything and that is an SVG extension do the pipe subtype icon fonts then we'll do font name this is a requirement we must have fun name such as name awesome fonts and append a spell and curve points this is just recommended you have to do this in the documentation it recommends to do this option then on code points to the function code points this is all pretty much the options are we get in the documentation which I'll leave below so with you our CSS templating in here and then we'll just log the to the console what we have done such as the options and then from here we have to close that come down here to pipe the destination to assess fonts and I should be good let's make sure I haven't messed up the names which I usually do doop to do let's just give it a run anyhow see what happens Golf icon font yeah well I surprised I messed up the names again and that should be one and doo doo doo doo and I should be down here River and nuts and then we get our console log which we've done here and hopefully if we're going to do do assets fonts we have our font there we are our font how great is that and yeah so that's how you convert SVG icons into fonts using gulp and pretty simple to be honest which is login stuff here and our CSS templating and giving a nice output so can kind of see what's going on such as like the options we point here so yeah fun created that's really cool thanks watch this video if it was helpful please click like and remember to subscribe and I shall see you next one", "cfIjnweBs9E": "hey this is Luke Simon's with salt strong today we're gonna be testing out procured gel is it effective we're on the water right now and so what I'll be doing is I'll be testing that I'll be throwing the same litter and I'll have one with this gel and then one without it I'm gonna I'm gonna change rise every three casts and at the end of a analyse you how many I caught on the one without procure compared to the ones I caught with poker these are this the same exact rod the same type of line and you know have the the yellow line will have the procure the white line will not have it we'll see what happens all right so we're gonna start out with procure and if you're curious on what type it is it just says in the shore saltwater gel so if figured I'm in inch or saltwater this would be the one to try so let's go ahead and get started there's a bunch of mullet jumping right basically in front of our anchored so we'll see if we can't get on the board fast again three three casts with this one and then I'll change and just keep swapping and uh and then analyze see what happens at the end alright first cats with non procure feeling hits with this as well they're just little pin fish okay first trout and this is yellow line so we are on the with procure a little guy I'll just be good but be good be good be good little fellow there but we're on the board there's a porpoise down there let me go all right you made it in the water there Otis you did not help on that one bud all right so for one trout on the board croaker one non procure nothing where we are there's a fish so this was on this is on the the know procure a little bit bigger still small all right one two one this is a trout on procure over two to one it is a little bit bigger but still small a couple of them with it yeah like this is definitely bigger Otis a stay but stay all right two to one oh right there at the boat keep casting around I'll just be good be good I think we're just in a small trout area but hopefully it'll be good for experiment numbers we'll try another spot hopefully find some bigger one bigger trout and also some snook and Red's but for now we'll do the small trout and three two one time to switch to the non procure and let's see if they'll still hit it and what I'm doing I'm just drifting down this big flat real big grass about there's kind of his potholes scattered around much a bait oh I lost them there's a trout this is on the non procure so this will be two to three still another small one I almost lost notice nice fish it's a big old trout it's a real big trout this is a solid trout interesting it was on the was on the know procure this is a really really nice trout looks like pretty good I just got to calm down bud I'm not 24 25 but it's a solid trout nice fish nice fish just came out in one of the one of these potholes catching all small ones and then this big guy showed up I soaked right on the top of the lip solid fish I'll let him go alright the rod with the white line so now we're three to three alright now I got the head came on I was wishing I had it on during that fight so see if we can't get another nice one out here another one this is sounding on fret here little guy though real little one it's gonna be my last cast so it's four to three now so I'll do one more one more round see if we can't find any big ones this is a much shallower area than before I was just getting a bunch of pin fish and no trout and then that trout decided to show up we're basically just fishing a big old grass I've never fished it before both yeah it's got a lot of fish on it this is a little dink trout this is the smallest one yet all right this is the last cast assuming I don't catch any damn need to go to an area that has some some snook and Red's in it see if we can't get some different species so I believed her four to four got a nail-biter this is nothing closer than I thought and then the biggest one surprisingly was on the other non procuress all right well that was a trip I got the boat all loaded ready to go it's three o'clock now I fish from about noon to three that first spot I've never been there before and that was a pretty good drop fly that uh most of them are small but one nice one I went to some snow areas that I've been to before for for snook and reds and just couldn't couldn't make it happen I didn't didn't even see any and see anything good so called it an early one I wanted to get back before rush hour but yes so far it's four to four on the procure verse non procure and I was just just one day one day's results isn't isn't conclusive obviously but it was interesting to see that it wasn't a landslide and in the biggest fish was actually caught on the the non procure bait but but again I need to do this a lot more before we can say conclusively one way or the other but just wanted to share with you the experiment if you do have some some ideas on how to make it better I'm all ears you know please do let me know this was just a way to truly start some analysis to see you know how much of a difference adding sent to lures actually does make so I hope you enjoyed it leave your question down below if you have any otherwise I hope you can get on the water soon and catch some big ones [Music] Oh lips out strong in wetlands a day", "VGOYZHZV1R4": "[Music] [Music] [Music]

specifically we're going to be looking at gulp plumber so what exactly is google plummet well it's basically a package that allows us to prevent stops on errors so say we're using some soft sass file or less file or some other plugin that hasn't got any error management in there what will happen is if we're running you know golf and then we've got a bunch of errors which we have here I've got Jason just to notify me that there's an error but if we have a plug in our package that's running and it gives us an error and then generally these particular plugins will just you know completely stop gulp and that's not good because we don't want to be having to restart every two seconds so the way to fix this is we're going to use plumber and it's very simple to use we'll see more errors cropping up in the future when we're using sass and less just because it's more prominent with this type of plugins but for now we're going to go ahead and install plumber so let's do sudo npm install save dev called plumber and i'll leave this in the description so you can have a look at the the get help for this and so and unlike passwords and it's installing that's cool it's installed let me just get rid of this error so don't go again and so now I've installed it let's create a variable so let's call this plumber require gulp plumber and now what we're going to do is say this was some sort of sass task or less task generally when we run this task and if we had an error in our sauce file it would you know just gold would completely stop it wouldn't continue and that's not good because we could have a huge huge gold file with a ton of dependencies and we could really mess up our development so to prevent gulp stop him what we Dewey's we're just going to simply go into one of these files here and what we're going to do is we could just do pipe and then do plumber and that's all well we pretty much have to do to you know prevent and combat any errors and we can just put this in every task that we presume is going to be errors plumber will tell us that those errors on a specific line which is good so regardless of I don't know the notation of the task what it's going to do is it's just going to give us the arrows in plumber down the pipe which is quite convenient the plumber is going to fix the pipe and it'll tell us the arrows in terminal as opposed to you know completely stop it in gulp which is really neat and we're going to be using this light turn in the next few videos so I recommend everybody goes and gets this particular package go plumber again I'll leave it in the description below so yeah that's it for this tutorial that was just getting called plumber and how we can and just use it as a pipe basically so we can just click well type pipe then put in plumber which is basically top variable both and yeah that's pretty much how it works so yeah thanks for taking time to watch this video and now shall see you in the next one", "9ZNkRm0N8FA":

work on other stuff as well they've done some mustangs and other stuff but the main bulk of their business is definitely gonna be LS and lt and allstate included after talking to a ton of shops looking at quotes and reviews and talking to people at car shows car meets and and everything really what it came down for me was - am I gonna trust with my car from day one who do I want to be cougar I really want to be in communication with what's their prices what's the value but also at the end of the day is it going to get done right the first time the only time and can I Drive it reliably after that for good so when I first created my package I was like oh man I'm gonna go I'm gonna go full sin I'm doing head scam I'm doing pull bolt-ons pull leaves all this stuff and it just got to the part I was like whoa man maybe I need to pump the brakes a little bit and that's when I really started to realize it am I just trying to join join my car or am I just trying to have a certain goal with the car or am I just trying to really be the king of the streets and what let's just back up to that you're never going to be the king of the streets man okay there's never gonna be a jefe of the streets but guys this is what happens guys get all excited seen YouTube videos and Instagram videos about who's getting gapped and then people build their stuff further and break it further but they go the further and then there's someone else's faster and it just it's a non ending cyclical cycle that just constantly constantly rotates so for me I was like man I'm gonna do all that like I want something that's gonna run 10-second for sure all day deep in the tens no issues extreme reliability is my main focus so that being said I expect to be able to start it I expect able to beat the dog-piss out of it and for for dozens of thousands of miles not skip a beat I had that flex fuel pulleys were a must bolt ons everything bolt ons was just for me it was a must and then I started looking at well when should I stop in terms of before I port the supercharger into our heads and if I want to do that how much is that gonna cost versus how much would it not cost and the difference in the power to kind of balance is that extra three four five grand really worth the extra 60 to 70 horsepower or do I want to just back up be happy with 710 730 depending on you Tunes it which is coming up and who does the cam which is coming up and so for me it was like man I don't think I really need to do heads I held off on that we are gonna end up doing supporting which I think is going to make me happy I don't think we're gonna do a crazy in the morning because to me it seems like I'd rather go full pork and heads at the same time or I'd rather wait so I think we're just getting up doing snout throb body throttle bodies at 102 and then it's now we're going to put this out a little bit and I Inlet and I think we're gonna do a mile porting the supercharger nothing crazy probably like a stage stage one just enough to kind of get a little bit better efficiency as I'm putting pulleys in it and last piece of that is I want it to be reliable so I went ahead and threw it in the cloud I believe the rxt I said hey man it's what you do not what I do sounds good to me brother and that's what we ended up putting in so so that's that guys so I'm hoping when it's all said and done I'm gonna be able to run between 14 and 15 pounds of boost Texas speed headers two inches full courser exhaust finally this is one of the things I'm the most excited about out of everything number one is the video the ability to run a 85 that's just that's awesome to me number two is the cam number three is corset oh my god I've wanted a course exhaust on my sports car since like 2013 when I first bought my Mustang and and I couldn't I mean I could afford one but I was ignite it will spend fifteen hundred bucks on some metal but now I'm like you know a man I'm gonna build a race car once for me personally I'm this is my race car guys it's not it's not like a human you're good just good and five years you've treated because like now this is I'm putting investing a lot of money in this is this is my car it's not going to air and my wife definitely is a all over that so good luck ever getting rid of a Dave but that being said Corsa is gonna sound amazing let's back up to the cam so and in conversing with the shop telling them what I wanted Mike my ultimate goals they recommended that I reach out to a G and so we did and Panji also known as Patrick Barrera and Victoria Texas or LSX dyno tuning it's going to because inspecting out a cam for me recently he just switched this from fretless a motors said he's had some incredible luck with it it's been very very good and what I like about it from talking to Patrick you're not sacrificing any low in power or going to work for any high in horsepower it's a great balance of both and that torque is going to hold through about forty eight to five thousand rpms and then it's going to die for horsepower slightly dips up so it's like in my opinion that you know horsepower is cool at brag about but torque with reverence races and so that for me that's that's what I was just really really excited about last piece of that for cooling is going to be heat exchanger four inch Kei and then a trunk tank with the real pump that's gonna be pretty sweet and I believe they're gonna run 12a in lines all the way up so man it's gonna be a really stout package full bolt on 85 flex fuel ie 1300 injectors DSX ox pump and upper lower pulleys see our five timing chain milling oil pump obviously valve springs retainers we are going to hold off on the heads but looking back at this I think the only thing I missed we're just random gaskets ls9 head gasket ls7 lifter chevrolet performance lifter tray we're gonna hold off on the head step kick em in the head if you're gonna want a two millimeter throttle body 660 polished dual spring kit titanium retainers to c7 celia five sixteenths chrome chrome leg push rods LSU ls3 4-pole camshaft gear ARP LSX Campbell kit obviously plugs will change cetera et cetera timing cover gasket all the gas gets under 60 degree thermostat Smith Brothers tell us bronze bushing trunnion upgrade kit already mention the timing chain damper pretty much guys that's it I mean it's going to be a super-healthy package I think he gave me a really good price out the door I really good price out the door because I hey man I really want to do a one and done I don't know and they're better like when some IPS and do students one is into the caution there's no stage two and go back and do that for me I was like man I want to do is H two plus probably not neighborhood three I think she plus it's gonna make me happy I want to be one and done what's the best price you can give me there's a couple of parts that I have and then you know for installation if you couldn't put that on there but already had a rotor five intake as I have told you guys for previous videos and actually had an exhaust up here but I actually opted did not use that one when trying to fit that in the garage with a couple buddies it actually didn't fit around the diff and so when I would have faced with that one was when buying it it was advertised SS one la Zia one I mean being a little bit newer to the car at the time I think I'd only had it for maybe two months I was like oh you had to be fine but now that I've learned a little bit more out the car and been around the car lot more underneath on top and side etc I've learned the difference just quite a bit bigger and in order to clear it I would have had to cut off the crust X bar and rebuild the moon ones and maybe it would fit me just get pretty much gonna be maxed and as like at the end of the day it's like if I'm going to get all my money back maybe - 100 bucks - just get rid of it for the headers full exhaust the axle back catback whole nine yards x pipe just start from scratch and getting exhaust I really want that was what brought me to get in Texas be headers and of course exhaust so for my car they only make the sports they don't make the extremes for the new zeal ones that have n extremes and I think you can get a course extreme for the SS and I think it would honestly fit my car just to axle-back not the whole looks awesome the absolute I could fit but it's single tip the sport has come with the quad tip so honestly being catalyst and having 2-inch headers all the way back to ed courses core mufflers I don't need to go extreme it's bloody loud I'm excited for the no drone but but man guys that's it it's at the shop now I dropped it off about two weeks ago I went to get a Zack Reese cts-v picked up some pretty cool wheels they're actually 18 inch zero one trips and being honest no shame I'm never gonna buy weld wheels I think they're crazy hey I think it's awesome if you want to buy them I think they look great I think they're off wheels but I'm not going to go spend $2,000 on some wheels I'm gonna go tear every race that's just crazy I can buy tires for seven or bucks and these reps were with tires and I think they had 50 miles on the Mickey Thompson et Street ours one pass and maybe 40 50 miles to drive it they're back from the drag strip from a guy in Austin and the wheels no curb rash beautiful wheels 18 inches they both right on no clearance issues no fitment issues they were like 750 bucks on Craigslist I met him up in the cypress northwest Houston and he came from way out in College Station so it's like that's pretty tight I can bolt those on and I can go over into the truck phone 2110 I'm gonna keep the rest of that 13 15 bucks and I'll do something else with it me but the exciting last few things that I have coming up for y'all are gonna be I'm actually gonna drive down with patchen's the car the guy's just an absolute magician she's incredible with the LS motors and his custom camp packages and his tuning it I mean it's not it's not the best cuz that's a super bold statement but I mean you I think you could put him up there with anybody and I think he would he would match no problem so I think I've since I'm building this car once and I build them right and I'm getting done the fit I'm actually gonna drive back to Victoria from my house is about two and a half hours I don't even care if I had a Hummer I would drive it's just too worth it for me to go why would I not go vlog that no that means like that's gonna be freaking awesome content and it's gonna be a blast of a day and I kill the day off so it's a win-win-win think we're just now getting to the good part and I think that there's a lot more to come to it we're gonna have fun with so after I breaking the clutch you get the car back tune will be buttoned up start using a 85 kind of getting everything run and get a cycle get used to it put some miles in the car I'm definitely a vlog that first road trip about reactions with the car driving experience with the car difference of power levels it's gonna stop guys 500 miles I can't beat it I can't romp it I got to be for that I can't go on it I want to do it right and spend a lot of money so I'm gonna break it in the correct way but that being said I'm gonna vlog about where I go I'm thinking maybe a trip to San Antonio er back because I think it'd be fun to hit 99 down i-10 drive to San Antonio for the day Bucky's or something get some good content items a pretty good straight shot I could do awesome but there's a lot of back roads I'm not really excited about it in a million back roads where as i-10 for me would just be a straight shot and back so that being said I think that's where I'm going to go with it if you liked the video please let me know like the video actually in real life comment feedback guys the whole point of this that this channel really is just - hey it's you getting outside of my comfort zone because I don't I don't do a whole outside of work in spent time with my family so as I've gotten older I have less and less free time and and my days off now that we're finally in a new house and

sea fishing today I'm just got some new laws some fake rag1 some rubbery ones they don't look too bad there's no sin to him at all so I've been down the pound shop got myself a bottle of the old oyster sauce give that a little dunk you know as you would boil your something keep your carp fishing yeah I'm actually out with cup gear today I'm hung out with me yeah Dahlia were reeled and I'm actually using ie spod rod yes I'm math using the carven spod rod as well I'm just saving me getting me van out today just to get me rods and all that out the back to add a few bits in me bedroom and I thought you know what I'm gonna try them lures out so yeah we're just down here I tied three o'clock we're on the Mersey so got one of the roughest tides in the world it really gets moving and it can drag your gear so using nine ounces so I'll ground a lot of white in coddling that sort of thing around this time year so well yeah we'll see how it goes got young the other camera over there as well trying out the new were sj4000 as well so we might bear to get multiple shots I'll even see if I can film yourself here chatting to you guys chatting to you guys so yeah I love a little mix and see if we can play with that looks I still got no pro ed and program on my computer so can't really do too much at the moment no wonder it's wonders so yeah just got me teach as well standard yeah just a little weight off now we've got about twenty minutes still very high tide and then it's going to be slack tide for an hour and then it's going to start moving again going back out the other way so I can't really fish it for too long of what you just get snagged and dragged everywhere seems to be holding ground pretty well at the moment but yeah I'll get back to you in a minute I'll get a few more bits up get a brillo on the go standard and yeah I'll show you probably what I'm using an hour set up and I know I not much going on not much going on on that tip there boys murder yeah what I'm actually using yeah that's Lea casting stick it's the 30 plus but yeah I've always used as a spod rod to think that's I think that's what she is and I'm on the dial reals there as well so I've got the I've got 20 pound sub line on there so yeah pretty much all cop gear this end just a little bit of sea tackle on the other end I say like 9 ounce LED and a fake ragworm few boats today can't quite see if that's the bizzy's going down there or not but a yeah I'm not too far from home I'm just sort of a a mile up that way the water New Brighton at the campsite yeah so we get some fish today trying out these new lures I'll whip one out in a minute and show you they don't look half bad Oh got to brew one as well standard got to brew on at last he comes all the waves now from that boat smashing it down it yeah I'm just sort of fishing just sort of down here seems to be holding ground right at a minute yeah you probably noticed lost a bit on the beard I fell asleep with a sheet and we melt the other night and burn a  great old in it why wouldn't you wouldn't you so yeah so why wouldn't ya hey so well yeah obviously growing beard again growing beard again feel naked feel naked cold and naked they're not afraid I'm afraid of nothing yeah pretty warm dirts actually down on the Merseyside gonna be brewed pretty warm day I thought it was gonna be pretty cold out so double wooly jumper and a body warmer I'm pretty  toasty pretty toasty yeah we're down here at the Belfast Barrett ferry terminal no boat in yet oh yeah usually there's a big boat going all the way along there and that takes like all the lorries and cars and passengers over to Belfast oiler man all that sort of thing and I quite like it when the boats here because when it fires its engine up I tend to think that it scares all the fish over this way so yeah I don't mind it when the boats in the time seemed to be any fish at the minute it seemed to be only fish of a minute the yell we do was carry on and you know keep shooting keep drinking brews I enjoy the dirt yeah sorry I'm put a video out for a while guys whoever here has been absolutely miserable since like Christmas day hasn't literally stopped raining as well come out fishing today it's actually our first sort break in the weather it's drizzling now miss drizzling now like birder no I thought would get out and make the most of it as it wasn't actually raining no fish today no fish they try now that new law and not an awful lot going on but there was three other decks further down so I'll just down here low but they sort of finished up now they do have much I said now I'd like to little whiting and be honest Todd but I've not even catch why in to be fair or dogfish which you get a lot of round ear toys dropped about and meet and now been a hour hour and a half I've got a got me GoPro I weren't me sj4000 over there sort of doing the time-lapse you know I'll see how that works he'll probably won't be able to upload it because I haven't got the editing software to put it all together and make you know individual pictures into a movie but a yes or even put anything out for a while it's just purely down or whether I don't mind going out if it's cold don't mind going out if it's snowing but I do not like getting wet and often lay there all night cold and wet because I've been hiking in the rain all day and your phone gets wet your cameras get wet and I am got that kind of money to keep placing you know I mean so yeah we're on a budget so as I'm went as and went you know just fish in just thought on the edge of that wall over there so dip in me diffing me lure in the oyster sauce as well but nothing nothing it's not usually too bad down me get a lot of thornback raise a little flat he's the dabs say white in codling a little bit further up by our campsite up there you get the smooth round in a fairly good selection here on the Merseyside I've always said you know people say oh you wouldn't want to eat the fish out the Mersey and I'll go now now you know it's completely different nowadays murrs he's a lot cleaner but I'm to be having a saying the car Ivanych each little bit further down the road and there was a couple of guys walking backwards and forwards across the mud and they were yeah they were just walking across the mud and I said well you up to guys you know because they're wearing wetsuits and coming backwards and forwards with a wheelbarrow they were from Northwest water I think it's Northwest water and what it was was they're having it go out like further up there's like little things like this sticking up when the tide goes out and what it was was there like outlets from the sewage plant and he said they're having to pull out wet wipes jam rags  nappies all sorts and it was just all blocked up so basically if the water plants are ejected sanitary towels nappies and all that sort of thing it's not clean in there and be honest I was disgraced oh but what's the point who can you complain to you know I mean oh yeah I spoke to a couple of lads that were cleaning up nappies well there you go we were cleaning it up so yeah there'd be no argument here for me so yeah so if I catch anything Connor mercy I am it boys oh you guys I used to back them out and say oh now it's great it's you haven't got all the industrial plants release and now no you've got the plant release and  so yeah that eat and fish out the Mersey disgusting sure yeah it's got a boat coming in who knows yeah where is you son of a can't see us behind a bridge anyways yeah it's getting dark now still nothing still nothing well yeah as you can see Fonda being environmentally friendly here on the Merseyside yeah very environmentally friendly around here oh there's the boner son of a look onto it ah this one doesn't zoom hang on I'll come out to look at the state out boys I think that is the ferry across the Mersey you usually hit a song playing as well captain musket in pissed off without tell ya listening to that all day but yeah that reminds me of the camouflage in the old days on the boats your warships used to have like bright yellow zigzags and stuff like that on the side of them because there's bright yellow zigzags in in the sea in there obviously but no we're not getting anything on this these lures I'll quit then I'm gonna quit them so yeah I'm gonna reel it in and show you what I'm fishing on and then you'll know what to  not bye yeah enough inviting today guys so we're gonna knock it in yet stead of call from your mate so I'm gonna go another chitra shade that's gonna be more entertaining than just standing around here doing nothing effectively camping cuz I'm catching fish so yeah anyway till next time guys you know keep it pokey schwa", "3uArqI-LHXU": "don't have Pepsi you know could I get more ice please when getting a little thing like a soft drink starts getting hard to call this a lard come to 7-eleven where you'll always get your favorite soft drink fixed

holistic living mentor I am here to help you maximize your wellness through exercise and nutrition so on that note today we are going to make a cannellini bean dip and this is going to be used for all sorts of things by the time we're said and done and our ingredients are going to be some I have some fresh oregano here packed oh I can't even tell you oregano is packed with nutrients lots of lots of minerals and few vitamins in there of course we have our olive oil I have hemp seeds hemp seeds are a complete protein in and of themselves and they are packed with essential fatty acids so this is a little nutritional powerhouse right here Celtic sea salt as you know i just love using Celtic sea salt because it comes with all the vitamins and minerals it's supposed to come with no one has stripped them away and so then it digests and break down much better than a traditional white table salt we have white beans which I cooked earlier I made those with a vegetable stock and then a little bit of organic lemon juice so here we go with the garlic the easiest way to get the garlic out of the skin is just to smash it down we have two pieces there we're going to smash that puppy down we're going to get take the skin off there we go and we're going to put that in the blender will do the same thing with all of this I like garlic garlic is wonderful it's an anti-bacterial and antimicrobial right so when you're sick it's the best thing to have and it's great to keep all those germs and stuff away from you so we love adding garlic into our foods / this guy up here and take all that little skin off of it okay our oregano we're going to take it off the stems so I just kind of take my nail and drag it along the stem there a little bit and we're going to use all of this it's really yummy the sims if the stems aren't too strong I kind of leave them in there too because they'll get all chewed up here fine I can't tell you the smell that's irregular right now is giving off it's wonderful the whole kitchen smells oregano right now which is just great so let's see here our bean dip you can of course cut vegetables like most people do and you can use them to dip into your bean dip but i also like making sandwiches with my bean dip so i can make a sandwich with chicken or i can make a vegetarian type sandwich and put it in there and then smash the bean dip in there and voila we've got like our own little mayonnaise so we're putting in hemp seeds Hennessy to the garlic and the oregano first so we're going to kind of blend these up working on getting a nice and fine perfect then we are going to add our white beans all those beads in there there we go want to add in some salt yep and some kind of juice just about will teaspoon maybe a little bit more and now olive oil so all is going to help us liquefy this so be generous don't be scared of olive oil it's really good for you and it's wonderful for your skin and your hair and your nails so let's Wow and there you have it so now I promised you some other things you could do with this right so you can make a sandwich or a ramp right and add this in there as kind of like your mayonnaise on the same note you could take some of this into a bowl and add it with a little bit more olive oil and you have a wonderful salad dressing that's nice and creamy so that's another good thing to do your cannellini bean dip will stay in the refrigerator for a good two to three days in a nice airtight container okay and you can use it for all sorts of stuff like that I also put it on the side when I'm making a salad I will just take a big gulp of this and put it right on top of my salad and if I want to so you got lots of options right and it's very good for you and it's a great snack so think about it you know you've got the beans between the beans and the hemp seeds you've actually made a complete protein because remember that protein is a chain of amino acids and your beans are missing a couple of pieces but your hemp seeds will give you those pieces so now you have a complete protein here and so this will now give you energy for a longer period of time as opposed to just carbohydrates by themselves so you can use this as a before workout snack or maybe an after workout snack or you can use it as a meal please enjoy if you'd like to see the recipe in writing go to WWD delaying calm remember I'm your holistic living mentor and I am here to help you maximize your health through exercise and nutrition bye for now", "08eFxLLFiT0": "On today's episode it's honey and hot sauce!\nwatch us drink this bottle of hot sauce, and also this bottle of honey. Aaaahhh! I'm afraid. Okay Let's do this. Okay. (theme song) The Bible is centred around two\npromises God has made about judgment and about mercy. We know that God hates wickedness and he will\none day come to judge the earth and condemn people to hell for eternity. But we also know that God has made a way to\nescape judgment through the death of His Son, so that rather than experiencing hell, we\ncan experience love, forgiveness, and an eternal relationship with Him. The problem is that we tend to focus either\non one side or the other. So there are men who are standing on street\ncorners holding signs that say turn or burn, and there's also preachers who will never\nmention sin in their church because they don't want you to feel unloved while you're there. If you talk only about judgment, you're describing\na God who would never send His son to die. If you talk only about love, you're describing\na God who had no good reason to send His son. A gospel of love is like trying to drink\na bottle of honey. It's too sweet on its own. So to demonstrate that to you today, we're\ngoing to literally drink a bottle of honey. I'll get some glasses. This is the dumbest thing I've ever done in\nmy whole life. So this is an entire bottle of honey. Aaaahhh! That's how I feel right now, inside. We're going to race to get down the honey\nfirst. The winner is going to get to drink the glass\nof water, loser just has to suffer. This is to symbolize the people who spend\ntheir lives preaching about only the love and goodness of Jesus, but never talking about\nsin or judgment. Too much sweetness is a bad thing. Okay here we go. Hands on the table. Okay. Braden, do you want to count us in? 3, 2, 1 GO! I'm going to gag. Way thicker than I anticipated. Done. Oh my gosh. It's not that bad actually. Yeah, this is hurting more as we sit here. Yeah, it didn't feel that bad at first, but\nlike-no, but it feels bad now. Oooooohhhhhhh! It just like-I feel sick. I feel sick now. Okay, so we just took a small break between\ntakes because we both feel sick to our stomach, and, uh we took the time to google whether\nor not, uh, honey makes you throw up, and we found that there's actually a verse in\nthe Bible that mentions this. And that verse is Proverbs 25:16, and it says\nthis: \"If you have found honey, eat only enough for you, lest you have your fill of it, and\nvomit it.\" Which I genuinely feel like doing. Yup. Um, there are men who spend their lives, uh,\npreaching about the wrath of God, uh, and his coming judgment, but they don't make mention\nreally of grace or mercy. We want to represent that today by drinking\na bottle of hot sauce. Um, now we're using Frank's Red Hot cuz that's\nkind of the standard for hot sauce. See, I have extra hot and uh, Stacey has regular. So that's just to kinda even the playing field,\nwe wanted to make this fair, and so, we bought hot sauce according to our perceived level\nof spicy enjoyments. I don't think my spice palette is as uh-oh\nmy gosh that's a lot. (laughter) OH! Oh it stinks. My legs are shaking, that's fine. Oh mine are too. You're not even doing this! Can I smell yours? Yeah. Oooohhh! Aaaahhh. Um, so winner this time gets a glass of\nmilk. This is so much more brutal! Like this is terrifying! You have to understand, like without too much\nwork on YouTube I'm sure you can find other people who do this, yeah, but those people\nundoubtedly enjoy and like hot sauce. Okay, go for it. Okay, here we go! 3, 2, 1, GO! OH! I don't like the flavour of this, and it's\nburning me. Hahahaha! (coughing) I can't even talk. You've already drank way more than me, but\nI already feel like I'm on the verge of throwing up, so I'm afraid to-you win! I just wanted to get it done! Oh my gosh. So, anyway, the point is proven that when,\nyou sign up for a YouTube channel you don't know what you're in for. When you present the gospel, you need to keep the whole character of God in mind. The reason the gospel is so good is because\nwe have a God who was willing to step into our brokenness and fix it. God is faithful to judge, and He's also faithful\nto save from judgment. And we need to keep both of those things in\nmind. Both honey and hot sauce are not very good\non their own. If you mix them, and use them in moderation,\nthey make a delicious sauce for any dish. Oh my gosh. Love and judgment are both important, let's\ngo, let's get out of here. Like and comment below! Click my glass of milk to subscribe to our\nchannel!

[Applause] [Music] hello Alexia foodies today I'm going to teach you how to make a take on a bolognese sauce a traditional Italian meat sauce now I've used this sauce for my baked macaroni my lasagna or just drink it like soup it is absolutely delicious in under five minutes I'm going to teach you how to make this dish now later and I have some family and friends coming over for Sunday dinner so guess what we're gonna eat this later and you're gonna see it so stick around so here are the ingredients you're gonna need to make this dish let's start with the ground beef I did two and a half pounds of ground chuck and two pounds of ground sirloin then let's go to the garlic I did six cloves of fresh minced garlic about a cup of Italian seasoned breadcrumbs some cool low heat the olive oil we did some garlic salt cracked black pepper garlic powder a cup and a half of pecorino romano my favorite some chopped fresh basil some red chilli flakes the mama Lara's secret ingredient a little bit of sugar so I did about a tablespoon and a half of sugar and now the best posting kitchen ready tomatoes my favorite and then we're going with some water and I'll show you how to do it let's take it to the stove don't forget your wooden spoon so we're gonna start with about 6 tablespoons of pollo Vita right into the pan now we preheated this pan now we're adding in the garlic and we're gonna saute that garlic there is nothing like the smell of fresh garlic say that up gets a little golden brown and I'm gonna add in some red chili flakes why because I love things spicy now I always do a little shake of my garlic check that out nice toasty golden brown now we're gonna add in the ground beef now we're adding in the ground beef right in okay and what I like to do I get my mixin chopped or some pampered chefs and I stop breaking up the beef now we're going to season the beef I consider it kind of like making a meatball in the pan except we're not using eggs okay so check it out this is what we're gonna do we're gonna add in our breadcrumbs right in our pecorino romano some cracked black pepper okay you can also add some more later we're gonna go with a little garlic sauce a little garlic powder as if we didn't have enough fresh garlic flavor we need a little more cuz we love garlic the stinking rose now we're gonna add in some water and we're actually gonna poach this beef we're gonna poach this paint it's gonna get really really nice and tender and I'll show you what its gonna look like in a couple of minutes stick around so the ground beef has been cooking down on medium for about five minutes it becomes very very tender it almost has a creamy consistency because we are poaching it in the water so let me show you what it looks like at this point this is the consistency and color you're looking for it's very very soft and velvety and now we're gonna add in the kitchen ready tomatoes so I just turned the heat to low we're gonna add in our pasta kitchen ready tomatoes five cans two four and a half pounds of ground beef so now we're gonna season the bolognese sauce and we're gonna let it simmer for about five hours on low check it out this is what we're doing next we're gonna add in our fresh basil buzzing a gulp is nothing like it some sugar the mama Lara as I told you and we're gonna do some more cracked black pepper and a little garlic salt again we're gonna mix this all up and we're gonna come back in about five hours and check it out stick around alexia foodies so this is what we're looking for about half way through check out this beautiful see that oil coming to the top so you're gonna keep stirring it remember in the movie Goodfellas you're gonna keep stirring the sauce alright so we're about halfway through here see you soon so I've just boiled the rigatoni now I took them out extra al dente cuz don't forget we're gonna be baking this into the oven for about a half hour until all the cheese is bubbly and is baked macaroni you know so let me show you how you're gonna assemble this so we're starting our layers we're gonna start by building the base which is this beautiful bolognese sauce look at that is that beautiful or what love it now we're gonna add in our first layer of rigatoni right in so after I added the rigatoni I added another layer of the bone yeas and now we're doing dollops of arugula now we're adding in our shredded mozzarella okay next some pecorino pecorino romano right on the top and now we're gonna go with some basil fresh beautiful basil and now we're gonna repeat the steps so it is done all the layers of the baked macaroni are ready to go we're gonna cover it with some aluminum foil pop it into the oven on 375 for about a half hour until all that cheese is delicious and bubbly look at that I want to eat it right now Lexia I think the big macaronis ready Oh dad take it out for me everyone is starving all right here we go I love it Wow yeah look at that are you ready to eat okay so what do

grab the fry I looked up closer I'm like hello everyone welcome back to another mukbang with me for 10 fresh you guys today I got kanji queen yeah I'm very excited for kanjou King I've been waiting for so long to eat kanji Queen and we finally got it if you guys don't know what kanji Queen is it's a Chinese restaurant here in Toronto it's very famous and I've got their rice noodles with soy sauce and I've got a deep fried fish I have no idea what fish this is but it's very good and we've also got sweet and sour sauce for the fish and I've got a diet coke all right let's get all this congee Queeny my belly right now that is the noodle looks fired with beef on it and they put some onions on it oh my god if you've never had these noodles we have to have these noodles so you can relate with me how good they are I'm kind of struggling with the chopsticks today the aging gods are gonna hate me today with these chopsticks skills is so tight I'm going to need some muscle so I guys I'm finally back in Toronto obviously because I'm having this I'm in Toronto I got my fork I'm just going to go full force on this because I'm super hungry the chopsticks couldn't take forever it is not efficient for me right now I know how good this is gonna be it's not really crispy but flavor it's out there salty flaky damn you noodles are almost done I'm meeting this so fast I haven't had it in months so you could imagine how much I've been missing it Oh baby Oh baby so it's super cold here in Toronto like three Fahrenheit -16 today - 17 - 15 it's been like this for a couple days it's super cold super freezing I have like it's snowing it's nice though like it's you know what's wrong with the home cities it's nice but now the funny story for you guys when I was super young I think I was like 9 or 10 years old 9 or 10 years old I wear glasses so like right now I'm wearing contacts I'd normally wear glasses all the time my vision is super bad like it's like - like negative 6 is my vision so when I was younger cause that ski chalet with my cousin's with Montreal I didn't have my glasses on right cuz I took them off because it gets fogged up and stuff when you go into the chalet when you have your glasses on outside when super cold you walk in and it's and it's it fogs up so you go in you take them off I took them off and I'm walking I saw my cousin sitting at a table right so I go up to that table I grab a fry I'm like oh you guys call fries amazing so I grab the fry I looked up closer I'm like I put my glasses on I'm like oh you guys are my cousins my cousins were the next table over and my cousins like hey what are you doing what are you doing like we're right here we're right here and I'm like oh I was gonna put it back on the trade she's like no you could keep it you could have that fry and I'm like oh I'm so sorry like I thought you guys were my cousins I didn't have my classes on I didn't see you guys my cousins are over there so I'm just gonna you know go over there and like no problem you're laughing so hard that's all bad my vision noise his end was watch and is was is so that's when I don't have my glasses on also when I was at that ski place that seems spa it was funny because I didn't have my glasses on majority of like not majority like some parts I wouldn't have it on because if I fall really hard on the snow it would break my glasses so I something I wouldn't have it on I'll skiing down I lost my cousins because I couldn't see them anymore cuz I don't have my glasses on right I went through this trail I thought it was part of the ski trail it wasn't I just went through it there's trees and everything I'm like this doesn't look familiar like this does not look like that trail it does not look like that trail that we were just on so I'm going through and like this is not right why is it snow so deep too like it wasn't like cleaned this this snow wasn't clean it was just all fluffy like it's like really thick and like it was really high and then I'm actually get out cuz security saw me going through it imagine seeing a tenure old going through a trail in the trees there's actual trails right here and but I'm going this way my vision has gone in worse though I was a minus 5 negative 5 now I'm a negative 6 so I eventually do want my laser eye surgery done lassic surgery I think last week laser gun I killed this I'm gonna leave these two for my bro he wanted he really wanted them someone leave him for him my sister won't eat it cuz she's on a keto diet she's not eating bread or rice I'm like bro you're too young to worry about keto diets when I was her age in grade 9 I would go to my Burger King and I would buy two when there when you when we I don't know if they still have them - whoa $5 whopper Wednesday's whopper Wednesday's I would go and buy two combos for ten bucks of whoppers and just eat those for lunch - whopper combos for five bucks each that was my lunch and sometimes if I wanted to I would upgrade it to a poutine so I would get more fries I hope you guys all enjoy this if you guys do enjoy it give it a like subscribe and comment if you guys don't enjoy this video don't forget to Like

guys are all having a wonderful day and we will see you guys in a bit [Music]", "zk6BKGw_Ieo": "uh-uh you and your bacon grease sauce soubise you don't have enough you can add some oil or some shortening it needs to get hot you know see how its foaming out there you know it's alright flour is consistent with how much you know oil or drippings you've got right be careful doing it this way because you gulp out too much and you're in trouble you can always add it you make you crazy artistic juice yes but but wait turkey gravy you know I might like Nami my turkey baby that's not I just use cornstarch in you get the drippings the whole broth and everything boiling or greater boil see that's still just a little bit too thin for me cuz I like a thick gravy yeah I'm saying you can only that a little bit more honey I'm still getting used to this pan but this is what makes or breaks your thickness of your gradient again you if you get too thick you can only that little water milk go ahead and put your pepper in and maybe a bacon salty already so don't you know we're crazy especially people or peanuts awesome drippings that's still to running for me but you just always with me you're like man this turns out so once you get the consistency that you like the thickness here is when you add the milk and it's got a brown this this is what causes rayon yeah I like right here this would be considered to me like I want gravy almost you don't get it and sometime judge okay I'm you know so I add a little bit more bacon grease here a little more flour because the thickening is what causes it to be thick if you don't get enough thickening in your kind of doomed you can't change it at the end but it's harder but you want it kind of pasty like this yeah it's kind of sticking together and since I'm really wanting a good pan full of gravy I'm probably gonna add just a little bit more my bacon grease and flour and this is the stage you can do it but the worst thing you can do is make it too thick to where you have to thin it down even in the see how that pin that down I'm gonna add a little bit more flour that's how you're making a bigger bag doesn't make it a big batch pepper salt I'm not gonna do cuz me you can only salt it on the table where everybody gonna lose all right I mean you're only putting my clock teaspoons of time here okay but it's how much difference it made how much thicker it made it I don't know what you call it extra see how it's getting Brown here that's almost looking batter yeah see how much brown are slipping already go a little bit more baking there we go almost looks crumbly thing out separating them looking I'm just going to put the brown they're usually not going to crack that backdoor step with it though for them I usually turn my painting on the bottom what kind of heat pretty quick media but yet medium huh yeah they just open it real fast and you can stand there it's smoky I usually time okay yeah that's good I'm trying my family that's how it's starting to smell yeah like Superman when you scrape the bottom it almost looks like a brown sticking bottom okay you got to keep stirring if you leave it you will burn it this one this one helps get the flavor until you get this crazy the paint this pan is kind of gold if you will the flatter pan you would be doing this all around horn iron skillet or an iron skillet would be doing at all not just from the middle this one's kind of making the most contact we're almost there really close come out zi brown brown together very very close oh yeah all right now you can turn the heat down a little bit we've been pouring this milk in a minute it's a little high that's probably as brown as I'd want to go to smell it how it smells hmm I gotta burn it now you can do this one a few way you can take it off the heat you're afraid to see it well good job kind of swelling - yeah well you self-rising flour by the way see how that looks like that's about what six to eight cups of milk yeah how much smoke was that like that's almost half right there down half of the other one plus the reason I did it with this my mom always give just with the spoon but I have bad luck if you don't get that broke up quickly and it clumps together that's how you get lumpy gravy so from here I go with this now you're thinking mmm that looks that looks weird but how still see along the the gravy stuff slipped in there here and as I say it's flutter now you can I mean you heard of backup now it's gonna take forever just gotta stay with it but if I would have left the pan on there you could have turned it down right before you think it's getting ready cuz the pan will be caught you could said okay I'm gonna turn this down because I'm getting ready at the milk I chose to take it off the thing but you don't have to and again I don't like this pan see how it's not me just you just do it slow and easy you wouldn't have to like whip it or yeah and but if you see any clumps big big clumps I should be okay and you can walk away for just a minute on that one but you know I'll leave it too long my mom always used to figure okay great I said she was good she didn't have to you and I mean you could use a spanner at this point once you get past this oh wow let me see that that Browns kind of bunched up to the top now I've got a little bit my milk and water over here because I have a feeling I'm gonna need to add it but I don't want to yeah I'd rather wait and thin it now let me get toward the end because it can't thicken up on the bowl and can but it's harder because then you've got to try to put fire and milk lucky do cornstarch and water you can do quick and then it really tries to lump so it's easier when you smell that it's getting thick it's easier to thin if I'm no good yeah I'd rather make my greasy half hour if you dig and pour in a little bit less when I think and then get it down at the end because it doesn't change the flavor it just denser yeah and that's looking very good that's I guess the other day all those love it too thick they do a lot a little bit more they probably won't have enough salt because on again I don't I don't over salt it cuz everybody seems like they reek salt pepper anyway and that was a good thing because I can already feel the drag a little bit Brad know what we did the other day you see there you for having a BL and it starts there enough foamy on top too and you know you know it's getting ready to pick them you can do chicken right this way it don't take this long when you're not chicken gravy you're not gonna make a big pan full with this or like you guys you have to figure out how much you won't be using a big skill like this I don't figure look at that we don't know that for two people like you know you know three people like you guys they might be done because you don't want to leave this gone too long you can for just a minute but", "cKD7ow46g80": "[Music] look at that thing yes sir oh oh the cheese overload yo mmm-hmm that was definitely for news because that was just blackness whoa good just in case I wanted a different thumbnail [Music] Wow Wow oh yeah this cheese right here is a

there's something that a lot of my subs haven't want to see me do sprite cranberry explanatory I've never tried this chug in the world one bottle at a time badly it's chubbs is back [Music]", "969yrQP6-Tk": "[Music] that's can probably guess from the title of the video I'm definitely trying something different today so is that scent I got in the is all in the first part of video I got this new it's actually attractant no it's not tracking it's a fish scent it's a fish gel kind of a bit sense a bit sensors right over here so I've always wondered whether stuff like this works know what got me to try this one was there now it's not like you know some others that I've used are kind of like very watery they have this very just very liquid and then they don't just stick on a bit really well so this one on the other head is like a gel base so this one I think will probably stick on to the bits really well so something is doing today I wouldn't do be doing bring my artificial laws as usual it's just that this time around I have little extra goodness so start of the day I'll be doing some talk to bits first I'll probably start with that bit I threw some time back it's this clarity old thing that's been thrown in the water start off with that first maybe a bit of sand later on see whether or not it changes up my game a little you know first that I would say the water today looks a bit muggier I explained it to I expect to be cleaned off honestly speaking but it's not so that could be a problem because initially my plan was to if I see the fish I'm gonna throw the plastic once and I'll see how it reacts to it yeah the scent and I would throw it again but that is going to be pretty difficult today I think because for one it's murky I can't really see anything so just have to just just try something first yeah so I'll put you guys up and I'll see you guys in a bit so yeah what does really kind of makea today so I'm just working my small soft plastic at all the wheats I said a lot of stuff something about and oh I see what is the issue now what does achieve very low yeah clarity is actually not that better it's just that a water level is very low Oh are you here to hit guys just right below but I was a bit skeptical Hooksett there that is insane size oh that's a huge pass huge yeah let's switch it up I'm just not feeling it on a sleeve for the this bit this morning we get it hit that was it oh well we're gonna use I'd say well a shell or nothing deep for sure I said I use the extra wrap where's that X wrap you know I Drive extract first and then we will change as we go it's not really funny today man that's not really feeling it today carry on my wayward son huh oh he was letting fish man Shh that hurt a little bit okay let's try this again got a bit bloody there but uh just a bit otherwise I'm fine it's a lot of weed here don't know about you hook up wait let's now what do you guys think yeah I'm gonna get hook up a wheat light on my first car so just watch this there you have it like there's no escape here yeah but it looks promising okay hey well I just took the witless again see how swimming action is on this one alright and it's better I think I'm just gonna be a sin right away just see how it how it's like because otherwise it's kind of pointless I just don't use it at all and I'll just see I know if I there's a marked improvement in my bitrate or anything oh it smells like shrimp all right what I'm gonna do is that you want to rub the scent all over I think yeah it does feel kind of gross but otherwise no point in using it oh yeah I just spread it all over Oh or really stays on your hand man no kidding all right we gotta send coated on so now it's time to give our be a shot in case you're wondering I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing for you but she doesn't smell that bad like it's a shrimpy smell but definitely right isn't those very overpowering kind so you know worried that it's gonna be too strong the smell well it's not that strong the shrimp smell is there that's Varela no way guys I got a fish right on the first cuss after I use the sin this is the first class after the sin and I actually caught a fish how cool is that this is pretty cool because it is just my first class like my very first cast so oh there he goes it's off the hook now I go yeah when right there and let him go so I guess I think what better way to represent it I don't effect that I think it works III my first cars after putting on the same like whoa okay there are vast chasing but they aren't really that big I guess it makes sense the scent is the strongest when you first buy your first car so it's particularly good life you see the fish that you know is there a mate that casts over really increases your chances by a lot my opinion oh my god I was enjoying that he ate it I'm gonna try again okay I'm just gonna stand right back didn't I he almost had a grab you love but you didn't eat it that well so I'm just gonna trying to see if this cars can seal the deal it's just gonna give them some space you know what I'll try adding more scent because this is this case I can see like I know he's there so I definitely I know I can invest a bit more into this effort I don't see how he's gonna resist this look let's see if we can get him this time about there I think it's very yes Wow he doesn't money I mean I can see now I don't know a is otherwise the fish anymore but uh I definitely did not see the chase this time around ah I blew my cover probably will have two more haven't caught my bit yeah I really bought my big fish now there we go the shop second one I saw him come in just choked the whole thing right this is a better fish let's get a good look at this guy got him ride and a jaw see like I'm good man this one I got him real good no it is the second fish as you can see so there we go I hope get a good release on this guy and there he goes genius so guys has an update I actually got a fish but I forgot it she fish on my camera all right where I stopped recording but yes there was fish number three and he actually took my entire it's our plastic so that's kind of sad but yeah suffice three fish yeah and I thought was a full month and doing off so back to I was saying I did get a fish I got another full mine small yeah small but I think I got a fish by what the switch on recording so damn it that is the first time that happened to me there we go fish on but it's another one and what the hell I know you guys for before we saw this really but he got my so this guy's had wrote me off too freakin soft plastic 3d I think I'd have you know about this guy's life yeah I thought that provision I caught sort on the same spot which pleased me to believe that there's a probably a school there I think I don't know how they can be so for a voracious well I guess that the way the ones are I mean we pick up West I will lose myself last expla abdomin how every time when I've gone soft plastic so far has robbed me of the soft plastic okay okay how just I just move one first the room pop you got bad but I will rig up yeah thank you okay okay we're back finally I saw a lot sorry just update you guys had lost to your to suffer he said Comanche I want to get Rico pass but won't leave me alone I mean a small Tom Angela I miss y'all I don't know the misunderstanding so I think I'll just move down I can see activity love I'm very sure those are those babydome and which i don't get it because i don't lose another soft lusty here we go ah think I'm a yeah oh it's my biggest be gouyet yeah I was peeling dreck I mean he just hammered me ah there we go folks my personal best peacock breasts yeah Wow all right that's how we do it folks folks I'm shaking no look at this size of that theme oh my god get this look at how he ate that prostate man oh my god like whoa he was a beast oh man he got me it's another look for you guys so that's a definitely a chunk there okay I need a picture oh here I got him real good mitt I got in real good so here's the release for you guys okay [Music] I think this is probably one of my biggest - did wow that was amazing hey welcome back I heard the call it day because the weather is getting pretty hot yeah it is pretty hot so today I guess it was pretty good day now to conclude if the same works or not now you have your own opinions but I have - well I felt that the same in D&D play a part I mean I've used this soft plastic before same presentation without the scent they didn't get I mean a fish would eat you know tell us the fish would actually eat but they don't eat it well in a sense that when they either they tend to like split up very fast I think with the same degree the advantage is that when they eat they tend to really eat it well a whole bear and now such that we have times actually set the hook because for this kind of hooks are they really have to eat the whole thing before you can set the hook laughs oh it's not like a traditional jig head where there's a chance that you can like I would say on a jig head is easy like you hook the fish but on a witness fly data right you need the fish to engulf the entire thing and there is one busy with the Swiss because you know lost the reservoir so very dear I so you see with a scope to me is critical it's a good good good idea we're save myself a lot of trouble and your is that it's less people eating like us Twitter I'm someone who really can't unwin sake safe with her main issue actually get a few fish today I'm not supposed to put a count probably I got about four or five so holiday because best they were identity the something to write they were caught relieved by the send very well because they were both caught like when the set was freshly added to the know itself and maybe they were credit to the said more than action of the law so but I daresay that this lower it looks very natural like when you actually because I like other laws I like other laws that I use for peacock bass right this presentation actually do a very slow one so it tends to be not very conventional peacock baseball right because you think you think about it I pick up best we can to go on a faster side of things typically but this one is a slower more natural-looking retrieve thank goodness the water the other side a multitrack site was quite relatively clear so I can see what's going on which is which we have a better idea which is what let me to catch them bigger one so it's really awesome because that big one right there when it does Kim I understand golf the low and I said the hole wow what a moment like I haven't had that in a just man we have a pickup just pull drive like that it really truly has been a very long time and I am really really grateful for the opportunity but it must be noted ed for that pickup all right the big one the Leo was a freshly caught our scent now I'm sure they still be of sending that which I'm glad for but it was a freshly coated you know like so it was a two towards a point where I was considering whether to add more scent because I think it was really Castle at many times really but you know I just went for it and hey he still took the leo which I'm very happy about boy would be such a bummer if you didn't it'll do I'll be like wash it at the scent but I mean goes to show that like right now I just wanna go for you like okay life to be honest that's not right a thing now but it's doing this I went there I would say what I see with this thing I would say yes because another day right I only have like that many hours of fish so just got to maximize your time I think that adding listen if it increase my chances yeah I know you know just give it a shot plus you know why but it's a nice like it's gel based not those bit cents which are very fluid you look liquidy like don't I think all really similar that well this one is quite well like easily you could it once right for the next 10 cos you have good Sandler is Lilla so it's fun for me I would do it such a way that if I less I really see the fish right I don't fit coated again and then cost-effective but I don't see that I won't put laughs of course yes so I hope you found that useful I personally had a very good day today brought my adays by the way that is mine I was a PBA person the best person the best peacock bass how about it so I'm it's really good for me today I hope you enjoyed this episode and I'll see you guys in the next episode bye bye [Music] oh my God thank God recording man I'll cry I

We're here at the Joint Center of Culinary Excellence in Fort Lee, Virginia on the Navy side of the house and today I am going to be demonstrating how to make fresh pasta. So what you want to do is make a well in the very center of it. You just want to start bringing your dough together. Just in the center.  We're going to let the mixer finish off the rest of it. An Italian grandmother would probably be cursing me right now if she saw this but um, she's just going to have to curse me. You know that you have the correct dough when it is fully smooth. If you don't let it rest long enough you're gonna have this just tacky looking dough. You want to make sure whenever you first feed it through that it's on the lowest setting. Always just go until I can see my hand pretty clear all the way through it. But there's 1000 different ways that you can cook pasta and get different shapes.  You can easily do it with a knife by just cutting it lengthwise, folding it over once and then running through it with a knife. It's as easy is that and you have fettuccine. You want salt it last minute. A good rule of thumb for salting your water is you want it to taste like you just took a big gulp of seawater. But like I said, I mean have fun with it. There's no right or wrong way to do it if you're in America. If you go to Italy that's a different story (laughs). Have fun (laughs).", "AbnQAqM8PIk": "so [Music] so uh so [Music] so so so so so so so [Music] so [Music] okay [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so so so so so

my journey to achieve the goal but before we get into week twos content I want to explain why I want to get to twelve percent body fat there's some vanity reasons obviously why I want to get there so the average male is able to see their six-pack when they're between ten and thirteen percent body fat so that's where the twelve percent comes into play but for every one is different depending on their genetics and where they store their body fat so for me at twelve percent I'm able to see pretty good definition that satisfies my desire for what I think is an ideal physique for me well that's different for everyone else additionally it's a percentage where I'm able to maintain by having a healthy and balanced diet so it won't be a struggle for me to maintain that so those are the main reasons why I feel that twelve percent is an ideal body fat percentage for me but obviously that will differ for the individual so aside from backtalk now let's get back to the content for a week - alright so week two physique update I'm weighing in at a hundred and fifty-five pounds as you can see there's still some body fat in the lower abs compared to last week there's more separation from the upper to lower abs so I lost three pounds this week which has been about ten days it's a little aggressive I want to maintain around 1% of body weight lost for a week so now moving on to the back act still defined not much to change between the two weeks progress has been pretty good from week 1 to week 2 I'm satisfied now to pose for the camera for my modeling career stick out the tongue hey [Music] now let's do the arm workout biceps shoulder and tricep routine let's get that pump in now start with a standard bicep curl ten to twelve reps I'm really going slowly here to maximize the time under tension next let's transition to the alternating shoulder press for ten to twelve reps on each side next bench dips 30 reps so here's a pretty standard bench dip you can make this a little harder by moving it to one leg [Music] you can go insane with this as well by putting your legs on something else and trying it out repeat that routine two more times now for the next routine let's start out with supinated bicep curls for 10 to 12 reps for each arm so we're starting with the neutral hand position and squeezing and twisting next seated shoulder press for 10 to 12 reps [Music] and let's end this routine with a single tricep extension 8 to 10 reps on each side [Music] let's repeat that routine two more times for the next routine let's started out with inner hammer curls eight to ten reps on each side this exercise has been really good to widen my biceps additionally look at that pump look at those veins pumping the camera doesn't want to mess with me camera doesn't want to mess with me staring it down we're not done though let's go to the straight shoulder applies 10 to 12 reps [Music] now let's do overhead tricep extension for 10 to 12 reps and let's repeat that routine two more times now for the final routine let's start out with seated bicep curls ten to twelve reps for each arm [Music] now let's do the lateral filter flies for 10 to 12 reps [Music] finally let's end with the tricep kickbacks 10 to 12 reps my form is horrendous on this I look like The Hunchback of Notre Dom look at that neck it's not straight at all ooh knees improvement let's repeat that routine two more times and we're done look at that pump let's go now let's get into the healthy salmon recipe so first off I use a scale to measure everything so I know the calories and the macro distribution of everything so first let's cut up a couple of mushrooms next let's cut up about a quarter of an onion finely let's use this cauliflower rice so this entire bag is 50 calories and only six grams of net carbs so it's a lot of quantity of food that fills you up and it's not calorically dense so it's great for when you're trying to lose weight so let's add a little bit of salt to this and some chili powder this is optional but I like it spicy I'm gonna add a little bit now let's mix it all up [Applause] [Music] that's how it looks now let's prepare the salmon so let's add a little bit of olive oil to a small mixing bowl about half a tablespoon now let's add a little bit of salt and some garam masala for the spice now let's apply this mix to the salmon [Music] next let's make the sauce which is inspired by a recipe I'll put the details in the description cup of cilantro fourth of a cup of five a 2% Greek yogurt half a tablespoon of olive oil about one and a half tablespoons of lime juice and finally a jalapeno I would probably recommend just doing half but I put the whole thing in there and finally a little bit of salt blend this baby up all right now it's time for cooking let's cook the cauliflower rice by just putting it on a pan with a little bit of oil in a little bit of water [Music] next let's cook the salmon with some olive oil cook it until it's like well done because that's how I like it but whatever suits you now let's plate the dish so I have the rice and the salmon on top and now I'm putting the sauce as though I'm chef ramsay let's see how it turns out kinda looks like a McDonald's M which is ironic since I haven't been to McDonald's in like five years now let's get to the good part and let's eat the salmon it looks pretty cooked taking that big gulp right there and let's eat it up I think some people think this is the speed I actually eat things I'm a very fast eater which is not great because you need to really appreciate the food while you eat it but I guess to each their own and we're done thanks for watching this week's episode to continue to follow my journey subscribe to my channel [Music]", "ebH_fZQadYo": "on

series where i usually talk about something i built and why i built it that way today's going to be a little bit different today we're going to talk about dust collection on the table saw [Music] the reason i'm doing this video in to learn the logic series format is i've gotten a lot of questions about how i combat dust collection on a table saw which as a lot of you guys know it can be a little bit complicated there's lots of areas on a table saw where dust can get out and especially on a contractor style table saw like this one active dust collection is not actually built into it it's something that i had to add not super difficult it works pretty well but with the motor hanging out of the back of this unit as it is with I think all contractor table saws getting dust collection around the belt that is going to be moving back and forth when you when you miter the saw blade is very very tricky and we will talk about that when we get around to the back of the saw I think I'm just going to abandon the typical questions that I usually ask on the learning of logics because this one is just so different I'll just talk to you guys chair what I did on this one so hopefully you can do this on your contractor saw as well let's start looking up underneath the table first at the top of the saw and we'll work our way down from there with the different things that I encountered as you can see right here I have filled all of the potential open areas with insulation so between the the box of the cabinet itself and the table saw there's just some fiberglass insulation stuffed up in there to close the gap that was wide open up there and this prevents any dust from leaking out on the side and getting all over the floor moving around to the back of the saw which this is typically a hundred percent wide open here so you can see where I added some probably eighth inch plywood and a couple spacers to close gaps and try to close in the whole back now with the contractor style table saw the belt and this whole motor mechanism bevel up into this area so you got to leave that open you can you can probably close this in with some - style materials I haven't had the time to add that and quite frankly I found it's worked well enough so far I don't know what improvements that might add because it is a soft stache it's technically just like a broom hanging there and wide open I don't know that it would actually direct more suction towards the blade which is where you want your airflow coming down from to grab all that dust so personally I don't think I'm going to be adding the sauce - maybe it would be a good experiment but right now this works pretty well now moving down underneath the saw itself this is like an angled hopper that I added with a fitting for a flexible dust collection hose I give these flexible dust collection hoses from NARS they are I believe $20 for a 10-foot section but this was just some pieces of plywood that I glued together and it sits on a frame so the whole thing actually just sets inside the cabinet and I can lift that whole thing out if I needed to I believe I can actually get it out without taking the table off just like twisting it around knowing finagling with it to get it out of there this has a cut in half Union for the sewer and drain PVC that I use for all of the dust collection and the flexible piping just happens to pinch right in there and that is just glued on to the hopper itself with some construction adhesive another thing that I probably should have mentioned at the beginning is this salt has zero active dust collection on it it has that angle tray in the bottom where the heavier dust would fall onto and slide onto the floor but that was it I would imagine though that newer contractor style salt will have something maybe it's just a shopback fitting around the blade itself for a little bit of active discussion the highly that was as good as a four or six inch system connected to a high power blower like we have here another thing I want to mention is the style of blade you use greatly affect the amount of dust that's thrown back at you and that is thrown on top of the table as well you need to make sure you have a tooth pattern on your blade can collect the chips and throw them down into the salt instead of swimming all the way around the blade and throwing them back at you so pay attention to the tooth patterns on there I personally have found I get the best dust collection with a combination style blade which has some bigger grooves in it to gather that Dustin throw it down into the salt well there you are guys hope that helps some of you out and answer some of the questions I've been hitting lately a quick summary of what I've done insulation around the cabinet and the table of the box to close in the upper portion as much as you possibly can I used some amazing spider to close in the back as much as I could with the contractor style fall that needs that big opening I made a dust hopper in the bottom of the salt with a port for active dust collection system and then you want to pay attention to your blade pattern to be able to collect most of that dust and throw it down into the saw instead of back at you you guys enjoyed this video please hit that thumbs up button helps us out a ton hit the subscribe button right over there so you never miss when

guys think scent works I have a small collection of cents and fish attractants over here and I want you to tell me if you've ever used them or if you think they work so this is a strange list of items to review here I can't really vouch for because I can't really prove that they work or not I'm curious to see what you guys think the first item spy kit this says spy kit garlic dip in glow so this is a garlic scented chartreuse a dip 14 inch worm if I were to dip the tail in here and pull it out it would be chartreuse I think there's another brand of this out there called JJ's magic I have never caught a fish using this stuff particularly so I'm wondering if you guys like this or have any tips on how to make it work alright the next one I'm going to look at power of eight that's attractant

power bait fish attractant does this work all right let's take a look at the next one liquid mayhem this is the best attractant made with real crawfish it smells kind of like Vaseline and a little bit fishy this one does this one work for you guys I've used this one before and I've caught fish while using it but I'm not sure if it's because of this or if this didn't matter alright let's check out some more mister goop fish formula water repellent formula stays on longer garlic all natural oils herbs biodegradable non-toxic I've never used this one it smells like garlic do you guys use garlic

anybody out there does anyone use bang brand fish attractant and finally this one this one's a little different gulp I mainly bought it for the juice inside to use as an attractant on other baits does anyone have luck with this gulp juice in particular I'm going to try it on some Krauze or something so here we have 11 different fish attractants and I don't know if any of them work so far the only thing they have attracted is me I have purchased all of these and I'm hoping they work it could be superstitious it could give me a false sense of security but I don't even know if I mind that

some hot drinks you know warms the soul little toesies it's just all we want it keeps the people going keeps me going so lately going to talk about the ingredients for my two favorite that i'm making today we got the goods for the hot today hot whisky totty and then the goods for hot buttered rum truly the best of both worlds that's why i like kind of showcasing both of them because i do think they hit different spots hot butter realm is dessert hot hot toddy medicinal so they say you know where people say they would just drink these and just sweat out whatever they weren't feeling so don't quote me on that i don't know if that's in the vaccine but um you know all right two drinks quick rundown of both ingredients and then we'll get into the good stuff the hot toddy yo easy easy money for both drinks i've got my hot water going so you might hear that little screech soon it's nobody being injured that i'm keeping in my apartment and locked up it's the kettle it's that kettle gloria both things are both all appliances are gloria in this house because they're all just like fierce queens that love a good song hurry up all right so hot water for both the best thing about hot drinks you can build this in the glass we'll talk about that a little further hot toddy's just going to be a lemon juice honey you can make a honey syrup if this is a little too thick but like i want to be a rich you know what i mean like when stephanie rich girl and a drink that's us and then i popped a very special bottle that's going to be the base spirit of the hot toddy yeah you can do truly any booze uh i personally love either irish whiskey scotch or or bourbon rye would be pretty rad too but that's the hot toddy and we'll talk about the rest of the process as we're rocking and rolling hot buttered rum did make this ahead of time ahead of time little spices i was lazy i guess anti-lazy because i ground the nutmeg so it's about did one and a half teaspoons of cinnamon half teaspoon nutmeg half teaspoon clove and set them aside enjoy the aromatics you know what i mean so i've got granulated sugar over here i'm going to do eight ounces of granulated sugar it's just convenient i hate using cups because this is a sweet pea also eight ounces of dark brown sugar you could do light but dark brown will go way better with the baking spices we've got going in here bitter powder all right so i'm gonna transfer this to the big guy and i'm gonna get my butter also now actually i could just mix all my dry ingredients a little baking video so we got all the sugar and now nutmeg clove oh my god cinnamon i can't forget about cinnamon she's always the best you know what i mean all right cool sweet you don't really have to mix anything yet you could i'm not gonna i'm just gonna make sure this butter is real soft yeah it's nice okay so very convenient eight ounces butter so so far it's been equal parts two sugars and butter in that bad oh yeah so you could mix this by hand if you have a mixer you can also do that i want to give it a go by hand and then if it doesn't go well i'll use a mixer i'll do it i'll do it this is what we're looking at now that's helpful it feels nice i can already tell i should do it with a mixer [Laughter] so now it looks more like like a thick paste almost that's what you want because that means the butter and the sugar are like officially incorporated  yeah ready to proceed you know because i'm doing the half recipe you could just get a pint of ice cream i'm using vanilla and then next time a little aged rum in there some homemade whipped cream yo yeah that's nice sweet and this can actually last i believe up to three months in the freezer we can factor i know it's like a good amount of time dose and then hot buttered rum highly recommend aged it's very important i think so just because this is gonna this isn't gonna handle all the baking flavors baking spices i should say so i like to go five year or higher this is a seven year she's seen some oak or he whatever you identify as we love you know respect yeah so those are the ingredients i'm going to do a little heavy cream trick on top you know because we want all of our all of our saturated fats with this one drink and yeah and that's and that's the low down so we'll get going hot toddy again drinks are built it's so easy and i just feel like it's a satisfying drink either way hits the spot but also like it is extremely easy to make at home and you can do all your fun spins it's whatever you want i'm keeping a preacher dish because i feel like that's what the people want to see and i feel like i'm the person to take you there you know what i'm saying girl some people put angostura bitters in there i don't i don't always it depends on my vibe but today i'm not feeling it so that's fine so what do we say cheapest ingredients first i've got lemon juice in here i squeezed ahead of time because you don't need to see me rolling fruit and stuff and like separating seeds and all that good good i'm doing a half ounce of lemon here set that buddy down i've got my uh my lovely uh new york state honey oh hey somebody's knocking all right shut up all right off yours all right half ounce of honey so already we're doing we've got our citrus out the way oh wow this is gonna take a sec hey this is why you do the honey syrup i just want it to be like a thicker thing but like if you wanted to make a honey syrup a lot of bars will do that they'll just cut honey with uh equal parts water so like if you want to make one cup honey one cup boiling water mix her up it's just gonna make it easier to pour as you can see so we're just gonna stand here let this go so right now all we got lemon dusty honey i'm just going to stand here because you know i don't want i don't want to waste anything it's a thick coating because i'm not at work i'm home sipping on this you just do a little scoop to do you know why not whatever whatever all right so lemon honey the booze i recommend two ounces so yeah hudson baby bourbon lovely they use a hundred percent corn from i think i believe that they grow it that could be wrong oh new york corn love that aged under four years but this she's been sitting in this boss since 2016. i bottled it myself and there's proof so right two ounces of bourbon in there or again any whiskey you want that's why they say hot whisky totty insert whatever you prefer love irish i feel like irish is probably most traditional but yes i got it i gotta brag yes queen bottled by me boop money shot now lit so this is everything right now and all we need to do is top it with boiling water you could you could measure it but i don't think it's necessary i usually go under the handle because one it's enough like if i were to sploosh this i'm not going to like burn a cat or myself which is safe all right so here we go right under the handle i'm going to get a little spoon you could use a bar spoon tablespoon definitely use your finger this is when we do not use our finger people all right so traditionally the hot toddy you would just do like a lemon peel or a lemon wheel and just like skewer with clothes it's not always my favorite thing i i love nutmeg after working at dead rabbit and black tail they just kind of burn nutmeg into your brain like nutmeg is god i was like yes girl you're right you're right so we're just gonna we're just gonna microplane a little or if you have a nutmeg grater don't don't plot the whole thing in there sweet yo money all right so this is the hot toddy so so easy like what did i really have to buy you already have honey maybe you don't have whiskey but like you could do whatever you want and lemons boil some water this is so easy i love it ian's not here to drink this today sorry but i am so it's just like i it kind of is medicinal in a good way because like it's just like almost like fakes you out like ginger could be in there which ginger would be a great addition i'm not gonna lie just warms the soul again a little citrus good for the gut it's just nice yo that's the toddy right there shall we do dessert brown brown round two brown brown so this is what we're saying dessert in a glass if you go somewhere do a little outdoor dining if you do god bless good for you it's cold out there but supporting your local bars very cool magical so almost even easier than the hot toddy because i literally took this container out of the freezer as you saw and i'm just this can stay in the freezer three months yo if you make this now fun fact january 17th national hot butter drum day bet you didn't know that and now you do just love some probably useless information in your head but don't you forget because i'm gonna be sipping this that day celebration so you can get super particular not necessary i just have like one of a bit like a bigger soup spoon so like a tablespoon of cocktail right but this is like you know if you're feeling a little freaky you want to get some extra butter well this is a big chunk but it's it's so good it really is like it's kind of cool to see the texture too so this is right the ice cream the butter sugar it's it's so dope it's just a very convenient thing to have all right so we got the one scoop in our in our mug luckily i have glass mugs so we can see what's happening here but you know put in a coffee mug pretend it's coffee i don't know do it feels right whatever uh same as the hot toddy two ounces booze i feel like that's usually safe it's just enough where it's not gonna overpower the rest of the cocktail just because we have so many cool flavors going on so i got my two ounces right here right now it's like two inches like a full a full shot kind of a wild shot a double gulp if you will what was they what they call it 7-eleven big gulp like a big goal but yeah again so you see how it settles to work definitely you gotta mix it in but that's why i love the next step i love freshly whipped cream on a hot drink it looks beautiful it tastes real good you can like pick a mess around the flavors i think because this cocktail has a good amount going on i'm just going to keep it so this is a trick it's a little bar time trick right here so if you have a protein shaker that will get your whipped cream going you know even like the little uh protein ball great but if not this is a spring this is like off in other videos when we strain just a shaking cocktail with a hawthorne straighter if you remove the the sprig spring sprig anyway you'll pop it in all right got my heavy cream this could take a sec i'm not gonna lie but like it's worth it it's so worth it we're just gonna do like a little one two three four safe say okay just in case in case we have to make another like whatever fine so now we'll call it the dry shake because like you're not adding anything else like this is just whipped cream my spring is in here i'm just gonna shake it this can take a sec but like the cream is beautiful you can also buy it whipped cream whatever but i had this and i was like i don't really want to waste dairy i can shake away so like a lot of bars will do this in a pinch it's really cool so we could do a little check so you see it's like she going i might actually have to add a little more because i'm pretty strong your girl is swole as the kids say an adult say whatever we're all we're all here all right so i'm gonna do a gentle shake because i don't want to over whip it you don't want stiff peaks we just want twin peaks should be having straight whipped cream this will be cool all right sweet so that is done i'm going to set you aside because we don't need you just yet we got that boiling water my kettle yo she she keeps it real real toasty oh mamma mia so i'm gonna do again to that fill line of right under the handle you can do as much water as you want for me it just like hasn't failed yet so we roll with it do a little mixer rooney as you see it's kind of settling at the bottom oh it's so good so you just go in just as soon as everything seems incorporated and if you see any chunks i use a vanilla bean ice cream so that's what that is but also like you don't have to use ice cream traditionally it would just be butter sugar and baking spices ice creams are something i thought was pretty rad and i love ice cream okay oh my god all right cool beans i got my whip so this is when you can add whipped cream if you really want to load up as i do because i'm a monster so i either will do more nutmeg or a little cinnamon i'm just a cinnamon lady so i'm just gonna do a gentle pet of course if you have a cinnamon stick you can also do that with a microplane i got my ground because i put this in my coffee every day sweet yo hot buttered rum magical you can keep a spoon in there if you want to mix up everything but like it is literally christmas in a glass it's a banger barbara brown better batter let's get at her hmm i'm just getting a little distracted getting lost in my own sauce that's a little gross to say you always want to wrap up feeling good i hope you made these cocktails at home get to enjoy it you know get to experience

some but they all sound good now now all of them it's my top three how you like that I like that answer y'all can't be asking somebody and you don't want y'all you can't ask a parent who they favorite kid is now they might have one but that won't need to stop it this is you got a favorite kid y'all don't even don't stop it oh now we know it ain't none of the Sun yes Wow Wow guys look sons daughters I love you all the same okay but no all of them are good it depends on how you cook so I would ask you a question and say what I think you how you cooked because they're all actually good for if I had to say definitely get three oh that's a hard one your repertoire do you need at least five these five to be able to survive and it's here like in this here on easier interwebs and in your kitchen I'm gonna say you definitely need go to some variation of the go to blend the salt or the no salt blue I'm gonna say you definitely most definitely if specially if you do any kind of Mexican food you want to do the tex-mex blend I want to say you definitely need the seasonings blend the pink Himalayan seasoning blend I want to say you definitely lead the Creole blend I'm gonna say you definitely need the spicy seafood blend is that five if that's not five and guess what pick another one but guess what y'all y'all can be asking me that what's five now what is 16 about things fire was enough come on now somebody yawn oh goodness well that's the wrong question to ask me but they're all good believe me they are all good alone or together or mix I know a lot of people were telling me now that I mix this with this we're we're bending they said what maple-bacon and what did it wasn't it make it bacon ya know somebody said they mix two of their blend they mix two of our blends together and I think was something and maple bacon I wish I should have paid more attention this kind of like school I'm paying enough attention so I don't really know the answer so that's all I gotta say about that that's all I got to say about that so how you guys doing I love you guys man what's the names of the knives Dinah Rogers this was one of our former sponsors cut they have a store called cut stores k utt store.com they have a really good affordable rate balanced precision knives it's a really high-end knife very good price there are even portable human a guy like me can afford them so he had cut sides say you tt-there on Amazon and they are on and on their website cut store that time well you know I've been giving them a lot of shoutouts because they're not one of our sponsors anymore sure I

chives black pepper poppy seed paprika cayenne celery white pepper I gotta breathe because there's a lot of stuff in here marjoram marjoram rosemary basil parsley thyme onion and garlic goddang that's a lot of stuff and then no salt blend so you got a really good flavor in there and we're also using it in our sauce so that's a good idea basically take this out my way before I start eating this man

you doing what's the other meat beside the hamburger use it well Nana got some pork neck breakfast sauces cuz this will we do we can't we grab stuff out their refrigerator and make it into a meal you probably got this in here you probably got it from the dollar store it was two dollars so you could spend $2,000 on to meet like this we got some 73% lean beef that was three dollars so you know I would probably make it way too much because we still in that mode where we had six kids and we sometimes forget we're not cooking for eight people we just we just have me and her so we're gonna have some leftovers probably that for that'll give us a day to not do cooking with greens and actually these leftovers one day I know that hurts y'all heart that we can't cook and get fat every single day but we're gonna be all more than where we normally work uh-huh what's something that said y'all have encouraged me to modify my diet haven't eaten out in three weeks using my seasonings ah right here right here my heart right here Mauro and that's all we want to do we don't have to be great we don't have to uh be the best of anything and and we espouse the fact that guess what we'd let you guys know we are not steps we don't know all the answers but we're not afraid to create and try in the kitchen and if people just do that people get to the point I like I will cook but I don't know how to cook I would try something new well chicken is safe and meatloaf because I know how to make just erase all of that if you need a little kick start we have our cooking show our cooking website cooking

going to start incorporating some of the spices in here and you guys saw the spice blends that we use we use our herb we use our go-to we use a little bit of our no salt onion black pepper and we use what a miss me all the herb blend yeah so I'll get a little bit of that in there and just let it do its darn thing just let it do I need to said the bread is ready man be good it's gonna be good

sister uh potty-trained my nephew and then she said when she's done there New Orleans and hang out with my my sisters and that's there and then she's gonna come home a package she's gone to Paris so you know I got to be like mama green when they go over she uh she she got the lights that I'm trying to it got the life that I'm trying to get so I'll let you guys kind of see the makings of the inside of this this salt the veggies and the meat boom and we already hit it with some seasoning dawn I don't know where we're gonna be yet I actually reached out for a couple of events that are happening in Jersey next weekend and we don't know yet so but my sister lives in Sickler Ville and if you happen to know some stuff I mean we'll travel up in North Jersey to if we have grandkids and children they live up that way but you know we look into maybe do one event before we head back to Virginia it'd be cool to do it was the last minute that they threw together this thing for my mom for the family so we are actually going to try to show up and you know use the time that we have in Jersey maybe they'd meet some of the cook Maria's family I'd be cool alright so BAM Derek we got it you got the meat kind of cooked down a little bit all right so let me get you guys out of the pan for a second so I can get both of my hands together boom alright so what you gonna do now yes I like to hit it with a little bit of red wine you don't you can skip this too let's like the flavor again like I say when I use wines in any of my my recipes use a wine that you drink not a bottle grocery store wine they are not good for this kind of thing they're not good even for cooking too salty they have preservatives just easily want to have more flavor and then the bonus is you got wine we gonna get that but get that nice hearty wine flavor in there too wanna move on let it cook a little bit now I'm going to add our tomato products in here all we're gonna open up any of these okay let's let me go ahead and do that why they talking to each other you know I'm opening my sauce here we gonna go ahead and get it in here uh-huh yeah we is yes we is our nice little sauce in their cans we using the Hunts gonna get that going here [Applause] try to mix everything in here and yeah we like our little vegetables kind of cook down a little bit you don't have to cook your vegetables that much I know it I know everyone doesn't like everything the same way so we're going to add our second bit of tomato sauce alright alright alright so we got a little net loss here [Applause] we're gonna add a couple of yeah it's gonna be real media real me we're going to add a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste doing that in there to help thicken tomato paste in there we got some nice garlic in here some onion a lot of herbs in our and I'm cooking my greens it's how you blend of course our other herb blend we have in here and we're gonna get a little bit of cook on this and I want to go ahead and give it a taste and then reese's it oh yeah oh yeah I like where you going sauce I like where you going give it a little tasty taste see we talked about what we talked about sauce oh you so Maisy [Applause] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah got a little tang you don't get that in tomato products so what would you do is you add a little sugar to that I know we're gonna start fighting now because people have a thing about sugar is like the grits scenario do you put sugar and butter and grits or do you put salt and pepper do it your way do it your way but this is what we do it takes a little less city acidity off of the sauce and it's not gonna change the flavor it's not gonna make you have a kool-aid sauce no you got to use it just to enhance and I just a little splash and I didn't mean a splash hold on let me just do a little cleaning real quick [Applause] all right so now I'm a taste again and then we gonna do our final and of course you can you can you can let this simmer and simmer down a lot but remember we went and took most of that stuff and cooked it ahead of time down [Applause] oh yeah and it with the rest of the seasoning oh my god Oh Derrick's goodness all Derrick's goodness whew alright let's turn it down low and I think we might be done with this sauce other than in a little simmer while we waiting on hey it's it cook Oh about to have some soft news oh Jesus wish to have some soft news you gotta do better y'all I hope y'all praying for us whoa somebody said they never put sugar in a homemade salt and sauce cooks all day long that's actually good like I said you're gonna have your own palate and your own taste some people like that I just don't I know the fact that it's gonna take some of the sitting this off of the tomato and you're gonna leave that out if you like yeah we bought the have some emotions we can see in the second shot all right let's let's get a little parsley put it just a little color mostly we go ahead and do a little choppy chop with the knife and again this is the fast a quick spaghetti when you're like I would love to do a Sogeti and I don't really want to cook the sauce down for Howard it's a really quick and easy way to do it you kind of cook everything my head like that and cook it down a little bit when you have sauce that's already made yeah you can do it like that yeah you can make your sauce from scratch that's we do it too roma Roma bomb a little parsley just for color and mostly this is done we're gonna probably serve this over these noodles and then we're gonna probably shave a little parmesan on top and Bo are you gonna be good to go y'all wanna come out here to see it I know it I feel it I feel like you like let's come down here and see you let's come down and see what you got there do you see you know multiply they've been cooking for hours done it all look at all everything is super cooked down ahead of time so we may have to do all of that yeah you can reduce some people like their sauce a little thicker you like a little more runny I like it about this consistency let's see when there's a and I cook the meat down to like small pieces like that I kind of I'm kind of okay with that consistency and again if you not add a little more tomato paste or cook it down and then just reese's me got a taste I don't know why this gigantis come from this big guy I don't even know where he's staying there just hide but yeah that's us all we made enough to feed an army so that means in migraine my my sign they'll probably be here and we'll problems keep some we could freeze that spaghetti salts freeze as well you can unfreeze it in and use it again be on I'm gonna see about this to me this might be alright we'll see but look it let's start getting a little

perfect my homeboys over a field trip little beef jerky here love it mmm where their meat sticks I'm racing all around so I need a little bit of sustenance maple barbecue now remember for you guys no matters they're hooking you up 25 percent off your order so go to the website be use the code Nomad you're getting 25% off bingo bango do I want some meat stick we're go well guys I sit in front of you today looking at a jar of pure death so seriously it's called death by salsa let me tell you a little story [Music] all the guys of the show we had to fill out our NCAA March Madness college basketball bracket basically like everybody else in America does the key was though there was no winning this bracket Freddie money there were simply the avoidance of losing the bracket because losing meant if you had to eat a hearty scoop of death by salsa and I got turned on to this by my guys over at pepper palace in Minnesota they work at the Mall of America in the Twin Cities I was there for the Super Bowl they said da you got to take this home with you you have to try it so anytime that there's a pepper holding its brain and screaming with fire coming out of its throat I'm in now I like spicy stuff but this is marketed as the hottest salsa on the planet well long story short I lost [Music] remember that historical anomaly that once in a billion shot where a 16 seed knocked off one seed for the first time ever and it happened to be the number one overall number one seed well I picked that number one seed to win the national championship not only did I lose my national champion in the first round but I basically lost the bracket that day it's a lot of red lines UMBC and so thus I was put in the hot seat literally let's go to the videotape that's a good amount is that a healthy scoop that's a good amount but you just got to make sure a bunch of it doesn't fall off onto the plate like that's got to get in your mouth okay he found the perfect amount on the school all right that's fair right that is a total fair this would be you paying up for losing put it in big boy there you go all right that's a good crunch [Music] tapping on the desk his eyes are lighting up da is now clenched his face is bright red don't touch your eyes don't he's drinking the milk his hand is shaking his hand is shaking folks Oh God you okay the eyes are watering man your tip your nose is red I've never seen your hand shake like that Oh God da is now getting up stretching out his back keep slurping the milk and a slurp he has kicking his leg down like a horse ready to come out of the gates at the Kentucky Derby he can't talk tapping his feet down hands shaking his eyes are literally watering he's raising his hands up Gilbert still burning the milk is not helping go right out of the carton man imagine having that much decor while feeling this heat I can't imagine really time I could tell I have never seen you cry before you have to tears like real tears welled up inside of your eyes okay hard this is hard this is I would say in the five years of the VA show we've done a lot of bet payoffs this is the hardest I've seen somebody punished as we are bringing a close to the hour this is going to be an interesting break we really know is the a gonna survive here so we could captain the mothership through the final hour here on the DEA show plus reaction on if DEA will survive more to come here on the break and check it all out at watch da comm more the DA show next on CBS sports radio [Music] I consider myself a pioneer kind of like the great Jackie Robinson as a Sports Talk host I paid up my bet and essentially melted down my internal organs you see the key is I think I took too healthy of a bite if I open this up and I just take a little bit just a tad just attack Oh my god oh it's actually still really hot Oh and then one of my colleagues at CBS Sports Radio Robbie the house rosenhouse also lost along with me so here you go your fingers are trembling a

mouth I've never felt anything like that never that was pure pain I don't know why they make this it's not enjoyable there's nothing enjoyable about this well it taught me a lesson never again will I

bit about scent and two products i always carry whether I'm ice fishing your open water especially for guidance because the is the Gulf product and also the bass assassin bang now some days one works better than others but a lot of times with the Gulf even if I'm using live bait I'll just dip it or sometimes I'll take one of the Gulf products and actually put that on a hook with a grubber with the minnow but also the nice thing about the bang spray it's an aerosol so basically I just put it against the bait give it a little shot no mess it's just an aerosol made my bass assassin you get the shad and crawfish formulas but you know when these fish really get lethargic an get tough you need to go to scent and you know carry a couple different products one day one works really great the other day the other ones better but those are two musts must-have products in your arsenal for either ice fishing or open-water fishing and right now I got the Mackler us the glow Sparkle fly on this diplomat sent in it's definitely definitely making the fish bite even when it's tough so hey this Terry with ultimate outdoors radio go to max leurs on our website in for more information",

I bought a does candle smart that is not functional at all well I bought a rose gold can opener when we first moved in together after we got married and it was much more beautiful than it was functional and it kept skipping like slipping and stuff like that so then I was like you know what I'm gonna go back old school get something that works for sure and is easy so I got this one which I think it's like a Japanese can opener is not responsible at all ma'am doesn't know how to use it I do know how to use if I stab myself with her every time so then you don't know you see okay while he was opening those cans I took out the cream cheese from the pack and I'm just putting it in the bowl because we're gonna pop it in the oven and melt it a little bit so Marian was telling you when we sort of decided to do this recipe that this is one of her favorite things issues to make during football season this was like hurry yeah one day watch the games of the Falcons losing it would be with this corn dip you just hurt a lot of people that love the Falcons you heard in the entire Atlanta Dirty Bird some come for you okay so now what we're gonna do is let's get rid of this trash hand we're the canned tomatoes they're diced we're gonna put this in this ball right here Oh actually gosh I'm gonna set thee oh yeah preheat the oven to 350 and then we're adding the white hominy in there as well so make sure you're super strategic about it and just dump it straight in okay now we're taking the cream cheese I'm gonna just warm it up for 30 seconds in the microwave and while that happens I'm just going to add those scallions that we had cut already added into the butter we're melting it to get the just melt this 15 seconds tops cool wood butter when you're melting butter always doing like five to four second intervals because if you do 15 seconds a moment butter is hot enough it just explodes and then you have to clean your microwave you nobody wants to do that so do it in like five seconds and you clean their microwave okay while you're warming that up I'm just gonna go ahead and put the cream cheese in our little Bowl right here just gonna go ahead and mix this if you're not a fan of Tomatoes you can obviously use to get the tomatoes or pull off of it I love both of these in equal quantities cuz I'm just gonna do that you got it over there almost it's a science I mean it's a heart out of science don't rush me oh yeah because you're just strategically melting our butter yeah you have to wash it's a process okay you can't rush my process okay you can add it in there you just all would me that's cuz you're in my way oh this makes me so happy inside it smells so good already now what we're gonna do is I'm going to take some old bay for those of you who aren't from Maryland old bay is the seasoning of the Gods and just so you know she assumed that we were talking about the dirty birds and she's using Redskins seasoning or Ravens seasoning so you're just trying to instigate for no reason right yeah okay now we're taking the shredded cheese and we're layering it on top well I'm like having I'm very clumsy today with my mixing and dropping of cheese is your mouth watering I heard you mm-hmm did your mouth watering right now you heard me you heard my mother oh I heard the gulp so like when your mouth water is cool good conversation I think you're here he's just you're hearing things okay now I'm taking the Cajun seasoning and I'm just gonna gonna season it on the top do you want to take out some help he is for me he can just pretty much like sprinkle the top yeah that'd be great hey good you homework I think that's good look at that so when you get them all these are the mild ones cause about did like oh like oh actually spicy you could make sure you get the spicy jalapenos but this says mild on it so we'll cut that out and we'll pretend it's a spicy okay is it right yep it's ready all right let's pop this in the oven I open the oven for me yes ma'am nice and toasty and now we give it about 15 minutes set a timer for 15 minutes I like what you did there 15 minutes later what if my hair gets burnt one day I would hope that doesn't happen I can't close everyone yes that looks good I just looked at him so that's 15 minutes at 350 yep you are tested it's gonna be really hot though I'm gonna blow on a love it hookah niffle when Miriam and I first started talking and and whatnot she would she would always say that too when food was hatch they go Fuqua net which means like you know essentially says it means to blow on it before you tell your story I just want to say thank you stood out of the middle yeah like you don't even bother getting it from the edge so we care like make a pretty little video of this thing you're just one straining look you take the picture like this right so it's like an action shot right cuz the cheese is still there you can tell it's there [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah Fuko night and I was like who what kind of weird saying is that just like cuz we say you see food that's not food it doesn't make the same it's who can who hmm okay okay yeah that's good Michael you owe me to feed you why you won all right let's be the camera all right let's get em Dirty Birds I would say my skins that I'm actually a Cowboys fan I'm sorry this video is not about any of that I know this is about this corn dip with white hominy tomatoes cream cheese all right and all the other good stuff like old bay old bay please send me more old bay I want to make you famous if not I'm gonna make food with you all this time talking we'll see you guys later [Music]", "8Wsmwy5-ydA": "[Music] hi and welcome back so you know what for this week's video i figured we would do something a little festive because there's a lot of festiveness missing in the world right now this is clearly the less festive setup ever but you know i do with what i can and what do people do to get festive definitely not this but i figured food but yes you're right you read the title this isn't about food it's about drinks honestly food drinks aren't they just two dualities of the same entity whatever what we're doing today is we're gonna attempt to recreate some festive drinks a little while ago i went on instagram and asked you oh my god sweet baby jesus can you tell i haven't had my coffee yet i asked you on instagram what festive drinks you would like me to recreate and a lot a lot a lot of starbucks came up so we're going to start with that starting with the what is it called the caramel creme brulee coffee latte now i think i've tried it like once before because my town is so lame that it doesn't have a starbucks 10 000 tim hortons though so anyways i don't get to drink a lot of starbucks drink i think i tried that one once and i don't remember how it tastes so the fun thing is i'm not gonna be able to compare but i'll be able to tell you if it tastes like  or not so let's get going i need some caramel sauce which i decided not to buy because i'm cheap and also i was like i can make this at home so we're going to start by making that caramel sauce which i also did not anticipate i would need heavy cream for so i'm gonna be using this and we're gonna see one cup of granulated sugar wait i'm using brown sugar so i should use less right yeah three fourths or half six tablespoons six of butter how much is this gonna make like i just want it for one drink it makes one cup six i'm so shook i'm gonna go with three four four is plenty of butter especially now that i have less sugar right me just instantly ruining the recipe i have to stir the sugar wait until it melts starting to melt oh my god why am i so excited looking back at the situation i think i should have just bought some oh it smells so good though i have to go buy some very last minute christmas gift afterwards so i really hope that this is going to give me the boost of life that i need look at this beauty sally's baking never disappoints it's sticking to the side oh my god it's such a beautiful color wow add in the border oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god she said it would bubble not that much oh my god it was like 10 times worse than this oh no it's separating she said that's not good vigorously oh my god i can't see anything this kitchen is flawed does it look ruined i don't know ow what happened i burned myself how i think it's fine i'll need to add normally the heavy cream she said it was gonna bubble again i'm scared slowly these are not bubbles this is a volcano this is bad i feel like i'm making a science experiment i do not like this can you hear it what is going on this was stressful we're waiting which means dance break now we remove it from heat she put salt in it so mama mama wants salted caramel oh what's happening salt let it cool one cup of milk in the saucepan that's my face okay okay i see you i see you can you hear the noise that it's making i don't know how long i'm supposed to do this i hear the boiling sound boiling the milk is boiling i need to take it off the heat some caramel i'm sure starbucks doesn't put that much heart into making their coffees oh was it all of it precisely one teaspoon left coconut whipped cream look at me getting two angles of it oh no my good camera died now i can get a good angle of that  coffee i am so ah [Music] yes it's beautiful what the i'm scared wow oh my god i'm just trying to get a bit of coffee in there it's really good oh my god it's a life changer now i can just make this at home wow the caramel sauce that i made especially i would recommend both of these recipes i burned my tongue a little but you know what it was worth it i'm not disappointed not gonna go buy christmas gifts cheers yes time for the second recipe yet another coffee from starbucks this one i don't know if i'm gonna like it because my friend shakiba suggested that one and it's the peppermint mocha from starbucks and the thing is i'm not a big fan of peppermint mixed with chocolate separately both amazing together flop i hate it it's a bad start but she wanted me to try it so i'm gonna do it so i went ahead and made peppermint syrup so i used a recipe online that i'll link down and it's basically just regular syrup sugar water and then you add peppermint extract to that there was no measurement for the peppermint though so i don't know if i added too many or too little i guess i also went ahead and made a decaf coffee i am so sorry for the hat that's really killing the christmas vibe right now but my hair is a mess you should thank me instead you really didn't want to see this half a cup of milk i'm going to be using that one again this is such such a big pan but that's the only one that was left baby whisk while this is going on they pour two tablespoons of chocolate sauce this one i bought because it two tablespoons of peppermint syrup doesn't matter if there's more right because it's supposed to be a mocha it's supposed to taste like something and that is literally the only chocolate that's in there very confused is this aesthetic that's a lot two tablespoons i use one and a half since i don't like it [Music] that says to add the coffee i don't know if the coffee's gonna save it all but so far i don't like it i don't even know if i'm gonna have enough milk the answer was no oh no i wanted to light the candle and i forgot let me make more milk time to top it with whipped cream then they say to also top it with some shaved chocolate look at me i look like a cooking channel but i kind of also want to top it with this at the end so we'll see how it looks oh i also have this to touch it with quick be quick quick quick and also this week so i've just done it on the outside oh my god look at my creation [Music] i'm still gonna go ahead and put a bit of that on it then we're gonna try it and i'm gonna see if i hate it it looks beautiful this is much more festive than the other one it's kind of good but i can only taste the chocolate so far i can't really taste the peppermint probably gonna be all at the bottom a big gulp of peppermint gross and disgusting ah but for mocha though delicious you know in terms of sweetness i would say i prefer this one because the caramel one like in the morning is very intense so i would go with this but i still can't taste the peppermint should i put some on top just a wee bit [Music] it's not there oh oh there it is it's still gone like i can slightly taste it but it mostly tastes like chocolate cause i guess because i put a shitload of it good another day another drink and today is not a coffee but probably the most festive drink of them all the festivus of them drinkiness because it involves wine yes you guessed it it is gluhwein ora mulled wine and i'm going to be trying some teachers recipe so someone suggested it to me and sent me the recipe that they wrote on the board during an exam so fun thank you teacher i'm gonna be using the mystery road wine because it is so cheap but also oh so good funny thing this recipe doesn't involve any anise star which is really weird but also really good because i couldn't find any other grocery stores so usually in normal days in normal years i like to go to german christmas markets get myself a little glass of glue vine pay a little four dollars for this much of wine but it is so worth it today we're gonna be making it at home and i can't wait it's actually the first time that i do it at home i'm kind of excited so let me just read it to you first it says one bottle of wine but oh i am so alone drinking this so we're gonna use like maybe half it also says one cinnamon stick three to four cloves so we're gonna be using much less than that vanilla with no quantity orange or clementine zesta and now i ran into a little problem most of my oranges were starting to die this was probably the finest it is a sugar to taste and some red fruit jam i'm gonna be using this one i was supposed to make cookies with it and then i didn't i can't read what else i need to do but i'm gonna just guess i need to put this on the stove and then warm it up all right so let's just zest the out of this just some juice in my eyes it's naked it says we need to use lemon juice but hey we're not gonna waste that poor baby so i'm just gonna use orange juice for that maybe half squid literally let's move over i got like a four minutes left of camera storage so i'm gonna try to be real quick we put this in a casserole that's a bit more than a half but you know what that's fine let's add some vanilla it doesn't say any measurement i'm gonna go for it of a teaspoon we're just freestyling around here and we love it like since coronavirus i've been doing like a lot of baking and cooking because like my mom was like i'm gonna make lunch you're gonna make supper and this is gonna be how we roll so i've been trying to like think about really nice things to cook i'm getting like a lot more comfortable in the kitchen and i like it is this too much nah come on come on time for the zest that is a lot oh i hope this is going to be good i'm going to be real disappointed if it isn't how do you open it oh thank you should i put a whole one or half should i cut it okay it's time for clothes we're going to be real careful with these little tasty i think i put a lot of zest in there it also smells a lot like oranges i'm not gonna be mad if it tastes like oranges that's basically what i've been doing like making at home sangria mixing a bit of wine a bit of orange juice and a little fizzy water boom so i'm not gonna be mad if that's what it tastes like it's just gonna be regular and i don't want it to be regular i want it to be custom because as we can see even the weather 24th of december it's raining canada where's me snow that's like the only time in the year that i like snow a lot of zest okay um i'm just gonna add a little bit more i think i need to let it simmer a little bit but we don't want it to boil i think it's cute whenever there's like a few oranges slices in there so i might as well just use that orange let's put this in there look how pretty sugar is festive so i'm gonna add a bit of maple syrup it is time it smells really good though it tastes a lot like oranges but i like it worth it well so there you go i hope you liked that video i really enjoyed doing this i like trying new things and all of these drinks are now gonna be part of my drinking repertoire if you liked it please subscribe to my channel like comment

anybody help study psych generators here alright cool so let me go on for this little bit like I am sell this flea you can follow me on this clip I like you go to our website right block on things i experiment with and so the question is why dwell make a static site generator with God like when we think of static site generators right we do you think of Chekhov a middleman things like that for me I want to make a lot of it but because jaco is like a blogging thing so I wanted to make a block because I go when I didn't want the usable press anymore that was only it is behind this then the second one was the prototype anything quickly in front end like I said these things come to mind this harder to means static site generators on the market the domain and check out and then I didn't want to use Ruby that's why I didn't consider this so then the next one came j-star let's assemble this metal Smith and in this winter sniffing a lot of other things they are people thought some random stuff which I didn't you say I didn't want to learn so much so I didn't care about them as well then like I said um this thing came to mind because I worked with better left for a while I really like how module scheme together to create a website with different patterns so like when I work for the desk website of experimenting with a simpler version of the static site generator Buddhist and like you can do like the attar behind everything gets binder quickly feel fluxes so it is your flux on almost in this moment flux Maya just like your theology I'll ask you another on screen Oh variable oh yeah my first is on okay it's like vintage I think it's fine let's just leave it on all right so in short I just want to make it like super extendable so any I can just go on there without a quick website in like very quickly with all the temptation so like basically let's go demo it starts the whole static shock generators like it starts with one combined so just running God will stop the whole thing so this is my terminal go and it runs stuff making sure it cleans good like checks are creates a pages creates the poles and stuff like that and then when it's stuff you can go to localhost 3000 to locate the site basically there are a few things about this site and there is a set of a part that persist throughout the site this is like no more like globaldata what i call it so you can use this for things like oh don't site URLs I username or 4s your stuff that you need to have and then this is what it is the must-have parts of this is to create pages you create the post and you create sort of all the testing I was testing something in there for your motive so basically is to create false nths like the thing about this site is that you can hit the like block and this awesome blog that I have free you set it up so one picture is about five blocks in toto and then when you click on it's a link to a post and you can write mount down and stuff like that so if I show you the code in here this is what it looks like all the poor suggest things like this so you have the yellow hard at the top where you live where they give the title and some are links and stuff like that and you take a look at you are out here you will notice that it's a pretty URL if you have talked to a fish TMO you know that if to get this wiki URL so you have to put it in such a way that used to go into the folder name so in this case training 1 2 3 / index dot HTML if you do it the other way would be like what not hdmi can stick which is kind of crappy if we want to put it out there for people to meet through so this is how the well the challengers have to go through so it does a 3d URL with the pummeling that stated here so that tamale is straining 123 so if i change this thing to testing training for example then if i go back to my blog the first one becomes testing training so it gets ugly turn again then I'm creating like if you work with wordpress how I define pages and cool sound like someone like WordPress believe it so those will be locals basically pages will be things like in that about those high pages if I hit that here like this returning now for example is a page when it goes to like a schmuck not really so that's how I define things too and then block any texts I show you the block pictures now you have links to both the four different pages you can you can link to different text at the same time so all these are automatically generated in the whole process and then there there are like 10 clips of things that you can use to get this data hot yeah I strapped to the URL so I want things that's very important multiple data sources it's one of the things that I cannot live without like for example what we usually do with this study site generators and it's not like that when coding is if we have one big data this one so when it gets lot she gets complicated and it's quick go to a lower three we are was done through so data sources the first flights from matter so we got the title and the tourmaline and text from the front matter there's also you can get data from any other file so you can use this departing in which in the front my turn to get data from anywhere in your project folder so in this case I'm getting from the data folder and the box on this one finally you can write em out now so like here this translates to a number of Lord some wood t-tech this more is like a wordpress segment in terms of anything above the wall would be the summary in your blog post anything after that would be content that's only shown on the book cause yourself then in pages you can like write down just like this with a mountain down break it so this I'm using nunchucks as my template January 10-play engine you go wandering and I mean this thing as well so you can use like but the plug is not like me but you can use it in this week so basically what this does is ah so yeah so over here I had dark fragments in the addition of the Dark Age so we hit the additional data sources this is the not love fragment and this Freeman is found in 10 flips fragments so you can just write man down and you appear anywhere she wanted to be no synthase hard I think the call highlighting is done as well so this about the process so they are basically four tasks in here to create the page to post the block and the text craving the pitch is that simple assault of everything so I pipe it through from a purpose then get some google data and go through a custom nunchuck template thing that wrote that the data template basically gets all the data sources and keeps in the template then creates the page itself then we rise from freaky URL to get the nice URLs over there the pulse is a little bit longer in a way because we have to go through my office and then you forget this hungry you have to get for me I wanted to write a certain I have to a lot of the founding to be in a certain date or some type of founding so this is a change then get the correct tamale get correct get all the texts get the blog and stuff then send it to the nunchuck templates this hex right gets this text and post gets to the next to pass which will help to create the block and the text so this whole thing's mix up the whole set exciter enter and there's a custom puddin uncertainties which I can show you if you are interested but it's going to give it driving so anyway tensley's are there are four different heights often five different kinds of techniques I had a layout template for all the SEO starter cssr that it's comments or pages then i have the blog template for other bloggers types like for example where you see for article article will be looping through the five articles i have on my blog page then you can get other former links and titles and all that stuff they are generally if you are if you notice the title will be from the title fri metal and formatting of you from the tunneling from matter so it gets a bit out there then there's a template which basically is the same thing just for text and the post template so one of the more interesting things is that this one here is the entire map down far from the post so we I from whether automatic content in cycling I chucked em fix Oh postal code for pages right because pages can be different so they use themselves with the template to alter the coffee yeah so the similarities between the templates are they are extended layout template so it wants to be dry lost my stuff I the SEO sir then they contain multiple data sources oh yeah then I see that you can use like from a touch in the pages itself as well so that gets the data is that it is required then you can get seojun do like first month down it's all the things I use often so Milo makes them pretty damn important and cool is not reversible publicly yet but we can talk about the I can't even show you the code yeah once again if you want to get me like outside of here then so it's like to talk on my website or you can check it as well shameless I'm writing a book on automating what's loss with shop so if anyone is interested in learning how to like a fine and development workflow we've got the tools this is the one writing you can check it out at this page although the slights I'll get the link to the slides are later and that's it any questions or anything in your templates we look like Shopify type code one was canonical have some kind of the mustache or percent something too long haul it's not going person ever told you this one block and Michael this is from the nunchucks empty it basically is a tempting inheritance it resembles on the nitrogen job so what this does is that it goes into all right let me show you the coat that's your SEO ah layouts like for example block canonical this video I'm saying in here is it ok in this position i define the kennel cannot go pack all that kind of logical flow and in my pages or up in my blog for example I say Kate for this block come on the chemical is like that so we meet places the original one if there is a replacement otherwise you just use the same item yeah so what why should i do a static website and also have you written any news before I have reason shot but let's get back to the static website first why should we do it at a website because it's a lot faster we don't have to go through a database to get the content so yeah I love like you have heard of things like you have to create a cash for the agaves before to speed up the website so if you're on a static website it gets loaded up immediately without having to wait for another trip to the server and things like that so it gets people get to read it quicker faster the invitation to you currently you can't have like logins and stuff like that if you're having a static website so eventually it's good for things like blocks but you do need membership sites then you have to turn to other sources and yes i have written another book is called learning Suzy so this yep okay so Suzy is basicly of framework on says that helps to write layouts quickly so what this does is that if you have like normally when we use bootstrap but with stripes you have to use things like column md nine so that adds to the complexity in HTML what Susie doesn't say that extracts all this back into the CSS and you can control your layouts exactly as you want it without having to do a lot of HTML manipulations it's like a framework you can do like multiple stuff with poor like this content and this will be a Collins for example so it helps you reading it helps with designing the Greeks ourselves yeah so the whole thing is about with how you Susie you can get seven three chapters which is Claire one-third of the pool I think yeah all right and else radio static pages right now because there's very few pages I basically beach and my wife say it so doesn't mean airplane or a new post your provision basically you can do it in such a way that like after you right after Everett done in the report right you can write a comment say I got deploy or something and then it deploys by doing your staff checking everything is fine then it goes to the using process as if and redo the post that you did not modify our desert it doesn't have to so like for the archives pages like the lots and the text you definitely have to because if you add a post at the top then you have to review the whole thing but if you didn't then it doesn't have to but if you think about like a dynamic website right I can't believe how long we've been doing this we've been building things which literally run the exact same code to generate the exact same content thousands of times it's just total madness but people do this all the time even look for people using like databases instead of writing exactly the content that you gain so that you can retrieve it in a single read it will do a thousand joints to write some content over over and over and over it's just stupid and yeah everyone great passions are there you go complexity of caching caching so yeah this this can handle caching as well so there's a catch bus thing in the optimization face just before uploading I didn't show it because there is nothing that you can use it will catch bus the CSS njs whenever it makes a new bill so you don't have to worry about caching so my little generator is like a generator page they open is it the same thing as I generated last time and if yes they don't touch it so my final days they stay the same and only the pages that will get changed then applicator file a ticket if you look into the rectory which of them has been updated yeah definitely one of the ways that we can do this with golf needs to check whether the output files on your word ender check whether there is any new of house like check the fall days between the source files and alpha false and check it check bishop Jeff refinery qualms of damage but that's this one way checking the binary content is another we can even check things like the layout of the page if anything has changed like we've been some CSS any other questions I write my books ah ok yes yeah everything Amanda who's your publisher me I pull it out on my own website and they just sell from there would you recommend using like get up pages or the other hosting a yeah um possible i er pages is quick and fast but the only thing is I think you have to publish a book yeah yeah I used to use another Ruby base Nigeria and every time i do that i just pure coming and get this the thing a ship or a witch whatever is different yes Jekyll Jekyll can basically what i want this to do is you don't have to push to get up if you want if you want to like I push through amazon for a test for example i can't push through any other similar three so you can read a web server yeah the deck has no the Deaf has website uses a older version of this yes I use or something like this they say that you didn't supposed to get out because your sauce and I just wondering like what well this digital things like like actually I want to protect my sauce in a way because sometimes I don't really want to put things on github suitcase it's not ready for things to be out there yet like even after this I Lynette because to ask me questions what do I continue developing this for myself or do I answer the questions of because what issues can come in oh my god this was talking about losing the blow it puts a whole source for up as well if you have to etiology hafiz range or the system because where did it was only the publish policy will be on then oh yeah now I have to check that it says I'm not sure regarding this I'm not very familiar with janaki traffic okay i can check cough drops a not yet but I think we I can cook something in that maybe like a front metal will be like draft and boom publish Olympics like everything will be in the front matter", "YDfS036OCqs": "What do you do once you go

okay yeah okay so there's no yeah just making sure awesome I think you're good to go this is going to be pulling me down okay I guess I'm gonna get started here yeah sorry for a bit the technical delays so this session is going to be about creating a Drupal 8 theme using all these wonderful technologies it's kind of a mouthful but it's it's going to be somewhat of a repetition of some of the stuff that run yesterday in terms of the new features of the Drupal 8 theming layer but I still wanted to go over that I don't know how many of you like I've attended sessions yesterday there's I think there's like a theming session from the fundamentals of Drupal any theming and there's a KSS session today too which is I'm going to touch upon that stuff as well I keep by show of hands like and to mess with Drupal 8 already like in on the seaming layer yeah like in terms of like the gulp and nulled stuff anybody is using it at this point okay cool okay so a little bit of background about myself I'm a front-end developer with Appalachian I guess I should say front-end developer slash designer I'm more of a designer background so some of the stuff that I'm going to talk about this it in a way it's kind of beyond me because you know gets technical really quickly but anyway activation is a globally distributed company we are I think around 120 people at this point headquarters is in Vancouver we have an office I think about thirty people in Montreal which is from what I hear we're the next Drupal North is going to be hosted and then few places in the States in Europe we are a sponsor here as well and we do contribute to Drupal eight accelerate program to kind of help out with you know getting that release as soon as we can I guess so yeah as I said it's gonna be like a two-fold thing I'm gonna just run over some of the we're kind of already late I guess with the technical stuff so I'm going to run over the the new features for the Drupal 8 in terms of like what theming stuff has been changed or like completely new to Drupal 8 and then we're going to go over the the node gulp setup so this is all based on my sort of experimentation or just proof of concept just I wanted to spend out a theme as Drupal 8 started maybe like half a year ago and at the same time there's all these tools and in the front-end world that like little toys shiny toys that you want to grab and and start using regardless if you need them or not but it's just like so tempting to experiment with stuff and you know try to incorporate that into your workflow so you can see the demo for the theme and briefly gonna just show you it's in terms of features like its I was actually like when Drupal was beta 6 I've set this up so it has lips ass going the sauce partial structure obviously it's responsive and got some other stuff integrated into it so I got some animations going here and just like for the for the sake of demo I can show you that we got that stuff going and we're going to talk about sort of integrating some of the GS stuff into this theme so I guess it'll be relevant to what I just show the source code for this is on github and it's also on drupal.org as a sandbox project so you can check it out there take it for a spin so as I said Drupal is getting closer to release they hopefully sometime this fall so it's nice to be kind of an early adopter and try to start using things see how they work with that I just wanted to go over the basic structure of a Drupal theme and a lot of it is going to be very similar and familiar already for anybody who's doing theming stuff at this point with Drupal 7 so as you probably already know Drupal has switched to ya know for like like to say be the info file the libraries file that we have there and the stuff with the green tax I don't know if you can see very well but in terms of those colors in there but the green stuff is basically the three things so the theme itself is the in my case this theme is called wanna set and it's the name of the theme and that theme which is your former template PHP file so the info file is pretty straightforward again you have to just be careful with the ya know format like space sensitive stuff but it's pretty basic you just declare a key value pairs and the name of the theme type description all that stuff the libraries is a new concept for Drupal 8 and it's basically a way for for themers to integrate declare their dependencies I mean any in terms of like their GS and CSS adding their GS and CSS assets so with just going to go over some of the ways how we can manipulate that adding the CSS and GS files into into the theme removing stuff from Drupal 8 like we're going to talk here in a second about Drupal a being more of a clean slate for for developers or like it's not providing like default markup the core it's not dictating stuff to you by you know providing the classes and and things like that but at the same time there's still some stuff that's loaded so in this case I'm just removing some stuff that I didn't want to use the normalized library I just have my own kind of reset in in in the partials that I'm using using sass so just remove that and you can remove anything that is served by core and that's in your bad info file so again it's a mono said that in for that ya know which is the name of my theme defining a library again it's in that yamo file pretty straightforward I'm just pointing to the saying that this is a CSS file it at it's a themes CSS file it lives under my Styles directory main CSS that's where everything gets compiled so and this is called the globally because it's like the style that I wanted to be available across all you know the whole site all the pages same with a GS so declarant dependencies as I said so Drupal has less assumptions now Drupal 8 has less assumptions so jQuery is not there by default but you can declare it as a dependency so you just have to say that you know please stick it in there so it will once you declare it in your library basically like I'm dependent for in my main GS file for jQuery to be there so I'm stating that in the libraries file and there's a bunch of other things that are available in the and if you want to see what comes with with Drupal core it's it's all under core assets and there's a bunch of other things like beg bone and modernizer things like that giving you no weights or specifying a scope for your GS files it's pretty easy also done in the libraries file so here I'm just kind of messing with the weight of where that CSS is going to be obviously it's it's more important for JavaScript like if I want to send it to the footer I think so it's by default it's going to be in the header most of the time you would want it in the footer and probably your custom stuff you would want to be like in that specific place and the quarter so like specifying that scope a giving giving the weight is it's pretty pretty easy again in that libraries file specifying the media type like I'm not using a print stylesheet here but pretty straightforward as well and you just have to point it and give it the parameters of media print this is a bit getting more interesting where you can specify a library and then only load that on a specific page or a specific content type and this will this has to be done with a pre process function so and it's in my mono set theme which is again your former template dot PHP file and I have to find a front page library which is only going to be loaded you know for those animations they're not like crazy heavy but still there's no point of loading them across the whole site so just serving those for the for the home page adding Google font to I mean there's a couple ways of doing that I think there's still a way maybe now there is a way to that add that directly in the libraries file I ended up doing just again a pre process function and and might want to set that theme file and let me actually show you how much of this you can see but so again just gonna go kind of to summarize again this is that that info of the that in for that ammo file so again name of the theme I'm going to talk about this declaring classy as a base theme just in a second so like all this pretty straightforward so those are the two libraries that I wanted across my site global and vendor and these is where I am removing this stuff regions are pretty straightforward yeah it's like a familiar concept from Drupal 7 right so we still have those in in terms of the libraries file itself you can see again this is my global library print stylesheet if I had one all the dependencies that I'm going to ask for from Drupal my vendor library that I just referred again in here too and I wanted I wanted that globally again so it's it's declared in that that info file will be available across the site so just a bunch of scripts that I bought from other people for that like for the menu for animations and SVG injections just prism is for code highlighting so some of the stuff that I've just utilized in this theme and then again this is the front page library that I wanted only available for those animations and effects so back to this so declaring class has a base theme again as I said so Drupal comes pretty much as a clean slate doesn't dictate you anymore as it used to like the Drupal seven doesn't dictate the mark-up or class themes things like that much nicer to work with I mean it's a big one from my perspective on the other hand if you want some sensible defaults you want stuff already to be there you know some divs and some like them style CSS class themes and things like that you can declare a class basically and that will basically reroute everything through the classy classy has a collection of templates already you know sitting in there I mean it's a core theme and it's it's a core it's a core based theme for Bartok and and 17-2 so that's that's the idea I guess yeah and just the there's an effort and add like again there is a session yesterday by Scott Reeves about tweak stuff and removing all the pre-process stuff from the drupal theming layer so it's removing that abstraction layer again for me it's a it's a big win for Drupal 8 you basically like everything is now in template file so for a theme or you know especially from a designer background like you know where the stuff is coming from there's no you know trying to figure out what it is how is like it's it's just removing that abstraction in terms of pre-process process functions that run by by drupal one of the great debugging features for for drupal 8 this is actually in drupal 7 as of maybe seven three - I think - is that you you can enable well you don't have the services llam\u00f3 file but you can enable the debugging feature where you you would see like output of like where your templates are coming from and in the in I'll show you in a second and a source code and Dom basically you'll see that HTML comments and so with with a Drupal 8 install basically when it installs you have a service CMO for services that demo file which you have to set the debug to true like I've actually said some of the other things - true I have like a the outer reload and cache to false and created my settings that local that Beach be I think that actually stripped another kind of of caching that twig was trying to do and for me it was kind of important because some of the the the gulp stuff running browsers are sinking and like watching for all the stuff that's happening with your templates kind of important for for it to happen instantly and so that just removes that extra cash in battle yeah go for it yeah yeah I mean I can't I'm totally maintaining this again this is this is just on my local right so this is the services that yeah mo file is for anything on your local you will have that debug true right I'm just not sure that auto reload too if you have to actually you know specifically say that you want that and for cash Falls like most of the time you will end up with a settings local PHP file to on your local system but none of this stuff is going to be you know it's not in my theme right so it's it's just in minor in my installing sites default so that's the idea for like Drupal show showing you where once you have that debug enabled and as in when you inspect your stuff basically yours your theme you will have these HTML comments and it's going to show your stuff is coming in core from core or if I say it say had classy as my base thing it would you know reroute everything through that look at the templates in there so by looking at this I can see what template is used where it lives grab that template you know decide how specific I want to be with that template stick it into my you know copy paste it and start modifying do whatever you know in terms of class names and things like that and markup I can probably just show you really quick oops sorry here so the idea how much of this is going to be seeing anybody yeah so all of the stuff in the green yeah really see so call all of these comments if you go down like there's a bunch of it's a bunch of template files basically that shows you where the stuff is coming from so second part to this is the the integration of this know baseball system with lip sauce and golf stuff and as I showed earlier like in that file directory there's some some things that are not specifically Drupal related again it'll be like the the golf GS file it will be the node modules in package.json file now again this would not be necessary Drupal 8 specific you can run this on any setup like Drupal 7 I there's a I think there's a catch with some of the stuff with Drupal 7 because that info file is not that into that ya know files but Drupal 7 that info files kind of mess with the node modules because it contains some that info files as well but otherwise yeah this is kind of agnostic I guess in a way so in order to get this going you have to have note installed on your system and it's I don't know how many of you again like familiar with this like I've previously I've run the most of my stuff on Ruby which is a pretty similar set up so once you have the Ruby installed on your system you have a concept of gems and use bundler to karna declare all the dependencies that you want to you know be be using in whatever processes or tasks you're running so node has its own installer you can either use that or if you like I'm using home brew with home brew it's pretty easy to install as well once you have the note going you have to install some packages like known as the node package manager NPM which installs some some packages globally and some packages directly into your theme alright like where you tell it to to install them so gulp is one of the things that has to be installed globally and also like in in a theme once you get that going basically you CD into your themes directory and you do NPM install it fetches all the dependencies from the node repos wherever and you after that you basically get ignore all the stuff because it's not I mean it could get pretty heavy in terms of all the the stuff that you're going to grab from note that each module is going to have some weight to it so you get ignore it and it's for annex developer say or somebody like if it's like a project that you're sharing they're just going to go through this install process once you once the Donald of the theme so package.json file contains the basic information about what this project is about it could be pretty minimal again and then you just declare all the dependent packages that you want to use I'm going to go over those in a sec and you can add more stuff to it if you feel like it again there's like plenty of stuff in in in the in the note in the note world there actually let me show you to the actual the actual apps the actual directory for this I don't know I think I can zoom here no I can't really it's hard to see here but anyway just that this is where all the node modules are the Gulf GIS file just sitting in that root directory and the package.json file does this kind of make sense so far I don't know yeah yes no maybe okay I guess one of the things that like if you're running like a SAS setup and you probably are at this at this point most the people shoot at least be doing sighs that's the point of this whole thing like I've tried to start messing with the lips a switch is actually not really it's not anything different from your Ruby SAS it's just the Ruby SAS has started as a as a ruby project from what I understand but Lee lips us is just a port of same sass stuff same library issues done in C++ III believe and it's been gaining some momentum in terms of it's like versioning one of the disadvantages of using lip size versus ruby sauce was that it was the future wasn't us feature reach so some features who are behind like if he had to have something in your in your sass creation processor and you run certain functions through things like it might have not been there at this point let's ask etching up and actually Ruby sass is waiting for for the for those features for lips eyes to kind of get on on pair on you know have the parity yeah one one of the biggest advantages for of lips us from like what I hear and like it this pretty much one of the first big things is that its speed so Ruby says not as noticeable on a project like this where you basically have a one-pager side you know and you have few partials but on on bigger projects where you have like a massive CSS architecture like I've heard people you know compiling times getting like you know a couple minutes long which is pretty bad so this definitely not not the case with lips I so yeah I there's some comparisons but I don't really know the numbers exactly but everybody's saying it's a lot faster so in terms of feature again back to feature compatibility you can check out this site which basically compares all the sass versions you can see what's there for ruby sauce vs. lip sauce and again some of these are going to be like I haven't used like any of the crazy functions math math functions and things like that so again for me it was pretty easy to adapt lip size because like in in the beginning I think like maybe six months ago I was missing some the mapping stuff was missing for sass or something wasn't there there's a couple other things that I was kind of missing the break point Jim I don't know if you've heard of that it's like it was kind of think that I've adopted an to mark workflow but that wasn't there because again it was Ruby dependent but otherwise you can see you know like most of the stuff is it's pretty close mmm another point as the compass like many people have used that in the past I've used it in the past but I have kind of stopped using it and compasses now it's it's a ruby I guess it's a library and you should say or it's like just a bunch of makes sense and different things that utilities that you can utilize again in your sass creation I as I said like I've stopped using it and I haven't really been missing it that much also compasses moving to being more agnostic or actually adopting the the lip sauce as its as a version 2 2 or like is I think it's that one something at this point but again there are alternatives like if you are into using MX in a library you can use board bond you can use need for grits if you're into grid systems you can also I think you can use Suzie I don't know if you've heard of Suzie grids just a great system that I think now with but can be set up with lip sauce but originally like it it's coming from Ruby again switching switching back to Ruby sass with this setup is pretty easy too because I've declared all the packages through my through my package JSON file but I can I can switch up my my instead of using lip sauce I can say I want to use ruby sauce and declare that as a dependency and I'll be running in Ruby sauce instead did somebody else yeah bootstrap in like in what in what sense sorry yeah like those are more like what you call semantic grids like need or or Suzi grids they're not like you don't have to have a specific markup in order to set up grids for your project for your like layouts with bootstrap you have to help this those glasses you know span seven whatever as far as I know I like yeah in terms of utilizing bootstrap into this workflow I I'm pretty sure you can do even maybe you will another thing that you'll require another dependency will be power you would run through you would run it through Bower and because it's just like another another way I had it to this for me like again I kind of wanted to keep things simple so that's why it was like getting rid of those extra dependencies like dropping the Ruby stuff like why not I keep things like so back to the sculpt stuff gulp well yes and basically where you put all the tasks that you want to run like repetitive tasks and some defining some pipelines that are going to be run some processes that are going to be run with your with your sass and your like watching Jas and and images and quick templates compiling and doing and browser syncing so that's where all of that happens again so for me the the the most important thing is like those three I guess three or four things were on the top there where the most important so sass compiling obviously I wanted to have source Maps it basically shows me where my sauce is coming from but partial that I want to target when I'm looking at the console like I'm seeing the partial itself not the style sheet where everything gets compiled autoprefixer which is a great plugin and it's again available like in other formats like in terms of grunt and things like that err notification without stopping the watch task it's one of the things that have set up in that gulp file so when you run your process you make a mistake in in the creation of you know and it just like forget a semicolon it's just going to complain pop up with a terminal notification you can do some crazy things like nothing's really crazy but yeah more each case I guess like you can clean the Drupal clear that Drupal cache from from gulp a theme registry and run like miscellaneous cleanup lint beautify tasks from from that gulp file and then browser synching is just where everything gets reloaded and synced up with your with your browser and other devices on your network and actually let me show you some of these this is the the back to just kind of to kind of to summarize the stuff that I've talked about in in part so this is the package.json file just has some basic information about what it is and then i'm declaring all of these dependencies that I want to use on my theme so gulp low plugins just some helpers and a golf autoprefixer notified called SAS health source maps and things like that so yeah as I said there's plenty of things available out there the actual gulp file so it's basically like a JavaScript file so I'm declaring some variables here on top that I want to use down the road like I'm specifying that like I need the the gulp the gulp load plug-in basically helps me with referring to like all the dependencies then I'm going to call later with this dollar global dollar sign variable and so I don't have to list all the node modules that I like to show you in and in that node module folder in here so some air notification here my main SAS task which you know watches does the sauce processing does the source maps I convert SAS to CSS compiles things and spits out any airs does the outer prefix layer and does the browser syncing so that's that's basically one task right there it's like another task here for a J's stuff like if I wanted to do some image optimization I can run that gulp images task GS hint like you can do GS linting as well or beautifying it kind of just linting was was somewhat difficult to do because like I was using other stuff stuff from other people's library and I like I didn't want to clean that up anyway so compresses GSS you can compress uncompressed things again not exactly you know like Drupal is going to do its own aggregation compressing anyways so but I kind of played with these tasks and kind of incorporated them they're running brush you can do golf crush and it will clear the theme registry as I showed Isaac kind of talked about already browser sinking is where like my browser is going to watch for this for this URL which is my local set up the aid that dev you obviously have to change that on your system depending but what's what what your local setup is and so it's a proxy that watches for that and then my default task is basically watching the sass doing the browser syncing and compiling again and watching for changes in the in the tweak files and I have because it takes a while to kind of set up everything I have just recorded some of this stuff in here I don't know if you will see a lot of this but show this anyway so I'm in my terminal I'm already CD the end to my theme here I'm going to run the gulp task it's going to fire up the browser connect to browser sync so I'm going to open the inspector in here so like I say I want to change one of the elements here like that section it's pointing me to the partial which is where it's coming from so I have that partial open on the Left I can I'm just going to uncommon stuff in there the gulp is going to watch to see get rid of the background in there so coming back back save that golf is watching for stuff it's kicking in the the reloading I'm going to make a mistake there say again as forgot the semicolon when I was writing my sauce so it's going to complain there it's going to complain there it's going to make me go and change that back or chain you know add that semicolon and it's not stopping the watch task it's still going so once I change that everything is running so this is a a tweak template so my my page template I'm just going to get rid of this whole section delete that our I'm coming that save that so the golf is is running the task so automatically get rid gets rid of that first section common thought back save it again and add said back and so that's just some of the default tasks that I've set up we're going to stop the golf process and do specific golf commands here so gulp in doing the golf brush so just because I have the notification going I it tells me that it's cleared the Drupal cache do golf images it's gonna tell me that it has gone and compressed blah blah blah since I've run it already like there's no compression happening like some of these tests I don't want to be running every time on my watch task but so I can run them just running J's hint it just tells me that everything is ok so that's that's the basic idea of this gulp and browser syncing watching tasks let me go back here so browsersync again is allows you to test your sights on multiple devices over shared network by synchronizing URL interactions and code changes so it's it's basically injecting stuff like CSS changes just you know updates like as you saw it's it's pretty pretty instant and again like the compiling stuff is pretty fast with ellipsis and it also not only watches for changes in CSS like it's all the interaction so like if you're taking out forms or like you like your scroll events and things like that and it's going to watch it across your network so if you have other devices set up for the for the browser sync well you don't have to set the you once you set up the browser saying it like you can connect the same like a bunch of device to the same network and it's going to be updated everywhere so as of late it has the UI and UI basically is so my element my local changes are happening on these local three thousand port my my dev is actually the aid that dev but I kinda actually like it because like I am locked in here and I'm not logged in here so this is when I run the gulp watch task it spits out this URL because again I've specified that da da dev as might left the proxy in the 3001 is the browser sync UI so you can see like it tells me what what what port I'm on like external external URL the proxy and then there's some syncing options you can you know synchronize all these click scroll events inputs and things like that yeah I haven't really like explored it this much myself I guess you can mess around with throttling as well too so you know like imitate the network stuff just great for testing okay so I think just a worry about this SAS partial structure and architecture engine in general I kind of is another way to kind of do SAS lobbying or bulk importing of all your CSS partials for this one I didn't really use anything but I use this this tool called test director which has a it actually has a sublime if you're using sublime it has a sublime plug-in and actually also has an old package as well I haven't just incorporated that into workflow and to my workflow but the idea basically that you have you have to declare all of these imports for your partial so these are given as an example so you would basically oops I want to be here I just want to go back you stick them in here and it generates the if it does drive us again yeah so it generates like a command line make directory stuff and you know touch make all those files for you they're just a nice little tool so yeah I think that kind of brings me to the end of this thing so as I said the source code is on github the demo is there on subtle should that net and that's it if you have yeah if you have any questions I'm I'll be glad to if I know the answers to answer them otherwise to github again Mazetti graph and I have a couple blog post about the same stuff on the activation website yeah you need any questions actually yeah have you got a good solution to keno the unused CSS classes try to whole site no I haven't I haven't done that I guess again for me for this one I kinda it's more this was more of a I should say like a crafted project so I kind of knew my structure and it's like I didn't want to use stuff randomly or adopt stuff randomly you know from other libraries and things like that well I guess I did in a way like I use that animate CSS stuff some of it is probably not gonna be used but otherwise it's it's like I know what each of these partials is is doing and what what what is in this but I'm pretty sure you can there will be like a gulp plug-in that you can incorporate into this workflow and oh just automatic you know like we'll go and hunt those yeah I'm not sure I don't know if I yeah that's a good question yeah that's a good question I am Not sure I guess I don't know anybody like here yeah yeah davell yeah it's yeah actually i have i just tried and yesterday in the session so it was about the twig stuff it was talked about briefly but you you have a develop module and for Drupal 8 already or at least at that version you can install that hopefully doesn't break anything then after you've installed that you have this kin stuff what yeah I guess you have to uncommon the whole thing anyway so you can see this basically you can go with with kin and look at the other variable so beyond using that of Drupal Drupal Zaid debug features you can excellence you know look into other variables that are available so yeah anything else no yeah yeah yeah so again for for this theme and I've done this the actual design like a layout for this for a MOBA like six months ago I think ellipsis was baby at the time was missing maps so the point is that it's it's actually pretty easy to set up and mix in that will do pretty you know I like it will do what break point is going to do but yeah but it's it's just going to be you'll incorporate that into your like mixing you like all your utilities stuff so for this one too I basically I do I do have that sola fide I'm using this kind of the same syntax for fine file or even here that I showed so @include break point medium and I think this this is probably so all this just refers to like a break point that I've set up all it took me to set this up is is like 10 lines of assassin here and I think you can do it differently now because you with lips us you can now use maps sass maps not source maps it's different yeah but it's just like it's like a key value and you define things and then you get referred to them later so it's even like there's a cleaner set up but it's kind of same since obviously it's not going to be as robust as break point but it it does the basic stuff so from a couple break points that I needed okay I guess if there's no questions I wrap it up thanks guys", "RD2YJrvd71Y": "- What?\n- Come on.

ha this pasta is like a spaghettini or like an angel hair pasta with cherry tomatoes basil garlic argentinian shrimp and i don't know that's it i guess so i'm so excited but first i gotta put some cheese on the pasta some fresh parmesan yep let's pour the drink i don't think you can hear it but we see all right red light cheers all right i am going to attempt to use this fork for the pasta oh what is on that the problem is this fork really sucks so we'll try okay who has seen veronica wings pasta with the cherry tomatoes that one looked good i should do a close-up i should have done a close-up i have a story time about these cherry tomatoes there's something about the texture of the angel hair pasta it's so good i don't prefer it all the time but when i have it so good so these cherry tomatoes are from my garden and i'm not quite fond of cherry tomatoes i love tomatoes out of all the tomatoes the cherry ones are like my least favorite i don't know why um that was freaking hot i'm gonna bring it in you guys have a quick look um okay unfortunately so these are argentinian shrimps and i never used to like them because i think i had bought like a bad badge or something and everybody says that they're good and i just so i tried to give it another goal and i'm so glad i did because they're phenomenal all right they're sold tender i think these are my new favorite i don't know man this pasta is so hot so let's talk about these cherry tomatoes and how what a nightmare they've been see this fork doesn't want to pick up anything um so last summer my husband decided it's so hot so yummy pumpkin decided to have a garden we're not gardeners okay but anyway first of all he planted way too late in the season because i think he started planting it was june you're supposed to around this time of year like like start planting in may at the end of me so he went to this gardening store and they had all these cherry tomato plants on sale because nobody's planting so the guy was like oh if you buy like here just i'll give you some for free so he gave him like 12 extra plants for free so the size of the garden first of all that we have is not that big okay this is gonna be hot so he had like 20 something plants 20 of these cherry tomato plants and these things grew like weeds we are so many cherry tomatoes again my least favorite tomato so i there was cherry tomatoes everywhere everywhere i had to find so many things to do with these cherry tomatoes give them away this and that finally the end of the season i was done with cherry tomatoes i'm like yes next next summer i'm gonna plant you know what i want so i got rid of all the dead plants and like around harvest time i cleaned up the garden this year i planned my nice tomatoes i plant jalapeno peppers i planted some zucchini watermelon i just planted cucumbers just stuff that we we love well don't i start noticing all these cherry tomatoes popping up now as you know like those kind of vegetables only come once a year like they're not you know you have to plant them every year but because what had happened was some had fallen onto the soil and i guess the seeds got everywhere and i think that that's just i have so many cherry tomato plants i'm so pissed so again i have not as many as last year but even one plant is too many for me of those stupid things i can eat them like this and like just like this um this is such a simple and easy and light because it's like i said the cherry tomatoes i can tolerate them like this i think i don't like them raw because i feel like i don't like the skin on them i don't know like the skin is thick and then i don't feel like they have a lot of flavor um hmm i hope i'm not hitting the mic yeah okay that would be annoying sorry guys i just want to cut this because i know i can't fit that like a whole bite like that in my mouth i grew the beef steak and san marzano tomatoes i didn't like the san marzano i don't know if it's because of the area or what they were just not what i expected i'm here like eating off to the side nobody can see this is so good look at that it's so juicy this pasta because it's so thin i feel like it retains its heat really well like it's still i don't know if you guys can see it's steaming out there so i think because my husband made me i'll call him pumpkin everybody knows him as pumpkin um as you know pumpkin did not want to get rid of those cherry tomatoes this year because i want i told them i said it's going to ruin our other plants and it they did they ruined some of our other plants like my my cucumbers did not grow so i was pissed and my mini water mountains didn't grow so next year i think if they come up again as soon as their little leaves come up they're getting pulled hmm i hope you guys can see the food okay okay i'm really happy that i tried these shrimp again they're really good do you ever get like rancid seafood like it happens once in a while you'll get like a shrimp or like a lobster and it's like mushy i think that's what it was i'm getting full i cook the shrimp in the sauce they're really good [Music] wow [Music] fresh mozzarella sorry about the metal this is my last bite do you guys actually use spoons when you eat pasta i don't not when i'm eating off camera hmm [Applause] wow i have a hair on my food don't worry it's mine okay this is for real gonna be last bite it's not gonna be a big one wow tapping up guys i'm stuffing i'm stuffed stuff ed stuff it okay well let's put the rest of this on here oh did i leave the store kaka all right anyway i hope

tried out a recipe this weekend and I loved it so much I just had to share it with you guys [Music] this recipe consists of multiple parts and one of it is creating an insane delicious garlic sauce so we'll start with that 200 grams of Tram fresh and now we add the same amount in mayonnaise this is actually my wife's recipe so thanks to her we need use of half a lemon we need a clove of garlic chop it really fine then we'll move it into a paste there you go now we want to add half a teaspoon of sugar just a bit of fresh parsley there we go and then just mix it up at the best thing to do is do this day ahead of time because then the garlic really gets a chance to mix with all the rest of the ingredients I'm putting it in fridge and we'll take it out when our meat is finished these are some beautiful free-range chicken thighs with a lot of fat on them now what we want to do is spread these out and make them as flat as possible or go with our knife and butterfly them as much as we can the chicken thighs are now completely butterfly and they're like big mountain of flat chicken of course we need to season them so I made a swamis seasoning and it consists of two teaspoons of paprika powder two teaspoons of onion powder two teaspoons of garlic powder two teaspoons of cumin powder two teaspoons of coriander one teaspoon of cayenne pepper one teaspoon of cinnamon powder two teaspoons of sugar and one teaspoon of crushed black pepper and it smells beautiful just like suami and really the cumin stands out above everything else so we'll start seizing this chicken fill it so we got that prepared now we'll start the curing process and what I like to start with is a red onion I'll add two of them so now we have our base for the chicken to start from and we'll start adding our chicken secure on your onions be careful for your fingers that's a beauty secure it we'll put it on the grill we got the Big Joe set up with the Joe Tishri we'll flip on the switch and the thing that I love about this it makes no at all what I did is build up a fire at the back of the barbecue hot charcoals on the backside so you get like the I don't know if you haven't been to swarm a place but if you've been there you know they have a back burner that's what we're trying to create here just heat from one side I'm adding a little dripping trade but just to make sure that if any chicken fall down you can still save it creating this will allow us to add something beautiful like adding a lot of wood this is so awesome because you're creating smoke and at the same time you're creating a lot of heat so you're really getting that wood fire experience the chicken just looks insane the outside has gotten a really great color and it caramelized nicely the fat has rendered off so it's time to start slicing off the first cup and of course this is the time where we already get to try some of the first cuts oh man hmmm this is so delicious it's just insane absolutely perfect well the rotisserie is still roaring behind me we got a first batch ready so I got one of these Libba knees reps and try to get them if you can if you can't please make them yourself nothing better than homemade Oh forgot the garlic sauce a big gulp of garlic sauce brush that on your wrap I know I always like to add some crunchiness to it as well I don't know what it's called in English but I'll call it field lettuce and on top we will add the chicken that's a true thing of beauty and so tasty so damn tasty isn't that beauty unbelievable gorgeous and then we'll roll it up of course you have to put less in it than this but hey it's a thing of beauty it's lunch time and I can't wait any longer I'm going for it anaconda style and this is just a rap full of flavor in thing I know you guys are getting hungry so don't let me stop you from shutting down the computer run to the supermarket and get the ingredients and start grilling right now because you guys must be getting hungry oh this is

so so so okay", "mcP_PN7jbBE": "[Music] so barbed or barbless that's the question last time i was out here i think the video came out on thursday new videos every thursday and sunday by the way so subscribe if you haven't there's going to be way more content i was out here last time and we were using barbed hooks a treble hook on the bottom and a sliding snail knot on top every single king salmon we caught there was no way no chance that that thing was coming off the line and today i'm using only barbless hooks i want to see if there's a big difference between using barbed hooks and barbless sooks we didn't lose any last time i think there's a higher chance of losing them this time but as long as we keep tension on the rod i think it's going to be no problem so while the motor warms up we are going to get some herring ready and we're just going to cut some fillets all right so pretty simple these are still kind of frozen so hard to tell where the bone is compared to the meat but we'll do our best so in the last video the food that these salmon were eating were the threadfin shad and they were about this size and this actually looked just like what was in their stomach so that's what we're gonna use that's for two two rods right there again you're allowed two rods per person in california at these lakes if you have a second rod stamp so we'll be using four rods today so this is the setup here we're not using downriggers we're just gonna drift drifting i had the most luck with last time so i got a one and a half ounce weight here this is only four pound mono on here i got eight pound mono just because that's what i had but basically fishing was four pound on the bottom a sliding snail knot and these are both barbless so sliding snail on top a barbless one on the bottom and this i could just put the bait on it slide it up because these are barbless the bait could just slip off so the secret is having a bait button this right here is a bait button and a lot of people already know what it is a lot of times use this for a barbless hook you could use this or you could even use a cut rubber band you get the bait button there at the end and you just put it on the hook and that way it kind of acts like a barb keeping whatever's on it from sliding off the barbless hook that little bait button right there so we'll be using those with the herring so last time i was out here i was using this uh line right here this 12 pound test and i was trolling it was trolling anchovy and it was spinning and i did not have a ball bearing swivel on it so you can see the swivel i had didn't do its job i'm not sure if you could see this but the line just tangles up on itself and it's like that probably about 75 yards down on the spool so if you want to get out any line twists you don't have to cut off all the line here's a little trick if you didn't know that you can do if you're on a boat just get your line out with no weight nothing at all put it in the water and you just let it out as far as it can go maybe not as far as they can go but farther than the line twists and you just ride on the boat and and it'll straighten it out automatically just reel it in and it'll all be straight all those line twists will be out so you got the line out and it's being dragged by the water and every time it drags like that it just straightens it all out all right here we go with the first piece of bait just straight through the barbless hook on top okay and we're gonna put a bait button right there all right that'll stop that from coming off and we're to put the other hook straight through the bottom windy out here all right bait button on the other side that's all we're going to do a little piece of herring just like that looks just like their natural bait and we're gonna pull it out slow just so nothing gets tangled but there's the first line so we're gonna position ourselves at the deeper end and it looks like the wind is blowing this way about four or five miles an hour right now so we're gonna kill the motor once we get to the deep end do a long drift get to the end and just keep doing that all day until we limit out all right we're at our spot now it's our time to fish you can drop it down 30 pulls calvin glove man love man is back in the house drop it down yeah and uh loosen the drag and then we'll tighten the drag once we get down 30 feet oh bite bite fish fish on baby here get it get it you got him if he's on reeling yeah baby yep there it is yeah first one nah this might be big that might be a trout or something i'm not sure let me get the net over here oh let's bring him up no that's salmon oh go over here don't let him get on the motor if he goes it's okay just let him run real all right here he is right here oh barbless yep oh no barbless hook fail was i supposed to pull him up or just bring him up dude this first five minutes we're going to get we're going to get a ton of them no we gotta rebait it we're 20 feet deeper a little bit shallow i'm gonna go i will say that doesn't count okay any fish that i reel in that'll be the the count so i could compare from my own experience from last time all right let's do it again let's do it again 30 feet it's about 35 feet here but yeah about 30 feet would be good you didn't see that bite huh that bite was just very subtle but you got it yep i said it we had him we had him oh fish on baby all right dude this one's on for a while yeah oh this fish on here get this one yep get it get it pull it up doubled up baby all right now this is the real test can oh oh this is a good one oh calvin what happened man this one's decent all right baby net me man net me all right so i'm just just letting him get tired a little bit and once he's ready i can see the weight just let him get tired ready here he comes no no no all right dude first one let's go on the barbless all right but now look barbless hook comes right out just like that and we still got our bait buttons they are here so one for the barbless one for one so far see adam up there that's adam fishing from geez dude be careful man it looks scarier down here probably get him come on oh he's on already god that was fast that was fast all right don't reel when it's taking drag like that get him calvin all right there's one we're gonna put this one away let's put this one on the floor for now where is he oh it's a nice one dude all right he's coming in he's coming in not yet there he is see him reeling a little bit more i can get him i think just get that weight up to the top all right bring him over here get lift up the rod man nope not ready yet lift it up dude so i can get him right here bring it over to me let's go let's go let's go that's a good size yeah that is a good one nice all right calvin on the board oh dude that's a nice color good that's a bright chrome salmon take out that barbless hook right there boom so we're gonna bleed these we're gonna keep a couple i'm probably only gonna keep two calvin's gonna keep his limit of five but uh yeah just when you have barbless hooks it makes it a little bit more nerve-wracking just because the chances of getting off appear to be higher but dude this one is nice this is nice and chrome fighting on four pound tests dude that's awesome that's a nice looking salmon i'm really gonna try this next season in the ocean drifting a little piece of herring fillet i mean if it works for these lake king salmon it might work for the ocean king salmon all right dude that one on the bottom is nice all right i don't even have time to set any rods out i don't think we have any rods in the water right now just cleaning these fish you know last time i was out here i was drifting this one bait for a good 20 minutes and i didn't get a bite and then i switched out to a new one that had blood on it and that got bit within 10 seconds and calvin just got bit when he dropped down a new one within 10 seconds so drop down another one this should have some fresh scent hopefully a good bit man the bite slowed down a little bit and i have a theory that these baits that i'm putting on here they're too thick so i'm gonna cut it so it looks like the threadfin shad that they naturally feed on got a feeling that that might work instead of that big piece i'm gonna use this little sliver right here it kind of looks more like a fish also so there we go right there like that so i'm gonna use this tail piece that looks pretty thin that looks like a fish but this big square piece that does not look very good to me so i'm gonna cut it from uh the front here and just taper it down on the end and that looks about the size of what they've been feeding on i actually got another piece too that looks very similar so i think that i don't know who knows for real who knows for sure but that's just my theory oh this one there i switched this one to a small uh strip yeah a small strip also this one got bit gonna be a little while oh it came off no damn came off ah that barbless hook versus the treble so i guess if you want to bring in fish all the time use the treble calvin's on and i'm on and they both feel pretty big i'm getting getting my line spooled a little bit here all right we doubled up here being blown by the wind both of our fish feel feel pretty good and this is probably the biggest fish of the two days i've been fishing see this fish feels feels good dude he's got a lot of line out all right calvin's gonna net this one by himself you got this calvin oh dude that looks like a good one it's a really good one oh my god this one's taking a line dude he's crazy this one's taking mine like crazy oh no okay i gotta tighten the drag a little bit let's get him down line's almost tangled right closer oh this is the best fighting fish i've had for these last two days i'm sure you'll want me to breathe you don't want to go on screen man he's coming oh come on come on baby see this one i haven't even seen color on this one yet oh there he is there he is whoa whoa oh he might be wrapped up on my line oh he is he is oh this is dangerous he's wrapped up on my other line right now dude this one no no no wait till he comes up okay yep we go that's the biggest one so far four pound test baby let's go feels good let's go let's go let's go oh dude look at the color on it nice color that was fun and four pound test lines everywhere let's go all right bleed them right there in the gills there all right while we wait we're just drifting the bite's kind of slow right now we're not we're not at the hot spot so i'm going to clean these fish while we wait show you some of the the fish he's been eating i bet you there's some of those shad in the stomach show you the meat too it's not the best looking but it's all right stop fish it's all right this one's not bad this one's nice and orange this one might be a holdover from last year all right let's see what's in his stomach look at these little fish so this is what i'm trying to imitate with the with the with the herring something small like that that's just that's what they eat this is a little threadfin shad dude the meat in this one really looks good let's compare it to the others this one doesn't look too bad either all right i'm predicting a double right here i see a bunch of fish on the fish finder between 30 and 40 feet all right baby here we go it's about to go down oh no he's dude that one's on i'm reel this one up so you don't get just spooled so we don't get tangled it's coming in all right let's get him no nope not yet all right here we go reel that weight up yeah right there all right should be able to get him now let's go again number three yeah i don't want to break your hook just just take it out it's easy to take off let's take a look out sweet let's go all right that's number number five calvin just had one lost it because barbless probably so how many have we lost you lost two of them at the beginning and then this one and then i lost one so four we lost four and we've landed five oh fish oh it came off again i didn't look at the thing oh my god barbless dang dang dang i think it's the barbless so you really gotta be on top of your game if you're using barbless hooks just look down for one second and it's gone stole that bait just like that okay i'm just gonna hold my rod from now on not gonna give it any opportunity to get out just gonna hold it so i feel it so i don't have to be watching it there's bite oh fish on yeah let's go let's go how's that 30 feet let's go you're not getting off this time i didn't let him eat it but still here i'll let him you focus on fishing oh he's taking off he's taking off let's go baby doesn't feel huge but it's a fish same spot too man we're just gonna get a couple more and then we're gonna call it dude this is so fun this is so fun especially on this little tiny rod i mean look at the bend on that this is like the biggest fish i ever caught just kidding here he comes here he comes oh it's a small small one all came off bro barbless man the barbel is kicking our butts man no way these would come off with the treble hook no way oh maybe i i horsed him in that doesn't even matter man i didn't even have it in position at all dang i think i should have played him a little bit more i felt cool though feeling that bite and setting the hook on him oh there he is again there he is again i think he's on it oh got a little nibble just now something was on there come on baby come on back for it i know i don't think he took it off with that little nibble oh what's that going on here you got one you got one there you want it you take it see this one feels good bro this one's heavy this one's heavy bro he's staying down there he's this guy's staying down there is this one all the way down no bro this one's this one's a good one oh my god oh there he is right there see him that's pretty big yeah he's he's not i'm gonna let him get tired out i don't want to bring him up and she's shaking his head i think that's where we went wrong before so i'm just gonna let him get let me get tired just let him get tired you know i don't want to bring him up when he's really hot if i bring him up when he's hot he's going to wiggle and shake his head and that's when he spits the hook he throws that hook out of his mouth so if you can get him to the surface when he's just floating and skimming on top of the water you know then you don't have to really worry about him shaking free letting him get tired like all i got to do it's got tension on the line and that's all all i'm trying to keep see the weight right there he's got a couple more runs left in him i'm sure yeah oh he's shaking he's shaking this is well this is the time when he shakes free like that oh my gosh he's shaking like crazy man he's scared he's fighting for his life right now there is he's really trying to see i would rather have him run like that than get near the top and start shaking his head like that if he shakes his head ah it's like game over almost especially with these barbless hooks got me scared now you know it's only four pound test i don't want to just horse him in either i know when he gets to the surface he's gonna start fighting again he's really just trying to tire him out let him get tired without putting up too much of a fight now if you had a treble hook and you had a heavier line you could just pull him right in but here he comes right here all right calvin here he comes ready not quite oh my gosh dude he's dude look at that look at that he's not done he's this is a fighter right here yeah he's not giving up oh man and i just tightened the drag too a little bit oh jeez he's wow what a fish man what do you think how many inches i'm going to say this one's 23 inches i would say maybe 23 to 24. 22 22. okay okay here he is here he comes okay nope not done yet oh dude he's fat though oh nice one nice dude let's go let's go looks like about the same same yeah he swallowed it he ate that bait yeah he wasn't going anywhere he wasn't going anywhere unless he cut the line oh yeah baby and it's just it's just with the with the barbless hook it's like it's just so much more at stake you could just come off so easily it's like you really work on your technique yeah let's measure it why let's not his head here it's a good one man huh 20 and a half 20 and a half not bad not bad this one no no no i don't think so all right man we get one more and we'll call it he's hot he's on it all right calvin's on the last one of the day you sure don't lose slack with him yeah dude the last one of the day we just got to land it all right yeah baby look at that rod let's go i'm ready ren i'm ready when he's here oh not in the motor not in the motor stay away from the motor scaring me scaring me going to the motor oh no this is a good one all right there he is look that's a good one that's a nice one do you guys see that whoa look at that okay yeah he's about ready okay when you bring him in reel the weight all the way to the tip of the rod and then bring him up so i can get him on top on top over here nope not yet okay almost he's almost done lift it up dude lift it up to me man lift it up over here dude keep it down all right now now lift so now you can get them on top of the water and skim them over here let's go that's a chunker that's a chunker hook came out what came out yeah wow that's stronger uh 22 like this oh dude that's fat though man that's a heavy dude that's a fat salmon oh yeah let's go man let's make let's measure him and see how long he is oh wow 22 and a half 23. let's go that's that's the biggest one all right well i think the consensus is that if you want to keep fish you just want to farm them in use barbed use a treble hook but if you want to do it for the sport the excitement get your adrenaline up a little bit and work on your skill and technique do it with a barbless hook it's more fun and if you gut hook them the hook comes right out don't have to worry about hurting the fish either so if i have my way i'm going to do barbless every time i think that's just the unless i'm into survival unless i need to eat to survive or something like that but barbless hook all the way that baby really fun wow", "_sK1Gut9vOU": "family if you already know the

you're saying you use chicken thighs cause really taste you kinta ok Calypso chicken burger as I've said before Lorraine it's great to have something that gives a little bit of exotic taste and I think the mangos is what's gonna make this a little bit different so we've got our chicken thighs in here we're just gonna build up some flavors on there set some ginger definitely in there some garlic just gonna smash this garlic just to help it along but cuz you're gonna whiz it so you don't you know you're gonna need to bind it together is one organic egg put here give it a nice whiz it's all I'm gonna do now is just add a few things in at first I'm gonna chop up a bit of spit on the end then it be the child together bang just to create a little bit more flavours on top beautiful don't get the mango in good just to make sure that we get a little bit of crunch and a little bit of resistance as well yes because it looks very sunshiny that will actually know so once you've done that is just really to make shapes with them and I've got some that I've made here already here so we just sort of shape them in a kind of a burger she's not shape and then just to lock them up in a foil sort of a rectangular for it and the thing with the foil is it just helps to keep the burgers together that's my little trick my body has a little trick and then you sort of bung these in the fridge maybe overnight to get the flavors properly yeah into your oven for about 20 minutes and again good thing I've got some that I've done a bit early gee thanks oh cool Oh lovely yeah I like the idea of chicken burgers as well because everybody you know beef oviously live party as well you know I think it's brilliant when you have a party and you have something that most people can kind of in and I think what you do now to finish you off on your pan just forget it license Ford and finish that we're old very nice together of course it'll be thinking of some music singing some songs singing some songs absolutely just the key that summer vibes going and I've got some courgettes here that I'm just putting put a little bit of oil on them just to fry them off nicely reminding me of holidays it feels very holiday roots and barbecue committee point is you really nail it on you want to hold on for that summer feeling good yes yes I'm gonna make one up for you now okay okay let's make a nice burger for you so we've got some buns here just this up nicely with some red onions I'm gonna pop a bit of red onions on there on my favourite things yes some tomato of course absolutely wonderful again this is something that you can do get the kids to help as well it's brilliant get something to do something so important to get them organized and of course you can use any type of sauce but you want [Music] even two uses that'll keep me going and there's your can you see we've got some chips here some sweet potato chips Caribbean theme running through it isn't that absolutely wonderful it's quite big I don't even know if my big gulp will get ruined up but thank you so much you can come back any time oh no I'm going to be I'm gonna be David coming in and just go be a bit all because it'll

but I didn't match it up with the I'll get out of package here it's the coffee calm G sauce which is the garlic infused spray scent very potent very very potent spray downwind should have a warning on there spray downwind it does it does stink up the boat if you get it in the boat so I'm doing the same exact setup the freeway umbrella rig chartreuse jigs Charlie Brewer crappie sliders the little grub tails paddle tails they're about 2 inches long the top ones gonna be no scent the one on the left is gonna be with the G sauce one on the right is gonna be a golf Alive spray so yeah let's pray these things up throw 20 minutes on the clock let's even catching fish all right so let's quick spray this stuff up so one on the left is the G sauce be very careful with this guy and the one on the right is the gulp spray live minnow scent alright freedom up good we're not refilling anything so no reapplying cents 20 minutes wow we are really crooked there I feel like I feel like it's like whatever no not whatever come on get your leveling right get your leveling all right there we go good now I feel like all right like she's still off by by a Titch anyway alright 20 minutes on the clock starts right now 3 2 1 go so left was the G sauce right was the gulp spray top one is the new scent oh there's some big fish down there that's a I got to show you this oh I believe right there is a muskie I don't know where he went oh he's going down he's swimming back that's crazy got them gosh dang muskie chasing my crappie away who's the hits come on somebody hit it there he is got him that time and that would be top jig no sense oh I do have to be careful that these paddle tails don't get caught up in the hooks because I will prevent a fish not biting it or it'll prevent the fish from not biting it yeah oh there he is got him dang it that's a dink can't tell where was doesn't count there he is and this would be the one on the right which I believe is the gulp spray one for the gulp live minnow spray one for no scent Jesus what are you doing of course one of the two that got off probably could have been on the G sauce to be fair but we'll never know because I didn't land him yeah for you guys wondering yes I am rocking out with socks out on my deck there he is right at the boat that's the one on the wood one on the Left there's the G sauce world tied up once all for everyone here and we're only about five minutes in actually we're we're exactly at five minutes in right now there is gosh-dang they're not getting very good hooksets i don't know there is what do we got here one on the right I believe that's the live minnow the berkeley lab minnow sent two for you buddy there's a fish Wow well it's a fish and that is the G sauce one on the Left G sauce - well - for G sauce - for the Berkley and one for no scent there is Oh God dang it they're not hitting very hard that's for sure there he is oh we got doubled up we're doubled up yes all right we got one of the left that's a G sauce and the top one no cent G sauce three no sent to Berkley Gulp or Berkley what does that go up alive - so - four no sent two for Berkeley and three for G sauce coming in strong I'd like to get them tripled up I think that'd be that'd be pretty cool tripled up right at the last cast it's not a fish yeah it is dang it well there's fish right below the boat there he is there's one I believe its top jig you up top jig no-scent I think they're all tied at three oh wait no I remember now dang it no scent three drop G sauce three Berkley Gulp two three this is why we edit that's why we watch the editing room there is it's another no scent no sound coming in strong hey that's four I think there no scent is leading this thing now you got two minutes left alright this is gonna be the last cast thirty-two seconds just probably be the last cast I gotta wait for you to drop down they're trying to let this think about 15 feet and slowly bring it through the school

to be showing you how to compress javascript files so what I've done here is of great I've got a folder I'm going to rename this to 3GS and then it's just got a file in here which is just full of JavaScript and jQuery so I'm what we're going to do is local terminal go ahead and type sudo if you're on UNIX NPM install save the gulp vocal if I type in a password I should download to the node modules folder there we go so what we're going to do now up to the top require this plug-in so do uglify equals require you cool local if I come down here do gulp task call it compress give it a callback function close that I will do return because then just give me a second I write this I'm pretty sure yes and then we'll say I want all the files in here so we'll do the wild-card and do pipe local if I and then we'll give a destination let's just go test is equal to KS that's very simple go p-- is really easy when it comes to just compressing and well a lot of tough single but just easy it all makes sense you can do a variety of really useful things in just a few lines and we using return here just so we can use them a synchronous tasks so yeah let's go ahead and run this compress well go compress and no second we got here to go to tune have a lot go p-- file 15:14 I did I do sexy sauce my typing is really off recently and there we go we got our jeaious and there we have it a compressed javascript file and the one we used before was this and then it's give is this which is pretty neat so I can check in here and you can add like all sorts of different options for okhla Phi you can do stuff like keep the comments in your J's file or keep some of the comments or the comments not on the comments I think by default is none of the comments let's have a quick check and yeah there's a seem to be any comments in here and I believe I've got you I've got a ton in there so yeah by default it takes the comments out but you can mess around with this plug-in I'll leave it in the description below it's just basically minifying files using okhla Phi J is very simple stuff to be honest you shouldn't have any trouble if you do leave a comment below and thank you for watching the video if you did find this video helpful please leave a like and remember to subscribe and you can get me on twitter at call hard win which will also be in the comments below description below and lastly let me know what particular options you've used for uglify such as do you keep the comments and how you are passing certain objects to the comp the object compressor and just things of that nature I want to see how people using this generally largest use it by default like it is now because they seem to do a decent job and that seems to be the standard across minifying files when the jf files see ya thanks again for watching the video and I shall see the next one", "Akwm2UZJ34o": "Hot Food We sit down to eat, and the potato's a bit hot, so I only put a little bit on my fork and I

There's my Mum, she's doing the same til it's cool, just cool, into the mouth Nice But my Dad; my Dad, what does he do?

metric here and we're on page 293 pretty amazing we're almost to page 300 pretty incredible and we're looking again at the metric system but here we're talking about capacity we're measuring liquids so think about you know a water bottle is like about a liter when we're measuring think when we talk about teaspoons and tablespoons we're talking milliliters so a drink so one thing I want you to do today after our lesson is next time you're in the kitchen or the pantry I want you to look at the containers in the fridge or in your pantry on the shelf things that are liquid so think of soups or sauces beverages your milk it's going to be in standard but they also list it using liters and milliliters so I want you to just kind of look at that and kind of get help yourself get an idea of the sizes of the difference between one liter and one milliliter okay one milliliter is gonna be a lot smaller so if we look you know so water bottle would be like one liter and if we're measuring you know that's for medicine here so it's just a small amount we're talking milliliters there whereas if a bathtub it would take 150 liters to fill a bathtub so that is a lot more let's look at these it says what's marks a better unit so if we were having to take some cough medicine here or some type of medicine it looks like or guess we can think it's a spoonful of soup how about that we won't think about medicine would we measure that using milliliters or liters milliliters right a leader would be a lot again think of that the water bottle what about here we have one of these big typically they're about five gallons so what I measure leaders or leaders with that yes if I wanted to measure it in metric instead of using gallons I would use leaders how many leaders and one of those big coolers what about the drink here with a straw well that one's a little trickier because in all honesty if it's was really huge his super extra extra large gulp type drinks we might think of it as a leader but typically most drinks if you look at a can of soda popper one of your favorite drinks chocolate milk it's gonna be measured in milliliters okay so that would be milliliters hope that didn't confuse you let's look here we have okay a saucepan all right for cooking would that hold two milliliters or what its capacity meaning a fine it was mostly filled up right would it we say two milliliters or two liters right two litres most of you know like soda pop soda pop it comes in two liter bottles usually so if you get it in the bottle and sort of it can so if that helps you get an idea of the quantity of that okay here well they even labeled it cough medicine for us would the measurement be seven milliliters or seven liters right so we would write 7 milliliters it's gonna be small what about the kiddie pool here again the bathtub takes a hundred and fifty liters so what do you think about this kiddie pool it's it's not for dolls it's a real live kiddie pool so we're going to talk about 175 liters yeah great job again here some more practice with charts we're just multiplying times a thousand so you're gonna have the 1000 count at Ernie goes one two three four so we're just adding a thousand each time one liters one thousand milliliters to liters would be 2,000 milliliters three liters would be three thousand milliliters and four liters then would be four thousand you probably had your commas there already so let's answer the question now that we have the chart filled out we can use it to help us answer the question Deana made four litres of juice for a party how many milliliters did she make so I'm gonna count fine four liters how many milliliters would that have been four thousand so over here we're going to write four thousand on the line I hope that seems pretty easy it's a lot of it's just trying to get this new information to stay stay in our brain add it to our files so I want you to pause the video flip the page over and do the back and when you have it all done hit resume hit play again and you and I can go over the answers really quickly and see how well you did okay so I've turned my paper over and you've had time you pause your video and you took time to go ahead and do all these let's go over the answers and see how well you did I'm here we have a soda bottle would it be better would we say one milliliter or one liter if it was full one liters is again here measuring cup okay you think a 2-liter bottle this was one liter right the larger soda pop comes in two liter bottles so with it this measuring cup have 250 liters no it would be 250 milliliters so again when you're in the kitchen offer to help mom many moms willing to make a recipe and you can get out her measuring cups at least and you can measure some water I'm practicing doing that with the milliliters just to get familiar with it here we have a big bathtub which of these fits well we know from the front it took 150 for that bathtub of liters so it would make sense 160 is much closer here we have a gas can about of lotion or so pure and an aquarium which would we measure with milliliters or leaders leaders here this one's smaller so again we're going to use milliliters for that okay normally we measure in gallons so it makes sense to use leaders for the fish aquarium okay just a couple more to go here again we have a chart we're going to complete the chart to help us answer the questions we're going by ones 1 2 3 so I'm just multiplying times a thousand two times a thousand is two thousand three times 1000 is three thousand so I'm completing the pattern 1000 2000 3000 dad needs 3 liters of gas to fill the lawnmower how many milliliters of gas does he need well I come over and I find the 3 liters and I look down in my chart and it tells me that the answer is 3,000 milliliters great job here we go we're changing from meters to centimeters so let's go ahead and fill in the chart we're multiplying times a hundred so 2 times 100 is 200 centimeters 3 times 100 is 300 again we're dealing 4 meters to centimeters Karen has 3 meters of ribbon how many centimeters of ribbon does she have so again I find 3 meters I look underneath and my chart tells me that that is equal to 300 centimeters great job at the bottom here let's just draw a line to the appropriate measuring tool so again if I'm doing meters I'm measuring lengths I'm going to use the meter stick leaders are measuring liquids and capacities so we use graduated cylinders measuring beakers you know measuring cups lengths again you're going to use right a ruler a meter stick capacity we're measuring liquids so we're going to use again a beaker or measuring cup something like that I hope that was easy and and you're enjoying doing something a little different next time we're going to look at weighing things using scales so we're gonna use grams and kilograms I look forward to seeing you next time have a great day bye", "EEhZgovgNQg": "what's good Nikola needs

off and take the top off [Music] coz they give Ramona right here I went to the store squeezed ah nice quick easy man", "UmSc-ITLSGY": "[Music] hey guys thank you for watching today I got something special for you look at this thing this is an inside skirt steak-- of a cow it's huge right biggest steak you've ever seen well we're going to be grilling this steak together with these vegetables and we're going to create an adobo salsa so now we're gonna put them on these lovely little tortillas so let's get started before we are going to start on our salsa we're going to work on on our ingredients and I'm looking at this garlic bulb but this is crazy this is just one book with only four cloves in it they're huge I got two bell peppers Point bell peppers I got four Tomatoes and the right ones you know the ones that are really flavorful I got five by the way five and then I got these spring onions and two more onions this is what we're going to use for a sauce together with these smoked chipotle sauce actually it's already a sauce but basically it's dried jalapenos which have been smoked and then turned into a sauce so this will be the base of our sauce before we start on that we're gonna grill all this up and that will require for the onion that we'll slice it in half so with that we get a nice char on it now the grilling can begin as you can see I set the Big Joe up to grill I've set the cast-iron Halfmoon blade in there in the back on a high level and a grill grate in the front on a low level so the grill grate will be perfect for searing our steak and the cast-iron half moon it will be perfect for you know blackening our vegetables so let's start with that put this on the griddle plate without seasoning it with oil and let's see if we can get a light nice big roast each our on it the smell from the onions come right at you instant flavor and instant smell so as the vegetables are starting to soften up we're taking them off the one by one so of course the spring onions are the thinnest they're done first so in the meantime we'll close the lid and that will help to keep the temperature in and with the ceramics of course the tomatoes and bell pepper is going to be done much much faster and in the meantime the vegetable are roasting away this is an opportunity to work on the vegetables that are already done will cup the roots of the spring onion off throw them away we don't want to eat those and then we'll chop our spring onion fine look at how soft they become it's even becoming a little bit more difficult to slice them they're buttery soft so we just chopped and mashed all the ingredients that we roasted now we're going to put this in this bowl and make sure that we get all the juices that are on the board in there because this is our sauce and the more juices the better it is we'll add 1 to 3 tablespoons of the chipotle sauce I like 3 tablespoons if you don't like it as hot just do 1 tablespoon that's more than enough seasoning it up with a bit of salt and start mixing it together oh that is a beautiful sauce if you cut your ingredients this course you will be able to recognize them and they will add texture to your sauce look at how beautiful it has become let's do a quick taste test you guys are gonna absolutely love this look at the size of this thing it's huge well cut it in half otherwise we're just not gonna be able to manage it on the grill and look at the amount of fat that's on that don't take this off people leave it on there its flavor so we're gonna just put this onto the hot grill do you hear that sizzle we're not gonna do anything to it until we grilled it just a little bit of salt and pepper that's it we'll put this boom that sounds great right now these need only a few minutes on each side so we're just gonna check on them listen to that look at the color we created that is flavor we'll throw a little bit of salt on them look at the beautiful my yard effect that's getting on top of these skirt steaks that is pure flavor that is what we're looking for this is what we're trying so hard to achieve [Music] these steaks are almost done so we got these 30s we're gonna put these on the cast-iron skillet move the steak out of the way I will use the fat off the beef to crisp it up the tortillas and it will soak up all that flavor that's on that grill plate take off the steaks let them rest for around 5 to 10 minutes make sure you keep tacking on the tortillas and this is the way we want to look just puffing up a little bit tortillas are done perfect that is a beautiful skirt steak put the steak in and then we want a big gulp of our sauce don't be shy that sauce is beautiful look guys this taco is the bomb you got a tribe you know juicy tasty beef Chipotle whatever it's good it's good you got to give it a try so give it a try let me know how it turned out and see you guys next time [Applause] [Music]", "qmHb_ayMYIg": "in this episode of mind pump so this is a quoi episode

back and we mess around and I had a great talk with took Briana to breakfast like the last days I was there and we're talking about you know working hard and success in school and all that kind of stuff and we had a really good and so for me being able to connect with your kids and then watching our kids connect yeah there was a couple times where oh this was we went to go eat at that that breakfast place in Truckee squeezed in mm-hmm love that place by the way love that place so we go in there and you know how there's writing on the walls and on the tables yeah and you can grab Sharpie pens and do that so the kids we're like we got a right mind pump everywhere we got a right mind pump family and so I can see now that the kids are starting to come together and also be like you know yeah we're my family here the mind pump flag this is this was my first trip with all of your guys's kids and I felt the same way too that I've really got to start to connect more with all of them more than any other time it's such a great story so I told on the podcast before it was a long time ago we did an episode one time and I think it was a claw or somehow and we went down the rabbit hole talking about fights that we've gotten in in our entire life right and I said you know the last actual like bar fight or adult fight that I had gotten with her was with Justin and not actually not with him meaning on my proudest moment I was with him and this is like over 10 years now I mean this is over 10 years ago and so you're still a full-on adult yo yeah we're still nerd but metal way better than to late 20s right like way back we're in our late but here listen you gotta listen to this story because this it ties into your kids and it was just it was unreal to me how it unfolded so I had to recap the audience on this the old story first they understand what I saw and went through so about ten years ago maybe give or take a year to Justin and I were out at a bar in San Jose or Los Gatos area called Mount Charley's and if you've ever been there it's a small very popular place and it's like I have to preface this though we're at your place before that taking shot after shot after show you were hammered really it was it was a driving got there it was the druggist I've ever seen yeah it was an Mountain Charley's is extremely conducive to fighting energies privacy Lulla edgy this is over ten years ago I died so how do you defend your old self right you get a pass you have passes over a decade I think we've all I think anyone listening knows that they've grown tremendously probably in a decade right so anyways we're at the bar and justin is hammered and it is it's that one of those where people are you know you're so tight that you're getting bumped into and you're probably spilling drinks on you just say and you know it's it's not it's not the most conducive for dancing it's just we get there and we're walking through and I see Justin he's you know had another he had another shot as soon as we got there and he's making his way through the crowd and I had a buddy that was like this was a football buddy of my good friend of mine who was a linebacker and he got this exact same way and I see this side of Justin come out and he's walking through the crowd and he's walking through the crowd he's like shouldering people on her pit hard yeah and I'm watching people look cool you know spill their drinks and [ __ ] and sooner or later you know he runs into the big guy who isn't gonna just take that and then it's on you know here we go we're [ __ ] brawling and so I see a guy throw a punch at Justin I come behind him and [ __ ] choke hold them and you know we get kicked out and everything so the reason why I'm telling that story is I have this moment we're sitting in the tile house and I'm sitting by the fire and I'm having nothing hot cocoa and drinking and I'm watching Justin's two kids right Evert Nathan now Everett's the little boy and Everett is the one who you've probably heard Justin references he's like a mini version of just otally but he's the he's the younger one he's got what three years younger thirty-three years younger right so he's he's a little bit he's quite a bit smaller although he's catching up and Ethan is more like his his mom he's a he's a big reader he's a little quiet he's a lover he's just he's not like as physical as ever it is and I saw this expression many times while we were all together but one in particular that brought up this story and I'm sitting at the fire ever it's kind of near me and he's kind of mind his own business playing and Ethan comes walking from the kitchen and Ethan's kind of mind his own business and ever gets up and he starts to walk towards the kitchen where Ethan's coming from and as he gets closer to him I swear I can see Justin swagger the same way Justin's walking and he just [ __ ] throws a shoulder into Ethan for no reason and then like you know II think it's like set back a little bit looks down at him and then ever just looks at him grins like what are you gonna do you know and he just paid no attention to and they move it I went oh my god was that Justin to a tee yes and I don't see no oh like that was heck half the things like if you have an older brother you're just always testing your abilities like can I take him at any moment no you just always want to attack wrong genetics yes I had a really a really good time I like there was one part I maybe laugh or I think it was your nephew who brought the the PlayStation Daniel yeah and he had video games set up or whatever and he asks you know uncle Adam hey let's play Madden and I we've heard Adam talk about how awesome he is at Madden at least I don't know 15 times if you've listened to the show for a long time you know what I'm talking about how good he is it madam so he sits down to played how old is he he's 11 well ever 12 12 yeah so they sit down to play and they start talking [ __ ] to each other mmm and his nephew whoops his ass was not happy no he's not happy about it it's one of those young lion old lion the kid matter [ __ ] you were talking oh man as you can see Atta was so frustrated fire I'm competitive as [ __ ] for sure and you know I you we he's I mean it's funny to watch the the evolution right so if him grow obviously I've known him for 10 years Katrina and I have been together that long and so when he first got into video games obviously when you play with a kid that's six years old barely learning the controls and stuff like that even Anna at that time I was in the height of still playing like video games back then so it was me always whooping him and then over the years as he's gotten older and played more and played more and I'm playing less and less and now it's to a point where I think Plus these kids are all it's a whole new generation oh yeah they're just their games evolved tremendously and that's and you know and but still in the last couple because we do this every year it's tradition that they bring one of the consoles up and uncle Adam still comes down and play that's the only time I play now that's on the Christmas break when we're all together they pull the games out and for the last eight nine years I still whoop up on everybody even though I haven't been playing like once I get a game in where I like learn the controls again like okay let me figure this out like I end up still whooping on wall this is the first year where he's getting me so you probably saw a little bit of my oh he's gloating about oh yeah and here's the thing he in this this the same thing with my kid they deserved a talk [ __ ] because you were talking hello [ __ ] oh yeah and I talk a little like when I play [ __ ] with my son I talk to hell this [ __ ] so when he wins and he does it back to me and I get angry and let loud mean of course he learned it's proving ground you know like once they get one on you yeah like totally it's just the fight to come back at yard yeah one time we were playing that game rummy cube that we all played taking numbers games so when your son's really good yeah you have to match you know patterns and numbers and he's just a wizard with that kind of stuff and I remember one time we were playing it was Jessica me and my daughter and I told my son I said come play with us and he goes no I don't want to play whatever you want to watch TV or something I'm like come on I forced him I'm like no you're gonna sit down and you're gonna play this game with us because it's boring because I'm just you know I'm just gonna crush it was too boring I was like [ __ ] I'm like sit down and I really tried dude and I thought to my head I'm like as soon as I beat him i'ma talk [ __ ] for a week i'ma teach you a lesson but I didn't win I go mask it he's like I told him he gets up walks away like funny yeah Justin I want to know what happened with you on the it was a snowboarding run yeah so we went we went skiing I went snowboarding so Courtney her sister and then my two boys I actually signed them up for ski school and so the whole day they got to learn you know under professionals as like oh thank God because I didn't want to like you know spend the whole time trying to teach them and everything I wouldn't even get a run in so we did that and then we kind of went off on our own and I hadn't snowboard I don't know maybe in like five six years something like that but I mean I'm not like a bad snowboarder I'd like I'm again on preferencing this all because it was you know a bad thing that you're making a lot of excuses for yourself yeah I've turned 40 this year you know there's a lot of things happening Sun was in my eyes exactly so we were going on all these runs I probably went on I want to say eight runs or so and I started to get that stupid confidence where I was seeing jumps to the left to the right I'm like who I'm gonna go test it and I went and off a few jumps showing off for his wife yeah cuz I'm there for my wife and her sister I'm like you know you guys got to know I still got it you know and so I'm doing my thing and there are pretty good skiers right yeah Courtney hadn't done it since for like 20 years so she was really scared and so we actually start on the bunny slope and everything but she picked it up right away like riding a bike so yeah they were doing fine and they were like cruising down like taking their time doing the thing and so it was funny because they're like we could hear you like behind us cuz like my board and in my body and everything make a lot of noise apparently as I go yet he's coming for you and so like this is get like the eighth run or something and we're going towards the top and we're trying to come down to eat lunch and so I'm like crossing over a few trails and so there's this one big trail I'm picking up speed like I got like a lot of speed going you know laterally some I start to cut and I'm cutting across and I go to like dig my heels in a bit more to grab an edge and I get nothing and the board literally kicks right out from under me and the board like goes up over my head my head is the first thing that slams back boom on the back of my head to my neck - then my upper back and I saw a flash of red and just pain instantly and then I just laid there just Oh for like ten minutes there was a guy thankfully there that was like part of the ski patrol saw this whole thing happened he's like oh no he comes up to me and like he's trying to ask me all these questions you know because obviously how do you remember that do you remember that whole period hard questions - yeah what's the square root of 490 I wouldn't know that if I did know I had - yeah yeah he asked me like what the the the run I was on I don't even know so the first question I got wrong you know it so he's like oh I don't know about that like started asking me like what day it was like you know who I am my name and all that so I'm like okay I could like I could answer it but I was in pain like I was in a lot of pain I had like a blurry like vision so anyway it was a bad it was a bad fall probably the worst I've had in terms of like a head slamming injury so I just of course you know dumb asked me like wouldn't take them up on the whole like oh I'll take you down to the very bottom in the sled you know and like you don't have to do the rest of the run fine and so it got up and like mustard like whatever energy I had with a throbbing head just like going down and like every like you know little like imbalancing thing I freaked out and then was like making my way back but yeah I was sitting there just just throbbing headache and all that and then finally just called it a day and went home how did you break the ice sister because you know the thing that robably if it was me I would have died because your head is made for that it is have you ever tried one of his hats on yeah it's a it's a thick dome yeah thick head your head if I put your head on right now it would fall down to my nose yeah I have a big football head it's funny cuz like so so I mean that's why you survived yeah the way it was described to me if I hit my head like that I probably dude so like all these stories come out later like I'm trying to tell everybody what happened you come back to the house everybody's concerned cuz Courtney I don't know what she said to everybody what happened was she scared we had a list of potential hosts because yeah I'm like but then there was like part of it where I'm like am I gonna get new powers you know what they don't like Navy I'll become a savant they're like I'll be able to like see like like colors and smell them yeah I've heard stories about that you know where people that head true that's actually true there there's been these are like real reports of people who've had head trauma there was one guy who had head trauma woke up and was a [ __ ] piano savant can you play the piano they're a movie new a whole nother language to like like Icelandic I think I read a guy that like woke up and he could speak Icelandic weird have you ever been Iceland that's crazy exactly what was it Xena glassy the ability to speak in unfamiliar language so it's a real thing like these real like occurrences but yeah dude I mean and then most people die most people just get really bad yeah like like brain hemorrhaging things happen and they yeah they said comic books or they could have you know every superhero like you know jumped in you know radioactive liquid or something comes out I have superpowers whereas most people will get cancer everybody has a story about this fall like I guess this is a very like like I guess a lot of people have fallen this particular way and it's caused a lot of issues like my brother-in-law was telling me about one of his friends that actually felt like this and was in a coma for two months oh geez yeah scared the [ __ ] out of me another guy like the guy the ski patrol guy said the last person he saw fall like that like split his helmet in half like broke the whole helmet in half and went to the ER in like so he's like you felt just the same exact way is all these people and you and now dude were you given the opportunity to wear did you wear a helmet and if not what did they know that locate and I'm definitely this new advocate for a minute snowboarding I took him shopping for lame you know cuz like it there's no way to look cool I'm like way to ruin it for me to dude everybody I've been getting [ __ ] since I've been posting about snowboarding copy your fall guy because apparently I you know like it happens and it was totally a freak random thing but I'm like totally an advocate for helmet weary you don't think you were being an [ __ ] just a tiny bit no not in this particular part yeah no I feel like you were doing things you shouldn't have been doing the first day of riding again maybe a back flip yeah but I mean the conditions were great they were I'll make I'll make like excuses haribol day to be doing anything crazy off the trans tupid yeah no at all brown patches I was going through so yeah it was stupid well I'm glad you're okay I was a little concerned but you know then when you came out and we talked to you a little bit I was like okay yeah dude I was so sore the next 2-3 days like my neck like was super swollen my neck and then like I was so stiff I couldn't even turn left or right like looking now you know you've had you've had concussions from football do you feel that it was as bad or worse I feel like it was worse oh wow yeah yeah because I mean the other ones like it they would go away like I it's so bad dude you know what the old method was when you got a concussion in football and you're like still trying to play like you would pinch like in between your thumb and your pointer finger and you'd pinch as hard as you can to kind of like help suppress the pain and they need to keep playing that's what I used to do now you know why I can't remember like like the person the group that needs like more head trauma I mean come on the guy who could handle it though you know again again honest if any of us fell that way we probably wouldn't be here I need my brain scan jeez anyway well I'll tell you what what else this trip did for me it it it was a period it was a period at the end of the fat days oh yeah like we're all talking about that this is a fattest I think we've all be yeah dude it's domed in a while yeah it's it's time it's time to reverse hit reverse team TV we need an overhaul no I just that's actually what I had such a good time but I was most excited to get home to get back to like my routine like you know there's it comes a point where I I don't know I mean to me that's that's good balance I mean we were out for 10 days that's the longest trip that we've ever taken any of us and we were getting just everything whatever through the roof I had candy I had bread I had pie a lot of everything waffle wine every day my doing so did you guys for the audience but one of the things we do when we we go on these trips we had 22 people in this house and Katrina's family has always done this and I love this I've I've never done this with another another group or family until her family and I love introducing it to other people that travel in big groups and that's you know you have we pair everybody up so there's 11 pairs and you are responsible for one either breakfast or dinner one day that's it and that one day you have to you know shop for the food you pay for it you cook it and you clean the kitchen but what's awesome is you have that one meal that you go all out on them the rest of week you notice a week you don't worry about anything and they in the kitchens always the kitchens always clean you're always having a great meal either breakfast or dinner or like man I love doing that and it's fun because because it's a tradition for the family everyone kind of brings it you know everybody likes to try and wow everybody for their meal and stuff did you guys have a favorite meal that you guys had during the trip you know I thought I thought it was a lot of fun I'm trying to think what was my I loved the the chicken potpie that Katrina made along right yeah I really really enjoyed it in fact I was gonna ask her for the recipe but no I thought that was a great idea it's awesome because everybody kind of eats together mm-hmm you know it was now preparing food for that was hard how many people 20 to 20 people yeah that was yeah tricky that's difficult you either undershoot or way over yeah it's a time everything or whatever and so I feel like we could have done you know cuz Jessica and I'd had one night I feel like we could have done a little bit better but it was fun I was a little stressed out about it cuz I've never cooked for that many people yeah but then you know we had fun with it we put music on we had some wine making the food you know kind of enjoying you know the whole bus I think you guys missed out the last night because you guys stayed at the other place yeah we had I don't know if it's Larry and I forget who else's was working Oh Larry brings it when he does that's right we man it was yeah he had some kind of like spiced chicken and he did all kinds of different like breasts and thighs and and then zucchini dish and like these potatoes with like this crusted like parmesan everything was like fantastic yeah that was my favorite Oh geralyn's breakfast was mine the way she does the the poached eggs and then puts him on the almost oh you missed that miss convinced no Burnett hollandaise no yeah that looked like a Sunday brunch oh do do she goes that's her son it's his birthday right so it's his birthday Jen about 25 yeah on New Year's Eve right and so you know that was his request that his favorite breakfast that his mom makes and it's caught it so good it was really good I like what you and Doug did when you guys did to make your own pizza oh yeah that was good that's fun great the kids have fun with that so that's what I you know I've been a part of other big groups and that it was an ex of mine that her family that was their tradition when they all got to go the fact they did that was their Christmas you know most people do like a prime rib or a turkey like a big but they had so many people that they would do this make-your-own-pizza thing and I was like man the way that works and the the interaction that you get from all the people like making it and laughing it's just a good fun meal to have like interactive and I got Doug and I nailed down I mean we were pretty close on just the right amount of everything yeah I thought we had the least amount of leftovers we did have to run back to the store and get is this the sauce tomato sauce yeah we were a little light on the tomatoes which is hard to judge with that many well that's your experience with like if my mom was there making food it would have been great because she's cooks for that many people every two or more every time there's a family function yeah I've never done that Jessica never does that for that many people so we're like trying to calculate exactly so we were a little short on a couple things but yeah 22 is a lot that was it was hard for us to I mean it's hard to gauge what was great about those what do you call those the sausage balls no meatballs I'm sorry but like all this like like vegetables that was snuck in there oh yeah yeah well I can find out later and I was like oh great cuz the kids ate them up like crazy oh we filled them up with tons and tons of vegetables actually that's it that's something that Jessica does really well she'll make a meat dish or something and she'll pack it full of vegetables and the kids will just I didn't even know that yeah oh it was full of lots of different like a bunch of them well I tell you what was great about your meal I know you were hard on yourself about it because you were a little light on the sauce and and whatever but actually was very refreshing because we were eating a lot of heavy meals and a lot of like you know fatty and and carved like to have a meal that felt light yes felt really good was good timing for your guys's meal to hit in the middle yeah yeah it was really no no it's and there was a revealing moment for me that I never you ever do something with growing up that you feel you you kind of really think it's a normal thing for everybody cuz you grow up with it but then when you meet with other people you realize oh this is just kind of what we do or whatever so and this might be a cultural thing but in my family before we eat before the meal starts somebody will say you know you've heard bone Appetit right you've heard that before Mew so my dad would say something in Italian you know and you know it's a bomb prawn so is what he would say it just means good you know good dinner and then someone would reply something else and then we would all eat and it's just I grew up with before you eat as a family somebody says something to bring everybody together and start so while we're having dinner having dinner every night with everybody every night I'm saying cheers Cheers everybody Cheers right and Jessica second I notice you do that every time before dinner I'm like oh yeah do you try things like why do I do that like oh it's because the way I grew up is when you have a big group the way you make everybody rather than everybody kind of eaten on their own the way you make everybody feel like they're together is you say something out loud and then other people reply was actually really surprised which is also probably why Katrina's mom really enjoyed you guys and you in particular about that Sal is that she normally does that that's kind of heard so they do the same thing she normally like will say something yes well you know hey I'm just I'm so happy to have all of you I love it she kind of and sometimes she'll even go around the table and say something individually about each one of us and and then we then we eat I love that but I think the only reason why she probably didn't was because we had such a large mixed group huh that I didn't you know didn't want to impose on anybody else so ironic that you say that and that was a tradition I'm sure she would have loved to continue keep that going but I tell you what dude the fat days are over we got to start looking like a fitness podcast again I'm saying man yeah no I I mean it was fun I'm oh I'm so over it like I yesterday I and it what it was it's okay to be honest it's not that I feel fat I'm joking what it is I feel don't feel good I feel inflamed my mind didn't feel a sharp I got sick did ya we haven't been sick in over a year and you know the first week of bad eating poor sleep it's just an example like what so what I did is I'm like okay and you know I've gotten to the point now you guys also you know we've been do nutrition and fitness for so long that when I change things up it's rarely because I want to change my appearance although I'll joke around about that it's mainly because I I've identified that I'm feeling a particular way so what I'm feeling is foggy minded I'm not have as much energy and just more stiff and inflamed just in general so I came back and I'm like okay I want to go anti-inflammatory I want to bring back mental sharpness and for me and this is for me personal so if you're listening right now this may not apply to you but this is something that I've identified for myself fasting always reduces inflammation I mean now studies show that it actually does that for a lot of people but for some of you that may not be a something that's effective if you have issues with eating or you're doing it for weight loss it's not a good idea but for me at weight loss was never an issue it was always weight gain so fasting was actually a good practice so fasting reduces inflammation and then going on a ketogenic type diet the one thing that I noticed for myself on the at least the short-term effects of ketogenic diet is mental sharpness so I did it fast and now I'm coming back I'm gonna go keto now I know my performance didn't decline in the gym I know I've already lost water I'm not gonna get as good of a pump but I'm already starting to feel the mental sharpness so I'm doing you know research on this and you guys know me if I get into something I get into it right so I'm reading about you know ketogenic effects on cognition and there's definitely some benefits a part of the the benefits of that type of diet for the people that have been tested or for some studies not all studies but for some studies is the the energy production and in the brain and how the brain uses energy it seems to be and they find this pretty consistently with people who have dementia and alzheimer\u00eds so when you take some of the Alzheimer's put them on a ketogenic diet or you have somebody who's you know dementia and raise their ketone levels they tend to think a little bit sharp yeah what's up with that with the brain functioning it seems like more optimally on ketones do you think because it's a it's like a slower process versus something like the oversaturation of glitter cleaner burning energy right it's like a slower cleaner process right it's not necessarily slower although for physical performance it's definitely slower so like if you're on a ketogenic diet you guys know this and you're gonna do like low level intensity but long duration it's actually a great diet for that you know like if I'm gonna go do a long hike without food going into it already in ketosis is probably a good thing for a lot of people but for other types of performance explosive performance strength or whatever you're gonna lose strength you're not gonna perform negatives explodes not a great athletic diet for most people but for the brain it just it's a cleaner burning energy and one of the things that happens to people as they age is that their brains start utilizing glucose not as effectively in fact they call Alzheimers type 3 diabetes so when you switch off of glucose now you're using a different kind of energy and you're kind of bypassing why your brain you know some of the some of the problems with your aging brain so you tend to think a little sharper so this led me down just the whole you know rabbit hole of ATP and ATP hey all that stuff right so I started reading about cycle yeah ATP for example is I mean that's like one of the main sources of energy for the entire body it's it's an extremely important part of the my body and you know it's found in all forms of life so it's like it's a main source of energy for all sources of life it's now they often refer to it as a molecular unit of currency of intracellular energy transfer so it's extremely extremely important so I'm like huh what are some of the most effective ways to maximize ATP production creatine obvious taking create and I take creatine on a consistent basis but this is why they find that creatine works so well for other health effects aside from just performance they're finding it's got cognitive boosting effects antioxidant effects anti-aging effects so I'm like okay I know about creatine what else is an effective way to get the body to increase its ATP production red light therapy No red light therapy and this is other benefit yeah this is one of the main reasons that they think it works in the first place like why does for example I'll give you a couple examples two things where there's a lot of promises with products and very very little actual results hair regrowth and removal of wrinkles like this a [ __ ] ton of products out there that promise to regrow hair [ __ ] ton of products that promise to reduce the appearance of wrinkles or whatever very few things deliver in particular with hair regrowth there's like you know minoxidil I think is one of the things that actually might work and red light therapy red light therapy actually they think the reason why it works is when you shine this type of light the k-cup of the ATP yes it dramatically increases ATP interesting and this is also why it reduces the appearance of wrinkles so I'm like okay so you guys again I get into [ __ ] right so I'm like alright fasting kita jagd I already taking creatine got my Juve light out and I'm like I'm gonna start this every single day because I want to reverse this like I said this feeling of you know fogginess or whatever I'm with you the same I love school I'm not I'm not on the ketogenic diet but I love after a trip like that I'll do like a nice 24-hour fast and then I'll kickstart like me and for me all the way I do it is I start with a fast then I go back to eating and when I'm eating I'm I'm just eliminated like I mean [ __ ] I allowed candy in there I allow dessert in there I allowed a lot of snacking in there I just get rid of all the easy stuff right away for me to let go of I'm not gonna be chomping on Wheat Thins in the middle of the day I'm not gonna be grabbing some Mike and Ikes while I'm watching Netflix later and so I just eliminate the stuff that I know isn't serving my body very well it's a great stuff and and the fasting though is the is the big key though like you said is I fast first I feel like I just totally kind of cleans me out and then when I reintroduce food and this to me this is a a more healthy relationship with fasting I'm not doing it cuz I'm like oh I need to lose click glad you said that it's no I'm just trying to reset my body yes it's more of a it's not if you approach the fast let's say you go on vacation or you you you've eaten really bad or whatever and you just haven't been super kind to your body and then you think I'm gonna fast so I can lose some weight real fast or whatever I'm gonna fast so I don't eat terrible way to use fasting and what's gonna do it's gonna encourage the restrict binge behavior the other way to approach fasting which is what I think you're talking about Adam and the way I've my relationship with fasting is it's more of a spiritual practice and spiritual practice being I'm gonna detach from food for a second I'm gonna I'm gonna create a detachment where it's challenging right because you just need to be needing garbage so you fast so you you you become comfortable with the fact that you're not eating this stuff or eating anything and then when you reintroduce food you're you've got a better relationship with food there's a very very big difference between fasting as a spiritual which is why fasting is present in all major religions it's a spiritual practice but if you use it as a way to die it that's just starving yourself yeah I just feel there's times where where my guts a little more agitated because I had been like introducing all these foods I know you know make it work over time and to for me to kind of step away from that and allow you know everything that's going on internally to kind of calm down and then yeah you can use it as a way to kind of reflect on other things as well like it's a much healthier prayer yeah and it's you know it makes me wonder too cuz you know you guys know January's like everybody wants to work out everybody wants to clean up their diet and I used to think and I don't know why I didn't piece this together it's probably less to do with the fact that the years over and more to do with the fact that the holiday season is over right and a lot of people feel that way right it is no I'm sure everybody's crazy speaking of that did you guys see our wall-e prediction is coming true oh you're talking about the segue yes wait did you see this so you remember well and this was probably I don't know six months or a year ago when Sal first brought up I think wall-e or you did just and one of you did and I hadn't watched it so I wouldn't watch it or two and you and you guys made the point that you know we are moving in this direction how accurate accurate they predicted what our potential future may look like where all these people are floating on these you know hovercrafts we're just sitting and sucking on a Slurpee with a TV screen right yeah right in front of them and so Segway has it's funny you know it's funny I someone shared with me before so Jackie sent this article over and I had already seen this ago saying my best friend sent the Segway over but he didn't send the article over and I go oh my god the Wally prediction is and then Jackie sent over this morning an article and they actually referenced the wall-e in it nothing all that's so crazy because we talked about this but so it's basically a chair that travels around for you like the Segway but you sit in it yeah is it gonna have collisions it looks like this for people that are like you know impaired like they can't walk or is this like supposedly marketed to just well here's the thing here's the thing brilliant invention I'm not the me I mean for people that can't walk right right bringing this up is not a to slam segue by any means it's just us I mean how do you think it starts it starts with probably people who absolutely need it right and then it turns into rascal scooter well yeah and then exactly then eventually you get in and you're like oh this is kind of cool and nice I can just kind of tilt back and it takes me wherever I want to go especially if it's connected to like you know devices and Wi-Fi it's not if it's not it will be yo you know I'm saying if it's so I went to Disney World years ago probably like seven or eight years ago have you guys ever been to Disney World I've been once okay the world okay it's scared the [ __ ] out of me there were traffic jams of those rascal scooter yeah traffic jams because so many in the vast majority these people were not like handicapped in terms of you know they had full use of the arms like obese just massive yeah they were just huge people and they were and I remember we'd be in line and there'd be like 15 scooters in front of us I'm like yeah that never have I remember and it's always like at the end of the ride because they can come up through the back you know of there and then they get to you know to sit in the front but it's like yeah dude it's crazy how like how many see now dude I saw one where there was this woman and she was I mean oh good 350 pounds and she's on the scooter and her daughter is sitting on her like her belly and her daughter was very overweight four-year-old with a huge like one of those huge like the biggest helps big gulps full of soda just drinking and she's driving around and I just like oh well you know they make those like gallon-sized now I remember when I was a kid but so much sugar do you remember humor I remember when the big gulp was invented yeah big gulp and then they had the double gulp which was a big deal which it was all it was was I think 32 ounces back yeah it was which was crazy how many grams of sugars in that I've got Hunt 200 No wait Doug look up what the they have a super big gulp now which is a gallon yeah it's got a handle right I took a picture of it's like a gallon yeah like five six years ago I posted on my it's a long time ago the first time I saw one at 7-eleven it's it's got a handle like this and it is a jug again it's like this I don't know what it's called but it's the the highest level of the super I mean there's so there's like the big vault a super big gulp the super duper big gulp like there's like so many levels to that you know what's what's crazy about that and this is when people say like oh food doesn't have addictive properties and there aren't these whatever that's like it makes me laugh because like do you have eyes do you not see I have I have trained many people who many people 100% guarantee you guys be like oh yeah I heard that all the time or they didn't like the taste of water yeah I don't know I don't like water it didn't taste good what do mean is it tastes good its water it's refreshing and why does this happen because you're how many grams of sugar so what does that say 156 carbs let's see that's only that's only the 44-ounce are you got to find the big one Doug oh God six grams of sugars look up the biggest big gulp or whatever I don't know what you're gonna google for it I'm gonna try and help you here the biggest the biggest big gulp that's crazy dude I remember vividly like my brother my dad would fill up those double gulps of like Cherry Coke and I was always like wow that's so much sugar did and it was like not even a thought back then it was just like oh you know it's a beverage that's crazy called that there's a there's okay listen there's a big gulp the super big gulp the double the double gulp the extreme gulp and then came in 2006 came the team gulp there's an extreme gulp and then there's a team called you're just gonna go yeah so like you don't feel so bad about ordering it oh yeah this is for me and my team yeah Wow but again I had clients who didn't like to taste the water because they drink soda so often that they literally did not water I had a client once tell me water made her nauseous water that's not that's a problem session yeah it's like the one thing your body needs yeah a six thing I don't like air there it is right there the lives right there oh my god look at that thing that's insane they have sugar cubes next to a tissue this is why when you told me that that was it coke had you were telling us had a monthly plan you said was unlimited I like no way are these are these refillable I don't know how these how they work how did can you come back and refill them as when you pay the top oh yeah I'm sure oh he's bringing back that's so insane is anyway I want to tell you guys about I just remembered so a couple couple weeks ago Jessica and I have you guys seen the billboards um you have to have they're everywhere the billboards that have said they say Shenyang on them and it shows like a Chinese dancer is that like what does that call the Cirque de Soleil kind of it looks like that pull pull up Shinyoung and I want to see I want them to see the picture 100% guarantee you've seen billboards cuz they're everywhere you're talking about this but you never told me what it was no no look up the look up the picture you'll see what it looks like right there performance so it's got like a Chinese dancer and they've got like the nice dress and amazingly yeah yeah so I seen it everywhere right and I you know Jessica loves performance art type stuff of course my parents love that Jessica of course cuz she travelled with Cirque de Soleil for so long yeah and I enjoy I enjoy seeing the the types of physical abilities people can accomplish when they train for years and years so for Christmas I thought obviously great present for my parents so again I don't know anything about it all I know is I've seen a ton of billboards and it looks like it's gonna be like a Cirque du Soleil type of thing sure and then so I buy tickets right I buy tickets for my parents the date comes up we all go to it when we get there now that I'm actually there we're waiting for the show to start we get there early like let me look up the history of Shen Yun and I read up and it says banned in China so now my brain in China s and I'm not really interested on my oh cool I like that part let's see what's going on here so I read more about it it was a stuff like bind feat no Rosie no so I watched as I'm watching the show there is a very strong religious undertone to this whole thing like they'll do the performances and then in between there'll be like one where there's like an angel coming down from heaven and they bow to it and then they have like these these plays these like like scenes where there's Chinese Communists you know beating the crap out of them and then they come back and they dance and then they you know show them this magic book which is obviously their religiously social commentary what so I read about it and so it's this religious group in China that is like super religious and you know as you guys know communism doesn't like any kind of really no because you don't want anything above you know the state yeah the state or whatever but they're kind of culty so I'm not like advocating for him and I don't know a whole lot about them but outright I read was a little bit kind of coal tea or whatever uh-huh they got persecuted thrown in jail some of the many of them murdered in China banned their leader came to America and started this dance show or whatever and in a way to spread and so it's funny as I'm reading reviews about this show the negative reviews are all the people who are surprised by the political commentary they're like I came to watch a dance show I didn't come here to see like you know angels coming down and weird [ __ ] or whatever so was interesting it was very interesting it was an interesting show but again if you had liked it or what was your takeaway I enjoyed it but you got it was it really heavy on the political side the religious undertones were pretty strong dude they were yeah but but if you get around that and I don't really care whatever do you think preach it they were preaching bad message the messages were good from what I saw it was like unity and taking care of each other but there were parts were again they were like holding the magic book and then you know the angels and I kind of stuff but if you can just get around that watch the actual dancing and the performance it was spectacular like it Jessica liked it too she definitely enjoyed it but it was it was interesting anyway another thing I wanted to bring up so along the lines of inflammation I almost talked about that earlier I also went down the rabbit hole of looking up cannabinoids you guys know I'm always really interested in you've been on the the CBC kick for a while yes yes so CBC you know I got more information on its cannabis chroming and I like reading about other cannabinoids because we tend to think that all there is is THC and CBD and the other cannabinoids you know they don't really do anything that's a lot of people think but the other cannabinoids are fascinating and some of them might even be more interesting than CBD for example so cbc doesn't bind ver well to the CB receptors the ones that like THC will bind to but it does bind to two other receptors one's called trpv1 and another one's called TRP a1 and both of these are linked to pain perception and so what happens is when CBD this is what's really cool when CBC attaches to these receptors what happens to the body is it actually increases its own natural levels of endocannabinoids endocannabinoids or cannabinoids your body makes naturally like an and amide so cbc doesn't give you the cannabinoid effects of like let's say THC but what it does do is it makes your body make its own natural more natural endocannabinoids and it increases circulating levels of them so what does this mean well it means that you can use something like CBC and not get this this strong down-regulating effect like you'll get with THC like well you'll notice with THC is you use THC and then you need more and more of it to get the same effect to the point where I know stoners who use cheese 20 grams 30 grams of THC and that for them that feels normal because they use it so often CBC makes your body utilize its own natural cannabinoids so it's probably a better cannabinoid to focus on for people who just want health effects don't want to get high or whatever well again again it sounds like you're making the case for full spectrum versus what a lot of people are doing is isolating one of the calm yes they're trying to concentrate and find those like specific and cannabinoids yeah but only happen yeah no your hundred-percent right because what we do in Western medicine that's both good and bad is we'll identify an active ingredient and then we'll [ __ ] concentrate it and ate everything else instead of thinking there might have been a reason why as well together and it sounded nature this way yes so like acute effects so if you want a cute like you have a strong let's say you're you know you've got cancer and you need some strong [ __ ] to really kill the pain you still want to use all the cannabinoids you probably want a lot of THC yeah you probably want a lot of THC to do that but let's say the average person and you're like I want to utilize cannabinoids for their just general balancing effect cuz that's what they do they balance the body balance pain they balance anxiety they help with memory formation and forgetting which is important there brains ability to forget information is important part of you actually remembering important information so how do you balance that out one of the best ways you do it is you utilize the full spectrum of cannabinoids and you probably don't want a lot of THC which is like a hammer you know that's the thing that makes you feel the high or whatever so full spectrum you know hemp oil extract for example is like Ned and in fact Ned if you ask them they'll so you can see third-party testing and it'll they actually test all the cannabinoid it's not just CBD CBD so you'll see OCBC CBG you know they'll see the terpenes all that stuff so it's really so inflammation from a different direction did you guys see ricky gervais tsa's his speech he did for the Golden Globes yes I sent that over and that was did that just happen yes that'll just happen like yesterday oh it did did you watch it live or to someone so yeah so Courtney watched it live and then I saw people like posting about it and then I was like what what was it dude his watch dude like he just eviscerated like Hollywood the corporation's like he just went all out I couldn't believe it dude can you feel was amazing and you feel what's happening yes no it's we're losing their power well and not only that but we're also watching with comedy we're starting to push back on like sensitive like we're done with this woke [ __ ] yes like he went so hard against it like I was like I wanted to stand up and applaud you know it's like just the bravery of him just like getting up there and like saying oh it was problem we were probably due to go on this you know this kick for a while now of you know being altura sensitive which by the way you know when I talked about I brought up my family in the thread over Thanksgiving in the political got a heat for that from who from what one of my cousins that hurt and I gotta go back and listen to it cuz one I didn't say anybody's name and then to you know I don't it was probably the cousin you're arguing well no it wasn't actually was another one that was just coming to her defense and everything and I thought did I say something that was really like harsh I was just I was making the point that it's unfortunate that we try to censor everything so much that we shut it down versus like you know and we talked about the importance of like a jester and comedy means anything like that and that you know it doesn't need to be an argument and a fight over it it can be it could be funny and problem to light right you know I feel like we're seeing that now in comedy again where they were they freaked out for about a decade there where they were getting you know pushed out of college by the way Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself yeah Hollywood is I'm gonna generalize now sure of course there's these people who stand out Hollywood is a sea of hypocritical virtue signaling fake-ass people now for those youth listening you think oh that's not true they're actors yeah the they are the best people and the win awards for acting a hunt and don't think for a second that they don't know how to act in a way that makes you like them think about this how many actors do you think are great people and then how many of those same people do know personally I bet you you think a lot of them are great and I bet you don't none of them in person it's like a good examples Tom Hanks seems like a [ __ ] great guy I don't know the guy in person but he's extremely likable in the way he's acting and that's what they do really well so here's some great examples I've built Amy Porterfield Cosby has to be one of the greatest examples because one of the most liked people in the world and yet the dude was a [ __ ] terrible press bum bag predator yeah and so this is what Hollywood is full of a bunch of fake so when they come up and they do their speeches and their talks and they're they don't live in the same world that we do what they're trying to do is sound likable they're trying to sound like well they're pushing agendas oh yeah like like my favorite person to pick on is Leonardo DiCaprio and he's like super I'm super Pro planet and you know whatever yacht private jet massive you know mansions like look at their actions don't listen to the worst and so what's happening is I think Hollywood is losing their power I really and I appreciate that I'm glad because they shouldn't have power to firt in the first thing they should entertain us but they should not have any power because these people they don't know anything aside from being phenomenal at entertaining us right first question is from Miz Adams two to four why is it so hard for people to stick to their health and fitness goals oh alright because their goals yeah it is it's true it disciplines it because its goals and be in how do we get to our goals the way we get to goals is through discipline and willpower there's nothing wrong with those two things but when it comes to health and fitness going off of willpower you will fail at some point because willpower just doesn't last all the time the people who stick to their health and fitness quote unquote goals are people who it's it's it's a part of their lifestyle it's not a goal it's not like I'm gonna lose weight I'm gonna do this and then what do I do when I lose this willpower what do I do when I lose this discipline what do I do when I become weak it's a different relationship with nutrition and exercise I also think it's I think it's the way we set our goals like I think we set such lofty extreme goals and they've I've read an article a long time ago that referenced this with just like success for a period or telling your kids like you could be anything you want to be you know it's there's a lot of there's a lie it is a lot but how long have we heard that and that's been it's been passed long said like it's not true and the same thing to be said about people that set fitness goals they set very unrealistic goals to set off start off and it's like why would you do that when there's so many steps before that that aren't great goals and I think this is something that took years probably a decade of training clients before I really piece this together and that was client comes in and and you know they're you know morbidly obese super over 100 pounds plus overweight and they have this image or they watch The Biggest Loser and so they're like I want to be here and it's this huge goal and I know to your point so that if this is gonna be a lifelong behavior that I can't just push them to that goal I've got to give them the tools and I got to slowly give them like you give them a tool and you practice that tool for a while and you get good at using then you give them another tool you practice with that tool you get good at it and over time you eventually have all these these tools in your tool belt that you can you can use that you're disposable to make this a long-term successful journey for yourself where right now I think when it's the beginning of the year a lot of people overshoot these lofty goals and they end up getting burnout totally yeah you're basically developing these micro habits that build up confidence and in these confidence like once once they feel like they've accomplished like one thing that's something they can build upon and then they find enjoyment in that I think that a lot of times like we need to really find and join you know in in self-improvement and finding like a way to make that happen because then it's like it can become a lifestyle thing it's not gonna become a lifestyle thing but grudgingly right and I think that that's that's a mistake a lot of people make it's like I have to beat myself up to get to a certain place but you know yeah there's struggle across this struggle but you know you finding enjoyment in a portion of that is everything it's all in how you approach it it really is so if you're going into this thinking I want to look this way I have this this fitness goal I want to lose this much weight if and you don't have long-term permanent behaviors already set around fitness and health the odds that you fail are astronomically high astronomical I would say 9 out of 10 of you listening right now if you approach it that way long term you're going to fail instead try approaching it this way save yourself ok I'm going to make permanent lifestyle changes now why does that make a big difference because you're gonna approach it completely different if I walk into a gym for the first time in years or ever and I say to myself I'm gonna make a permanent lifestyle changes I'm gonna start slow I am because out and now I know this is gonna be forever so I'm gonna go to the gym be like well I'm working out 0 days a week and I'm gonna do something that I'm gonna do forever I think I'm gonna start once a week let me start once a week and see what that looks like or I'm gonna change my knee I got to you know get better with my nutrition but I got to do it in a permanent way nutrition by the way is a harder harder one to change them then exercise good nutrition is just it's a part of who we are it's a part of culture it's a part of everything that you pretty much do think you know culture in society surrounds itself and circulates around food so when you think yourself I'm gonna change how I eat that's a massive massive change now add to the sentence I'm gonna change how I eat forever oh boy let's start slow changing anything forever makes you want to start slow so you think okay I'm gonna do this forever first thing I'm gonna do is I think I'm gonna eat a serving of vegetables twice a week because I don't eat any at all right now and I'm gonna do that for a while then when it becomes a part of your permanent life then you add the next change and now if you're listening and you're thinking yourself wow that's just gonna take too long that sounds like I'm motivated right now remember the okay permanence is much better than temporary okay so will it take you longer yeah but you'll keep it there's nothing worse than getting somewhere and getting out of somewhere oh that's it that's a terrible position to be in and it doesn't take as long as you think look I've used this example many many times and I like the way it illustrates what we're talking about if you took two parallel lines and I adjusted one a fraction of a degree to the left that's it just a fraction of a degree looking at it initially doesn't even look like this it looks like they're still parallel follow those lines the further along you the further you follow those lines the further apart they become the more they diverge so this is what ends up happening when you approach this with that particular mentality it starts off slow for sure but trust me over the course of just a year or two you make some fundamental changes that won't go away the irony of this this doesn't change just because you're more advanced or you've been doing this for a long time we just talked earlier in the episode of how we start after coming back from a vacation right you know this is two weeks I did not lift and eat really well two weeks it's probably the longest in a very long time probably since my injury where I actually had two solid weeks off and not eating very well and I'm coming back now to week four a lot of people isn't that long time many people taking months off over the entire holidays and yet I still will come back very very slow so what it'll look like this week is starting off with a fast and then again like I said I'm not gonna go hardcore dieting anything it's just I'm gonna get rid of this stuff I know doesn't belong in my diet and make a conscious effort to make a better balanced meals that and then maybe get in the gym two or three times this week that in itself will already set me up in the right direction and it's not too much to commit and it falls in line with I'm always constantly saying on the show which is I'm always trying to do the least amount possible to elicit the most amount of change and when you haven't been doing anything for several weeks eating wise healthy and or exercise it doesn't take very much for the body to respond and start seeing some change right in in going through this process from a permanence mentality a lifestyle a forever go into and think to yourself can I do the changes I'm gonna do right now can I keep them forever and you got to be honest with yourself okay remember you're you're coming from a motivated standpoint which means that you're not gonna be motivated at other times so ask yourself because right now you might be motivated you might be super motive like a lot of people in January so ask yourselves okay can I do this forever and can I keep this up when I'm not motivate I know I'm motivated right now and I'm excited but am I gonna be able to keep this up when I'm not motivated so you have to be very honest and that may look like a very small change it literally may look like and I started many clients who've achieved lifelong permanent success as long as I've known them that I've started a lot of them with once a week once a week in the gym and I've actually convinced people people have come up come to hire me who have not worked out for ten years or longer or whatever and they've said to me I want to start working out with you three days a week and I've actually convinced them and said actually let's start once a week let's do that for now and we have this big talk like just like I'm doing right now on the podcast and those people accomplished phenomenal things so be very honest with yourself what can you do forever now what does this do for you well over time you will value health and fitness you would truly value it in different ways now what does that mean that means that when you value health and fitness in a real way you do it even when you don't enjoy it okay that's an important thing to understand when you're motivated and having fun nobody has to convince you to exercise and eat right when you're having a good time and you're super motivated you don't need there's no problem nobody needs help when they're motivated when people need the help is when they lose motivation like we all do when they lose the enjoyment factor you know waking up you don't feel like moving you'd rather watch TV you'd rather eat you know junk food you're stressed out or whatever that's the times when the true value comes out so when you build these lifestyle these lifelong habits slowly over time you value it to the point where you know when I go through hard times in my life I don't go to the gym to workout to get stronger and have fun I use it as a way to relieve stress I use it as a way to make myself feel better when I'm stressed out and anxious and I want to you know eat reach for a piece of cake I actually value my health and fitness the point where I know my anxieties actually do better long-term if I eat healthy and so that's when you that's how you accomplish that that so the may the reason why it's so hard for people is they're going in with goals and it's about motivated motivation inspiration that is 100% a road to failure in the long term next question is from dance girl what are the benefits of isometric holds for example a wall sit you know it's funny with isometric type so if you don't know what that means so there's there's three main types of muscle contractions there's the concentric contraction this is what I'm actually lifting something so think of a bicep right meet curling a weight up that's concentric meet lowering the weight that's another form of contraction that's called eccentric and then there's holding something that's isometric and it's funny because or X there's isometric holds go in and add a favor in the in the fitness space both that and eccentric they do I think both those two are overlooked but isometric a law like isometric was valued a law a long time ago wrestlers and you know grapplers and when weight training became a thing initially in the early days of lifting weights yeah isometric was a big was a big thing the Soviets really utilized isometric training quite a bit in fact they have some of the best studies on isometric training I love isometric training because they create little doubt damage for the amount of the amount of results you get from them so it's a great way to add volume to your work now without overtraining your body the strength that you gain from an isometric hold most of its in the in the hold itself but there's a lot of carryover to outside of that well it's also one of the best ways to teach how to get connected to them : we talked about a muscle connection in mind muscle connection people throw that term around a lot you know this is one of the best ways to help somebody to get connected there is you know in a wall sit you know what's cool about a wall sit is you can be in a wall sit and there's there's many muscles that are being contracted but you can sit in it and actually mentally engage the ones that you want to put more emphasis on so I could be in a wall sit and I can make it really quad you know just totally tense up my claws or I can kind of shift it back into my glutes and squeeze and tints my glutes to hold me up and that's what I like about it allows for the time for you to really connect and feel your way through you know the muscles in into the recruitment process so it's like you know can I summon up more of an army you know for this job that I have and that's that's part of it like you can do it from like any angle - which is a great benefit to it so if there's a part of an exercise you feel like you don't have that much support you don't have that much strength yeah good point let's just let's just focus on that for a while let's feel our way through it let's squeeze and see if we can recruit more so we get more powerful in that movement now that's it's a perfect exercise that's a great great point so to use that in an example let's say you're you you like to squat but you notice at the bottom of your squat you tend to lose a little bit of stability your knees wobble a little bit or your your pelvis tilts or you just don't feel as connected a great way that can connect to that portion of the rep it's do an isometric hold in that portion of the rep we did a great YouTube video on this mmm we did it it's a dumpy squat and I know Justin introduced that to us for that exact reason that you're talking about right now so and I think it's one of the most overlooked here's what you got to remember is like we and we tend to do this we do an exercise we do something in sync we want the immediate results like tomorrow why was I not sore enough for oh I didn't see something change it's like that's not what you're doing when you do something like that like if you go squat 200 pounds 10 times and then you go do isometric holds for 10 reps you're gonna feel the squat with 200 pounds on your back weigh more the next day it doesn't necessarily mean though that the the isometric hold couldn't be as beneficial for somebody if you're not getting good recruitment in your glutes and you're trying to focus on that just loading the bar up heavier just gets to the body sore doesn't necessarily mean that you're utilizing the glutes as much as you like to so introducing these types of exercises it's the long-term carryover that you're getting in that which is great because it seems to be a theme of this episode is the you know you're doing something very small and basic but the carryover that it will have long-term for you is gonna be tremendous it's the first place you go when you have a disconnection the first place you go when you can't connect to a muscle well is to try to squeeze it in an isometric position you know what Western athletes understood the benefits of isometrics on accident before other athletes bodybuilders now you asked well how how body builders don't use isometric hold posing they flex that's exactly right and I remember as a kid stumbling upon this on accident cuz when I was a kid and I was lifting weights in the 90s I know magazines talked about isometric holds but they did talk about the benefits of flexing and posing they never used the word isometric but they would say things like Arnold you know when he would go up to as he got closer to competition he would spend an hour a day posing and body able to say that helps bring out definition or whatever you know Jim bro you know science of so I would practice flexing because of course Arnold did it and he's you know the bodybuilding God or whatever and I would notice when I would practice more flexing I feel better in my workouts I would just be able to feel the muscles a little bit more and by the way if you've never posed or flexed your muscles and held them I'm not talking not just a flex and relax try holding a pose like a bodybuilder does on stage and when you're on stage is a bodybuilder and you're holding a front double bicep you have to hold it and look good not just your biceps your flexing everything and it very nice you know an increased the intensity of it and you have to smile while you're doing it you can't look like you're you know because that takes away from the look or whatever and you're holding that [ __ ] for like 30 seconds you know try doing that no joke try 5 minutes of posing where you're holding a flex and remember your whole body is getting looked at so you're not just doing a lat spread or you know a crab pose the hope the whole body is being presented try flexing your whole body in different poses hold your pose for just hold it for 15 seconds just do that do that for 5 minutes and tell me that that's not a freaking amazing workout next question is from Kim and Lexi adventures can you explain why fit people have a lower resting heart rate and why it's important it's a muscle have you made it stronger by exercising it you're just more efficient your body is utilizing the blood that it's pumping more efficiently so you don't in your heart doesn't need to pump as much your heart is also pumping more effectively so more the GoBot you know there's some people that theorized that we are all born with a maximum time that our heart will beat like 100 trillion tau it only has like X amount of Chinese medicine right the other so there's there's two people that theorize that each of us were born with this you are you've got a hundred trillion beats whatever I'm just saying that for a hypothetical reason so I was call it the ticker and by you strengthening your heart that's a muscle you can build it just like you could build the biceps and exercise it and what sound means by efficient it just it takes less pumps to like let's say when you're unhealthy your heart rate takes 60 pumps in a minute to circulate blood to the body well if it's a really strong heart and no longer takes 60 it takes 50 or 40 well 60 would be low to begin with if you're unfit right yeah no those are terrible numbers I'm using but to get the point across is that you know you need you use X amount per minute whatever your start with the more you train it the more efficient it becomes and that really matters over time you know it's less that muscle has to work throughout the entire day you may be and you may think well that's weird you elevate it till when you exercise well yeah you elevate it for an hour it's a stress right that causes an adaptation right that makes it more efficient and makes it stronger and then the rest of the time you're alive you're your body's more efficient with its you to live utilization of blood and the oxygen and nutrients that are in blood so when you're at a shape and you go up a flight of stairs and your heart beating it's because your body ain't utilizing oxygen and blood very well it needs to pump more and more yeah it's crazy I was training like cyclists and a couple marathon runners and to try and stress them out and to try and get their heart rate to exceed you know whatever max output they had previously was really difficult there they were so efficient you know at bringing that level down even once it rose up high came right back down and so that's I mean the more you train it's you know the more effective it that's a very good point right there that's another benefit that you get from training the heart really well is the recovery time yeah right so like walked up going like a person who's decondition right and we'll use better numbers now like you know 75 or 80 beats per minute their their heart beats right right now they go upstairs and 20 it elevates to 120 and then for the next harder to get it down the next 20 minutes it's still above a hundred because oh my god the flight of stairs who tell us a lot and the hearts still pumping the person who's really conditioned well first of all they're already starting at 45 or 50 beats they go up the stairs it only goes up to like 80 and then it recovers right back down within minutes mm-hmm that right there and then when you think about it over you know decades of your lifetime you know you you now have saved so many you know pumps you know your if thing of your heart like you like an engine like it's less miles that you're putting on that heart over time and that's where I met that I know there's some people that theorized that you only get X amount of beats in your entire lifetime one of the best ways to you know get that number to come down overall is by strengthening US sodas and that's mainly a Chinese Chinese medicine that says I know Western medicine I don't know of any studies to support that but Chinese medicine does say that that that specific thing that you just said out of have you guys ever worked with deep divers who don't use like equipment or whatever okay so I've trained a couple divers who that's what they do they do competitions where they don't wear a breath like four minutes yeah they don't abalone divers do this yeah so they don't wear you know oxygen it's just the freakin snorkel and they go and dived the slowest heart rates you've ever measured in your entire life as they're diving and holding their breath the heart rate just do just slows way way down and it's the most efficient thing I've ever seen on a human being I actually had somebody I've trained years ago who competed that way and he was able to get it he was like it's a heart beat got so slow is like a freaking dolphin like it was just it wasn't even it was beating like I remember it was like something ridiculous super low number pretty amazing to be able to do that now what are the benefits of that well [ __ ] man you want to talk about stamina being able to maintain you know a nice moderate level of intensity for long periods of time you know that has its own you know health benefit at state of calm yeah but at the end of the answer this question it's just you're just more efficient it's like you know you're gonna use less energy doing something that you're good at then you will doing something you're not good at and if you're not good at moving your body your body is very inefficient at using enter just gonna use a lot more of it next question is from Rohnert nacho our inner thigh workouts bad for men Justin doesn't over not you I am a big inner thigh guy I do a lot of good girls squeezies ya know of course they're beneficial I mean and that's the thing too like you'll see you'll see how dominant you get over the years of patterns that you've established especially with athletics and to be able to stabilize especially around the knee and ankles like it's it it's essential that your you're gonna you're gonna work the muscles in a way where it keeps everything in track and it keeps everything in good alignment and so to be able to you know train the inner thighs is in conjunction with the outer thighs and everything else to be more balanced is optimum it's so funny to me how body parts and exercises are you know start to get you know categorize this male or female now I know part of the reason why is because when you ask men and women what body parts they want to work on women more likely will say inner thighs and guys more likely will say things like biceps impacts but the fitness space is fed into this and now it's the point where you're a question like this pops upwards yeah okay more women want to do inner thigh workouts but is that bad for men then should I not do it no absolutely I there was a period in my life where I did a lot of you know what you could categorizes inner thigh training when I did when I was doing Brazilian Jujitsu a lot of the submissions in position I mean the guard position for example you need to not not just have good flexibility and mobility in your hips and in your inner thighs but you also need to have a good squeeze yeah yeah and when you get an arm lock especially the guy picks you up or a triangle choke or you know lots of other submissions part of the effectiveness that this of the submission is your ability to squeeze your legs together to trap your opponent so when I was competing I would do things like I definitely did the the you know abduction excuse me adduction machine which is the what Justin referred to as the good girl bad girl machine that's where you put your legs on the sides and you squeeze them but one thing that I did that I found very effective is I would take a medicine ball put it between my legs and just isometric squat all right so I'm gonna make a case so why it can be bad for men and women to do because it's really common that you know people you know their feet pronate or collapse in it's very common that you see knees caving in when I squat you have 30 doing that so if you're doing things like that which is very common for both men and women when they're when they're squatting your the femurs already internally rotating you're already over dominant on the inner thigh and if anything you need to work the outside more than you need to work the inside so that's where it's bad it's not bad because you're a man or a woman if you have a breakdown mechanically in your legs and your feet are flattening or pronating in and your and then that which causes the femur to internally rotate and then you're also doing all these inner thigh exercises because you think you're trying to target an area to make it look a soldering the problem yeah you're exaggerating the problem you're making it worse so there was very few clients that I ever did inner thigh direct work in fact it's more common to do out or you're right it's more common to do outer and or do things that have that stabilized the leg right so I like to do like a step up to a stabilization or a reverse lunge to a stabilization and because you're having to stabilize both the inner and the outer thigh have to kind of help work to stabilize the knee and that's it I think to a lot of lateral movement for me like it was a big one where you know you're your average person that's in the gym isn't even thinking about like adding in exercises that you move laterally in so to be able to stabilize the knee left right you know that all like engages those muscles anyways like like a lateral lunge or like a cossack squad or something like that where I'm you know I'm making sure that it like I'm I can functionally stabilize these forces with my body moving in those type of well this is why I like and this is how I you know we cracked on a stabilization exercise because we went on this kick for a long time but there's value to it and here's a place where I see a lot of value because you take somebody and you have them this this person who comes to me and says hey Adam I want to work my inner thighs but then I also noticed that when they squat their knees are caving in we have this problem with the feet pronating well putting them in like a stabilization exercise I can step up to a balance or a lunge to a balance if your feet are collapsing the knees collapse and you'll fall when you do an exercise where you have to stabilize on one leg so it challenges them that in that area meanwhile also addressing the area they're asking you to work on so you know I much prefer doing something like that that's why I'm not a fan of the good girl bad girl type of machine because of that because most people suffer from you know the flat feet and I would much rather do something where they have to stabilize and balance on one leg which then will not allow them to cheat and allow that knee to collapse in or the foot to flatten or also you would fall over and they have to really think about how their ground yeah the only times I think you should target inner or outer thighs is if you have identified an imbalance so if you've identified a particular imbalance where the knee likes to travel one way or the other or there's a specific sport or something that you're training for where you need extra lateral stability or really need to crush watermelons between your style or yeah you know something like that right then then it kind of makes sense but other than that you know besides correctional exercise purposes or sports specific purposes I ever would program inner or outer thighs specific exercises unless I'm correcting a problem

Perry makes them from Texas and I he's Nell and he does one of the best hand tine jobs I've ever seen and now he's into plastics this is what you call a transparent jig okay or translucent no today is going to be real real bluebird skies and on this channel I don't think I've used a transparent jig before one that you can see through I did use a blue eyes on the Bobby Garland one time on a day similar to this and mopped up on the crappie and I expect to do that today too these jigs right here will catch crappie when the sun's out real hard and heavy no doubt let's uh let's just simply take them to the water and see what we can do yeah I know what amazed you are you all right yeah okay we're here folks and today I'm going to be using it's a sounds super sensitive I am six graphite jig pole I've used it in about two different shoots it's a nine foot two series lied is a feather ball did Walmart for $44 and I'm using a kuma spinning reel loaded with four pound test line and coerced Mr Perry's jig right here and for a fish attracted slabs also it's my favorite attracting okay let's go fish okay well we've got a lot of grass that's bloat in right here on this Bank I've noticed whatever we're gonna put some slabs sauce on here get her juiced up smelling right and we're gonna start vertical jigging these rocks now what I like to do first of all is to test the depth okay okay I'm gonna reel down right here it's about four feet deep right here off these rocks so I'm gonna put my jig about midway of this rod or a little bit more and just start working these rocks real slow I'm gonna hold my jig at about about 45 degrees to start with off the rod tilt and just test and see how these fish want this bait I just had a bluegill buy that I had to jerk anyway all right there's the first fish of the day that simple you got complete control with the jig pole it's a great way to fish from the bank or in the boat he's one he hit that and sun's out translucent jig or transparent small fish let's let him go now I brought my bucket today I don't keep me any fish but I'm wanting some it's a bluegill I'm gonna run it right back through there again anyway ours fish the Goodman's I say eager right there we're out for eaters today that's a good war mouth I'm gonna take him up here and put him in the bucket folks yeah is that not a pretty fish just put him in the bucket we're out to eat him there we go it's a crop that now in Guntersville lake they have to be nine inches long before you can keep them that one ain't 9 inches so we're gonna let him go down the Coosa River likewise and nearly Henry they have to be 10 inches now we go small one crappie though come on in here that one right there I don't believe him make the grade either probably I don't know eight and half inches loans it was too small anyway I don't want to eat them that little right there Leslie don't go back in her border see if there's another one in there got a lot of bluegill pester me in the carp they're pestering me tooth there we go little bluegill like that in the car fish spawning all way down through there and they're making the awfulest racket folks running up and down these rocks and it's really giving me a difficult time catching these crappie but maybe they'll move on and we can catch some I would go there real tight sand rocks come only in here boss sensitive rod I like to go out and handpick my own rods I like what I like don't jump pretty little crappie though ain't big enough I know if we're gonna get any supper or not there's another one I love that Rob when you set the hook you can just hear that line just cut through the waters and it's getting a little bit better how do you eat that jig look here lay down in there hands off a little I'm letting go we'll go he's probably eight inches long but he's fast get back in there that's two I'll at one spot let's see if we can catch another one yeah we're good huh come on in here a little fine you he had to have that clear jig now let's let him go I'm proud to see that we got a great that just an indication of a good crappie population when you see all them little ones like that I have a go now that one's a little bit better yep come on in here that's close to us but I don't think I'm gonna catch enough today to eat all the times let's let him go you know back in our little feller where we go uh-huh pretty good they're all good to me really little all the way up down this rail trap is just little ones and a bunch of them I don't guess I'm gonna be able to take no crappie home today let me get him off just gentle as I can there he is unharmed if I ain't gonna eat them I'm gonna put them back just as gentle as I can that be that crappie Abby next year he'll be about a pound okay they grow that quick if they live four years in the south from what I've read and researched they're doing good they have a short lifespan northern crappie live a little longer there's another one I mean I'm on them

they managed to consume a bottle of water in litchi at one second I've seen videos of this from youtubers in the past for example faze banks he used to do it a lot in the phase guys videos and they always wondered how do people actually do that it's honestly really impressive and if any of you guys know how you actually do it please tell me in the comments below and one of the clips this guy actually does show you how to do it but you didn't really describe it very well it's still awesome seeing someone actually might have to do this there are multiple clips of people actually doing this you guys can tell us in the comments which one you found the best we actually do a post notification shutter at the end of every single video so if you guys want a post notification shout out where you guys have to do is subscribe to our channel click the little bell next to the subscription button which enables notifications and comments something nice related to the video make sure to leave a like if you did enjoy both that being said let's get right into the clips this is marvelous you tomorrow so how much had to do had a how to check water bottle in one second um I did this many times is full just showing off you know and I did it I can do it I really can do in one second I can do and probably about thirty four seconds so what you do is I like warm water cold water hurts really bad it's not like you don't have to have a really warm but at least pretty pretty warm so what you do is follow on how final about the path like this at all and then you take a deep breath through this I think that I don't one of myself for the camera at what she do is do this now is like hold my finger in my hand like this hold your hand underneath it like that and like this and then take a deep breath when you breathe out that's when you start reading so and then you squeeze and then what you do is actually take deep breaths and put it up your mouth and you squeeze the bottom and you start chugging specif you alright so that's how I tell you had to know I'm but actually do alright ready then oh my gosh i XE really her guards but that's how you do it and um what time I try to do it before at like a as a deer camp thing when I was hunting and the water was bigger than original was play about I know I don't know why I ALS's that is but you see it's empty actually had just a little bit in the bottom [Music] close enough video I'm tired drink the water bottle in one second challenge and imma see if I can try it and I must see if I can do it or not but um but I'm gonna get right into the video right now so I'm just gonna open this bottle and see if I can drink it in one second I don't know it's gonna take me more than a video peace out hey guys today I will be doing I should drink a water bottle no one's taking challenge with this whole bottle of water let's get it let's get [Music] well that one totally awkward I'll try out this half bottle [Music] still can't do it one more [ __ ] Johnny [Music] [Music]", "aMiaz2IYhN0": "[Music] [Applause] [Music]", "EUZWE8EZ0IU": "[MUSIC PLAYING] Hey there, Polycasters. It's Rob here. Today on the show I want\nto talk about performance. As web developers, one of\nthe things that we often do when we're about to\ndeploy a site to production is we take all of our\nscripts, all of our styles, and we concatenate them\ntogether to cut down on costly HTTP requests. Now, if you're working with\nsomething like Polymer and Web Components, it's important to\nremember to also concatenate your definitions for\nWeb Components as well, because those count\nas HTTP requests, too. So today, what I want to\nshow you is a tool that we've created called\nVulcanize, which you can use to cut down\non those HTTP requests and make sure your Polymer apps\nare as performant as possible. Now, before I get\ninto any of that, I first want to show\nyou kind of the impact that Vulcanize can\nhave on your app. So what I've got here\nis over in the terminal, I'm just going to run\nPolymer Starter Kit. I'm going to use its development\nserver that comes with it. So I'm going to run gulp\nserve to boot this up. And I haven't done anything\nto this project yet. It's just a fresh checkout\nof Polymer Starter Kit. So we see that sort\nof starting page. And when we open\nthe Dev Tools-- so if we go to the Network panel\nand we refresh to load up our app, we can go\ndown to the corner there and see that this\napplication is currently making 65 HTTP requests for\nthat one simple page, which is quite a lot. Now, if you look kind of\nup at the top of this, you'll notice that it\nlists these files here, like iron-fit-behavior.html\nand polymer-micro.html. Those are all of our Web\nComponent definitions being fetched individually. So let's see if we\ncan cut down on this using a tool like Vulcanize. So this is the same example\nagain, but this time, I'm going to run\ngulp serve:dist. This is our distribution server. It's going to run\nVulcanize for us. It's going to take\nall of those imports and concatenate them together. And now when I go to the Network\npanel and check things out, you'll notice that we've\ngone from 65 requests down to just 14 requests\nfor this application. So that is a huge,\nhuge difference. You can imagine, if you\nwere building a massive app with hundreds of\nelements inside of it, you would definitely want\nthat sort of performance boost that Vulcanize\nwould give you. So how do we do this? Well, there's two\nways to run Vulcanize. You can either run it\nfrom the command line, or you can integrate\nit in your build process using a tool like Gulp. So I'll start off by showing\nyou the command-line version, and then we'll switch\nover to using Gulp. To start off with\nthe command line, you just want to\nrun npm install -g to do a global\ninstall of Vulcanize. So we'll pull down Vulcanize. And this is going to\nmake the Vulcanize binary available to us from\nthe command line. So we could just type\nvulcanize whenever we want. It'll process the file for us. [HUMMING] OK. So we've got Vulcanize\ninstalled now. What I've done is I've set up\na very simple project here. You can see I've got an\nindex file with a single HTML import in there that's\npulling in elements.html. Inside that file, I've got\na few more HTML imports, where I'm loading in these\ntwo elements, x-foo and x-bar. And looking at\ntheir definitions, these are just really vanilla,\nkind of boilerplate Polymer elements. But they're going to\nhelp us demonstrate how we're going to bundle\nall of this stuff together. So what I want to do is\ntake that elements.html file and just sort of crunch it down\nas small as I possibly can. Over at my terminal, I'm going\nto run the vulcanize command. And I'm going to point it at\napp/elements/elements.html. And when I run this just\nfrom the command line, it's actually going to\nwalk that tree of imports, take all those files,\nconcatenate them together, and just return the\noutput to standard out. So that's kind of useful\nif we were going to, like, pipe this to some other command. But what I'd really like\nto do is write this out to a file in my Dist directory. So to do that, I'll\nrun Vulcanize again. First I'll make a\ndirectory, actually, to hold my distribution. Then I'll run Vulcanize. And I'm going to vulcanize\nthat elements.html file. And then I'll just use\nthe little arrow symbol to write the output to a\nfile in my Dist directory, which I'll just call\nelements.html as well. Now, if you don't want to use\nthe arrow key or whatever, if you want to use the options\nlike command-line flags and things like that, you could\nalso just use the -0 option. It basically does\nthe exact same thing. And so we'll write out to this\nfile, elements.vulcanize.html. Now, there's a lot\nmore options that we can pass beyond just output. We could also tell\nVulcanize that we want it to inline any external\nscripts that our elements depend on, or pull in any of\ntheir external style sheets, or strip out all\nof their comments. All of these are available\nas command-line flags, so you can really customize\nthe bundle that you're building with Vulcanize. And honestly, I would recommend\nusing all three of these flags just because it's going to\ncrunch that file down as small as it possibly can be. So now that I've run that,\nI can go back to my editor, and I can look in\nthe Dist directory. If we check out that\nelements.html file, you'll see that now it's\na bunch of stuff chucked inside of here. We've got Polymer all up at the\ntop, all the JavaScript for it, and any HTML that\nit depends upon. If we keep scrolling, we go\nall the way down to the bottom, we'll actually see x-foo\nand x-bar, those elements from our little sample project. They're crunched\ninto this as well. All their HTML, all\ntheir JavaScript is here. So this application, which maybe\nwas making before four or five HTTP requests to boot\nup, should now only be making one HTTP request\nfor this single file. This is a really\ngreat start, but it's kind of a bummer to have to run\nthis command from the command line every single\ntime you want to build and mess around with\nyour application. It'd be nicer to integrate\nit as part of a build step using a tool like Gulp. So to do that, I'm going to\ngo back to my command line, and I'm just going\nto run npm install. I'm going to save it\nto my dev dependencies. And I'm going to pull down\ngulp and gulp-vulcanize. And since this is\nnpm, now we wait. [CLOCK TICKING] [CLOCK TICKING] [SNORING] [CUCKOO CLOCK CHIMES] Now we've got those\ndependencies installed, we can go set up a Gulp file. So I'm going to go\nahead and require Gulp. I'm going to require\nGulp Vulcanize. And I'm just going to write\nout a really simple Gulp task for our Vulcanize process. We'll tell it to pull\nin elements.html. We'll pipe that to Vulcanize. And then we'll pipe that\nto our Dist directory. I'm also going to write\na default task, which is going to run Vulcanize for us. And this is starting to shape up\nto be a pretty nice boilerplate for, like, a little\nPolymer project that we could launch\ninto production. If I go to my\nterminal, I run Gulp. It's going to go\nout, it's going to do that build process for me,\nright, which is pretty cool. And there's a little bit\nmore that I can do here. I showed you those\ncommand-line flags before for inlining scripts\nand stripping comments. We can add that to our\nVulcanize task as well. We just pass it an Options\nobject with those same options. But this time,\nthey're camel-cased. And I'm also going to\nadd a Copy task here, so I can copy over my Index file\nand my Web Components polyfills to my Dist directory. And now when I run\nGulp, I basically set up everything I need for\na production Polymer site. I can run a little server\nfrom that Dist directory. You can see here are\nmy elements showing up. I've also got my Web\nComponents polyfills loaded. So if you want, you\ncan even use that Gulp file as a starting point\nthe next time you want to mess around with Polymer. The main thing to\ntake away from this, though, is if you're launching\nPolymer in production, you should always,\nalways, always make sure that you run Vulcanize\nbefore you do so. It's going to\ndramatically improve the performance of\nyour application by cutting down HTTP request. And ultimately,\nit's just something that everyone should be\ndoing in their Polymer app. Now, I want to cover\ntools like Vulcanize and a few of its friends\nin some future episodes.

[MUSIC PLAYING]", "rm7iPdkf3YU": "today we're gonna be finding about about volume used in the metric system so we're gonna start with our basic units basic unit is a leader and obviously most people in class are probably heard of a two liter coke bottle a leader is just a little bit more than a quart oil sold by the Corps that's why I got a little bit more oil out here because you would need just a little more to add to this to get to a leader Powerade bottles or so they're just about leader sized water bottles often times are one liter the other union measure that they use is if you're measuring something small it's a milliliter which is one one thousandth of a liter if you got a flu shot it's probably measured in milliliters if you have a pin cap it holds somewhere between one and two milliliters so here we go through our units again Killough is the big one 1000 probably remember that from computers that a kilobyte is a thousand bytes Sinta hundred cents and a dollar so sent as 1/100 of something milli very small one 1000th breviary for leaders nice and simple it's an L oftentimes you'll see it as the cursive L because this kind of L also looks like a 1 breviary for milliliters well from the other things we've used Bentley has always been an M and leaders was just L so we put them together and you get ml a goldfish bowl with a carnival holds one of these and all the way through here I'm just gonna give you a couple seconds and I'm gonna go on the right answer so the goldfish bowl with the carnival holds one liter only one that makes sense because it's either like the liter bottle or it's one of the pin caps you're not gonna get a very big goldfish in there and he sure can't get the ping-pong ball in there bathroom sink it's gonna hold eight of these again eight pin caps doesn't make sense so it must be eight liters pitcher of kool-aid holds two of these go with the pin cap thing again two pin caps is not enough so it must be leaders a swimming pool and you can see it's a little kid swimming pool 250 mililiters sounds like a lot that's still not a full leader because there's a thousand milliliters in a leader so that would only be one for 250 milliliters would be 1/4 of a liter bottle 1/8 of a 2 liter coke bottle not a very big swimming pool so it must be 250 liters your softer and cane if you check on the side it probably says 355 milliliters bottle of mouthwash holds 500 of these well 500 liters would be a huge amount because most people don't even have a mouthwash bottle that's more than 2 liters like a coke bottle so it must be milliliters how much orange juice to put the carton contained again to pin caps not close to enough 2 liters cereal bowl holds 444 of these it's not your cereal bowls not over a 2 liter coke bottle so it must be milliliters milk pouch is what we used to have at school because they thought plastic would be better for the environment but then they decided it was worse so we're back to cardboard ones now it holds about 240 milliliters because it's way less than a 2 liter bottle cane of super more or less than a 2 liter bottle less so it must be 400 milliliters bleach jug more or less than a 2 liter bottle it's a little more so it's gonna be 3 liters squeeze bottle of mustard more or less than a 2 liter bottle way less steak sauce a 1 220 again less than a 2 liter bottle so we're going milliliters trashcan looks like it's big enough for Oscar the Grouch to live in I said bigger than a 2 liter bottle yeah so it's gonna be a hundred litres baseball team's cooler it's gonna hold 30 of these it's 30 milliliters that's only 30 pin caps the first person is not even gonna get a good drink so it must be leaders and aquariums gonna hold 40 and if you can have some fish in it better be leaders the bathtub this guy's trying to cover his face so you can't tell who he real is 200 litres Dairy Queen blizzard is it more or less than a 2-liter bottle less so it's gonna be milliliters the big gulp more or less than 2 liters you get the big gulp it's almost about the same because two milliliters would just be to pen caps so it's closest to two liters how much water should you drink a day to pin caps or a 2 litre bottle two litres single serving of pudding 190 milliliters shampoo bottle holds 600 of these is it more or less than a 2 liter bottle less jelly jar only holds one of these one milliliter again would only be one pin cap that's less than a spoonful so you wouldn't get very much jelly so it must be leaders the picnic cooler holds about 40 of these I think you can see 41 liter bottles get thrown in there a lot faster than you can see 40 of the pin caps the large milkshake from Steak and Shake 1,200 is it more or less than a 2-liter bottle less so we're going milliliters teaspoon holds four of these obviously way less than a two-liter bottle so it must be milliliters all right now we get a little more interesting how many milliliters is the French dressing well there's a thousand milliliters in a liter bottle so 4700 would be twice as big as a two liter so we're down to 47 and 470 is it about half of a one liter bottle yeah so 470 the jar of Miracle Whip is it close to being the same size as a leader pretty close and a thousand milliliters would have been a leader so 900 milliliters get you close a gallon of milk is how many leaders 40 44 40 and 400 well we got one a milk is bigger than a two-liter bottle back it's about the same size as two of the 2-liter which would give me death for leaders an IceCube is how many milliliters well if we put two of the pin caps together ice cubes are usually bigger than that and 200 is quite a big chunk so 20 seems like the right answer how many litres is a bottle of tide 330 300 well how much bigger than a two-liter bottle is it it's that 15 times bigger is it 150 times bigger or is it like one and a half times bigger just a little bit bigger so we're gonna go three we kind of already did this one the cane of soft drink if you remember 355 milliliters the bottle of Sunny D look at it it looks like it's very close to a two-liter bottle right and two liters would be two thousand milliliters so which one makes sense 1900 bottle of shampoo is it about half the size of a one liter bottle yeah which would be 500 milliliters so my best answer is 444 bag of microwave popcorn is how many leaders only answer that makes sense is to in your bathtub how many leaders could you put it in well two would just be one coke bottle 20 would be 10 coke bottles I see that boat is floating up very very high we're trying to fill the entire bathtub so we probably need 200 of the leaders Oscars back again how many leaders does this trashcan 10 110 or 1110 only and so that makes sense is 110 bottle of orange juice we got some Minute Maid do you think it's close to the same size as a two-liter bottle probably close which would be 2,000 milliliters so we're going 1,700 a pipe and regular size not the mini pot pie pie pants how many milliliters would it hold 5 pin caps 50 pin caps 500 pin caps or you can think if I took a one liter bottle am i cutting it in half would that be about right yes so 500 milliliters you got a bottle of Dawn dishwashing soap how many milliliters is it is it close to a one a one liter bottle yeah so 740 and last question we got a cup of coffee how many milliliters does it hold well if it's 2400 that's over a two-liter bottle so we know it's not that 124 would just be 24 of the pin caps 240 is about 1/4 of a liter bottle which seems like it would make sense so hopefully today you learned a little bit about leaders and milliliters when we're measuring volumes in the metric system", "QHVJvqC4LVE": "[Music] come one way gentlemen and welcome to beverage Chuck's have you ever experienced brushing your teeth and then have them open our orange juice right out there and the orange juice doesn't taste you know the way it should well I feel my subs wanted

that's how folks chug in the world one bottle at a time that hey it's Chuck this is bad", "ygWoFEU5QeU": "sup guys Wednesday and it's a hump day on what is we call I don't know late late summer appetizer there we go we had the little polenta's with the little baby crab salad ish kind of thing on top yeah we got to do those by the way that they were so good by the way the little hum EG tlin oh why you putting me on the spot no no wait cuz I'm gonna be I'm gonna it's gonna be a point it's the point is not about you I need humming gee I think I had four ok I had about three or four Maxwell my job zero that's my that's my point the kids like he look at him I don't like he's later dude he's like a hundred pounds soaking wet I don't love crab geez or you don't have a shrimp you okay with true i do like shen it's not my favorite but i like ever how do you feel about wings oh I love wings like wings your liking when they're wrong gross no oh yeah I don't like the one they're like that either but this is I promise three ingredients your wife cannot touch raw chicken no she can't touch public looking smell saw the chicken that I made I made that oh that light is really yeah I made the Huli Huli chicken the other day she saw the chicken when it was sitting raw she almost almost didn't eat the chicken that night oh these lights are really bright yeah I just an intern that one down a little bit ok John tune yeah that's gross Syria that's better okay so I said three ingredients and I'm gonna up it to four sorry kill me shoot me for that so here's what they are wait are we making huli huli no or basically no I'm just saying I made whoo-hoo okay so here's my ingredients are there the soy sauce they're brown sugar and I'm gonna put a little sesame oil wow so ish but simple so let's do this let's put in I want equal parts of of brown sugar and soy sauce so this is about a cup it's too Jewish man handfuls to choose man it was like one full Jewish man handful and then what you really you gotta pray the Jewish card there dude Canadian man whatever ah soy equal yes and now little sesame that's that much like a seafood teaspoon yeah that was a small enough oh those remember you can go overboard oh okay like if a recipe calls for like a teaspoon of sesame oil and you accidentally put in a teaspoon and a half you could f the whole thing up I'm not kidding you could f the whole thing up it is that strong it's delicious but it's that strong so here's our goal we mix this great smell coming out of this by the way hashtag by the way and now here we go just like that I'm so easy no I wanted to make them it to make a little bit extra so I'll do that in a second but right now my goal is merely this get these guys all covered in this right and you know you buy a bag of chicken wings but is that a wing what is that it's it's that waiting lega schweer know that's a wingman it's not a wing is that a wing I don't know I don't do this shapes of these things kind of freaked me out drum it's shaking those bears so now look at here's the deal how much time do you have not a lot you have an hour based on the front I mean marinate and let them sit for an hour you have three hours dude go three hours the more you leave them the more time they're going to have to soak all this deliciousness in and as long as their refrigerated they're not going to write so I would do this you do this in the morning and you go off to work and then you can come home and you're going to be great so now the way there's different ways to cook these I would argue that doing them on the grill would be great but there's a lot of sweet involved here and I think you might find oh sorry there you go I think you might find that the sweet burns quickly oh yeah we talked about rules we've talked about this as being one of our rules and one of the rules is when you're grilling and there's going to be some kind of sweet sauce involved do that not until the last five minutes you know that right master chef it's a good rule yeah yeah the simple rules look we've been shooting a ton of stuff for bed bath and beyond and we've been doing these cooking school things I think the information is really really useful mm-hmm there are little tiny rules that can really make a difference to your food all right and if wait sorry if speaking of the veloute chicken if this recipe interest you go check out our kauai episodes where we did the Holy whole chicken yeah so awkward episodes are great quiet pisode agree okay so um I don't really know what to do here let me take a sip and think about this yeah it's cocktail hour the big gulp sir yes thank you I'm gonna show you what you can do with almost no marination time which is all these have had I'm going to put these guys face up so that's going to be like skin side up if you can sort of find that side of it they're going to go into the oven but they're not going into the oven to bake they're going to go into the oven on broil and that is what I think is going to help make them really great there's times when broiling is the thing to do and for me this is one of them by the way this recipe could easily be made with completely frozen wings I mean you can take wings and put them on a baking sheet and throw them in the oven under the broiler and they will cook nicely and they'll cook through and they'll cook through yeah sting we're gonna cook us we're going to cook some steaks coming up on the live cast absol one hundred percent frozen mmm outside on the grill or here in a pan whatever I don't but it's gonna be I don't believe I think you're gonna be surprised I think you're going to be surprised at how it works frozen is a new thought frozen is the new thought what we were just talking about Lin we're just talking about doing short ribs on the grill and the thing about short rooms is generally you think that they need like a long braising time right raising right now cooking them slowly in liquid to help them really tenderize Lin what's up the Chinese wrote BBQ pork that I've been doing lately oh yeah I use pork shoulder uh-huh and how additional ease pork shoulder cooked braised right it's braised low and slow right yeah because you wanted to fall apart takes a lot of time do that stuff so what i do is i marinate it for 24 hours in the the chinese BBQ pork sauce hmm and then i do it in the oven and it takes about a half an hour the pieces are like this thick that's it that's it interesting there's no braising time and I'm telling you it's juicy and delicious tender amazing tender that's awesome okay so here's what we're gonna do these are going in the broiler and I can show you that right now so you know this and if you don't know about broiling you can go to hesitate or get max the bed bath one a roiling I don't think it has but burling is top-down heat so I don't know how close yeah they help on one percent let's try this out and this is how we lose a camera alrighty there we go already yeah yep okay are we gonna put on the top rack we're gonna go to top rock you so you see this is it helped with the light arm oh no yeah yeah okay so you see the bra broiling is this top-down heat and you'll either have elements like this or there's flame their flame is old school is very cool but it's not what we're doing it's not what my oven has so right this goes in well she'll smoke already hit yeah because of the sauce is on the side and it okay and that's it huh so here's what we do these are going to go and they're going to be maybe 10 minutes aside i want to make i'm going to take that sauce that's up there now i'm going to put it in the little pot ain't gonna bring it to a boil and kill off any of the chicken badness that might be there nice get it to 165 degrees it'll be fine I'm going to use it to baste with this we're going to come back in a minute I'm going to flip these little guys over because it would be 10 minutes over you and then we'll see what they do on the second slide will base a little bit it can be amazing when we have I'm so excited mazing you're excited I'm excited are you excited yeah okay good nobody go away come right back it's gonna be magic only this this many ingredients is not that many yeah if you've watched this show for any amount of time you know that perch sponsors us the perch calm on the internet kitchen bath out door amazing look it's this simple you walk into one of their stores you oh I need a sink you walk into one other stores you're like oh my god I've never seen anything like this before you think I'm making this stuff up because response to the show oh no I'm not making it up it is the way it happens you'll be blown away go to the perch comm check them out on facebook you'll love them like we'd love them it's an amazing store amazing story rolling like a river we don't know what lens saying you just making up yeah now we're all tired and hungry okay so here we are check this out real bad real hot I'm should have used a glove and I didn't oh wow so look what I got right and here's this is this is the the the the bad side I don't mean the bad side but I mean see their little burn stuff all good all good this is the skin side that was up there first right so no this uh here's what happened I mean I said I was going to come back and show you let me just talk you through what I did when it was finished on the one side I took it out I had boy hold the marinade I took the pieces I dipped it in the marinade and then I put them back on like the other side up right does that make sense I explained what we did there man yes sir okay and i boiled the marinade because chicken was in it and and who wants chicken who wants marinade that has had chicken in it that hasn't been cut what's the word been disinfected yes this one really could be good so here's the here's the deal this was the marinade that the chicken was sitting in I put in this little pot I put on the stove and I brought it to a boil boiling liquid happens at 212 degrees I really only needed to get this past 165 degrees because the chicken juice that was in this make this fine so bring it to a boil it'll reduce a little bit it'll kill any of the bacteria you'll be fine to then use it as a marinade again ah right there you go now here's what we're gonna do it now we're gonna get this bowl we're gonna put all of our chicken in it all of our chicken all of our chicken all our shoes and glasses all our shoes and glasses anybody note that move that's from no clue max Cherokee boys Jerky Boys you used to do you know the church is over young and we loved it nope you don't know the Jerky Boys the jerky boys are comedians it prank caller prank callers and they're just ridiculously funny ridiculously funny anyway go listen to them I think you'll like them so here's what we're going to do we're going to take all these guys and just build them up in here try and put their best foot forward you know what that means the prettiest side out right the best wing for it we put your best wing forward that's funny huh just goes in here well these aren't chicken feet clearly they're not chicken feet which I by the way I do like chicken feet I love them dim sum amazing flavor a lot of people have a hard time getting their head around them okay so look it that looks really nice right did it we're gonna do the classic look sam the cooking guy thing which is this green honey I know don't get pissed because Rimmel test I love green onion hooda the way you said it was a little bit mean oh gosh a little bit me so what green onion like this what late summer so we're talking about here right it's very late summer we don't know why as late as it gets mmm it's only late summer in the time not necessarily late summer in oops that's okay look how beautiful that is there you go look at that Shh why didn't I what did you just do then I just pooped why'd you do that what the poop of approval oh boo boo-hoo prove all take it so I should eat one I kind of hate to take it out because now I got a little bit of a hole here but I can fix that for linds picture still a little Stevie look how like glassy and glazed these little guys are how beautiful that is if you don't like green onions don't put them on if you don't like sesame seeds don't put them on but let me ask you a question what the hell are you going to put on put on here because here's this side which has got nothing on it and it's plain right and then there's that slide with a little bit of seeds a little bit of green I didn't come on make it look pretty you could use a little cilantro I don't think it would eat as well because I think it would be sticking whatever i'm having a bite perfectly cooked hmm still moist hey quiet all you use the dogs are going Wow okay good mm-hmm oh my god it's so hard and they're so good brown sugar soy sauce sesame oil chicken wings dime in the oven was is probably 67

Lynn thank you in the back thank you yeah all right everybody will see you friday for something late summer appetizer ish see you", "JZLmCtNRRZY": "hey good afternoon YouTube Joshua here with salty scales comm today's topic of discussion is how to modify your plastic lures to improve them increase your strike ratios and show them a little more flash come along I'll show you what I'm talking about alright so how do you enhance your bait to make you stand out from 98% of the other anglers on the water well I do it with spikey garlic dipping glow now this is in chartreuse colors they have other colors but this particular color stands out because it's super effective now you may be wondering why well as with most lures and things that go into the water as it hits the water light refracts totally differently and as it goes deeper and deeper colors tend to change now this is also the case with chartreuse all those this looks like a foreign color what you may think is a foreign color to a fish it really is not because as your lure starts to dive deeper and deeper into the water it starts to change colors and chartreuse happens to change to a very very light green or almost even some would say a white depending on how deep the lure goes and that is one of the reasons it's very effective now this stuff I chose because first off it's very very quick anyone can do it and it also has this garlic scent now it's been proven over the last 20 years that garlic is very very effective fish attractant you know it's one of those senses that they use smell vision are the two primary ways and of course the vibration off of their lateral line so adding this chartreuse is really really effective just because I think it makes it look more like a natural bait fish moving through the water column and now obviously that's my thought I've done some research on it and I found that anything I asked our tours to always seems to work a little bit better so let me show you how to use this stuff all right side of the TV boxes I had some of these deep creek lures showed it to you guys a little while ago figure these would be great for the presentation purposes these are these little gobies nice and oily so how I use this spike it garlic dipping glow let's go ahead just remove the lid and it's as simple as those guys you take your lure I like to usually dip the tail pull it out and give that about 30 seconds to one minute to go ahead and dry now just the flash on that this tail obviously is going to be moving and vibrating in the water now you add that additional flash and it's gonna be that much more enticing especially and for this instance trout they're gonna destroy this because trout love absolutely love chartreuse alright guys so you can see here that you can use a multitude of different soft plastic baits and this garlic dip and glow is going in here or that color to all different types of plastic here's a grub it's a big bite bait by saltwater baits and you can see how that just quickly and easily adhered to that plastic and it really gave it an extra spike a flash so to speak spike a flash spike a flavor alright ladies gentlemen that's a wrap I hope you enjoyed today's quick tip if you did please give a thumbs up comment below and subscribe we have much more to come until next time guys I'll see you on the water", "MwlNjTUIHUA": "hi this is julie with the palmer alaska public library welcome to healthbeat today's topic is sugar or should i say too much sugar and we're not talking about the natural sugars like in fruits but the added types like in processed foods are you consuming too much sugar what negative health effects does having too much sugar added in our diets do to our bodies and what are some of the day-to-day ways we can lower how much sugar we are eating if you are like most americans and me you could be eating more sugar than you need according to the mayo clinic only 200 calories or 10 percent of a daily intake of 2000 calories should come from added sugars that's roughly 12 teaspoons or 48 grams of sugar the american heart association advises an even stricter limit for added sugars no added sugars for children younger than age two no more than a hundred calories from added sugar a day for children older than age two and most women and no more than 150 calories from added sugar a day for most men according to the fda the food and drug administration the average american consumes 22 teaspoons of sugar or 355 calories of added sugars each day and here's an interesting group of facts from the new hampshire department of health and human services 200 years ago the average american ate two pounds of sugar in a year in 1970 we ate 123 pounds and today the average american eats 152 pounds of sugar a year this is equal to three pounds or six cups of sugar a week so if you are trying to keep your daily calories from sugar limited to around 200 calories a day or monitoring roughly how many grams of sugar you are consuming a day what are some examples of some things we eat that might really add up for example two chips ahoy chewy cookies 170 calories from sugar 32 ounce cola big gulp 364 calories from sugar 8 ounces of nestle chocolate milk 116 calories from sugar one slice of various types of bread can have up to six grams of sugar and one tablespoon of ketchup four grams of sugar and one can of soda like the ginger ale i had last night can have 40 grams of sugar almost the whole daily recommended dose just in one can the point of looking at these few food items is to see just how quickly and with relatively little amounts of food or drink we can meet and then exceed the amount of sugar recommended for the day along with cakes cookies and other sweets sugar is added to processed foods like crackers ketchup bread soups cereals peanut butter cured meats and salad dressings sugar can come in different forms and have different names all supplying no nutritional benefits and when you look at nutrition labels sugar may not be listed as just plain sugar but it can sneak into your foods under other names some of these are dextrose maltose corn sweetener corn syrup sorghum syrup fruit juice concentrate high fructose corn syrup cane sugar evaporated cane juice and malt syrup or rice syrup no matter what it is called sugar is sugar and it can have negative negative effects on our bodies according to the mayo clinic the following health problems could be related to eating too much sugar in the diet poor nutrition if you choose sugar heavy foods instead of other more nutritious foods you miss out on important nutrients minerals and vitamins these foods add lots of extra sugar and calories and no other nutritional value weight gain adding sugar to foods and beverages makes them more calorie dense it's easy to consume extra calories when eating foods that are sugar sweetened and not only can these added sugar calories cause us to gain weight removing these pounds can take some real time for example for a 150 to 60 pound person who walks at a brisk three to four mile pace it takes 25 minutes to walk off two tablespoons 111 calories of maple syrup and an hour to walk off a cup 270 calories of vanilla ice cream and 75 minutes to walk off one slice 340 calories of apple pie the next is increased triglycerides triglycerides are a type of fat in the bloodstream and fat tissue eating an excessive amount of added sugar can increase triglyceride levels which may increase your risk of heart disease and tooth decay sugar promotes tooth decay by allowing bacteria to multiply and grow the more often and longer you snack on foods and beverages with either natural sugar or added sugar the more likely you are to develop cavities especially if you don't practice good oral hygiene so how can you reduce sugar in your diet drink water other calorie free drinks or low-fat milk instead of sugary sodas and sporks sports drinks this goes for coffee too when you drink fruit juice make sure it's a hundred percent fruit juice not juice drinks that have added sugars better yet eat the actual fruit like an apple or an orange rather than drinking the juice so that you get the fiber as well choose breakfast cereals with less sugar skip sugary and frosted cereals add fresh fruit to the top of your oatmeal or cereal instead of sugar cut the amount of sugar you use in recipes for cakes and cookies or switch out sugar completely by using unsweetened applesauce opt for reduced sugar versions of syrups jams and jellies choose fresh fruit for dessert instead of cakes cookies pies ice cream and other sweets buy canned fruit in water or juice not syrup if you do purchase fruit packed in syrup drain and rinse it with water to remove excess syrup be mindful of condiments like ketchup and barbecue sauce which can be high in sugar try salsa mustard or hot sauce instead and last take a little extra time to read food labels to see how sugar is being added i hope this video was useful in helping you think about where added sugar could be coming from in your diet and to also help you find more healthy ways to enjoy a real sweet treat

so since I was doing a best search baits you know I thought you know what let's do a top five colors that I like to use and top five colors that it works extremely well for me so far this year we're in the end of July right now and I just wanted to go through the top five colors that have worked best for me and at the end of the video I want you to comment below if you agree with me on the top five colors first of all if not what colors worked this for you this year because I like trying new baits I like hearing from you and I like trying new stuff so let's just start it off number one I think hands down I don't think anybody's gonna disagree with me on this number one number one color chartreuse varying forms of chartreuse both the single color chartreuse and two toned in the tube the black and chartreuse something something that's been a go-to bait and also a black and chartreuse swim bait style chartreuse has been one of the main colors I've used all spring you saw it in the bed fishing video multiple bed fishing videos I did some really great underwater footage showing these crappie coming up and hitting actually was this exact one well not this exact one but this style is black and chartreuse set ring the reason I was using a black and chartreuse for most of the spring instead of a solid color was because the black and chartreuse kind of covers covers the full end of the spectrum right so if the water is clearer these lighter colors like chartreuse will show up better but if this water is a little dingy little murky stained these darker colors will actually show a better outline of the bait so by using both of them a dark and a light color like this black and chartreuse they're covering the whole range the whole palette that you possibly could make whip it worked really well during the springtime I throw it underneath the bobber throw this right on top of the crappie bed and the bobber went down pretty much every time as you saw in the videos another reason to use the black and chartreuse or a dark and a light is in very low light condition so early early in the morning or right at dusk the crappie will might be transitioning from if it especially if it's a clear lake transitioning from seeing these lighter colored baits like the chartreuse to wanting to be able to see the actual profile debate so you need a dark color like black it's another reason why I used those black and chartreuse but chartreuse by far chartreuse and anything anything red blues pinks chartreuse worked great overall so that's my number one pick number one color for catching crappie now color number two I've used it quite a bit but not as much as the pure chartreuse now this is a pink in structures but the second color is pink now I know I'm probably gonna get some debate that pink is number one color that a lot of guys use pink in chart roost combo especially on clear water it's deadly it really is the other time you use this as sunny skies and when it's really calm water so even if the waters a little stained if it's really calm in sunny skies a brighter color combo like this a two-toned pink and chartreuse probably the second go to bait that I use for crappie but this is a hackle jig right here pink and chartreuse this is something that I actually used quite a bit for smallmouth fishing this spring when you smallmouth when I'm dead now pink in church ruse and black and charters these hackle jigs and also Maru jigs a couple more hand tied marble jigs I used for a smallmouth video I did these worked extremely well so not just the tubes any type of any type of bait if these are crank baits if they're these are marble jigs hackle jigs like these chartreuse is number one pink is my second choice for color pattern to grab of any type of bait now color number three and this was kind of close because it combos with with another color that I really like but the number three color is red that guy right there now this is a red and white set ring right here I'm sorry it's this is a red and chartreuse set ring tube but red and white black and red actually was was decent for me this year red chartreuse um and red and white though were the two colors actually number four the color number four is white but we'll get into that in a second redden has been great because it it's the kind of the in-between between a really dark color like a black brown a blue or a navy blue and that really light color a white a chartreuse a hot pink it profiles really well in darker water or when it's a really big really cloud cover days waters broken up but it's light enough to see in extremely clear water and it's sunny day so it's it's kind of that happy medium that worked out really well during specific times when the black and chartreuse for whatever reason maybe they were seeing it two months maybe there was too much pressure on that Lake and they were seeing a lot of black and chartreuse jigs or a lot of pink and chartreuse or or white or something like that I switch it up to the red and it just seemed it just seemed to work it that's why it's my number three it works sometimes but didn't work all the time it didn't work as well as when I'd throw pink or chartreuse in general so I like I mentioned number four is the white now this was a close tie with the red but the white is so good because it mimics the belly of a bait fish so like these ones right here these gulp gulp minnows they got a white belly and black kind of a shad pattern so throwing these white white tubes like this really mimics an actual bait fish this is actually one I used quite a bit it's actually a white and chartreuse the lake I'm on right now is really clear water so white and chartreuse especially if it's a sunny day like that like today I know I'm in the shade right now because it's really hot out but on a sunny day like today it's fairly calm there's not a lot of wind white chartreuse has been really well if black and chartreuse or the pink don't work white and chartreuse is probably the next step so like I was talking about the white being a shadow color so this is the belly of the Archy 220 that I was using for the micro crankbait video and I talked about it in the best search base for crappie video but this is the reason why I like white so much especially in clear water these lighter colors it goes so well with these lighter colors but they look like the belly of a bait fish I think that's one of the main reasons white is a really good color for crappie is because it it tends to mimic the the bait fish that are swimming in that that body of water now color number 5 really doesn't get a whole lot of love from a lot of people but that color is believable this guy right here I got her tied onto a 1/16 ounce jig right here now this is a blue and white jig but blue doesn't get a whole lot of love from the crappie fishing world you don't know why because blue and white there's a bluegill combination there's quite a lot of bait fish that have that blue and white tint to them and blue is a darker color which means it shows up a little bit better in that murky or stained water or on cloud-covered days maybe there's a little bit of wind that the Sun isn't that Sun light's not penetrating the lake this blue color will stand out a lot better and you'd think maybe not as good as a black will when you throw in black and chartreuse but you know it works just the same and honestly blues been a great pattern for when I'm throwing beetle spins so blues been actually a great pattern when I team it up to a beetle spin or even those chatter baits that are those micro chatter baits that I've been talking about in that vest search baits video the lose actually been working out fairly well because it mimics there's a little bit of bait fish that have kind of this color pattern it mimics them looks like a running baitfish especially when you throw it on a beetle spin throw a blade on it there's a little bit of chop in the water waters a little stained this definitely works in darker water now depending on the shade of blue this is a little bit of a lighter blue but there's some darker navy blues that really work great when that water turns a little murky or there's some waves where there's some cloud cover so before we wrap this video up I want to mention one important thing these might be my top five colors my go-to colors when I hit the water but sometimes crappie they want to see something different whether it's because of frontal systems I move through maybe it's really stained water there's wind that day there's Sun no Sun cloud cover or it could just be the crappie pressure you know work just could be fishing pressure a lot of these a lot of these lakes that are closer to the urban areas they they throw people throw the same baits black and chartreuse pink and charters crappie sometimes they just don't want they see it they don't want it anymore so it's important to kind of switch it up so maybe colors you don't normally normally use that might be your your yellow your Brown your orange just different color patterns you might need to try because sometimes these these baits don't work for whatever reason also I don't always start with my number one bait that would be the chartreuse and most likely of black in charters I don't always start with that bait you got to take a look at the water you're fishing take a look at the day and kind of give your best guess of what these fish might want to see first if it's a little choppy if it's really dirty water versus if it's calm water and clear you know I might start with a red and white versus a black and chartreuse or I might start with a blue and white versus a pink and chartreuse that's going to be your call when you hit the water I don't always start with my number one and then works in my number five it doesn't work like that it's just if you were to ask me the top five colors to pick here these are what they are but as always I want to know what you think did I get the colors wrong maybe the orders wrong maybe I forgot a color do you disagree with me about on the blue color are you I got a feeling the the blue color at number five you may not sit the best for some of you but let me know in the comments below if they're out of order if you think they're out of order or if you think I missed a color that's what I want to know in the comment section below and again if you like these top five or best fishing lures for crappie videos so be sure to give this video a thumbs up that thumbs up more thumbs up means

see you [Music]", "EJ-EztsZAa0": "good morning barbanel a nutrition education assistant with purdue um and i'm here today to talk to you about my plate as well as how to use food that you may get from a food pantry or from a food basket that someone has made up for use so knowing how to use those foods and put them together is sometimes very difficult and i i was given a list um some things that have been in a food pantry and i'm going to go over those and then we're going to talk about what i'm making and then we'll get into the my play piece of it so the first thing is in times when you get a package or a box of food from a food pantry because you don't get a pick at yourself you get things that are just random and you're looking at it saying how do i put this all together so in my basket i got canned ravioli i got peanut butter and jelly canned sliced carrots spaghetti red beans and rice mix 15 ounce traditional pasta sauce canned sliced peaches honey nut cereal cheesy tuna pasta mix shelf safe milk two different containers of chicken flavored ramen noodles tomato soup two cans of white chicken canned apple sauce and two pudding cups so that's what i was given to prepare if i was to receive this package so the recipe today that we're making is one pot pasta and this pasta calls for ground beef or ground turkey but because i got chicken in my basket i decided i was going to substitute the chicken for the ground beef or the turkey and it works fine so the other thing is in my recipe it calls for onion if you don't have onion and you have onion powder and salt if you use salt you're going to use less of the onion salt so that it doesn't become too salty but you could put those in as a substitute then it calls for chicken broth and instead of chicken broth we're going to just use water because oftentimes your chicken will take on the flavor of whatever it's cooked with so you don't have to have that and if you google a substitute for chicken broth water is one of the things that you can use for chicken broth tomato paste italian seasoning pepper and macaroni or pasta so and you would hopefully it is whole grain but oftentimes in the food pantries you're not going to get whole grains so what your pasta is is what you're going to use but the tomato paste i i received a pasta sauce so that's what i'm using also in this recipe so right there i used three of the items off of my four the items off of my basket i then also found a couple of other recipes a can that that i could make one of them was tomato soup with noodles so that one i would use my ramen noodles and my tomato soup together you also could make bread beans and rice with a chicken jambalaya so you could put that in with your chicken jambalaya and use your other can of chicken so being resourceful and finding recipes that will use these items takes a little bit of work and i know sometimes it's just as easy to throw it on and just warm it up and eat it the way it is however it's not always as nutritious as it could be if you throw it in a pot and put it together so this recipe all we have to do is in a large saucepan we are going to cook the chicken and this chicken will not need to be cooked very much because it has been cooked when it was canned so we're going to put that in just warm it up a little bit and i usually as you guys know i'm a cook that likes to get it done fast i won't say i'm a lazy cook but i'm a let's get it done as fast as we can so i usually go ahead since this meat has been cooked just throw it in and go ahead then and it's not going to have any fat because it's chicken where if you use turkey or if you use beef especially you would have some draining to do but with the chicken you're not going to have anything that needs to drain off of it or you should have very little i mean i'm looking at what's in here and there's hardly any fat in this chicken so we're going to go ahead and stir in our broth which is the water we are then going to go ahead and put in the tomato pasta sauce and just let this start cooking i like to cook it together a little bit longer i'm going to put the onions in as well and then we're going to just let this cook once i get it all mixed together we're just going to let it heat up together and once it gets good and heated up and boiling i'll turn it down to a simmer and we will slowly add in the noodles and the thing with this is just about anybody can make this you saw how simple it was to throw it all in the pan together this is what it looks like as it's starting to cook up so it almost looks like a tomato soup but you're going to put that noodles in and it's all going to come together and and if you want to put a little bit of cheese on it you could you could also um servant with applesauce was i would plan to serve so i would use that out of my bucket also so knowing that you have a basket and it's random foods i like to look and see what goes together so that i can put together a one pan dish or i can make a casserole one of my gals the other day one of my other students told me that she got scalp potatoes and chicken and some tomatoes and she said i just put it all together in a casserole dish and i had just a great casserole for dinner i had enough time to invite my neighbor over and said it was something different that i wouldn't have had otherwise so a one pot meal is always good if you're in a hurry it's also good to use odds and ends of what you have in your pantry and you can also throw in a little extra italian seasoning or salt or pepper if you want but that's to taste it really your pasta sauce should have enough italian seasoning in it if it doesn't you can always add a little bit more in so with that we look at this and we talk about my plate and my plate is a simple revision of the food pyramid from years ago and what it basically looks like is half of our plate is fruits and vegetables and half of our plate is grains and protein and then we have dairy and when we're looking at building a healthy plate we want to say does my plate look like this at most of my meals if it doesn't then what can i do to change it so in this meal that i just put together in this pot we have our protein we're going to have grains okay we've got a little bit of vegetable with the onion and the tomato and we're just missing the dairy and the fruit okay these two right here so not bad for your plate because oftentimes we get our fruit when we have snacks also with vegetables often times in the afternoon we'll have to take a snack and we'll have selling carrots or we'll have broccoli and something i know my grandkids love it with a little bit of ranch dressing so that's an e these two are easy if you pick up an apple and you peel it it's an easy one to have as a snack dairy we often get from yogurt or cottage cheese so this one doesn't it doesn't have to just be milk but it needs to be a dairy product and um need to try to stay away from the dairy that is say i a lot of times i'll hear well i just eat cheese that's okay but that's not how we should get all of our dairy because of the amount of fat that we have in cheese so this plate is what i look at and i talk about and i say does my plate look like this so it's an easy way to look at it as compared to the old pyramid that we tried to figure out if we had so much of each one so when we're looking at this vegetables we should have two and a half cups a day fruits we should have two cups a day protein we should have five to six ounces a day grains five ounces and then dairy three servings or three cups a day so easy to remember it's twos and threes and then you're five and six ounces the important thing here is that at least half of your grain should be coming from whole wheat grain or whole grains so a whole grain is wheat if it's whole wheat oats are dry those are grains that are whole so those you want to have as opposed to having the um fully unbleached white flour that is not a whole grain because it's been processed protein you want to try to have as much lean protein as you can a lean protein is going to be turkey it's going to be chicken it's going to be fish okay a lot of times someone will say well i think pork is a lean protein they oftentimes announce that it's a white protein which it is when you cook it but it's not lean it still has fat and i always i always just remind myself pork gives us bacon so we know it has to have all the things that come from pork has to have some kind of fat in it beef if you're using ground beef you want to try to get the 85 percent lean if you do not get pro the beef that is 85 percent lean you can always brown your beef and then take it out and um [Music] i lay it on the counter on a piece of couple pieces of paper towel on my cutting board and i pat it real good and if it still has a lot of if it's 70 or less i will put it in my strainer and i will put very very hot water on it and drain that fat off while it's still in the liquid form so that i then i will pat it again so that i've got as much of the fat out as i possibly can so there are ways to use ground beef that is not 80 or 85 lean if you use it with taking precautions to process it before you actually eat it so when we look at making our plate look like this sometimes we challenge ourselves in getting enough fruits and vegetables and that is because we have learned to eat fruits and vegetables in their fresh stage and as you notice on my list in my pantry basket i got no fresh fruits or vegetables i got everything that was canned or i might have got something that was frozen those are great resources also you just have to be careful if you're using canned carrots you want to look at the container and see how much sodium is in it because when we can things we put salt in it or sodium in it to stabilize it and if that's the case and it has a large amount of sodium then all you have to do is wash that can of carrots off put them in a strainer and wash them off so that you get the juice that they're canned in off and that gets rid of a lot of the sodium the same thing if you bought fruit that is canned and it's in a heavy syrup you want to put that in a strainer and wash it off and if you save the juice you can always put some water with it and that way then the water will liquefy or break down the sugars that's in that syrup and by doing that you're not drinking asthma if you're want to give that juice to your child you're not giving them just straight sugar water the other thing is is oftentimes when we buy canned fruit it will have um be in pear juice and i'm not i'm not 100 sure why they use pear juice a lot but we do see pear juice and a lot of our cans of fruit that we buy it's okay there's nothing wrong with it it's just that that's the fruits that they have used to can with so knowing those things and knowing that your plate should be half fruits and vegetables the other piece of it is if you do go to the pantry and you pick up fresh fruits and vegetables you want to know how to store them you want to know how to have them last as long as you possibly can and there is on our website for purdue extension eat gather and go and it gives you a lot of tips on how to store and how to make that produce last longer i often times if i know i'm not going to use something i'll cook it and then i'll freeze it so that it's safe to eat later down the road especially corn or beans i will do something like that so that i know that i'm not going to lose them apples if i know that an apple is starting to go bad i'll look at the whole batch and oftentimes i will just peel them pour them and throw them in a pan about this size with a little bit of water and i will let them cook for about an hour and with a lid on them so the steam is building up and i make apple sauce so it's a great way to not let a fruit or vegetable go bad if you process it a little bit so it goes into something else so we love for you to get fruits and vegetables at the pantries however this time of year it's a little slim pickings because we don't get as much fruit and vegetables as we do in the summertime the other thing is in the area we have several gardens that you can go and work in the garden and you can pick up fruits and vegetables from that garden after you have worked in the garden so they're community gardens there are throughout lafayette so it's a great way to pick up some fresh fruits and vegetables the other thing is if you are on snap dollars your snap dollars can be used to go to farmers market that they will convert those into dollars to use at the at the farmer's market to get fruits and vegetables so it's a great way to get fruits and vegetables that you might not have had otherwise and i know that um many times there are different different ways to get some additional dollars to get your fruits and vegetables because pantries don't have them as often so i always say tell my snap people that look at what you're getting from the food pantry before you go to use your snap dollars so that if you need this recipe and you needed to pick something up you've got your snap dollars to do that or fruits and vegetables are one that i really encourage people to take and use for their snack dollars as opposed to thinking they're going to get everything at the food pantry protein as we talked about is just when we cook it is the next piece of it that we can help to keep it a little bit healthier so if we grill it if we poach it if we bake it we're going to have a better quality piece of meat as opposed if we fry it so if you're making hamburgers and you can grill them some way or you can do something other than just putting them in a skillet and letting all that grease cook together that is truly a better way to fix that ground beef the other thing ground beef oftentimes is my go-to to add into something like this one pot pasta or to put it into lasagna or any multitude of casseroles that i make that i will put ground beef in or making a meatloaf is a great way to use your ground beef making sure that we cut back on high foods that are high in solid fats added sugars and salt and our labels today tell us that what is added sugars and those are sugars that are just added to make it taste better sugars come in fruits and vegetables and with that those are good sugars but oftentimes we'll see something being prepared and they will have added sugar to a let's say a strawberry parfait or something and with that do you need that extra sugar from what they've added or can you just have the strawberries by themselves so the less we eat sugar the better our body is because we begin to not notice the sweetness in fruits and vegetables that are actually there if we've gotten used to having so much sugar in our diet also added sugars are oftentimes in our soft drinks and that's where we pick up a lot of our calories is when we're doing soft drinks so understanding what soft drinks do to our diet is something that often times you didn't see that on our plate and we oftentimes pick up that soft drink and say well it was a great value but the value that you have from that soft drink kind of loses its value when you look at how much it could hurt your body the other one is solid fats the easy way to remember a good fat is if it's in the liquid form if it's in a solid form it's going to turn right back into solid form when it goes into your body so it's going to make your arteries that much thicker with fat in them so you want to try to avoid as many foods that have solid fats in them so if you're looking at having a solid fat let's say a piece of pork that has fat on it or bacon that started out solid that is going to turn back into solid fat when it gets into your body so i know we have this huge crave um craze of bacon right now if everything's being made with bacon we just want to make sure that we don't have a lot of bacon because it does have a lot of fats in it the other piece of it is is that we need to drink water we need to drink at least eight cups of water a day and knowing that we have to have eight cups of water a day it's easiest if you just start out with a container and fill it and know that you're going to fill it up every so many hours if you if you stopped and got a big gulp at the grocery store that's a great cup to keep to fill it up with ice and just keep filling it up with water because that water is going to help your body process and it's just our body is made up of a lot of water so we want to keep water in our so we're not dehydrated and the last piece of it is to switch to skim milk from whole wheat milk and knowing that we are switching to skim milk is sometimes very hard for people because they've gotten so used to having whole milk and the reason we switched to skim milk is because of the fat that comes from a cow's milk i know there's a lot of questions that if i were here in person with you you'd be asking about almond milk and oat milk and all of those milks and they all have value but cow's milk is really one of the best milks that we can have but we want to make sure that we're doing skim or one percent milk and my trick to getting people to change from eating whole drinking whole milk is to switch to half whole milk and half two percent and then go from two percent to one percent and um then one percent to skim if you can't do that and if you have children i highly recommend that you continue to give them whole milk until they're about 12 years old so you're going gonna if you have children you're gonna be drinking whole milk longer than maybe you would want to but they need that um extra vitamins and that comes from whole milk and the last piece of of my plate that's not on here is making sure that we're active making sure that we are doing some kind of exercise for at least 30 minutes a day and that means getting our heart elevated high enough that it has to slow back down after we've done that 30 minutes of exercise if we don't get our heart rate elevated then our metabolism doesn't set in and doesn't work as hard as it as well as it could so knowing that and knowing how to get 30 minutes of exercise i know a lot of parents say i get my 30 minutes just following my kids around but my question always is where i took my dog out for a walk my question always is did your heart rate was it elevated or was it just the same as if i was standing here talking to you and if it was just the same then it probably didn't get elevated enough to to get your metabolism going the way it was supposed to so knowing those things knowing to have whole grain breads to have skim or one percent milk to have a lot of fruits and vegetables and it's okay to eat canned or frozen i preferably like frozen better than canned but some people it's the opposite so it's really to your preference it's making sure that we eat the right amount of calories and knowing your calories oftentimes um the usda bases everything on 2 000 calories for a woman and 2500 for men oftentimes that is too many calories for someone that doesn't move a lot and have a lot of exercise or is is aging so you want to make sure you understand your calories and if you have a cell phone or a smartphone there's an app it's called lose it it's free there's also the usda um app that you can put everything track everything that you've eaten for the day and it tells you on either one of these it tells you how many calories how many carbohydrates how many uh proteins how much fat so it's a great way if you really are trying to just watch your diet and to maintain or to lose weight those are two great ways to use those two apps to be able to eat healthy make your plate look like my plate looks like on a regular basis and still be satisfied and still use everything that came in your little packet when you went to the food pantry so knowing how to balance all this is hard it's also important to know how to plan and to prepare when you get some of the odd things that maybe you get in your food pantry box how to make it go the furthest for your family and how to make it as nutritious as nutritional as you possibly can make it so with all of that if there is interest i teach virtual classes through zoom two to three up to five times a week at various times you can pick up my virtual classes through food finders or you can just email me at b norg purdue.edu and we can get you set up with some virtual classes to learn how to plan how to to delve into the fruits the vegetables the proteins and understand them more as well as exercise so it's a great way it's a free service it's something that can help you help your family have a healthier lifestyle so now back to the important part of what i've been making and stirring you while i was talking this is almost done hopefully you're going to be able to see it but this is what it looks like as it's finished it is a great easy recipe this would easily i made a half a recipe so this easily is going to feed three to four people so a whole recipe is going to easily feed six people sometimes if i make something like this i might go one step further throw it into a baking dish and put maybe a little bit of bread crumbs or crumbled cheese and breadcrumbs on the top and just bake it for a few minutes and have a baked spaghetti meal as opposed to just the one pot it depends on how much time i have it also sometimes we'll throw peas in this or throw some spinach in with it so it's really how you want vegetables and that that you like there's no reason that you could put some vegetables in this and those carrots that we got if we weren't going to use them in another recipe we can throw those in here i also often times if they're if you have a chance to pick up a butternut squash or a any kind of squash i oftentimes will take those and prepare them and throw them in something like this they'll cook down and they will take the flavor of the tomatoes but they will give you more nutrition as far as a vegetable in your dish so lots of ways to make your meals healthier it just takes a little bit of time and a little bit of planning and that's truly anything in life takes a little bit more time if it's going to be really good so i would just encourage all of you to try some of these one pot dishes they're also the recipe will be on food finders site but also if you go to eat gather and go just write each other and go into your server and it will pop up and i'll say purdue on it and you can find all kinds of healthy recipes that really work well with things that you can get from food pantries there's also i believe it's feed america has a site that you can pick up recipes for things that you might get at a food pantry so just want everyone to know that we can eat healthy it just takes a little bit of time and a little bit of patience and a lot of coaxing our kids to like these things if they've not been exposed to them so i wish you all well and hopefully you will get to try this recipe", "0vH5V4ndHio": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

for joining us today we're going to be talking a lot about saltwater fishing and some of our comments the last couple weeks some of you subscribers have been asking specifically what we use when we bring our what we bring when we come at saltwater fishing choice of bait and that would be the Berkley Gulp so just gonna kind of talk a little bit about that yeah so thanks to the subscriber I can't remember off the top of my head who it was but we've been catching tons of fish this fall on the Berkley Gulp and it's not new news it's it's not you know something that's a crazy new discovery that the Berkley Gulp is one of the most effective and versatile saltwater baits for all of us out there who don't have access to an offshore fishing boat and we're not catching Marlin we're just fishing from the beach from a jetty or a pier the Berkley Gulp swimming mullet which we're going to talk to you guys about today we're going to show you everything from the rods and the reels to how we work the bait and to hopefully catching some fish this afternoon so check us out the swimming mullet this is the pearl white and if you're ballin on a budget and you only want to purchase one color then I would recommend the pearl white it works great in muddy water chartreuse and those ones might work a little better sorry I'm trying to talk with these domestic Navy Seal ships behind me but the pearl white is the most versatile color it works great in clear water and it also works in muddy water so sometimes you'll notice that it has a little something on the end of it we're gonna actually bite that off and so it looks just like this so I come from a fast fishing background and in bass fishing the smallest most minut items and things can have significant impact in your fishing so that being said when you tie your knot onto the jig head make sure that you don't have line hanging off a lot of times and I bring friends out and they fish and they hadn't been fishing in a long time or ever aiight either or not and I don't cut off the tag in expecting that they're going to and they don't that will eliminate a lot of fish to hit your Pole because they're looking at this thing up close so you want to make sure everything is very well presented with the jig head we typically use a 3/8 ounce jig head this one right here is actually a quarter ounce you want to use the lightest jig head possible because what you're going for is this is almost like a finesse bait we're not we're not reeling it in we're gonna work this bass slowly back so when we hook this up you have so this right here is mr. swimming mullet you have the back in the belly you want the belly to be facing down in the hook to come out the back so that way it's sitting and looks natural on its belly so what we're gonna do is we're just gonna hook the you know going straight in through the head and we're gonna try and get it in there and make sure that you're careful that you see there's a line actually in the middle of the swimming mullet you want that hook to come out right out the end in the middle so it looks just like that so when you push it all the way up that hook is straight in the middle in the dead center of this that's going to affect the way that it swims through the water and the fish can tell that difference so make sure that when you're rigging this thing up that you're doing it correctly because that's what's going to either allow more fish bites or less so that's the bare bones you know kind of 101 of how to hook this thing up very easy and now time to get out there in catch fish I'm on yep got myself a little trout see that Berkley Gulp every time so first of all you just want to cast it out make sure to close your mail and get that line nice and tight you're gonna just wait for your bait just to drop to the bottom so give it a few seconds and then it's nice and easy it's a slow retrieval y'all so you're gonna real maybe half a real wait a few seconds and give it a couple of bucks [Music] especially when you are fishing for flounder you're gonna want to fish it real slow one thing that you have to know about flounder is that their mouth can open pretty wide and they can suck in that bait from at least 2 feet away when you're fishing for flounder it's gonna feel more like a poll-- because what condor do from 2 feet away they're gonna suck in that bait and they're gonna pull it down so it's not going to be that tap-tap-tap you're expecting it's just going to be that firm pull then you're gonna wait and watch for that line to move but if you're fishing for let's take trout or sea bass they're gonna be the little nibble so you're gonna feel the tap tap tap on the end and then that's when you want to set your hook but not too soon for those of y'all who are catching flounder and you want to catch a flounder your first flounder catch you're probably gonna hook up on it and you don't even know that you have a fish you're gonna think that you're stuck on the bottom that's what people classify as the thump for flounder fishing and there's a lot of debate as to when to set the hook for a flounder fishing we're just trying to go through the basics here and put you all on some fish saltwater fish so you know when you're fishing this Berkley Gulp just like what Kristi's doing right here it's just slow bounces off the bottom and guys sorry to say but women are probably going to out fishes more because guys can be we can be a little bit too overzealous at times where girls are just out there watching the Sun and watching the boats going by and before they know it they're hooked up on a fish guys we're a little bit too antsy with setting the hook so sometimes you'll see Kristi catching more fish than me got one all right these shot are getting a little bigger all right you guys so we got this long line of jetties tons of rocks right here we got really good structure one of the things that you really want to watch out for with this is because you're you're bouncing it off the bottom if you get it stuck on a rock then you just let it you just stop reeling don't jerk on it too much and let it sink back down and then just pop it out so just half for real bounce bounce it oh you're all you're looking for is a slight tap sometimes the fish will smoke it and they'll take it and run with it but sometimes it might just be a light tap oh he's back on he wanted that one ooh that's a good one Oh guys I'm on a good one look at mine I've got a big one [Music] good yes he was happening these are the Berkeley gulps for the wind people you okay you guys this is what can happen if you guys fish with Berkley Gulp and as you guys can just see I just landed three trout within 15 minutes on the white pearl Berkeley gold and he's an awesome size he's huge so as you can see my bait is getting pretty torn up as long as it is as long as you know it the head is not exposed and there isn't any red or any jig heads showing in this area then you can still continue to use it so we're gonna actually we're gonna keep fishing this jig head you guys really want to feel the bottom when you're fishing this lure it's going to resemble a almost like an injured fish trying to bounce up off the bottom it's an irresistible treat for predators there is pretty decent size trout people its trout number four of the day be free there is oh fish on here we go you'll see how fast that was once my feet hit the water that fish knew what he wanted and he wanted my Berkley Gulp that's for sure ding oh no no no now when you guys are using your retrieval method that we just taught you don't be afraid to kind of mix it up all right you guys can do one bounce so you can do two bumps it doesn't really matter just make sure you fishes slow and really just remember bump it up and then you're gonna slow half reel down and wait a few seconds kind of like the art of fishing sea bass that's what it was Oh Christie's on cheese on a trout get it in get it in here all right Christie's caught a good trout people about time it finally landed my trout so jump was also with Berkley gulps you have to catch her you have to kiss your catch no I don't kiss them when they have teeth that hold your big trout all right y'all Christie caught oh that's a good stud there he goes okay ladies don't let your men hold your fish because you see what just happened ladies you can manhandle your own fish okay you don't need your man to do it for you there we go seriously yeah here let me take it off the hook that's a big one [Music] it's a good size trout stop stop stop stop hey okay there he goes he gone there he is Manny hit it soon as that thing hit we're gonna keep working that because you might come back for it he hit it on the drop there is Oh whoo this is he's a big one he's pulling drag all right y'all try and get up here and land this this might be a PB trout I think it is Oh Christie can you land them for me yep Mike grab the fish jumping salmon from me are you guys check out oh look at that stud muffin look at that one y'all you another one yeah these Berkeley gulps are hot people big trout that's probably 15 in sure he's a good one all right you guys so there it is moral of this story is white Berkley Gulp shrimp because today we ripped some lips today yeah we did it was hot and the batter the best the trout or he never smoked and I'm left and right yeah fishing hope you guys enjoyed our tutorial on the Berkley Gulp swimming mullet four-inch leave a comment drop a line if you got any other questions hit us up if you want to go fishing yeah absolutely any other inquiries or if you guys want do some collaborations let us know leave some comments below and don't forget to check me out on instagram at Christy joy Anderson see y'all next time peace out", "OR2f7eyqZVY": "Oh all right today is Tuesday Tuesday I'm not exactly sure what day it is but today's the day of the week and like I said fishing has been pretty crappy lately I'm going to try to go to the new spot sometime this week where the fish bite pretty good in the winter buff right now I'm going to do something a little bit different so today I'm going to show you guys a little recipe that I know it helps me catch fish a lot okay yeah you heard it right it's not a fishing vide day but it's a cooking video so this recipe I will show you guys is the trout bait and I don't trout fish a lot but when I do I use this bait give it at the time it's similar to power bait but it's completely different at the same time it's a doe bait so it's one a bait that you roll into your hooks cast out let it drift I honestly think it works better than power bait so that's why I'm making a video about it to show you guys how to make it and use it because catch a lot of fish so let's get into this cooking portion of this video you we have all our ingredients here we've got dough which the dough you can buy store-bought I just whip some up but the dough you can buy in the store you've got cinnamon ground cinnamon we've got some honey so again dough cinnamon honey okay all right so what you want to do now is you want to take the dough and you want to heat up in the microwave for like 10-15 seconds just get it nice and warm and then after that we're going to mix the cinnamon and the honey and with the dough now this part gets real messy with your hands to have paper towels rags ready but this is where the magic happens let's do it all right so this dough is nice and warm again 15 20 seconds on the DAO nothing nothing you don't anything more than that so we're going to spread this dough out nice warm we're just going to put some of this honey on it put some honey on it sprinkle some cinnamon on there and those trout are gonna love it now is the fun part you just you just got to go right into it guys just kind of get right into the mixin I usually let it air-dry for like two hours so it's the right consistency to a stay on the hook when mixing this up I didn't show my mixin but you really gotta like keep adding honey flour and cinnamon at the same time because the honey is going to offset the cinnamon the flour you got to make sure it's the right consistency the right texture and the right color and you want to make sure that there's a lot of flavor in that because travel actually they'll actually want to bite on this again they love the flavor of this it just downright catches fish also you can add dye to that you can add glitter that you can make it look pretty much exactly like PowerBait because it's just a dough so you can really make it have other people think you're throwing PowerBait have them not know what you're throwing when you're at a trout hole you know and there's there's guys here and guys here and there's guys everywhere you can have you're gonna have them thinking you're throwing power bait really you're throwing something tricky Adam you are mixing it up and you are catching the fish like they are not and that is why we do this right here to catch you guys fish to catch me some fish when other people aren't catching fish all right so I hope you guys try this recipe out I hope you make some go out fish with it hope you kept a hell of a lot of fish with it because otherwise that well that just kinda makes me look stupid but anyways if you guys like this video give it a

middle part is this is the one it's the one because the cheese and everything is right in the middle this okay so i googled panzerato and calzones and i'm kind of confused between like what's the difference between a panzeraro and a calzone because i remember in my last video i did this you guys were like that looks like calzone so i'm like let me google calzones apparently they're very similar from what i read calzone is uh baked and a panzerado is fried i got this baked so i'm assuming maybe it's a calzone they both originated from italy but different parts of italy so so israelites you yes uh so so so so so it's so hard to eat this in like big bites that was awesome that was really really good thank you abruzzo so you get the bread and you dip it in the sauce oh yeah

about his contact with the church in jerusalem affirming that he did not receive the gospel of grace that he was preaching from man it was a direct revelation from jesus christ his visits to jerusalem were very short and there was a long time between them and so he talks about his conversion in damascus and then he was three years in arabia receiving from the lord the revelation directly from jesus this revelation of the grace of god manifested through jesus christ it wasn't until he returned to damascus and then back to jerusalem some three years after his conversion before he ever returned to jerusalem brings up an interesting kind of a situation he was sent by the high priest to damascus to imprison those who called upon the name of the lord they no doubt had a timetable in which they were expecting him back with a lot of prisoners and paul didn't show up three years he just sort of dropped out of the whole picture and then he went up to jerusalem and was there just a very short time talking with peter he did see james but of the other of the apostles he really didn't see any of them they had only heard about him the one who persecuted the church was now preaching the faith that he once sought to destroy so now he's talking again but 14 years later i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas and we took titus with us also now in acts the 11th chapter there is a recorded visit of paul to jerusalem and this could be a reference to that but most commentators believe that it is a reference to the 15th chapter because the events so correlate with the 15th chapter of the book of acts in the 15th chapter of the book of acts paul's ministry his home church was in antioch it was basically a gentile church in the area of syria on the mediterranean coast and barnabas had been more or less the minister in antioch and just to follow paul for a moment paul went to arabia for three years he returned to damascus went to jerusalem and from jerusalem he returned back to his home city of tarsus over in what is now greece and or now turkey and he returned to tarsus and he was there for seven years the silent years of paul we know nothing of what he was doing probably making tents and just sort of waiting on the lord but barnabas went to tarsus and looked for paul because of the work in antioch and because there were so many gentile believers he felt that paul was really the one needed to come and to teach there in antioch and so he found paul and paul returned with him to antioch and began a ministry there and that was paul's home church that is the church that sent paul and barnabas out on their first missionary journey and so paul was ministering there in the church of antioch an interesting thing to me that from paul's conversion to the beginning of his ministry was about 10 years before he actually started to minister and i'm certain that those were 10 years of preparation as the lord was preparing preparing paul for the ministry that he had for paul to fulfill so 14 years later and we don't know if the 14 years is 14 years after his conversion or 14 years after his first visit would make 17 years after his conversion and the commentators sort of have divided opinion on this and we'll let them divide their opinion it really doesn't make any difference does it like so many of their arguments it really makes no difference just 14 years later paul went up to jerusalem again now in the 15th chapter of acts as we were saying there were certain men who came down from jerusalem to the church in antioch because they had heard of the ministry of this church they had heard of how there were so many gentiles coming to a faith in jesus christ and these men who came from the church in jerusalem said that they had the apostolic authority to come down to the church in antioch and to inform them that they could not really be saved unless they were circumcised and they kept the law of moses and so they were seeking to put the gentile believers under the law or to make them jews they believed that salvation was of the jews they believed that you could not be saved unless you were a jew and so they were causing division in the church in antioch and so paul gathered them together took barnabas it doesn't say that he took titus but they came back to jerusalem in order to settle this issue of what relationship the gentile believers had to the mosaic law basically the customs of the mosaic law and so it is thought that paul is making a reference to this event that is recorded for us in the 15th chapter of acts you can also read of paul's visit in the 11th chapter and that could be it too but one of the two is the reference here so i went up by revelation and i communicated unto them that gospel which i preach among the gentiles but i did it privately to them that were of reputation lest by any means i should run or had run in vain paul did not want to create a big rift in the church in jerusalem he knew that basically those in the church in jerusalem were still following jewish customs and jewish practices and because paul had received this glorious gospel of grace and realized that salvation is by faith through jesus christ and by the grace of god and not by works he didn't want to do in jerusalem what had been done in antioch the division that was created by the what they call judaizers those who said you had to be a jew in order to be saved and so to those in reputation that is to the apostles paul explained the gospel that he had been preaching to the gentiles the glorious gospel of grace now in the 15th chapter when the church council was called it it records there how that paul and barnabas both of them shared with the church elders of the work that god had been doing not only in antioch but in many of the gentile churches the miracles that were being wrought through the power of jesus christ and so they were sharing that these gentile believers not keeping the law not under the law yet were experiencing the power of god and the miracles from the holy spirit so paul said that titus was with him who was a greek he had never been circumcised and they did not compel titus to be circumcised you see part of becoming a jew was the rite of circumcision and they they who said that you have to be a jew to be saved were saying you had to be circumcised then to be saved and uh paul is telling the people in galatia because these same kind of teachers had come to the churches in galatia and they were seeking to put them under the bondage of the law and seeking to force them to the ritual of circumcision and so paul is saying look i went to jerusalem and i shared the gospel that i was preaching now titus was with me he was a greek and they didn't force him to be circumcised so it wasn't an issue with the church leaders in jerusalem and paul tells of the reason for his going to jerusalem because there were false brothers who were brought in unknowingly to paul who came to privately spy out our liberty which we have in jesus christ that they might bring us into bondage so paul is talking about these who came from jerusalem who were bringing in this damnable doctrine that you have to be a jew to be saved and so paul said we didn't give to them a place of subjection not for a moment that the truth of the gospel might continue with you paul stood his ground he didn't bow to their supposed edict from the church in jerusalem for a moment he withstood them how grateful we are for paul's stand in the grace of god and salvation through faith have paul not made such a strong stand and declared with such clarity this glorious gospel of grace then christianity would have become nothing more than just a jewish sect but because paul was willing to stand up for the truth we have the glorious gospel of grace preached among the gentiles but of these who seem to be somewhat and and you know there is a tendency by man to sort of exalt and elevate certain men within the church there are those that we have a tendency to look up to and sort of stand in awe of them they seem to be the pillars the spokesman and and so paul referring to these who were highly revered peter john james he just said those who seem to be somewhat and whatsoever they were it doesn't matter to me i like that for paul says god is no respecter of persons god accepts no man's person that i love you see you are as important to god as anybody else the world may hold up the pope or mother teresa as you know great people of god sort of in a category in classification above the rest of us not so you are so important to god and and god is no respecter of persons and and i think it's we we lose sight of that we sort of think of ourselves as so insignificant as we stand around these others who you know have such great ministries and so forth we sort of you know the way they carry themselves the way they you know sort of stand and the way they talk and you know you know these guys are really you know big shots but uh god doesn't look at us that way god sees us all on the same plane and god loves us all equally and so they that seem to be somewhat whatever they are i don't know but god doesn't doesn't matter to me god doesn't accept a man's person for they who seem to be somewhat in the conference didn't add anything to me they didn't it you know help me at all they didn't add anything to me but contrary wise opposite when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me as was the gospel of the circumcision to peter they realized peter is sent to the jews i'm sent to the gentiles and thus they recognize that within the church there is the broadness we don't have to all become little uh clones but in christ there is neither jew nor greek barbarian scythian bond or free christ is all and in all and and they recognize paul god has called you to those who are uncircumcised or to the gentile world and peter's been called obviously to the jews to those of the circumcision and so it it isn't a division it's just a recognition that this man can minister effectively to these people where this man can effectively minister to these people god has always had a broadness that exceeds that of man somehow we feel that everyone ought to be like us and if they're not like us well they just are sort of inferior in our eyes because they don't worship like we do they don't have worship teams they have choirs that you can't understand the words that they are singing they have robes they have tall hats they have incense and they have chants and rituals and parades and you know and so we sort of feel that we have sort of a superior spiritual relationship because of the freedom in which we worship not recognizing that god is in all and that there are certain people who are attracted to and love the formality of worship doesn't mean that they're any less a christian than we are it just means that they love to worship in a different way and we should not be guilty of judging them or assuming that we are superior because of the way we love to worship and because of the way we relate in in a freer more casual style doesn't make us superior just means that we're freer and more casual but it has nothing to do with spirituality it is the heart that god is looking at it it's our hearts and and we need to guard against this becoming judgmental because a person doesn't see it the way we see it or worship just as we worship and so they recognize peter god's called you to the circumcision paul god's called you to the uncircumcised and and there was that acknowledgement and recognition for he who wrought effectually in peter to the apostleship of the circumcision paul acknowledges god worked through peter's life in a marvelous way you read the book of acts and you read the miracles and and the power of god that was upon peter's life and and so paul is recognizing this god worked effectually through him to those jews to the those that were circumcised and the same god was mighty in me toward the gentiles paul has an obvious powerful ministry among the gentiles and the holy spirit is working through paul miracles and wonders and signs through paul's life as he ministers to the gentiles same god using peter to reach the circumcision using paul to reach the uncircumcised so when james and cephas which is another name for peter and john and paul calls himself every once in a while that was his jesus is the one who renamed him as peter but cephas was his given name so when james and cephas and john who seemed to be the pillars these guys seem to be the you know the leaders and this james is not james the brother of john but it was james the brother of jesus james the brother of john had already been martyred so when james and peter and john who seemed to be the pillars perceived the grace that was given unto me they gave to me and to barnabas the right hands of fellowship that we should go unto the heathen and they to the circumcision there was that uh acknowledgement god bless you guys shake hands you go to this circumcision we'll go to the heathen you know and we recognize that we have different ministries different callings and we will obey the call of god where he sends us only and they said don't forget the poor that is the church in jerusalem had suffered tremendously financially and were in financial straits and so shake hands god bless you guys and don't forget the poor so paul said which i also was forward to do paul was always sending money to the church in jerusalem to help them because of the tremendous persecution of the church there in jerusalem but when peter was come to antioch now this is a visit to antioch he said i withstood him to the face now you see they were putting paul down and they were saying paul's not reading an apostle and he's inferior peter james they are you know and and they were putting paul down the false teachers were putting paul down not peter and james and john they respected him they gave him the right end of fellowship and respected his call but these false teachers who had come in and were troubling the people telling them that faith in jesus was not sufficient they had to keep the law and they had to become jews so when peter came to antioch i withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed now paul tells of this encounter with peter this uh difference that came up it sort of of course smacks against the thought that peter was the first pope and the divine infallibility of uh you know peter and the of his words and so forth for when he was come to antioch paul said i withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed for before certain of the jews came from james in jerusalem he was eating with the gentiles but when they came he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision now following the jewish custom it was not lawful for a jew to eat with the gentile you remember when peter went to the gentiles in the 10th chapter of acts he was hesitant but the lord had said to peter don't call that unclean which i have cleansed and so peter went to the house of cornelius and they invited peter to come in and i'm sure that peter inside was just having a fit he had never been in a gentile house in his life because a good jew would never enter into a gentile home and so he probably took a big gulp and maybe thought that lightning would strike him when he came through the door and he said you know how it isn't lawful for me a jew to come into the house of a gentile i mean that's the way he introduces this his message he's going to give to them it's not lawful for me to be here and so it was even worse for a jew to eat with the gentile because in their custom and in their mindset to eat with a person was tantamount to becoming one with that person and no good jew would want to become one with an uncircumcised gentile and so they would shun eating with a gentile because eating in in their style of eating it was the common flat bread it was the sauces and the breaking off of the loaf and dipping into the sauces and the it was just a sharing of germs and everything else as you ate and the sharing of the same food means that i'm being nourished by the food you're being nourished by the food we're becoming one because this bread is becoming part of me being assimilated becomes a part of my body it's becoming a part of your body so mystically we're becoming one so before these fellows came down from the church in jerusalem peter was eating with the gentiles which was perfectly right and proper with the lord there is neither jew nor gentile and when these fellows came down from the church in jerusalem peter was afraid and so he separated and did not eat with the gentiles but started eating separately with just the jews and other of the jews in the church in antioch dissembled with peter they followed peter's example inasmuch as even barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation barnabas this companion of paul he separated and stopped eating with the gentiles and so paul was stood him to the face peter that's hypocritical that's wrong and so paul said when i saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel you see the truth of the gospel is that god is made of one we are all as one in the eyes of god and so paul said i said to peter before them all if you being a jew live after the manner of the gentiles and not as do the jews why do you compel the gentiles to live as do the jews now of you being a jew you live after the manner of the gentiles peter had forsaken much of the tradition especially the sabbath day because jesus was constantly being accused of violating the sabbath day and and so paul said why are you trying to force the gentiles to live as jews or the gentiles to become jews we who are jews by nature that is by birth we were born as a jew and not sinners of the gentiles knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified so paul is getting now into the basic message to the galatian church and he is sharing how that he shared with peter this message knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law there is something that is almost inherent in man to seek to be worthy of salvation to try to atone for our sins by counterbalancing them with good works maybe i said something cruel and mean about you and i feel bad i feel guilty i judged you wrongly and i said something to someone else that put you in a bad light and so i feel guilty about it and so i send you a dozen roses and you wonder why in the world would the pastor send me a dozen roses well i'm trying to sort of make up for some bad things i said now if ever you get roses from me i know you'll be suspicious but somehow we seek by good works to counterbalance the evil or the sin or the bad works that we've done now it is interesting that this has become the whole uh basis for the jewish justification today the day of atonement yom kippur which is coming up on us very soon used to be the day for the national atonement for sin that day when the high priest himself would offer the sacrifice that day when he would go into the holy of holies to intercede for the nation that one day out of the year the day when the goat was killed as the sin offering and the other goat released and that whole ceremony of yom kippur day of atonement now today when they celebrate the day of atonement there will be no sacrificial offering for sins but instead the day of atonement to the jew has become the day of reflection they will sit in meditation reflecting on the past year and upon the bad things that they did the people that they cheated or whatever those that they took advantage of and they will also think of the good charitable things that they did the money they donated to the temple or the money they donated to the red cross or and and they will seek in their minds in the reflection over the years the bad things and the good things and sort of put them on the scales these were bad things that i did these were good things that i did and hoping that in the balancing of the good against the bad that the good will outweigh the bad and thus they will feel that they have atoned by these good things that they did their generous works and their philanthropic works and so forth they they feel that as long as they over balance the evil that i've done i will be accepted by god now there is no biblical basis for that whatsoever in fact the bible says that without the shedding of blood there is no remission for sins their bible says that our righteousness is as filthy rags in the eyes of god and yet this is exactly what they're offering though their prophets said that their works their righteousnesses were as filthy rags in the eyes of god so in reality their day of atonement is meaningless today because they are seeking to be justified by the works of the law but by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified so paul is declaring now the gospel that he preaches knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in jesus christ he is our sacrifice he is the complete sacrifice we do not come to god without a sacrifice jesus sacrificed himself he took our sins upon himself he died in our place even as in the old testament the sins were put on the head of the lamb and the lamb died in their place so jesus the lamb of god has taken away our sins he is our sacrifice not a necessity for continuing sacrifices day after day year after year but once and for all he sacrificed his life for the forgiveness of sins so by our faith in jesus christ we are justified of all of the sins we've ever committed so paul is expounding now this glorious gospel of grace we are justified by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified you could keep the whole law and yet if you violated in one point you were guilty of all you cannot be justified by the law even if you did keep it completely so if we seek while we seek to be justified by christ we ourselves also are found sinners is therefore christ the minister of sin god forbid perish the thought in other words being justified by christ if i am as a gentile that is i'm not keeping the ordinances i'm not circumcised and so forth does that mean that christ is the minister of sin paul said oh come on perry foolishness perish the thought for if i build again the things which i destroyed i make myself a transgressor for i through the law am dead to the law that i might live unto god so the law made nothing righteous and paul said the law is good if you use it lawfully but to try to attain by the law a righteous standing before god is is folly it just doesn't happen the law made nothing perfect god has provided justification that is the total and complete exoneration of your guilt but he's provided that through your faith in jesus christ and his sacrifice for you and all of the keeping of the law cannot add to the righteousness that is yours by faith in jesus christ we stand in jesus alone we're trusting in him fully for our righteous standing before god and so if i through the law i'm dead to the law that i might live unto god the law actually condemned me to death i violated i'm guilty and and the law pronounces death so i through the law am dead but really it's that i might live unto god through christ for i am crucified with christ the law has no power over me let's say that in a moment of desperation pressed by bills that is not pay in desperation i go to the bank with a baseball cap turned backwards and dark glasses and i give a note to the teller that says fill this bag with hundred dollar bills or you know i'll shoot you and i robbed that bank but in trying to escape one of the tellers pressed a silent alarm and as i went out i found the police outside with drawn guns i throw down the bag of money i raise my hands and i surrender to the officers and i am taken to jail and i'm booked and i am tried and i'm found guilty i was caught red-handed and so the judge says 5 to 20 years in the state prison and so as they are sending me to the state prison the bus that i am in is hit by a train and i'm killed are they going to take my carcass up to san quentin and put it in a cell for five years because that's the sentence of the court for my crime death ends the guilty sentence that's the end of the matter death has finished it the old life i'm guilty i violated the law but now i am crucified with christ therefore the penalties are negated the law has no more power or say so over me because i've been crucified with christ and thus i'm released from the law that had condemned me to death and so i'm crucified with christ and nevertheless i'm living but yet it's not i but christ now living in me paul said and when christ who is our life shall appear not just a part-time christian full-time a part-time servant of jesus christ no full-time servant of jesus christ the life that i now live i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me so i have been justified not by the deeds of the law not by the works of the law they could not justify me but i have been justified through my faith in jesus christ and by being crucified with christ i am freed from the law and any hold or any penalty that it may have excised against me i am free because i'm dead dead to the law dead to the old life dead to the flesh i do not frustrate paul said the grace of god for if righteousness came by the law then christ is dead in vain tremendously powerful statement one that you need to really meditate on if i could be righteous by keeping the law then christ didn't need to die his death is in vain in the garden jesus prayed father if it is possible let this cup pass from me talking about his death if justification is possible without my dying for sin if justification is possible by the law by keeping the law if a person could be justified by obedience to a set of rules then christ would not need to die but the fact that justification before god full exoneration of my guilt of sin is only possible through jesus bearing my sin and dying in my place thus jesus death is not in vain but through his death he has brought to me justification unto eternal life now it is faith in jesus christ and that is sufficient it isn't an admixture and this was one of the issues in the early church they were trying to mix faith in jesus christ and the keeping of the law whenever a person comes to me and is trying to share their particular belief my question to them is on what do you base your hope for eternal life because that's that's the bottom line that's the important issue on what do you base your hope for eternal life and the answer quite often is my faith in jesus christ and continued membership in the mormon church or my faith in jesus christ and my continued works the going of door to door now the moment you say and you're in error you cannot become righteous after you have believed in jesus christ you cannot become then righteous by works works cannot make you righteous even the best of works all of the works of mother teresa did not make her righteous righteousness can only come through faith in jesus christ now my faith in jesus christ will be manifested in the fruit of my life the kinds of things that mother teresa did are evidences are fruit of a relationship but they are not that which saved they are not that which makes a person righteous for if righteousness could come by the law then christ died in vain paul is going to carry this subject and expound upon it as we go through galatians it is a tremendous book to set us free from any endeavors of our flesh to be accepted or made righteous before god and we will realize that jesus christ is our only hope our righteousness is in him through him by him and it is complete there's nothing you can add to it you are complete in him glorious truths that will set you free father we thank you for that wonderful work of jesus christ in our behalf who took upon himself our guilt our sin who died in our place bearing our sins in his own body that we through faith in him might be justified from every wrong thing we have ever done fully exonerated forgiven and that we stand before you in him in the righteousness which is of christ through faith lord what a blessing what a privilege to realize that you look upon us as fully righteous because you see us in christ what a blessed privilege lord bring us into a complete understanding and full appreciation of all that jesus christ has done in our behalf in his name we pray amen so we stand jesus paid it on all to him i owe sin had left a crimson stain he washed it white as snow and when before the throne i stand in him complete died my soul to save my lips shall still repeat jesus paid it all all to him i owe sin had left a crimson stain he washed it white as snow praise the lord god bless you", "TPuT0Jqr_4s": "this week in the galley we're in Anaheim California at each street in San next to me is cake he's a chef here and this is her own business where she does taking lessons and she's been kind enough to invite us down to show us how to cook up a fish dish and what is it you have for us today we are going to be making halibut with the Chipotle adobo sun-dried tomato sauce cool so how do we get started going to take one or two tablespoons of chipotle depending on how much spice you like I like surprise I do too I like it spicy so one if you're not into too much spice too if you are into spice so two tablespoons adobo reconstituted sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil and so in this situation you're going to take a cup into here and into your blender then you're going to take a 1/2 cup of olives they don't have to be chopped up crazy because your blenders gonna do the work for you so you can chop them just a little bit anchor it with your left hand to break them up a little bit yep and into your blender next thing you're going to need is a 1/2 cup of orange juice this adds a little bit of Tang a little bit of sweetness then you're going to use a tablespoon of vinegar I like to use apple cider vinegar just because it's a little bit more complex than your generic distilled white vinegar so apple cider vinegar into your blender 2 big pinches of pepper same thing with salt so one pinch to pinch the salt and pepper make that big of a difference in every dish because just about every dish I see people add salt this salt brings out the flavor of everything it's crazy when you're cooking especially something like an onion if you put salt in there all of a sudden is just vibrant so yeah salts important next thing you're gonna take a half of a diced onion right into your blender and last but not least just a little bit of olive oil to get it moving about a tablespoon put your lid on and zoom it around so that's our sauce no we're done easy that's what's nice about halibut it's it's like a rockfish in the sense that it absorbs just about any flavor you add yeah a normal portion is about five so I'm going to cut this in half you want to use a pan that is not Teflon coated olive oil you're gonna take your five ounces of halibut into your hot olive oil so it's gonna cook just like this from the right okay look how quickly yeah just like that right after you put it in your gonna want to loosen it up just make sure it's not stuck so if we're using a Teflon pan did the fish would taste as well the flavors actually stick to the bottom of the pan so whether it's pork or beef or fish you always want to use this kind of a pan well I always say Teflon is just for eggs and cream the beauty that halibut is it's a flaky fish and when cooked just right it will be flaky and melts in your mouth you want to make sure you don't overcook it when it meets in the middle is it's done if you keep cooking it just like chicken it will get tough even if you're starting with the best of the best with a five ounce piece of fish it's gonna take about eight minutes put it right onto your plate kind of salsa goes just right over the top like this Summa sauce magic secret sauce not a secret anymore that is good good sauce that sauce I love you can even use that like I'm a fish taco yeah this is really great you guys have to try this dish cook this at home it's just a beautiful great dish Thanks thanks Dan appreciate you helping that's not so oh and Kate's located in Anaheim California and go to our website and get more information let's get back on the water and show you more exciting action right here on sport fishing", "qFnxzzClu5w": "hi it's jeff krasnow and welcome to the commune

approximately double the u.s government recommendation a significant portion of this supplemental sugar is delivered in the beverage form perhaps unsurprisingly a 12 ounce can of mountain dew contains 46.5 grams of sugar more startling though is the prevalence of sugar and beverages that are marketed as part of a healthy lifestyle like sport hydration drinks or consider a 20 ounce bottle of sobe energized green tea an innocuous even purportedly enlightened thirst quencher which packs a whopping 61 grams a table sugar or sucrose is a disaccharide comprised of glucose and fructose which in digestion are separated and metabolized very differently glucose provides calories for cells the liver turns excess fructose into fat fructose is known to induce leptin resistance and greatly increase the risk of developing obesity as leptin plays an important role in regulating hunger suppressing leptin release can produce an insatiable appetite and lead to overconsumption so why is high fructose corn syrup so omnipresent well it's cheap about half the price of cane sugar largely because the big food industry and corn refiners have successfully lobbied for subsidies that are guaranteed through the farm bill the production of high fructose corn syrup and other sweeteners under their true cost of production is a citizen funded government-enabled grant to companies like coca-cola who pack their drinks with sodium to make you thirstier and mask it with cheap high fructose corn syrup this allows big beverage to market its product in increasingly larger portion size and we've all witnessed and perhaps experienced the 44 ounce big gulp the daily consumption of which will yield 57 pounds of fat by year's end what is the byproduct of ubiquitous high fructose corn syrup and processed food in general well from 2000 through 2018 the prevalence of obesity in the united states increased from 30 and a half percent to 42.4 percent so what is obese obesity in adults is defined as a body mass index bmi of greater than or equal to 30. bmi is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared rounded to one decimal point okay so to save you some math a bmi of 30 for someone six feet tall is 222 pounds a bmi of 40 severely obese is 295 pounds and the prevalence of severe obesity has increased in the last 20 years from 4.7 percent to 9.2 for comparison obesity rates in china hovers around 6 percent little doubt remains that there is a correlation between sugar consumption and obesity rates sugar is also known to suppress the immune system just by consuming 100 grams of sugar can suppress white blood cell function by 40 for at least 5 hours why interrupt your day with this disquisition on the evils of sugar at this very moment because while covid19 is a nasty highly transmissible and potentially fatal virus lurking behind the pandemic is a more pervasive and insidious epidemic we consume too much sugar we are increasingly obese and living with chronic disease and inflammation and in our immune compromised state we increase our susceptibility to viruses escalating obesity prevalence is directly tied to skyrocketing rates of chronic disease most notably diabetes there are 35 million american adults 10.5 percent of the population with diabetes and nearly a hundred million additional people that are pre-diabetic the estimated domestic total economic cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2017 was 327 billion dollars there is a distinct socioeconomic component to these data that often correspond with racial inequities black men are seven percent more likely to be obese than white men and black women are the most disproportionately impacted group with obesity rates at 57 17 points higher than white women comorbidities the simultaneous presence of two chronic diseases or conditions in a patient such as obesity and diabetes have contributed to a covid19 age-adjusted fatality rate among black americans that is 3.7 times white americans i cast no aspersions on people carrying extra weight my childhood chubbiness and its accompanying self-esteem issues have been thoroughly documented in my prior streets and in full candor i am currently in a knife fight with a pair of muffin tops that are cresting over my belt loops as i approach 50. to be clear being healthy should not be confused with commodification of wellness which projects unattainable images of perfection in attempt to create a feeling of deficiency and then markets products and services to address that perceived lack being well is not about appearance it's about health and thus should not be judged the media floods us with daily stratagem to address the riddle of snowball and cova diagnoses indeed there was a point when america could have followed the lead of other nations and quashed the spread through well-documented policies that include a combination of personal responsibility and governmental leadership these tactics include mask wearing social distancing and personal hygiene in combination with mass testing contact tracing and the curbing of super spreading events by most estimates just 10 to 20 percent of coronavirus infections account for 80 percent of the transmissions incompetent leadership may have ironically informed a new strategy for international terrorism leave the united states alone they'll do themselves in while there's a glut of newscasters scientists and cdc officials hammering home important if conventional policies there is a deafening silence from the media and the mainstream medical community around personal health the pre-covered ground conditions in america that have led to such widespread transmission and fatalities 5.2 million cases and 166 000 deaths at recording there are data emerging suggesting a correlation between excess weight and covid19 severity a recent open safely study reports the risk of dying from covid19 increased by 27 percent among obese individuals and was doubled in patients with a body mass index greater than 40. in a prospective cohort study of patients with cobit 19 from new york city the prevalence of diabetes and obesity was higher in individuals admitted to hospitals than those not admitted to hospitals 34.7 versus 9.7 for diabetes and 39.5 versus 30.8 for obesity respectively instead of celebrating the elixir of binges from chubby hubby to netflix that has conspired to coin the term the covid 15 referring to weight gain from inactivity during quarantine we could be seizing this moment to have an initiative for public health to promote exercise mindfulness practices and proper nutrition as a means to build healthy immunity to take on big food and hold them accountable by at the very least internalizing their true costs to educate widely on nutrition promote cooking and community gardens to provide incentives for grocery to enter underserved neighborhoods and stock fruits and vegetables to make snap benefits redeemable online such that these services can deliver to underserved communities to consider taxes on egregious products similar to the cigarette tax to enlarge the food and vegetable prescription program for children and to pass a new farm bill there's very little public discourse focused on what we need to do to improve the underlying well-being of society and while robust immune systems are not going to protect us from more lethal viruses like ebola there is plenty of good reason to address the underlying root causes of our societal disease we can leverage this moment to invest in our communal health or continue lining the pockets of big pharma to incessantly treat the male effects further well-being must cease to be a class privilege running walking practicing yoga

different part of the lake hoping to find some bigger fish I found a different school I don't know I don't know it's it's not looking too good August is not fun but I wanted to do a live minnow verse slab sauce challenge today as well since I'm out on the water anyway I'm hoping the storm holds off today because I do want to try to bass fish I don't think I'm gonna film it because most people don't care if they watch me bass fishing but I like bass fishing especially right now it's very little wind pretty much calm in these back bays maybe maybe start frogging it I don't know I don't know what I'm gonna do all right so ten minute challenge G sauce verse live minnows of Berkeley I don't know shad I think this is called black shad different minnow obviously because I'm spraying a different scent on it but sixteenth ounce jig head I got a sixteenth ounce jig head for the live minnow rig set up got the minnows in the water so let's get this thing started here I got a buoy marker out actually and I'm finding out that it looks like there's a bigger size of fish from what I can tell on the sonar right as this there's like a mid Lake hump here and it breaks down to about 15 to 22 feet and on that that gradual break I've seen some pretty good size of fish pretty good pretty good school size of fish is what I should say so hopefully hopefully these are some decent fish by the way spray this downwind oh not like that don't let it rebound into you unless you want to smell like garlic looks like there yeah there they are okay another underneath the boat starting now three two one go time check well three two one go now okay four on the GoPro this would be easy math 14 we stopped at Davis 14 on the GoPro we're done the mortality rate there he is jeez sauce number one baby mortality rate of catching these fish deeper than you know 2025 feet down it's it's a lot higher than if you catch them less than 20 feet I'm sure I got to find some studies because I'm sure a lot of you are gonna be saying well how do you know that I just think about it if you're thirty feet down and you get ripped to the surface versus if you're 15 feet down you're gonna feel a lot worse if you're thirty feet down and you get rip to the surface and just are areas that's a that's a dink this is not the same fish that hit it crumpet number two for the G sauce and yes I know these are these are numbers challenges not oh dang that stuff is strong there he is copy number four for the G sauce thirty seconds left there's a fish I figure what number this is not really sure I think four maybe oh that's time that's time all right let's just roll right into the live minnow here all right here we go Oh almost threw a rod in the drink set that in a rod holder there we go that would've been good all right ten minutes on the clock five four three two one and go oh no he had it and he just stole it there he is oh that's because they're Dinks don't you throw my minnow just threw my minnow it's cuz you're Dinks come on come on crappie oh it's halfway through here five minutes 45 seconds left only got one fish of course I missed like three various - - I had a I took a time out so I got three and a half minutes left on the live minnow challenge that's why I paused it put a little pause on it there he is baby baby crappie various keep throwing my dang minnows as soon as I get to the surface your tiny fish though tiny tiny fish thirty seconds left thirty seconds left I hope I don't got I'm gonna have to put some background music because I don't want to get a copy strike on that Sun somebody it's blasting music I'm a shoreline here ten seconds left there's one below the boat here let's see if I can get in quick five four three two one that's gonna end it that's what might be a walleye hold on folks challenge is over but I just want to catch this fish hope there he is oh he's a crappie not a big one either there was a bigger mark down there and it looked it was longer look like a crappie okay that's gonna end the challenge not really sure who want I'm pretty sure minnows one I got to be perfectly honest with you like the month of August have been just awful right now I've had a terrible August I really have let's zoom this back out oh I don't even know what to say about it like small fish can't find the big fish minnows are pretty much the only thing they've been hitting on I don't know I might I might chase some other fish I'm actually probably gonna go film or not even film I'm just gonna go fast fishing right now I don't know what to do it's it's bad it's really bad but that's what they say about the month August the dog days of summer dog days of summer really bad for crappie fishing unless you have a live minnow but anyway sorry sorry to get you down there I didn't mean to do that that's not good if you like these challenge videos be sure to like the video more likes I get on these challenge videos the more them encouraged to feel more of them

"[Music] so i'm going down to gotta go down here to mom and dad's and get some wing sauce me and dad's gonna do some wings today today uh my wife's doing a uh she's having a baby shower so while they're going to the baby shower i'm going to do some wings and hang out here mom and dad probably do maybe do a little fishing i don't know it's been raining it's nasty i was gonna do many yards but it's just been nasty today already so i'm going to probably do a little fishing later on right now i'm gonna get this wing sauce and do some wings a little bit and i'll show you how i'm gonna do my wings another cooking video y'all stay with me all right so i got my sauce mama had it it's crystals wing sauce i've never had it before but we're gonna chop today on some uh some wings i'm making so now i'm on my way to the adult beverage store so we can sit around today and eat wings and maybe watch a race and have a drink i don't know hang out have a good time so anyway i'm going to show you how i'm going to do these wings kind of experiment with this new sauce but i'm going to show you how i did it or how i'm going to do it so on my way to the store so we'll be back in a minute for a little bit we'll start doing some uh we'll start doing some cooking we'll see you in a bit all right guys i got my wings here i've got 24 uh chicken wings i got the flats and the little um legs got my wing sauce which is uh pure louisiana crystals sauce original recipe wing sauce smells great tastes great so we're going to give it a try on our wings today so what i'm going to do first is i'm going to get some meat tenderizer i like putting those this on my wings and my chicken it just tenderizes a little bit you know it makes a little bit better uh pulls off the bone real good when i do it this way so i'm gonna get that done uh get them just seasoned down a little bit with this um not heavy just a little light light coat on them and then um and then we'll go from there i'll show you what i'm doing i'm not putting the heavy coat on just a little bit and i'm doing it over sink here so i'll make a mess everywhere and but i'm just giving a light coat not much no i'm gonna let these sit in this um meat tenderizer for probably a good hour or so before i season them up they're still a little a little frozen that's okay and then we're going to take the next step and i'll show you that in just a minute it's got me a big uh big pot out i'm gonna put my water in here and then i got my wings over here that i just put this uh meat tenderizer on and i'm gonna put the water in here let it bring bring it to the bowl i'm gonna put some crab bowl in it and i'm gonna boil my wings in the crab bowl for about uh i don't know probably 20 minutes all right guys you can see right here i got my crab bowl i got the powder and the um gallon jug of liquid my wing sauce we're gonna make this our hot wings y'all stay tuned it's gonna be good all right so y'all got a boat i got a pot got my water in it got my wings that i put the meat tenderizer on in the bowl i got the wings sauce crystals wing sauce never tried it but we're to try it i've got xanaran's crab bowl the powder and i've got xatarian's shrimp bowl liquid this stuff is hot this stuff is hot this isn't hot but it's got a great flavor i'm gonna put wings in here i'm gonna boil them until they get a little bit tender i don't want them falling off the bone tender because there's another step after this so i'll show you what i'm going to do all right y'all i got my wings i got my uh water bowling i already got my crab bowl and stuff in there i'm gonna put these wings in there let them bowl for a little bit are y'all the wings are in the bowl scramble i'm gonna let them bowl in there or let them sit in there for i don't know probably 15-20 minutes i'm not going to let them get to where they're falling off the bone but i want them good and tender so then i'm going to take them up put them back in the bowl and we're going to go take them to the grill and then we'll take this stuff and coat them they're gonna be good you know i got the uh wings and the crab ball behind me and it's just let y'all know when y'all do this make sure you have the vent going because this stuff right here will choke you to death but uh boy them wings are gonna be good real good y'all y'all can see the wings are starting to come to the top on top of the water that means they're getting about where i want them i'm gonna let them sit they've been on now about 15 minutes i'm gonna let them sit in there about another ten minutes and then i'm gonna turn the heat off and let them sit in there for probably 30 minutes then we'll go to the next step here yo i'm fixing to take these boys and cut them off and let them sit in this crab bowl for about i don't know 30 minutes [Applause] turn them off they've been bowling now for about 30 minutes so i'm now going to let them sit in the bowl for another 30. kind of suck up some of that juice you know it's a rainy day in georgia been raining since earlier this morning but that's okay so along with the wings i got the char-broil going i got some fresh sausage on i just put them on don't let them cook for a little bit it's going to go along with our wings all right y'all saw i brought them out of the bowl and now i've got them on the grill and i'm charring them up and i will start basting them this is my first flip and i'll start basting them once i get another little char on this other side now i'm letting them sit on each side for about five minutes and then i will start basting them with my wing sauce oh y'all have been basting my wings down with that sauce they're looking really good i'm gonna take them up they've been on the grill for about uh i don't know about 15-20 minutes i'm gonna base them down one more time and they'll be done well y'all there's a finished product right off the grill all right y'all we're in the bar we're going to watch the race got the wings and all right here we can have us a good time [Music] all right we're going to try them out appreciate you all watching [Music] you", "6UJSgk-LMSE": "[Music] that is a start of a crappie welcome back ladies and gents I'm Davis is the flopping crappie channel and today I actually want to talk about the best search baits for crappie of course these are only my opinion but this is what worked for me from pre spawn post spawn and now we're in summer Clark crappie this is mid-july right now and these baits most of them will work all year round so I'm gonna start with the bait that worked by far the best both pre spawn post bond and now the summer that is the beetle spin so this is the bait I was using for most of the post spawn that was just absolutely phenomenal if you remember the Berkley Gulp minnow challenge these are actually a different color than the ones I used but those are Emily emerald shiner the ones I use were like a black shad but this bait has been great pre spawn I used it a little bit but post spawn especially I was able to fish it shallow weeds just as these crappie were coming off their beds in less than six feet of water and you just buzz this by the top of the weed line and these crappie would come up out of the weeds and take it this is a very simple setup both tubes and the swim bait style plastics work great on these you can kind of you can cast it out straight retrieve kind of work it like a jerk bait you can even jig it back to the boat in deeper weed cover which is what I've been doing lately in this for instance we're in the middle of July that's what I've been doing lately but the best conditions for something like this a little bit of cut cloud cover or a little bit of wind just something to break up the water surface but let that blade go to work I mean let's be honest it's basically a spinner bait so if you know how to spinner bait fish you know how to throw spinner baits for bass or the conditions you should be throwing spinner baits it's the same concept pulleys for crappie now the jig head size I use is normally a 1/32 but this is a 1 this is a 1/16 size jig head it's a little heavier because I'm these fish are starting to get a little deeper water that 15 20 foot of water you need something a little more you probably even go up to 1/8 pounds of jig head to get this Beatle spin down to the depth that these crappie are at throwing this around brush piles deeper weed lines deeper weed lines have been so key for me this year these crappie some of them have moved out - brush piles these brush piles been set up in 20 plus feet of water but these deeper weed lines something that 12 to 15 foot range these crappie are just tucked down into the weeds and if you can just put this bait just so it comes across the top of the weed line these crappie come up and attack it so the two baits that work the best for me on this beetle spin have been this 3-inch swim bait so the black and chartreuse plastic and then a black and chartreuse full body - this is a Piko scent ring ivy the tail is a little chopped off as you can see because these crappie like these but yeah hollow body tubes work worked as well they kind of slide off the jig head you might have to super glue those on but who but full body tubes and swim baits worked great for me now search baton number two crank baits [Music] and there's actually three I guess groups of crankbaits there's the regular not a square bill the round bill crankbait the jerkbait and then the lipless crankbait so the first one I'm going to talk about is this one it's a two-inch Archy 220 crankbait this is the exact fade I used during the micro crankbait video I'll link all this stuff below all these videos below so you guys can check them out this is a 6-foot diver this was great during the post spawn season this would dive down just on top of the weed lines when these fish would push off their beds then that transition from their spawning grounds to that summer to their summering holes those deeper weeds those brush piles that risen that transition weed line between 8 to 12 feet of water these weeds would grow up in these and this would run just deep enough depending on how fast I actually reel it in it would run just deep enough to tick the tops of the weeds this was great for aggressive crappie cloudy days windy days search baits probably work best when there's a at least a little bit of cloud cover or the waters broken up this one was great you can check this video out a link it below that's the first family of crank baits so the second one is probably what I'm going to be using later in the season here this is a sinking Rapala jerkbait style and the reason it's important that it's sinking is because obviously you're fishing crappie in 15 plus feet of water you need something to get down to those depths I'm actually I'm actually experimenting with somehow like Carolina rigging something like this or maybe a not quite a drop shot rig but but a 3-way rig where there's a bell sinker where there's a bell sinker about a foot below it's like a 3-way swivel and this is a foot and a half back I've seen that work really well for crappie so this is the second crank bait style this is the second group of crank baits that I'm going to be using for these crappie and the last one of the second set of search baits is the lipless crankbait there's a black and purple lipless crankbait this is actually an ice-fishing crankbait and it's mostly meant for vertical jigging it doesn't really run straight when you just pull through the water it really it's it's meant to dart around actually it's meant to be purely vertically jig because when you're ice fish and you dig this up it actually spins around the hole as it dives back down to make it look like a dying bait fish so this one's going to be more of a vertical jigging tactic I'm going to be using also I read about it also I read about a new technique and crop it on an article on crappie calm they actually tied this up below a slip bobber and the guy was fishing him I think it was 10 to 15 feet of water and he was fishing and think of me and he was fishing it like a suspended crank bait where he you could really slowly move it in but the the important key was he kept it in that strike zone so if these crappie wanted to hit a bait in that 15 foot range you could keep it there but he could still move it up and down and give it a little bit of a but he could still use it like a lipless crankbait to get these crappie to strike so that's actually something I'm going to try to do later this summer you can check that article out crappie comm it's in their archives if you want to read more and it sounds like a really good idea he had a lot of success doing it so I definitely want to try this now before we go to bait number three I want to talk about this Archy micro crank bait and I mentioned it a little bit in the micro crank bait video but I wanted to mention it again especially since this is a search bait video I was getting most of my strikes as I would pull it and would take the top the weeds but it wasn't a straight retrieve most of the strikes would come from when I paused the bait and the other thing no this is a floating crank bait so when I pause this bait it rose up now remember crappie or they like to hit lures from underneath they like that negative bite that come underneath and hit the lure you can definitely tell between a bass or a northern pike and a crappie bite because the bass in the northern pike will actually grab it with enough force and push it forward a crappie bite as your either you drag it through the water without reeling and then you kind of reel up the slack but keep the line kind of taught the profil just feel like dead weight so if you're using these search baits especially if you're using something that's more of a suspending or floating crank bait that can dive down to that 6 plus foot range one that's what you want to that's kind of the retrieve you want to do you want to be able to pause it and let it drift up because that's when they're going to hit it and to understand the difference between if you got a crappie or a bass or northern pike on I don't know if that's important to you but just thought I'd share that all right now bait number three is probably something a lot of crappie fishermen I've probably never used before that's why it's because it's fairly new to the marketplace I don't think it's been out for more than a couple years actually in this size I know chatter this is the chatter Bay this is actually a very small chatter bait I know chatter baits have been around the bass fishing world for a while but this size of chatter bait I don't think has been on the market for very long this is a metallic chartreuse ChatterBait Ivan you've probably seen it in the micro lure challenge this is the exact chatter bait that I used in that challenge to catch some fish and I really think bladed jigs that are a little different than under under spins and some smaller spinner baits that are kind of different from the beetle spin are kind of are going to be the next level of search baits that a lot of crappie fishermen are going to use they're kind of a fusion between a bass fishing lure and a crappie fishing lure I think these type of lures are definitely going to be the next the next set of lures that a lot of crappie fishermen start using this one is I was able to do a bunch of stuff with this I was able to straight retrieve this I could vertical I could cast it out and jig it back to the boat and I was even catching fish by vertically jigging this bait so this has a wide range of ways you can retrieve this back to the boat and still catch fish I was putting two different types of baits on there 3-inch swim bait paddle tail the full body tube this is a Piko scent ring full body tube both of those plastics I put on here I use bunch of different colors too blue and white red and white red and chartreuse black and chartreuse pink and chartreuse just all over the place I was still able to catch fish with this I'm definitely ordering some more of these different colors that I'll be doing more videos on but this was just a great I think this is going to be a great bait that I can use all year round pre spawn mode you can definitely cast this and cover water when these crappie are spread out before the spawn probably could throw it under a under a bobber during the spawn probably don't need to because you can throw marbly jigs or hackle or just basic jigs with little full-body tubes or any type of tubes on them but if you wanted to you could post spawn this one crushed it again along with the beetle spin and this summer having jigged a lot of brush piles yet this year but these crappie are definitely starting to get that deep so this bait I'm gonna be using it for vertically jigging and I'll let you know I'll be doing multiple videos with this so I'll definitely let you know how I'm doing but this is bait number three from my best search baits for these crappie and [Music] last but not least one that's fairly well known in the crappie fishing world it actually really got translated to the bass fishing it really started to come over to the bass fishing world past couple years and that is the under spin this guy now the bass fishing world they actually throw them on I guess I'd call them warm hooks bigger bigger worm hooks like 2 3 OTT hooks and the the weights actually molded into the actual hook and then they put a blade underneath it they don't actually have well I think they do have jigs that look like this that are you know quarter ounce of jigs for bass but this one these ones obviously a lot of people a lot of crappie fishermen use these can be retrieved in a variety of ways straight retrieve casted out just bring it back in like a like a regular spinner bait you can jig it the same way that shadow bait worked for me and then vertically jigging these or put these below a bobber I've seen a lot of videos where guys are actually putting these below bobbers and they're kind of they're vertically jigging it but they're using that bobber as a suspension so that that bait stays 10 12 feet of water or wherever that bait needs to be set for these fish to hit they're vertically jigging that they're just slowly bringing the bobber back to the boat keeping that bait in the eye line of those crappie I mostly like to use these when these crappie start to get a little argit I find that these baits these underspin baits I can work a lot slower than most of the other ones the only one that I compare this to is the chatter bait that micro chatter bait I can probably work at the same as far as slower retrieve but this is I use this mainly when crappie are a little lethargic they don't want to hit a moving crank bait that's just buzzing by them they want something a little slowed down but you still need to cover some water okay you still got to go find those fish that's what I mainly use this for but this is a pretty small hook I'm usually going to stick to mostly full bodied or Holly but hollowed body tubes with this under spin now those faster moving baits there more likely to trigger a reaction bite so the the crankbaits the beetle spin they're definitely more more likely to trigger a reaction by these ones since I fish them slower and I team them up with something like this this full-body tube I definitely want to have something that not that attracts these crappie not just the color but I like to throw some scents on there this is actually the G sauce the new G sauce from crappie calm I also use the original slab sauce but just a scent that really attracts them in because you're not really moving that bait very fast and it's not going to create a reaction strike the way a crankbait would or where that Beatle spin would so that's gonna wrap it up for me today those are my best search baits for all seasons of crappie fishing but I want to know what you think did I miss anything are there any other baits that you normally fish that are you consider the best search bait post that in the comments below also if you use the same baits that I did but you use them a different way post that in the comments below as well I like hearing from you I like trying to fish new baits and I like trying to fish the same baits but just in new ways so just be sure to let me know in the comments section if you have any other ideas for search baits that you normally use or if you fish these baits in any different way please post those in the comments section also if you like these types of top search baits or just top lures for

task all right let's get on with our next task and apparently somebody called an emergency meeting so let's see what's going on people getting look how fast people are getting activated like if you call an emergency meeting like at the beginning of a game people get aggravated very fast all right nothing's happening right now he's not saying anything what what does that mean i love you pink wait

i guess he's the one who called the emergency meeting for no reason but yeah was he the imposter let's see it was this the real truth was he the imposter and he was not the imposter all right i don't know what they were doing but let's get on with our next tasks all right so i'm going to navigation let's do this test real quick hopefully white doesn't kill me real quick and it was a pretty cool little task all right let's do our next one right now all right so these dudes are mad sus right now i don't know what they're doing i'm gonna try to act suspicious also so they think i'm in the imposter to drive them away all right i guess i'm gonna go on i guess we just turn different corners i don't know what just happened right there but yeah let's just go ahead and do our next task all right so i'm just going to go to med bay real quick do this test real quick can you even like oh oh my no we die dang good now we have to eat 10 drops of hot sauce all right i'll see you guys in the next game all right let's see what i got kumi again you already know this game is going to give a screaming all right i'll see you guys on my first desk all right let's do the swipe card thing okay someone called an emergency meeting people are gonna get mad it's just like last game someone already saying why last game people got very mad all right they're not saying anything i hate when they like call a meeting and then they don't say nothing like you caught a meeting for a reason everyone come to medbay and watch me and dawn's getting me man okay i guess like he really wants us to watch him scan the thing are you serious damn why did everybody just leave out no clue all right i guess everybody's gonna vote red because red's acting weird i'm avoiding red and yeah pretty much everybody voted red and light blue actually voted gray which is interesting was read the impossible i don't feel like he was but like yeah he wasn't i don't know why people would do that they did the weirdest stuff hold on so guys i'm about to call an emergency meeting because there's only four people left in the game and there's two imposters so if one of the crewmates dies then it's a game over so we have to get everything settled and vote right now so there's only four of us left yeah and if one of us gets if one of the crewmates dies yeah you already know we get a game over so yeah all right we have to vote now all right let's see hopefully they don't just go for me because i called the meeting because look there's only four people left because like a lot of people died oh what the freak what is autocorrect now oh there's only one imposter hopefully it is only one but he said all right he says cyan all right i just voted cyan cyan voted me all right yeah you deserve that all right

we caught a couple fluke it was a great time it was really hot but check out this video yeah definitely going to put a bigger weight on this especially after this huge i think you got something yeah you got a fluke hell yeah that's like a first cast that's sick that's a good size too can we take it off that's sick nice hey slimy oh my god he's so aggressive and slippery all right another one jeez girl all right i got another one it's because my balls are tangled that'll happen you know to the best of us there we go there we go oh that's a good size that's what i'm talking about baby you got them yeah i just got it for you nice yeah that's a good one right that's a good one all right there's a good one can i take a picture guys give us a smile it's fluking they're there they're out there wow that's a good one let's get you back in fellain buy a little drive away he goes we both caught this yours was bigger yeah yeah of course it was dolphinately was that a fish joke tight lines bro all right so without further ado the pompano rig so you're going to grab your monofilament i'm using a 15 pound monofilament just for an example and you're going to fold over the line to make a circle like this you take these two ends here and you start kind of twisting them [Music] about three times and then through this opening you pull the bottom part of the loop through put in your teeth and pull and there's your first dropper loop you're going to move down about 10 inches to a foot depending on how far you want your drop of loops apart and you do the same thing you're gonna make the loop and then you're gonna twist three times i'm gonna pull this bottom loop through bite down pull it tight there's your second dropper loop next you're going to put your bead float and hook on i like to pinch the end of it so it's easier for me to get everything on you put your bead on there's many different colored beads i have an orange one and then you put your float on slide it right on and for the hook i'll put it through the eye and then i'll loop the line underneath the hook and then bring it over the barb part of the hook and then pull it tight there's multiple ways of doing this differently this is how i do it that's the hook for your first dropper loop then you just repeat the process pinch bead float hook voila so there are your hooks for your pompano rig on the hooks i put four inch gulp alive mullets then towards the bottom of the rig i'll cut it off the spool and i'll put my weight clip i'm using a lot of hardware for this rig some people just like to tie their weights on i like having a clip just in case i want to switch between weights i'm going to do a clinch knot on this weight clip make sure your knots are tight and you have a good connection and clip off your tags oftentimes i use a two ounce pyramid weight sometimes a one ounce sometimes a three ounce it's all relevant to where you're fishing the current the wind always be prepared with multiple weight sizes then at the top of your rig or my rig i like to put a barrel swivel the swivel helps from tangle prevention again i'm going to just tie a clinch knot if you don't know how to tie a clinch knot it's an easy google search it's a very easy common knot and it's a very tight connection and there you have it the pompano rig also known as the high low rig and probably a ton of other names

up your soft bait rod first we'll start by tying your leader on so I've got some 20 pound fluorocarbon here and some ten pound braid we're going to double over that fluorocarbon make a loop run that braid up through the loop pull out about ten centimeters or so I'm going to hold that loop in that hand and then wrap the braid around there one two three four five six times hold on to that end wrap it back up six times get back through my loop that I made hold both lines tease it up tight take the main line pull it up tight I'm going to trim our tags off in term that cleric a band tag nice and close there you go okay so we just showed you how to tie your leader on to your braid they're now going to show you how to tie your jig head on cheerleader as you run about two arm spins our leader so I got plenty protection against the rocks and all the rest but now going to tie on my light bulbs you get so again I just use the Union op for this make a loop back through the middle five times three four five times fill it up nice and tight from the takeoff what to leave about half a centimeter attack or so then we're going to rig up my favorite z-man new penny pedals Ebates so basically just poke it through the head feed it around bring it back out through the back of the bait bring that up onto that head that's pretty much good to go normally I'd run a bead of secret sauce through the belly flap there but I don't get my hands dirty at the moment now you might have noticed that I didn't tie a loop knot and thus I use the Union off I did this because the loop knot does allow the lure to some of it more freely but it does lower the breaking strain your fluorocarbon quite a lot whereas the Union doesn't", "HMAEwPMuYlo": "okay so got some nice little hot sauce sir oh you oh I thought

everybody donate damn it will all be happy let's see who ball has spoken now now you must get", "WdelztMz8CE": "[Music] so my name's captain billy pettigrew uh true florida cracker born and raised daytona lived in ormond most of my life live in port orange now now i'm gonna teach you a trick so this is called the bsr billy's special rig this is what you do on rainy days and you're tinkering so everybody's seeing the gulp shrimp everybody throws the gulp shrimp right or has or whatever now a lot of people what they'll do is so they can cast it further they take the tail and bite it off you don't need to do that now what you need for a three inch gulp shrimp is a three ought ewg hook so you're gonna take this bait get it to where it just goes in you're gonna come right out i'm going to take that hook everybody can see what i'm doing all right come out and then you're going to push it through and you're going to rotate so it sits like this see how that bait's sitting right now it's not completely hooked up but it's sitting right there all right and then you can see where this bait lays on the hook and you're gonna come back through and get it on there so you're fishing and it's high tide well i can you can use as a high tide low tide it doesn't matter this bait right here with it being weedless you see the fish in the grass well guess what throw it right in the grass so the reason i do this and like i said rainy days can't really fish i tinker i've made homemade cut bait out of artificial don't believe me ask jimmy jimmy britton knows all about my homemade art a bit artificial bait that was cut yeah took a big swim bait cut it put a hole in it gooped it up with some uh what was it see it was some type of sauce and marin yeah it even took a red marker and highlighted the area i cut so it looked like blood yeah welcome to finicky fishing tampa i'm gonna figure something out this bait if you ever look at a bait most of the baits in the water all their weights in their head well same with a lot of artificial baits especially gulp so by hooking it like this it's like throwing a dart so when you cast it all the way is in the front and it's pushing away from you so it's not like it's fighting it it's literally going that way and it's pulling your line with it leaving the tail on it allows it to swim naturally as a gulp can be it's i mean true shrimp they kind of hop in whatever this will hit the water and it'll actually try to swim away from you with the current so it'll swim down and then when you hop it it'll hop up and then it'll do it again it'll glide right back down everybody's seen the video of the doa shrimp where it hits the water and it glides down well the problem with the doa shrimp is you gotta hook it in the head well if you're fishing with the current coming at you it makes more sense but if you're fishing with the current going away from you a shrimp doesn't fight the current it normally goes with the current i'm not saying it won't try to fight the current but natural bait again it goes with the current so being able to hook your gold shrimp like this it'll actually make it look natural swimming with the current away from you now i will say this you can do the exact same trick on a doa shrimp a lot harder to rig because you got a lot less plastic in the tail to work with all right all right so that's the basic beautiful day perfect scenario now if y'all like me i don't work unless it's blowing 100 mile an hour cloudy rainy windy like i've got a rule in my boat there's two four-letter words i don't use r-a-i-n and w-i-n-d all other four-letter words are fair game but if you get those days where it is cloudy rainy windy my three go-to baits are swim bait with an underspin all right it's called the flashy swimmer owner makes it and they make these anywhere from a one knot hook to uh i believe they go up to a seven on on the beast but i normally fish three four or five this is a five ott which i'll put on a five or four to five inch bait three ot three inch bait kind of see where i'm at with that four ought four inch bait and the other thing you can do is they also make it you know silver and then they got gold on cloudy days i like gold i'm a gold guy problem is they don't make gold and willow leaf that you can buy on this bait i'm not saying you can't buy gold willow leafs and swap it out because that's what i do so i'll take this one and i'll take the same size gold little willow leaf and swap it out so i'll put a gold one on instead of a silver now if the water's dingy but it's sunny then i'll stick to silver but on cloudy days i like gold you're going to see this here shortly here's another bait a lot of people don't throw chatter bait chatter bait on a nasty day works wonders pretty weedless bounce it off of oyster bars brown grass can use it anywhere from mosquito lagoon to jacksonville over on the west coast and steen hatchy over in crystal river and and everything works in louisiana so we just don't even worry about that the color selection i try to stick natural um this is just one i actually happen to have i kind of go to like a pen fish or a mullet pattern is normally what i go with but i'm going to always have that gold blade don't know what it is about redfish and gold they like it and if gold doesn't work a black spoon will it's one of those that you can actually see this thing's been chewed up quite a bit i like to use this if they're shying away from gold because a lot of people do throw gold black is not another color to be afraid of to throw even throwing a black solid topwater don't be afraid to do it it'll work so that's my kind of cloudy water go ahead there sir you put swivels on yes i do 100 i hate lime twist i hate when knots but i will put the smallest swivel i can find to put on my spoon i don't want a big spoon swivel that big on top of my spoon it just doesn't look natural you know it's the smaller the better if i can find a smaller swivel than what i got on here now i will put it on there you don't need a 300 pound swivel you need a 20 pound swivel 10 pound swivel you know because i mean you got to realize that your drag on your reel if it's a 28 pound dragon you got it locked it's still going to take 28 pounds of pressure to break something so if that's the case and you keep your drag locked then you might want to go to a 30 pound swivel because then you can't break the swivel with the drag anybody got questions about anything because i can ramble on forever what size flashy swimmer three or five just overall three or five because people that throw like um saltwater assassins three out works great on them now when you get to the dye dappers then you go to the five you know just kind of it just depends on where you're at with the sides of your it um i don't let water temp really control what i switch the size of the bait i let the size of the bait that i see control on what i switch so i mean water temp can be 50 degrees but all the bait in the water is that big well guess what they're eating they're eating bait that big i mean now this time of year on average most of the bait's this big on average so you want to throw the smaller stuff and you watch it you know as it grows um and i'll push it a little bit like if there's all i see is something like this then i might go up a size just to see if they're going to react to a different because it's something different that sticks out but i'm not going to go to this and then throw a bait that's like this it's just no i mean i might go up a couple sizes just so it sticks out a little bit more um that's why i throw like the bone or like the sea trout because it kind of blends in a little bit but it's a little bit bigger on the juniors than what the beta this time here i mean they got the the pup which i've got and i like throwing it but i like the junior on the spook is heavy enough that i can throw quite a ways especially on a spinning rod so he asks if i'm fishing docks if i'm skipping docks for redfish i go to a jig head jig head's easier to control underneath the dock because i can skip it a lot easier it gives it a little more surface for the bait to allow it to slide underneath and in the water a little better than the weighted hook will i throw a weighted hook yes i prefer a jig head around box

just makes it so good [Applause] mm-hmm [Applause] meat's tender this one here is a more familiar dish for me i used to make it a lot when i was on a diet but instead of red meat it was chicken the meat is really tender it's literally melting my mouth [Applause] so okay let's try the spring rolls vegetable spring rolls mm-hmm well i tasted ginger the ginger is very very strong that [Applause] so

easier [Applause] i need one of those like small plates nice [Applause] oh yeah i taste the celery you could have this black pepper chicken um steak on like a diet date it'll be pretty healthy minus the sauce i don't know what they put in the sauce but you guys could literally eat anything you want as long as you're counting calories you could eat like you could eat anything you get ice cream you

could be counting your calories and then you could you could be like have room to eat a burger like i i need 30 grams of carbs i need maybe like 20 grams protein is never like you should never over um under count protein like you could have as much protein as you want you're just gonna piss dress out whatever your body can't handle anymore so like it's not really like a big deal you're more

picked up some Berkeley golf minnows where do these black shat black shadows I saw a video on this I think Richard gene did a video on this a while back and we're finally getting to post spawn mode up here in northern Wisconsin northern Minnesota so I figured you know what let's put these on one of my search baits and let's try to catch some proppy so that's the goal today catch a bunch of crappie on some gulp Berkeley called minnows if they work out I'll link them below and you can check them out for yourself they don't work out I'll still link them below and you can see how badly that they suck ok let's get going you twelve feet of water and these fish are just they're mixed in between the cabbage or they're suspended right off the cabbage so this should be fun in a troll forum oh there's a fish and that's a bass oh no it's a giant crappie yes Julian crappie not giant I like it's a good crappie though hey it's a darn good crappie buddy gotta love these postponed fish what is that eleven and a half baby boom I'm gonna bring a about a half half dozen home today I think half dozen is a solid meal no more no more in six well if I keep finding them here I'm gonna start casting with the with the beetle spend let's see if we can catch another one like that get a nice school of eleven twelve inch crappie like that that's a good day there's another one okay we're gonna start casting know this might be a bass this this thing is fighting pretty hard [Music] see there a bass sure it's a big crappie oh it's a bass yeah well beetle spins doing it today cloud cover a little bit of chop of course good old look at Lake Fork guy with the spinner bait right that's always what he recommends on some days like this it's a good dude I like his videos baby bass that's a sad excuse for a bait right there that's for sure it's not in good shape oh I got a fish on hit it right on the drop what is that well what's a crappie oh you just threw my minnow though it's a good one yes that's a solid crappie right there I wouldn't mind a mess Foley's ten and three quarters I wouldn't mind a mess full of these ten and three quarters right there and three-quarter 11 inch those are solid fish you threw my minnow though and it's sunk you know what let's try casting out they might be stacked up right here well there's a fish regular jig side and it's a bass [Music] a little bass just a little guy are you kidding me we got a fish on this one again oh it's a baby crappie baby crappie you hit it on the drop I wasn't even moving this thing got a fish on this one now feels like it wow that's a giant sunfish you know what you guys think there's a green sunfish they got the green stuff on their mouth I'm only keeping crappie today though thought we could keep that but crop is what I want there's a fish he hit it as I slowed down took my foot off the I don't know what this is it's another big big sunfish man these are let's drop the rod in the lake there's some fat sunfish it almost looks like they haven't even spawned out maybe it's definitely the spinner bait that's key today I'm not sure how well these would work under a bobber I'm sure we can try it I just don't want to right now because that means I have to tie on a bobber probably won't be too hard it's I already got a jig but it's crop you're in deeper water which means I got to set up a slip bobber and that means I have to retie I'm too lazy no thanks sorry oh that's a that's a good fish whatever that is Oh cuz it's a good crappie that's a good problem Wow there's another one eleven ten eleven inch right here yeah try to lip them there we go it's another solid crappie right there that's why I didn't want to leave spinnerbait does it again what is he just shy of 11 that's three for the Live Well number three all right so I'm gonna try casting cuz he looked like he was right in this section of water there he is there's another one yep there's another crappie he's not as big hmm he's 10 I'll keep him I don't think he is though there they are they're pushed back into the bay but they're still in deeper water I don't think he's ten well he's just shy nineteen three-quarter I'm gonna I'm gonna throw him back just shy but that is where they are all right troll them till you find them and then Castille yeah so you're alive well so try not to fall off your boat Jesus what was in that Red Bull not a fish yes it is feels like another crappie to stuff not fighting like a bass because it's another crappie just well I can think I can think I can think I can safely say this Berkley Gulp minnow does the job you want to try it out he's uh he's just shy I believe there's no yeah he's nine and a quarter still nice catch nice fish there's no size limit on this lake but ten inch fish it's a good sized fillet it's kind of what I want to go after right now so just keep casting - this looks like they're just they're just pushed right off this edge of its five in these lily pads - this way I thought that was another one because that is another one yeah Wow I just cast right on top of these guys I don't know he let go if it was one he wasn't very big this is like a five foot flat lily pads in the hell lily pads and it's kind of a gravel type bottom definitely spawning there right I could see beds cuz it's clear water there's a fish man they're just hammering it is that out what is that it's another crappie this guy's smaller though he's only about a 7 8 inch fish got to get back to the bigger ones and it looks like these fish are just pushed right off this this edge of the where they were spawning last time I was fishing this they were pushed way up to point and I'm thinking because I fished it and it was really really windy and so it was kind of like a front system moving through even though we got a colder colder day today I think the the wind & Technik I think it's storm that night if I remember right and they push these fish further out the point towards safety towards deeper water there's a fish there we go oh that's a good fish that's a good crappie yup I'm thinking this is their 10 inch or Plus that we're looking for I'd say so guess in ten and a half ten and three quarters for number four in the lab well alright we are going straight chesty I want to save camera life for my outro and it looks like I have low battery so all you're gonna get is this view sorry no b-roll it's alright two more fish and I'll complete my challenge my my goal I don't know what you want to call it I like heaven having goals on these videos there's a fish there's another crappie he's not very big that's only Bonin 8 he's only about an 8 inch fish I do go out and fish by the way that I don't know why why am I talking to you you're not on I do go on fish just for the heck of it by the way and not have challengers their goals without filming theirs there he is that feels like a good one that feels like a really good one hopefully it's a crappie and not a bass it is a crappie there we go I'm thinking this is number five in the live well you know what I probably should let you see what the heck I'm I'm doing here so that is hot you see tail he's about a ten and a half I'd say going into Live Well number five number five in the live well alright five and the live well one more to get and we'll have a have a nice meal nice crappie lunch maybe dinner it's 12:30 it's this is midday this is a midday bite right now that's insane I'm thinking the cloud cover is definitely helping right now the fact that it's so dang cloudy but they are loving the spinnerbait action a little old beetle spin there's one that's a good one too that might be number six feels like him I'm thinking so we can get them in the boat here yes I should have that running hold on folks you stay on and you don't flop out of the boat stay stay oh okay we're on ooh I'm thinking this is number six here if I can get them off the hook easy easy that's number six number six what is this guy let's measure him up measure him up for you Oh just just shy of eleven ten and 7/8 that's gonna wrap it up it's gonna wrap it up we should there we go that's gonna wrap it up Berkley Gulp minnows I'll link them below you check those out solid six crappie for the day didn't have a lunch with all these filets and yeah check them out seemed to work mid they bite probably throw on a

the oh there's a fish that's a tiny guy holy smokes three fish in the boat for the Berkley Gulp I apologize ladies and gentlemen either not very big fish not very fun to catch either I can see bigger marks on the sonar by bigger marks if you saw my 2-d 2-d sonar video I mean there's darker rip on this 2d sonar it's darker red the darker red is the bigger fish or more solid structure that the sonar bouncing off of I got a fish on - I think I still got him yeah I do oh crap forgot forgot already a while fix it in the editing room I might have to do a white bass video actually in the trout fishing video that you guys suggested alright I asked which other species you guys like me chasing and one of the suggestions is white bass so I do have a couple I got a swimbait tied on and a couple fluke set up so I don't know see I can see them on the sonar and they look like decent fish it's just the good ones aren't biting oh my goodness well they took it that's kind of a problem when you're fishing without bait except two maybe maybe in Canada if you're in far northern Canada you can you can use bear let head jigs to catch fish but not here what does this thing oh there is a fish on there I believe that's number six [Music] mm I got a full 35 seconds left 35 seconds left so you can get it done I don't think I'm gonna get to 10 fish but there's a fish a little bit bigger eight-and-a-half maybe maybe we can slowly drift into some bigger schools of fish that would be nice eight and a half ten and a half seventeen and a half oops I think I have a fish on there and my stupid I do have a fish on my stupid lines wrapped around my rod tip oh okay that's a little bit better I want to measure him real quick I know it's not a he's he's probably eight and a half maybe again yeah he's just shy nine what is my line keep getting wrapped around the rod tip here what time hope we're done we're done I was about four seconds over I caught it in time but I was four seconds over on that okay so we're gonna do live minnows now same let head jig head set up step live minutes got the trusty little Lindy minnow tamer here oh look at all those guys we're go over them we're

us to get this over with as you go back to bed Babel going get one all right last week she weighed in it 160 2.3 and today she weighs in at one 62.8 that she went up a half a pound hey you thought a lot worse than that all right so last week I waited to 56.5 and today my way in at 250 4.4 told you yesterday now lost weight all right she's going back to bed good idea and I am going to get ready to leave here in a minute or two and head to schools where it's up if the other heard of a bit before but it's see you at the pole rally it's worth teenagers getting around the flagpole before school and they pray I think you pray for school their friend's you know whatever but they get around the circle and then the most times the circles are more like a crowd because there's so many of which is awesome to see so and then from there I'll go to work a little while and then I'm coming home early today okay okay well I'm on my way home I didn't vlog the see the poor ollie cuz I forgot I forgot to ever gonna take my slip to the flagpole I did my vehicle and I didn't remember until I got back to my car but there was over 60 students parents teachers at the five bolt and at the high school and then there was about over 25 middle school of the teachers parents and students so those are pretty good turnout i feels more middle school last year let's pray good turnout and when I wasn't praying when I wasn't actually speaking every once awhile to look up because people were getting off the bus this should be up bus and they be looking all around like what are they doing so I'm hoping that the students will be able to tell their friends and be boned ups hello friends what they were doing and why they were going so okay oh now let's see i'm tired i am not used to waking up at 5am anymore and that's for sure and i am tired it's only ten minutes after two whoo hey everybody it's um weigh-in wednesday and today we are going to do a sweet and sour slow cooker flank steak now it's about ingredients takes off proximally about 12 about 20 minutes preparation and cooking time is an all day thing but if that's why it's in a slow cooker so first thing we're going to start off with is we're just going to take three pounds a flying snake and I'm just going to throw it in a crock-pot you can see I cut it all off and I'll eat it all nice and even we're going to put that at the bottom of a crock pot and then the next thing we're going to do is we are going to take two garlic grooves and like I say we use fresh garlic it's better for you and it's fresh see I'll just use that cup drb1 all right then after we do that then what we're going to do is we're going to chop up some onions I'm going to use my Pampered Chef shop now i get my frustration out because when I'm aggravated if I chop um you know because you know George can get on my nerves I know but it's true but he doesn't get on my nerves that much this weight watchers meals actually is called sweet and sour slow cooker flank steak and no you didn't say it you said its way in Wednesday you say we watch your meal I'm sorry and then we're going to take some mushrooms now even as our cut up some I'm just going to chop them up some more just to make what you want to do is you're going to choose again just throw that in there you see that right they did see what I just didn't know okay I'll show them but apparently a good so I guess it comes with this reputation so and then what we're going to do is we're going to add 24 ounces of chili sauce oops I guess I should've checked to see so that would have been the whole thing of chili sauce I'm just gon keep that over like that for a couple minutes and then we're going to do a half a cup of fat-free chicken broth add that Indiana I think want to do is stir this up a little bit get all of it kind of mix together some this smells good already don't you think about it does it's not even cooked yet so I can't wait for this and then we're going to do 2 tablespoons of tomato paste I thought I'd opened it but apparently I did try to do some of the prep work before we start it so River those lectricity won't have to worry about being hands off you got that thing good right two tablespoons of tomato paste and then we're going to do one fourth cup of red wine I don't like wine it stinks and this one's like really bitter so you wouldn't want to make it isn't even a sweet wine my girlfriend Gail she um she has a lot of alcohol or have and I didn't want to go in the liquor store and purchase any wine so I called her and I said do you have any do you have any wine and she just laughed because you know she has least 100 bottles of wine so she told me she said this is not drinking wine this is very bitter and sweet and my neighbor because I didn't have a corkscrew took a next door to have them open it for me which they thought was hilarious they requested BYO with had a bottle of wine and so she had to have a drink and I told her my girlfriend said so she didn't believe her and she's a wine drinker so just took big gulp of it and just spit it out in the sink it was most nastiest line ever so you know tried to warn her toe all right and it also calls for a teaspoon of salt but like we've said in previous ones I don't I'm going to use the salt that's already in the food so just going to skip that all together but we will put it in the recipe when we toast it and put some pepper in it and then what we're going to do is use a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar is that what it's called yes add fat where's the letter and then we're going to do a tablespoon of brown sugar and then like I said I've already put the steak at the bottom of it we're going to mix this all up and then we're just going to cook it all day long but I think it's about six hours you're going to want to cook this and that's all it is very simple recipe to do it value points or nine points as you can see it's pretty easy to make of course it is a higher point than what I normally do so if you're going to do potatoes you're going to want to do very little potatoes I probably do more vegetables with this or even on put it on top of a salad which would be a lot better but you have to choose what you like to do I am going to make potatoes for my guys because they like their potatoes so that is it George will post it on all of the ingredients and how to do it and give me some suggestions what you'd like to see next so by the way I am going to make an apple pie for those people out there that then asking about the apple pie I'm going to make it good sorry see ya okay so this will get person with all the ingredients and all this of the bomb and I think that is it all right number six hours so this would be a good meal if you have something planned and you can't get back there you throw in slow cooker in the morning that will be ready for your dinner time alrighty dr. L later now for the taste test let's see how this case it's really really good just let you know i did i just did before that but i didn't i didn't vlog fail I didn't have a camera so I've tasted that already it's really really good it's nine points but it's definitely were there probably one of the best meals are the way watching knows we've had it's a must guys miss try gotta try it what's enough with know what the chicken the one meal June I can't remember right now but yes no no p chicken but we don't think we didn't vlog that we said we'd had it but his head it was a sound anyway that's good so but here let me tell you another failed she was trying to go cheap so she got this great value yellow how many she must start was corn and it wasn't I don't know what it was but I didn't have any but my son and cherry tastes it and it was nasty morn that's what happens when you don't really I do make mistakes once and vodka yeah she does oh so anyhoo revealed um don't buy this it is nasty okay that is it for today hope you guys had a great day and us anything I'm not going to lose next week either cuz you know we're going to California so I mean but I ate probably like she did and I

night hope you guys had a great day to see", "NGaR8yi7E2Q": "[Music] well good morning good afternoon good evening wherever you are today's video is just about as much of a mystery for me as it is for you david rapp he was supposed to come out and meet me here and i was supposed to try to get him on his first halibut today but last night he ate some bad sushi and came down with the stomach flu at 3 30 in the morning it's been throwing up ever since so now i'm not really sure what i'm gonna do i heard there might be a herring spawn and i also heard that there might be some secret fish out here in the bay but the plan is to catch a keeper halibut i'm watching from a different spot today and we're going to target two areas one in san francisco and one across the bay the rig today is very similar to what it was yesterday but today i added a flasher and i was watching my old halibut videos last night and how did i catch those big ones before i had a flasher on so that's what it is a chartreuse this looks like a six and a half inch flasher that's going to spin in the water while i have the herring on this sliding snail knot so with the sliding snail knot you've got the hook here on top and you got the stinger hook on the bottom that's the treble hook so you hook the bait through the nose there and you can slide it all the way up or you can slide it all the way down and what that does is it allows you to bend the bait a little bit so it spins and you can bend it to the right rotation that you like and i i'm thinking salmon like it fast like a like a like a drill like a drill bit halibut they don't like it as fast if you guys ever get a boat or if you kayak or you go out on the water even if you're doing shore fishing it helps a ton if you have friends who do the same i just got word from carlos thank you man uh that there are herring where i'm headed now so instead of wasting any time here i'm going to reel up and go over there before the herring go away because these herring man they'll spawn and they'll disappear and they won't be back so i'm gonna go over there now i've got two cast nets it's gonna be fun to try let's go well i made it but i'm not sure i don't know it doesn't look like anything's going on right now although it looks like something may have just happened because a lot of birds out there all right i don't see anything going on right here right now so instead of just waiting around i'm gonna throw on the bait and troll around here and i'm gonna keep a close eye on shore just in case something pops off oh there's something on the bottom here let's see if it takes the bait bouncing that's what you want to see a little bounce bounce here bounce bounce there i don't like it here it's too shallow it's only four feet there's a spot close by like look at this it's just got seaweed and crap all over it there's a spot close by where i caught three fish yesterday so i'm gonna go over there and i'm gonna come back to this area and look for those herring a little bit later on but yeah i mean come on can't fish like this just crap all over the hooks let's get out of here all right new spot we'll go back to the other one a little bit later this is where i caught a couple fish yesterday oh play with me playing with me weight got caught in this in the mud hopefully it happens today except with a couple keepers instead of three shakers oh fish on big fish yo whoa that's a big fish dude hey this could be something special bro i'm gonna chase it down before i get spooled it's gonna be a herring or something look at that he just took off man oh i gotta actually chase the fish down right now what the hell is this thing okay dude this got to be a ray or something man oh it's a seal i hooked a seal geez damn it i think that's what it is i see him way out there damn it i hit the seal seriously unless it's a fish i don't know it's coming in oh man i'm pulling him in like a fish dude dude that was crazy y'all see that damn that's a good presentation right there i think this rig is done for hope i don't lose my my uh my flasher shoot y'all ever hooked a seal trolling for halibut jeez i see him he's got my flasher in his mouth just holding my thumb on the spool and this 20-pound test this will handle a big fish i know you guys didn't want to see me catch a freaking seal come on maybe i could bring him to the boat catch and cook seal that'll be fun he's tired i wonder if he'll let me help him take it out come on man i'll help you dude come here come here come here all right let's see if i can help him come on up come on up dude oh come on up bro come on up dude so tired right now this freaking seal dude okay come here and they gotta breathe too you know oh yeah yeah what am i gonna do now i'm just gonna cut it what can i do at least i won't lose my flasher you know they say if a fish gets his mouth stuck in a hook and it's gill gut hooked just cut the line and eventually that'll rust so i'm hoping that that's what's going to happen there too damn man was not expecting to get hooked by a seal and lose a rig that took a good 25 minutes to unhook from the seal and tie a new rig oh but that doesn't happen again halibut time now man i feel like at the beginning of a season either salmon season or halibut season nobody's really tuned in on where the halibut are or the salmon or whatever it is so everyone's just scattered around and then as the season goes on information gets out and all the fishermen finally find the spot and they all get together but right now it's like boats here both there both boats all around nobody's really congested in one area hoping i could be the one to find them all look my motor is off and look how fast we're drifting that's the old naval shipyard at hunters point in san francisco currents are ripping around this corner here a lot of old nuclear tests done at this site a lot of nuclear waste dumped in the bay here in the 50s 60s back then so that's why a lot of people are iffy about eating fish from the bay i think it's gotten a lot better but i don't know but a lot of these halibut are migratory anyway so they're not in the bay they don't live here they just come in here to breed and then go back out i don't know i don't know i'm still down to eat them though man i'm trying to think what have you guys gained from this video what have you learned anything probably not huh not really well here let me at least try to give you some kind of information something you can use for the future if you want to throw a cast net you take your rope here you got your cast net this is a four foot radius casting so it's eight foot diameter eight feet wide you start doing coils right just small loops when you get to the ring here you do another coil just as if you were doing it the same now i got about let's see what that is about three feet of net here and you do one grab it there grab with your fingers another one grab it with your fingers and for me i like three now the secret to this when you cast it you don't just throw it with your right hand i mean it'll probably work with these smaller nets and i haven't been doing it too much honestly myself either but this is what works for me when you cast it out with your left hand here you swing it around and that way you form a big loop with your net so this is how it should look cast it um kind of kind of like that here's another little tip if you do come out cast netting bring two of them at least because you might get one snagged and also bring a telescopic rod because if you do get snagged you might need this to fish it out and this extends to 12 12 feet i think but those are just my tips for cast netting either from shore or from a boat all right back to our original spot it's beautiful again it was a little bit windy but i've got a feeling this is the calm before the storm as they say i think the wind's going to start picking up in a little bit i got a three ounce weight now i still got a herring i put that flasher back on i'm gonna go back around the pier see if anybody's getting the herring with the cast nets if they are i might throw a sabiki out there try to reel something in and drift a live bait otherwise this is the plan until the end of the day here's the wind uh-oh oh man this picks up fast out here oh man i don't like that i better get back close to the boat launch or this is gonna be a hell of a ride back oh man i better go i just don't want to be stuck in the wind it's horrible out here when it's windy let's let's pack up man this is not not good i don't want to be out here when it's windy i'm going to beat the wind it's always a smart thing if you're in the bay and you have a small boat get back to the boat ramp or get back to the launch as soon as the wind starts to pick up i was about five six miles out from the boat launch you do not want to get stuck out here people die every year getting stuck out here on kayaks canoes and small boats especially little aluminum boats so you know it might look like a lake at one minute and then it's going to look like two foot white caps all over the place the next minute so just be careful out here you", "rUngm3hd1bQ": "[Music] alright here we are with Dez from vicious fish charters who's gonna show us about filleting a halibut okay first of all you want to have a sharp knife give a couple rubs on a whetstone rubs with the steel clean the knife off kind of scrape some of the lice away and I do make a couple little puncture holes about an inch and a half long on the tail one right there one right there and those are gonna be your finger holes for handling the fill it with okay we start up here right around the back of the head and you come down around the back of the head following the gill plate and once you clear the gill plate you get to the spin and you just follow you the lateral line which is this line right here you can faintly see it on the fish follow that all the way back to the tail like so nice a little clean and then you just take your knife and just basically like that but along against the spine gently pulling the flesh back as you go along like so and like that lifting the flash as you're going running the life along the backbone and get to the end like this run right through the skin like so I know when you're Philippine always go from the forward to back never go like this it's always from the head to the tail with the knife like that finger hole here snip that off there's your fella nice and clean and boneless find a nice clean to be able to put it on now for the lower part you want to start somewhere right around here this this area here is prone for worms and and whatnot so you want to kind of cut right around there to where the fins start here just form a the same shape as a gill but back around the belly cavity like so and then again start up here pressing the knife against the spine coming all the way to the back and again lifting the flesh up as you go all the way to the back and then this little bit of belly cavity here you just want to trim that away because in the belly cavity there's a lot of worms and stuff you can find in halibut so that was from the belly cavity right there so this is where these little things live and you want to cut that away all the way to the back again use your finger hole and there's your bottom part just like so she's a beauty she's a beauty thanks Dez that's a great Lhasa oh and we can't forget about oh yeah all right you got to do the cheek so if you put your hand on the top of the halibut and you can feel where it's hard and where it's soft so I usually start up about here just kind of guide your knife around - it doesn't cut and then turn it back out following the shape of the skull going around up around the eye socket so what you're doing is you're holding the knife like this and just going like pivot the knife over and just basically right around like that so nice back in that go right around to the back of the eye socket around like so filling it up off trim some of the stuff and then instead of using your knife to take the skin off this skin on the cheeks just peels right off just like so and there's your cheek meat right there trim a little bit of the blood off and there's your cheek good eating all right that's awesome thanks dad happy all deficient

your dog from eating too fast and getting sick before we begin for the best puppy training tips and tricks subscribe to my channel and be sure to hit the bell to stay notified when I post new content each week Michelle here with how to train a dream dog and the creator of 30 days to puppy perfection the online puppy training program where you can train your puppy from the comfort of home dogs that gulp their food without even chewing are more likely to throw up as soon as they're done eating they take in tons of extra air and they gulp their food which leads to poor digestion extra gas and the potential for bloat in dogs the kind of blow time talking about involves your dog's stomach in which it flips and requires surgery to get it fixed otherwise they could die I use a variety of toys and games to get my dog's to eat much slower first up the slow Bowl feeder it's designed with different sections to keep the food from being super easy to golf up and really makes it harder for your dog to try to grab mouths on the food there are a different size bowl to accommodate small portions and large portions of food number two you can spring for a puzzle feeder it's similar to the slow bowler but just it's a little more fun add it in for your pups because of all the nooks and crannies they have to snip through two grab the kibble number three using canine enrichment activities like a busy box is another great way to keep your cut from ravenously eating as you can see your pup pretty big push in paw at the towels until they find their food this will definitely make it take longer for your dog to eat a meal number four next up treat dispensing toys like the star mark wobbler these kinds of engagement toys are great for speedy eaters they get to have some fun while working for their meal number five if you've seen any of my dog training videos you'll know I have soul love to use mealtime is training time since each one of those pieces of kibble can be an opportunity to reward your dog for the right behavior you could use half their meal for training and feed the other half in one of the other toys or enrichment games I mentioned in this video number six portioning out their meals in the smaller amount can also help stronger dog feeding down don't use the whole meal all at once but do decide the meal up in feed in little portions instead of all at once one portion at a time allows your dog the opportunity to digest their foods more naturally number seven some dogs do much better when their food has been soaked in water put your kibble in their slow boil Peter add water and wait till it becomes a little mushy then let them eat it this is also a great way to make sure your dog gets enough water during the day as well number eight you can add a weighted ball to your dog's food this helps them slow down eating because they have to work around the ball to get at the kibble I'd use a pool ball or a hard ball such as a lacrosse ball don't use a tennis ball they're gonna love it and want to play catch or fetch number nine use the scatter technique and scatter your pups food all across the floor this allows them to use their nose to find each piece of kibble and they're going to eat it much slower number ten last but not least you could hide your dog's food all around the house and hurry finance he kind of scavenger hunting dogs love the search percent so why not let them play a fun game while searching for their meal hide a couple of pieces or kibble in different rooms or different spots all throughout the house or your entire home alright in the comments below tell me which one of these techniques are you going to try first to help slow down your dog's eating and if you're looking for more information on teaching your dog new skills or

special today and we're getting ready for spring slash we're gonna be drinking it throughout all summer uh it's one of karen's favorite drinks and honestly it's my one of my favorites you don't even like these kind of drinks like he does but not really he doesn't order them but this one drink that we're about to show you guys how to make is one of our favorites and we decided to find the recipe and make it and you're going to die when i tell you how we found the recipe but you guys may know the drink already super simple it's super delicious so today we're going to show you guys how to make a spicy pepino margarita in other words a spicy cucumber margarita yes but this is not just your typical cucumber with a jalapeno and sweet and sour this is like fresh ingredients a twist with some chamois and tajin we also have serranos going in there everything's fresh it is so delicious and this is like like i said one of my favorite drinks i have like if i ever go to a restaurant i always look at the drink menu and i always look for pepino margaritas and i always ask what's in there because not everyone makes it the same except this one restaurant so we're kind of replicating javier's filipino margaritas if you guys live in los angeles i believe they're in la and a couple other places yeah there's a restaurant they definitely expanded yeah there's a restaurant called javier's and they have the best what i'm telling you guys the best cucumber margaritas ever yeah they're a little pricey in my opinion but oh but why pay that when you can just exactly use 18 to 20 and just get all the ingredients actually it's probably a little more than that because you gotta buy the tequila and you gotta buy the you know but but there's always beauty in making your own drinks as well especially when you can nail down the recipe so let me tell you guys real quick the story how we found the recipe it's not online anywhere they just tell you like the basics and that's it uh miley my assistant paul have yours and what's she saying she was like hi um you know i'm going through my birthday and i want to try one of your guys drink it's a cucumber one but i'm actually allergic to some stuff so i want to know what you guys put in there every ingredient they told her the whole ingredient list but before they did they were like what are you allergic to she's like well agave and like sweeteners and they're like oh yeah well we do put a guy that we can put this instead she's like well how do you make it and they gave her the exact ingredients and that's how we got the recipe it's gonna be a really good drink we'll get into the ingredients shortly remember to subscribe to i love salai's channel um if you're new to the channel we do cooking videos like this um quite often uh

thousand shopkins i am not proud i made mistakes listen i haven't been back since that video was like the next day i was like karen do you remember we filmed the video last night she was like i think so it was one of my favorite cooking i am not re-watching it live on youtube though forever so go check it out so like i said guys we're about to get started with today's video we're gonna go through the ingredients right now and before we do that we gotta as you guys know warm up with a little shot and as tradition you guys already know we take bota shots so you can pause the video do what you got to do go get you whatever you need to go get even the water who cares let's take a shot [Music] all right i can't do it there you go all right let's do this really quick as tradition says it's part of our contract i feel like i deserve like an ice drink tonight it's friday night um i've been putting in work a lot of work with content but also like myself which is more important i've been working out every single day almost i've been like oh my fitness grind and i'm so proud of myself because it takes a lot of uh discipline a lot of hard work a lot of dedication and i feel just so motivated these days you know ever since that you've you've been engaged there's just something about oh god there's just something about you here you go cheers guys we love you [Music] you guys ready for the ingredients let's go first thing you're going to need is some pepinos cucumbers we're going to use three of them next you're going to need some serranos some lime next we're going to need some agave next we're going to need this charm away from cholitas i'm going to be using mango and sabasa is going to be doing the original flavor and then next you guys already know we're going to be using what they call the two glasses really recommend having one of these on the side this is to measure all your ingredients this is great when measuring out like the agave or the shot and lastly a shaker trust me on the shaker oh my god i always forget the main ingredient you're going to need some tequila and today we are using the glasses reposado personally reposado tastes way better than blanco i don't like blanco tequila so reposado is where it's at oh and you're going to need ice too honestly if you want to make this drink and you don't drink you don't like tequila you can actually substitute it for your vodka because it's a dude for soda water for some squirt honestly you can do it however you want you know we just like a little bit of fun over here but do as you please remember when we first started these episodes we didn't cut on this board well now we cut on this board because it's already been used and honestly it gives it a little bit of character so i don't mind it anymore so what i'm going to do is actually cut up the lines means i was actually making our own drink because of the way that we're gonna be making it it's a little different yeah and karen doesn't share her spicy cucumber margarita not sure at all so we're gonna start cutting off the limes in half and pretty much you're gonna need two ounces of lime per drink go ahead and also cut up the serrano now serrano is optional but personally if you're gonna have a spicy margarita the spiciness isn't the tajin it's honestly having like a serrano jalapeno everything i do about like four slices i would say inside of my drink i'm gonna just do four it's up to you how many you want to do i'm gonna do the whole tree i'm so excited guys for this drink it's my favorite so next we're gonna cut the pepinos we're just gonna go ahead and do this into slices both of these isn't this like a thing to do it gives it more flavor they say um it is important that you leave the skin on there and i double check this i feel like everyone makes a little different but i guess for the flavor you need to leave the skin on there so we're just going to go ahead and cut it up nicely sick [ __ ] babe will you cut like a heat though yeah wait till you put your finger off but that's why you learn to cut in what culinary school you go to no i went to culinary i went to culinary class like uh what's a cooking class in high school cooking class yeah cooking class it's culinary isn't it i mean it wasn't culinary for me all we did was make snickerdoodles in monkey room okay guys so we don't have a little peeler but what you're gonna do now you're just gonna go ahead and cut this into little dices and the way i was taught in culinary class cooking class is to go i am so scared for your life right now dude curl your fingers in please you're scaring me holy chestos we're gonna go ahead and squeeze exactly two ounces of lime in here that's how much you need per drink two ounces two ounces wow these are really good limes i picked them myself oh that was exactly two limes two ounces no one lime no i just did oh yeah that's what i meant yeah cause i lie i like one i love lime are you okay thank you for always letting me be your co-host i know you can pick other people go ahead and drop how many serranos do you want i guess i'll do all those drop the serranos serranos drop the serranos i'm gonna go ahead and do four in mine and then now we're gonna go ahead and throw in cucumber this is all like al gusto however much you want you wanna show the camera yep we cut up a lot of puffiness we can just eat that right now actually yeah i love me some cabinets and now we're gonna go ahead and pour two shots into the drink wow sure i thought one shot was just hobota that's fine and then now we're gonna go ahead and add the agave now this is gonna really make it nice and sweet personally i've had it when they don't add enough agave and it's too bitter you can taste the lime but i like a good amount it swings it up yeah so i'm gonna go ahead and and it's flip it and do one ounce of agave and it's a natural sugar did you know that i don't know if it is no it is it's a raw natural agave a low oh a low glycemic oh that's the word i've ever said organic raw blue agave nectar you want one ounce as well sure baby now we're gonna go ahead and grab our ice throw it inside and then give it a good one two this is where it gets really fun i'm gonna put these pistols to use so with this drink our friend who's a bartender shout out to muslim kyo musa we love you and kyle love you too and i was like hey we tried muddling this drink we tried to do it in the blender what am i doing wrong and they said that the trick is to throw everything to the shaker and shake like and it breaks everything apart with our guns and i was like dang that's crazy because i'm used to muddling but i guess you don't muddle this drink that's what he said so everyone makes it different i'm going to go ahead and do it his way cause it's a little different yeah ready wearing a little shake on this let's do it everybody if you're following along let's shake together let's go ready one two three [Music] it's so cold [Music] dude we can be bartenders should they go like this honestly that's what don't do that how's everyone's night doing today yeah i'm drinking a sweat yeah where are you guys

cheers guys once again if you want take another shot if not watch us salute [Music] all right now one of the most important things for this video is we have to prepare our cup our glasses so we're going to need our chelitas chamoy and by the way when you're drinking chilita you're having a chili [Laughter] you're out you've been out we're gonna go ahead and add our drinks into these cups these

original vamaduta morindo you are yeah um they're super good and honestly there's natural flavors in this which i [ __ ] with heavy made out of real fruit and by the way they are like a small business based here in whittier shout outs everyone from whittier in that whole area over there so really real quick about whittier me being from norwalk and i think when i was in ninth grade but the saying was is the girls from whittier are a lot prettier yeah whatever well you didn't you didn't end up with one year did you no i did it another thing that i like about this chamois is that not only is it like super good but you know like when you use other chamois like and you put it on the cup and it gets runny this one's nice and consistent the consistency in this is really good and it's thick and

it's engineered to quench even the most diabolical thirst this monstrosity of soda originally introduced in 1988 has become a staple of the store only recently downsides because 7-eleven claims customers found the large container too hard to hold this soda lovers dream is interesting to say the least and by all accounts students love soda the US national library of medicine claims that over 65% of college students get their daily caffeine intake from the sugary beverage and that 95% had at least one soda in the past month so where does the double go play into all this is it an economical solution to your soda cravings we decided to investigate in terms of volume the double gulp is definitely a winner the provided container holds almost 5 cans of soda that's a nearly half gallon of volume in just one serving not only that but it comes at a fraction of the cost compared to the exorbitant prices vending-machine bottles and even a 12-pack of cans the double gulp is definitely the most frugal option even when compared to that milk from earlier the two are essentially equal in cost but what is consuming all of the soda mean first of all and just one serving you effectively consume almost a third of your daily recommended caloric intake not only that but by gulping down the nearly half gallon of soda you consume on average 146 grams of sugar which is the equivalent of eating over 40 Oreos by the way it's almost impossible to drink it down in one gulp I guess that's why it's called the double gulp considering it contains almost twice the human stomachs volume so while an incredibly cost-effective way to satisfy the common sugary soda craving it is apparent that a double gulp lifestyle is probably not a healthy one but hey we're not ones to judge you", "krPa_nhfEFo": "all right here we go welcome back ladies and gents another challenge video today this time we're gonna go slap sauce with the Berkeley power bait because it really wasn't a whole lot of scent on this Berkeley power bait verse live minnows today yes we're doing live minnow challenge today hopefully I've had better luck today then in some other days I've been out so we're gonna start off ten minutes challenge Berkeley power bait versa live minnow ooh I gotta get the minnows out here hold on hold on folks time out and there's our minnows live minnows in the water the trusty little Lindy minnow tamer comes in handy really does all right here we go so quarter ounce a quarter out I don't know why I call these quarter ounce jig heads these are 16 ounce jig heads 16 that's what they are it's a little bit cooler today like low 70s so hopefully these crappie are still I'm still active I guess you'd say I'd say I don't really know all right we're gonna spray this up with some slab sauce here nice and nice and juicy okay so you know the rules ten minutes on the clock ten minutes for each bait winner catches the most fish that's the winner and I was on a school of crappie hold on I gotta get back over to him I'm really hoping 10 plus inch crappie today fingers crossed it's been a while I feel holy smokes there's a big school of them down there look at that there they go thank you school actually there might be might be some brush oh yeah three two one go there's a fish maybe they are crappie oh they're just not big crappie that's not good jeez it's a giant school hold on to show you the school real quick come on look at that school that is an absolute giant school of fish but I think they're all Dinks that's just incredibly disappointing there's a better school please be a better school there he is Oh No did he get me halfway through slap sauce has won now - wow these are lethargic crappie there's no wind today and very little it's pretty much it's not quite glass coz there's some boats on the water but I don't know it was dead calm like this for whatever reason these crappie really slow down probably because it's a pressure system would make sense to crappie for the slab sauce I know I was watching Richard genes video live minnows in August live minnows in August seem to be like the key in Richard gene think SK hook city think crappie head TV D crappie I think those guys well D crop is actually he's a purist I think I saw one of his videos he likes the jig's hook city looks city one with the minnows I think I got a sea plane taking off it's great fantastic great audio appreciate you bud there's a pono just nip in the tail I don't know these challenges i/o usually only puts spray Schloss on one time in the ten minutes I I don't spray scent more than once in the 10 minute challenge but man they're just grabbing the tail of this thing I know I might have to do this again with like a shorter bait where we go for time 20 seconds Tsuboi slap sauce is not your day not your day-to-day bud man you've had you've had better days could be the bait I paired it with I don't really know three two one oh I'm gonna give it to you gonna give it to you probably shouldn't but I'm going to he's a dink of a crappie what in the world if we caught on here well that was was that three fish seemed better out of flaps off it's definitely not not slab sauces day seemed better alright we're gonna go this battery's dead so change batteries go to live minnows 10 minutes challenge continues okay here we go 10 minutes on the clock let me get a minnow baited up here I don't know a slab sauce that was a was not a good performance out of you today was it for fish that I counted one that was pretty done close to the clock alright 10 minutes so deed ready go there he is please be it's not a good one I'm through the minnow well one for the live I know tank again I always get my hopes up when they fight hard thinking it's gonna be a big fish stole it it's the son of a gun sneaky little sneaky little devils halfway through I just think these crappie don't want to feed right now this is a ridiculous I can see them on the sonar they just they don't want to eat anything there he is there's one oh my a real wield up for this guy crappie number two in the live minnows This Is It this is bad it's really bad folks this is terrible right now holy smokes - what is it six fish total and man these minnows I don't know it was bad serious number three they keep throwing my damn minnows this is gonna be close even if I do count that extra one with slap sauce it's gonna be really close honey minnows thirty seconds left I don't know if we're gonna do it 10:09 eight seven six oh four that's a game tie with an asterisk I don't know if I should count the slab sauce it was just a pitiful day that was just a bad challenge to overall I don't know these crappie else on well they've been like this the entire month there is lethargic and they suck basically it's awful it really is I don't know I don't know what to do really don't the big ones don't bite the little ones apparently don't bite anymore it's bad I can see him on the sonar they're not on the brush piles which is weird I guess I don't know they're pushed off the brush piles so you can't even like I could bounce around from brush pile to brush pile and try to find some big fish but I can't even do that anymore can't even do that well that's gonna end that challenge that was a bad challenge by the way it was bad what I get eight fish ate fish in 20 minutes

kind of forgot this because we were talking about you know some other things uh one um right after church me and so we have to kind of head out she actually has a doctor's appointment she's got a she's got a bad elbow i don't know i'm doing too much of my laundry or washing all them hunts and hands or hitting me with the frying pan because i've been a bad henry i don't know but uh she's not she's hurting right now so we gotta uh she's gotta zip out she's gonna be in flushing i think at 1 30. and two i would ask you to pray for a personal friend of mine who passed away this past week uh his name is greg eastaf he's actually the man that started the seminary that i graduated and uh it was roaring back in the 80s and 90s and early 2000s he had a heart attack and he retired from the ministry but when i wanted to get ordained i had asked him and i was the last guy that he ordained and me and so drove out to ohio and he passed away this past week he had a bad heart condition but god gave him you know another 10 years after his heart attack but his name was greg estep uh you know when you're in the ministry you always have favorite teachers and preachers he was very influential and you know on my kind of thought process in the doctrine and the ministry he was baptist and uh but he was a good man he was like a country guy he had that real kind of ohio twang you know but he knew his bible you know and and he he was a good teacher and you know um like i said i was the last i was the last guy that ordained he preached at my at my ordination and he was a he was a nice man so pray for greet uh mrs e step as she's you know grieving right now all right luke chapter 24. uh we're going to start at verse 36. all right all right amen it's good to be saved it's good to be in church luke chapter 24 we're going to start at verse 36 here uh and as they uh and as they thus fake jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them peace be unto you just to set up the context this is after jesus had risen he returned back to his disciples for a short period of time all right and he said peace on be unto you but they were terrified and frightened and supposed that they had seen a spirit and he said unto them why are you troubled and why do thoughts arise in your hearts behold my hands and my feet that is uh that it is i myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as he uh see me have and when he had thus spoken he showed them his hands and his feet so you know they questioned like you know hey what are you doing here you died no i risen you know with my head check out the holes in my hand and my feet all right and whenever spoken he showed them his hands and his feet and while uh they yet believed not for joy and wondered he said unto them have ye here any meat i'm hungry and they gave him a piece of royal fish and a honeycomb and he took it and did eat before them and he said unto them uh these are the words which i have spake unto you while i was yet with you that all things must be uh be fulfilled which were written in the law of moses and the prophets and the psalms concerning me then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures let's pray father again it is good to be saved and it's good to be in church lord we ask you to bless the message in jesus name amen now i've been on this theme here for uh three or four messages here on god's guide to good health all right and so far we've looked at mostly things that are not healthy for you we've looked at what causes bad health and sin causes bad health booze smoking overdoing it then we looked at sugar salt uh then we looked at the white stuff you know remember some of the white things are bad you know i mean listen pasta is good but you can't eat it every day okay you know and then there's some like good white things you know cauliflower i mean how many calories every day my wife likes cauliflower all right and then last week kind of an unusual message you've probably never heard of pastor preacher message about should we eat pigs uh reptiles and insects all right now pork i'll eat it a couple of times a year but after my own message i'm like i don't know only only if my wife makes her famous ribs i'll eat it uh reptiles no no alligator nuggets you know no uh you know rattle snake stew uh insects uh i would try i honestly i'm not gonna eat scorpions but those pretty close things the grasshoppers and the crickets and the locusts i've seen i've seen them on those shows you know the travel shows where like david zimmerman you know unusual food and stuff and they are taking the crickets and putting that in the in a frying pan with a grill and a little salt and pepper and it tastes just like chicken right or you take a little mama's cholula hot sauce and then everything tastes good with mama jungles hot sauce but i think i'd try some insects and the question i've been asking you know for the last few weeks is you know why am i preaching this message well um again no i'm not a nutritionist i'm just kind of you know i've been sticking with uh kind of scientific fact but also importantly i back it up with bible verses is that god would want his servants to be healthy uh remember the things that we breathe the things that we inject in our bodies the things that we eat are all important to us and god would want his servants to be healthy and happy now we'll be preaching a message here maybe this might be the last one on food and then i'm going to maybe transition into kind of some wellness things like i preached some messages on being happy and that kind of stuff and you know we'll get i think we can knock out a few messages and then we'll be around coming up on easter time and then mother's day so i'm having fun i hope i'm not boring you if i am you can tell me i'll all right i'll stop preaching about alligator nuggets and all that we'll move on to some other things all right but again i'd like to continue on what the bible has to say about food and health and we see here in luke chapter 24 that what you know that the lord jesus christ is eating food now you know since i've been on this topic of food i'm saying okay you know jesus is god you know he's the son i you know is he eating is he like a regular guy you know remember he's the god man all right he is god manifest in flesh all right that's the whole christmas story he is god but he was made flesh and dwelt among us so if he dwelt among us you know i guess he did many of the things that uh people in his day did and we look here at verse 41 hear rule 24 and while they yet believe not for joy and wonder he said unto them have ye hear any meat you know so after the resurrection the lord was hungry okay so first he told him hey it's me it's good old jesus there's the holes and uh he got a little grub i'm hungry all right and they gave him a piece of broiled fish and honeycomb and he took it and did eat uh before them and what i'd like to do and that was just by introduction i just preached a little message here and i've said this what i would do a couple weeks ago is that probably what are some of the foods and drinks that the lord jesus christ eight or probably eight so we have some evidence here that he ate some things and then we can suspect because he was a you know he was a jew and you know israel that they had their diet as well but one food the lord ate and i know he enjoyed uh was fish all right look at verse 42 and they gave him uh a piece of broiled fish all right and and a honeycomb now um you know seafood how many people like fish no i can't i mean we live on an island all right we're kind of known for seafood and uh some of you guys that you know had maybe been brought up in other countries you know i know that you know that seafood is an important part of the culture um important important part of the diet hey i my dad grew up right here in baldwin baldwin harbor and i grew up you know in merrick you know with you know my family and my dad had a boat and you know he was an old bay rat you know he would go out at two o'clock in the morning he'd go it was called when you go on low tide and you get what's up i'm sorry well i thought you'd give me a hand signal now i don't know i'm like left eye on my wife always because i have our secret little code here you know is that anyway um you know my dad and he would take me my not usually my younger brothers me and him it was a father something i had some of my best memories with my dad in that boat at merrick harbor baldwin harbor we'd catch and that's back in the day where you know nowadays you go anyone's gone fishing on a party boat you spend 50 bucks you you go on a boat you catch nothing but back in the 70s you know actually most they call it a party boat because all they all the old guys do is they get away from the wipe they got their cooler with 24 pack and they drink it they don't care if they catch a fish or not but uh you know but back in the day me and my dad he would bring a garbage can on the boat and we would fill it up with crabs and then flounder and then we would go clamming when when i started dating my wife my dad still had had his boat and he took me and took out on the boat a couple of times and we got clams and and like this is pretty cool you know and uh you know so we like seafood here all right and a verse 42 and they gave him a piece of broiled fish you know probably broiled as uh i just envisioned like a little fire and they have the fish on the stick and they kind of you know do this kind of thing and they stick it you know broil not fried you know and pig fat you know like they go to arthur creatures fish and chips you know you take the fish chunk and the chips and you know burn the oil and it comes it tastes good you know but what happens you're defeating the healthy fish is done being nuked in oil and the fries and all that and it's not healthy but nothing like you know scaling the fish putting in a little fire and having a broiled fish now fish is an excellent source of lean protein an essential part of our regular diet additionally fatty fish like salmon mackerel sardines which i all like my wife cooks uh salmon all the time one thing i got from my grandfather of all people how many people buy the little cans of sardines my mother did okay that's kind of like old school i go to stop and shop i see them like you know three for five dollars i get a can of sardines and you get to put them on a little cracker and it's it's good for you you get them in the olive oil all right they're an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids have been reported to having anti-inflammatory actions in consumption of adequate amounts of omega-3 fatty acids have been suggested to support healthy blood lipid levels reduce blood pressure and reduce heart disease so fish is good and according to harvard medical school eating fish regularly can help ward off serious heart rhythm disturbances associated with cardiac death it also appears to reduce the risk of heart attack strokes mental decline old age and prostate cancer and in fact according to the mayo clinic if you're worried about heart disease us try to eat one or two servings of fish a week that could reduce your risk of heart disease um and doctors have a long have long recognized that unsaturated fats and fish called omega-3 fatty acids appear to reduce the risk of dying of heart disease right for many years the american heart association has recommended that people eat fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids at least twice a week all right in fact the lord liked fish so much that what four of his disciples were what commercial fishermen all right and aren't we as christians aren't we supposed to be fishes of men now you could talk to my wife about this and she doesn't like it when i mention her messages but she knows all of this stuff about health and things um you know like me when i go to stop and shop i get to stop and shop brand of uh you know smoked salmon 9.99 i put it on a bag i'm happy now she goes to costco and she gets the alaskan stockie yeah i mean i mean it's it's more money but and but it's a different color and it's thick and it's like it's that wild alaskan now i've seen these tv shows and again you know my wife's the expert on this but you gotta buy the wild stuff not the farm raised you know salmon all right because you ever watched those tv shows they got a little thing in the bay they surround it with nets they got like two million fish and one they all poop and pee in the thing and they all get dirty they're under growth and and then and then when you slice salmon i think it's like it's got to be actually dark and not have a lot of those like white lines if it has a lot of the white lines i think it's farm raised so but anyway you know just buy a natural wild you know right off the boat kind of thing and remember pork no fish yes all right i i like fish i can eat fish pretty much any time and i've never had you know bad experiences with uh fish another thing we see that the lord ate in luke 24 he ate honeycomb now a honeycomb is a mass of a hexagonal wax cells it's not just a honey but it's you know when you go inside the hive and you see that it's uh all those little holes and different things that's called the hexagonal wax cells built by honey bees in their nest to contain their lava and store the honey and pollen so it's going to like they have like a wall they got like a million little holes and it's like a hex kind of pattern thing and that's where they put their honey and their pollen and what they did was they just didn't eat the honey they ate the honey cone all right it's been said that the best tasting honey is the one that comes from the honeycomb i proverbs chapter 24 verse 13 says my son eat thou honey because it is good and the honeycomb which is sweet to thy taste so um i i i you know i really don't go to health stores although i did go to cvs that they bought some vitamins um but anyone that actually see like when they sell honeycomb or anyone actually eating like a honeycomb you know now how many of how many of us you know when we were kids remember the honeycomb cereal okay um yeah that's called what they call it advertising deception they make it look like little honeycombs but it's not healthy for you it's all sugar it's all bad but as a kid you get two bowls of honeycombs yeah it's not healthy you got to get the what do we get special k with strawberries you know uh nuts and grains you know um actually soaring can kind of testify this europeans eat real cereal okay when we went to germany one time all in europe once and we we ate you know the hotel breakfast they have like real cereal i'm like where's the honeycombs where's the captain crunch with the fruit loops no it's a oats and grains and yeah it's okay where's the sugar can i no sugar and they have lots of salmon and they have a cheese house which first i'm go first i walked into the cheese house and there's like flies flying all over and think i'm like man i'm not eating that cheese it's like flying and no that means it's good you need like the fly poison and the need the cheese to get old and eggs all right hey when in germany do what the germans do now we cutting up the and that was some good breakfast you know i got a deal at the hotel all you can eat so like us americans you know european one little bowl one little piece of salmon meat five pieces of salmon epithelia cheese oh croissants oh they got something that two croissants oh yeah eggs bacon i get the heck and i'm like that's plate number one oh yeah orange juice i'm gonna get two cups of that stuff because i know i i i paid for it all you can eat they they they peg me and so out as american i mean you know in a second you know but that's a we had fun going back to the honeycombs honey has a long history of use uh both as a food and a natural health benefit again um my wife she takes uh she takes uh honey supplements and she buys honey um i think you know um in the jar and stuff and you put it in tea and that stuff and many of the uh phi tone nutrients in raw honey have been reported to have cancer fighting properties it has been suggested and adding honey to one's diet can support normal blood sugar and cholesterol health isn't that like interesting like the american diet i told you in a can of coke or on a big gulp it's like 24 sugar you know and it's all bad and it hurts us but having natural honey it actually helps us and and it helps us with the blood sugar and cholesterol which the real which the fake high sucrose sugar and all that stuff that they put in it's bad now you guys are going to yell at me because yeah you know when me and so head out i'm going to grab a can of coke because my my throat is parched okay and i'm waiting for someone to invent natural soda without sugar but uh honey is good for you the carbohydrates and honey have been shown to enhance digestive tract health by promoting beneficial bacteria which is a good energy source for the long walking journeys during that time you know jesus didn't have uber they had a walk from town to town to town and that honey provided uh extra energy for the for the wall raw honey in addition has been known as a natural sweetener it is full of anti antioxidants is considered to be antiviral antibacterial antifungal substance it is thought to have tumor fighting properties and may help prevent colon cancer now it's been said honey is one of those like top 25 foods you know like blueberries walnut salmon honey the daily consumption of a spoonful okay you know spoonful okay not a glass full all right it's said to increase antioxidant levels in the blood it's a healthy sweetener for type 2 diabetic i got to get me some money and i'll start keeping it on the truck you know honey is also wound healing and muscle regeneration properties dave forget about the doctor i'm just going to buy some honey i'll put it on your elbow and you'll be okie dokie okay you can run around and taste move the frying pan and i will save some money with the doctor yeah not to stick to the honey all right uh you can eat the honey from the honeycomb and you can chew the honeycomb and get the you know the sweetness from that honeycomb when chewed regularly during allergy season completely alleviates allergies chew a piece of honeycomb as long as possible as as though it was a piece of gum within 30 minutes of chewing honeycomb symptoms like a stuffy nose and headaches disappear start chewing honeycomb a week or two before allergy season starts and allergies won't manifest so how many people would spring come on up suffer from you know allergies from the pollens and different things all right um listen this is you know this is an example of me cutting and pasting you know i go like the mayo clinic i go to health sites this is what they're saying so i'm i'm trusting them but uh you know perhaps you can listen on amazon go to the house it's a honeycomb and you just start you know chewing it and having some honey and maybe you won't get those allergies all right so that's good all right we don't hear about you know you know jesus sneezing you know and having a stuffy nose but another bible food that jesus probably ate was pomegranates all right now song of solomon chapter 7 verse 12 and if you know the context of song solomon it's a it's a it's a song about a man and a woman that love each other and they're married and everything and it's a type and a picture of jesus marrying the church as well so we get the spiritual application here but song of solomon chapter 7 verse 12 says let us get up early in the vineyards and let us see the vine flourish whether the tender grape appeared and the pomegranates but forth there will i give thee my love now the pomegranate again probably top 25 food is considered a super fruit because it is tremendously rich in antioxidants research studies suggest that regular consumption of pomegranate or pomegranate juice can support heart health breast health prostate health and skin health naturally a single pomegranate provides nearly 50 percent of our daily fiber and vitamin c now i like pomegranates pomegranate juice what's the problem with pomegranate juice it's too expensive you get a little 12 ounce glass jar and it's like 9.99 and i'm like yeah and you know me i get gold and i'm not going to share it with silk and that's it i mean it's uh pomegranate juice is expensive i guess you know farming the pomegranates but you know i guess if you want to live long you got to spend a little money on some of this stuff but uh you know but pomegranates uh it's a super fruit now here's five health benefits from pomegranates they keep your health a teeth clean i did not know that i wish i would have known that like you know 30 years ago that i've eaten pomegranates every day rich in polyphenolic flavonoids compounds with antibacterial properties pomegranate juice has been found to be just as effective as prescription mouthwash ridding them out the plaque bacteria and things that causes cavities and gingivitis so look at that pomegranates regulate cholesterol all right one study suggests those who drank pomegranate juice for two weeks had an 18 increase in production of enzymes all right pomegranates contain apparel paranoxis a naturally occurring enzyme in the body that helps keep ldl bad cholesterol from accumulating in arteries so you know get that pomegranate juice it can help prevent arthritis all right they're a great source of fiber and also they protect your skin packed with potent antioxidants powerful uh allergic acid pomegranates help limit the damage of uv rays they also defend against free radicals and collagen production i know if you take the pomegranate juicing yet you know and uh i think you're supposed to drink it though i don't think they made a suntan lotion for that but uh hey get them pomegranates but again i i've worn pomegranate juice supplies once a while cuts it off and everything but it is a little pricey another thing jesus probably uh also ate and which many of us do eat here and i like this are olives uh and olive oil now when i was a kid i hated olives i don't know why they just my mom would like cut up some oven in the house with the dogs you know and that's it but as an adult i love how i mean i go i go to i buy a jar i sometimes you see that olive bar thing they have different houses around the world and i i like them sometimes they stuff it with uh garlic and other things and all right but deuteronomy 8 verse 8 says a land of wheat barley and vines and fig trees and pomegranates a land of olive oil and honey look at that all these things here wheat barley vines you know your grapes your fig trees pomegranates olive oil and honey these are all good natural things that we should you know incorporate in our diet the sock used to dip bread during the last supper may have contained uh a mixture of olive oil and some other ingredients you know like when you go to what's that place uh panera bread i think they give it the bread or where you like a nice italian restaurant and they get a little bowl of you know olive oil and you dip the bread that's better than slabbing it with a big old half a pound of butter you know yeah i mean i like the butter right but you know my wife's gotta get the olive oil all right but the sauce is a liquid or sauce which one dips the bread or meat for additional flavor and just like they bring the dish of olive oil you know we dip the sauce olive oil and olives have long been a staple of the mediterranean diet a dietary pattern uh thought to be a much healthier uh you know diet than typical western diets all right the mediterranean diet southern europe uh you know israel beirut and then kind of like some countries in northern africa there tomatoes olive oil fish you know all this healthy stuff i know the west western diet i don't know if we've actually been defined america western diet barbie cane white castle mcdonald's you know but we can learn a lot from you know the mediterranean diet olive oil is rich in anti-inflammatory antioxidant compounds however the dietary fat and olive oil is mostly monosaturated fat which has been reported to support natural heart health reducing total bad cholesterol levels additionally anti-oxidant anti-inflammatory properties of olive oil have been reported to support normal blood sugar ease joint discom comfort and decreased breast cancer risk so you ladies let's start loading up on the olives there right again olive oil also nourishes the skin for a glow i did not know that eat lots of olive oils and you'll have like nice shiny smooth skin you know jesus probably also ate figs um i have a lot of lawn customers i don't get it they all plant fig trees but i've never seen the figs grow i don't know i don't know you have you have a fake tree you have you get the figs i get the fish all right but from what i heard you can't really eat the fig right from the tree right you had to pick what some people did but i cooked them yeah that's what he's supposed to do i think they're supposed to like you know let them dry out cook and everything but they say like eating raw figs it can can actually uh you know maybe not be totally healthy but jesus probably ate figs in a mark 11 3. we see here and seeing a fig tree afar off having a far off having leaves he came if happily he might find anything there on but when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the figs uh was not yet so jesus went to a victory he wanted to you know perhaps eat some figs and uh there weren't any there yet but here jesus attempted to eat figs from a fruitless fig tree on the road to jerusalem so we can assume that he probably enjoyed figs figs have long been grown and eaten in the mediterranean area figs are an excellent source of potassium dietary fiber i think they say you know you need to go to the bathroom or that kind of thing eat some figs now i don't even know if they make this cook anymore how many people remember fig newtons when i was a kid my mom would buy fixed newtons and i'm like this is not a choke this is not chips ahoy all right what is this fig stuff yeah it's good for you no it tastes like medicine where's the dog and you go and i love fake cookies for you where's the chips all right cookies you know when my wife first met me they're going food shopping like oh chips are not two bags because i mean i can eat me i've been me and the boys we can get a big old glass of milk and we can do you know 10 20 cookies and my mom almost god bless her uh you know she did she didn't make it from scratch like lori but she bought that that stuff it was in the roll you cut it in slices you put it on the tray it's like uh sliced chocolate chip cookies but like right out of the oven chewy i mean you know and every time we visited my mom in florida and she knew we were coming she always had big three trays to me and calvin hi mom hi guma where's the cookies yeah but big newton's in i don't know how has anyone actually had a fig newton in a while but hey i know christian you're gonna buy some box of fig newtons next week right for the yeah well look we'll get a box of fake news but you gotta get the big nuke you gotta read the ingredients if you see high sucrose salt sugar you know um what do you got the flour that's not you're like you're gonna get like five percent fig and 95 bad for you but anyway figs have long been grown and eaten in the mediterranean area figs are an excellent source of potassium dietary fiber it's important support of normal blood pressure dietary i got to start eating these big things man all right things are a good source of antioxidants and uh carotids and a bunch of other good stuff uh jesus also ate grapes 30 minutes all right jesus also ate grapes in fact jesus cam compared himself uh to a great plan all right in john 15 1 he says i am the true mind and then my father is the husbandman every branch in me beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch said bear with fruit he purges it that he may bring forth even more so what you got to do you know anyone's ever taken care of a great tree or grapevine is what happens they overgrow you've got to cut it back a little bit and that'll actually spur um you know more growth and jesus is comparing himself to the great grapevine in which we as believers in church we get to be those little vines and and uh and branches now you are clean through the world like i've spoken into you i am the vine and you are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit and without me you can do nothing so the lord compares himself to a great line here and grapes are a rich source of many uh cyano nutrients including uh resverterol and you know it's funny i can kind of pronounce a lot of the bible work but always like health things or i could say antioxidants but saponins you know i don't know what what's saffron uh s-a-p-o-n-i-n-s saponins all right just research it's good for you all right research also reports that red grapes or grape juice can support normal heart health by decreasing bad cholesterol and preventing the oxidation of bad cholesterol and supporting an overall improved antioxidant status and also new research that grape extracts also support healthy skin um a lot of times with me my wife would go to a korean restaurant after the meal um you know or even at mike like we eat at our house or my sister-in-law's house they after dinner they bring out a big tray of grapes and melons that stuff is all good for you all right there were many vineyards that uh at the lord's time and there are still many vineyards still in jerusalem and the surrounding hillsides to this day many health benefits from grapes include the rich compound reds virtual resveratrol is one of the most powerful antioxidants has been found to play a pro protective role against cancers of colon prostate coronary heart disease degenerate nerve disease alzheimer's and viral fungus infections it also reduces stroke risk by altering the molecular mechanisms it does so firstly by reducing uh the subs uh the subset of the blood vessel damage through the decreased activity um oh man really really barney which one of these words here angiotestin a system hormone causing blood vessel constriction oh man i sound like a bad doctor to graduate medical school here great it's good for you all right you know all of this stuff grapes are rich source of minerals like copper iron magnet magnesium copper and manganese are essential cofactor of antioxidants enzymes superoxide iron is especially concentrated more in raisins that's kind of like a lost thing too people don't eat raisins like as much as when i was a kid you got that little box of raisins in your lunch box now of course there's natural raisins and there's raisins that they put sugar and stuff on top you got to be careful natural raisins all right grapes good source of vitamin c uh vitamin a vitamin k carotene b complex and uh yeah grapes man you eat some grapes not just for lunch but you know there's like a little side snack all right now we've been talking about fish and we've thought a lot about fruits and vegetables but uh one animal that the lord probably ate was lamb in fact we know he ate lamb because it was part of the passover meal all right mark chapter 14 verse 14 and wherever he he shall go say unto the good men of the house the master saith where is the guest chamber where i shall eat the passover with my disciples so the last supper the passover meal was uh was was one of the last meals that jesus ate the passover meal consisted of lamb i mean i how many people like lamb they say it's like an acquired tank but i like lamb i like lamb i like yeah i go to the stopping shop i get those little five or six lamb chops my wife oh man she takes the little spices and she knows how to cook them not me i buy the stuff she cooks a couple years ago uh me and my wife and roman and evan we went to a filipino restaurant on easter day in queens and i'm looking at i mean i've had filipino food i like it but of all the things they had on the menu they had lamb chops mashed potatoes i'm like i'm getting the lamb chops and mashed potatoes and uh you know i like lamb here's a funny story my wife's gonna laugh at this one it's not harsh it's not the no when we visited my dad we took my dad out to dinner with his girlfriend which that's another story and i don't like dad with the girlfriend but um he uh how can i say he i know if he thought he was gonna pay or not pay i don't know he says wow i'm going to get the lamb chops and he saw the lamb chops was 39.99 and then he put his glasses on no i'm going to get the fish and chips which is 11.99 turned out who paid for it babe and i said i said see that you should have ordered the land but you thought you were gonna get stuck with the bill now you had the fish and chips you know see what happens you know what hey you go out to dinner my rule is it either i pay or they pay or we chip in but order what you want yeah you're in a restaurant you know but my dad he he missed that but going back to the lamb the passover meal consisted of lamb it consisted of mara which is a bitter herb like horseradish baby all right lamb also the lamb uh less upper consisted of charoset which is a sweet salad of nuts apples and cinnamon that sounds good carpis which is a vegetable like celery or parsley hard-boiled eggs and matzah i mean that sounds pretty good i mean we had to find a nice little i mean i go to a meeting we go to jewish restaurants it's hot pastrami on rye you know which is good and uh you know the the matzah soup but i like to get a nice nice uh meal like that that's pretty good all right the lord as he compared himself to the grape the great plant before the grapevine the lord also compared himself to a lamb all right john 1 29 the next day john the baptist jesus coming on them saying behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world lamb is an important part of the jewish diet especially during the passover feast right lamb provides large vitamins like amounts of vitamin b3 b12 high amounts of saline zinc phosphorus and iron zinc has been reported healthy for healthy immune system and while lamb is high in saturated fat it contains less than most other meat products of the total fat lamb only 36 is saturated the rest is mono and polyunsaturated fat which is the healthier fat all right i love lamb against one of the top five meals you know that's how that's healthy i like lemon so like field cup of parmesan you know it's uh spaghetti that's an o number two we'll talk about the other three another thing that jesus also ate was bread all right jesus said unto them in john 6 35 i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst all right many whole grain breads are a natural source of vitamins in mineral and it's good for a dietary fiber again we're not talking about you know american bread which is wonder bread which is they take the flour take all the good stuff out and they make it bad and it's all it's all bad for you but natural whole grain like someone knows this european eat real bread i mean it might it might taste like horse food but it's it's good for you all right hey my wife she says buy the the multi-grain bread i'm in the bread all white oh but now one little section multigrain and that stuff is good for you all right it does it helps your management your digestive system helps manage your blood sugar health it purges bad hormones from the body and actually has good heart health eating a diet load fat and high grain products fruits and vegetables contain the dietary fiber that can help you reduce some cancers including breast cancer right wheat was part of jesus's diet all right psalm 81 16 he should have fed them also with the finest of wheat and with honey out of the rocks should i have satisfied me i'm just kind of blown by the message here it's getting a little late late but i got a couple more points here the lord drank vinegar all right john 19 30 when jesus therefore received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost vinegar is used as a a condiment medicine antibiotic and indeterminate detergent the the red cider apple cider vinegar is becoming like very popular now my wife buys that you take a little shot you mix it with some you know some things but vinegar including wine vinegar apple cider vinegar has been reported to slow the breakdown of carbohydrates in the digestive system and help support normal blood sugar again vinegar has also been shown to increase the absorption of calcium from vegetables making vinegar a good ingredient for your salad dressing that's what i like you know when you buy the salad dressing like from the store it's oil vinegar and like 15 other things and it goes from like 50 calories to like 300 calories just get natural olive oil um what do you call that the there's two times the uh um what's the good stuff extra virgin thank you you got to get the extra virgin and you get the vinegar scoop scoop and that that's good for your salad vinegar is good for insect bites or stings all right which will help soothe the sting quickly so they get stung by your beets take a little vinegar juice poor vinegar on sunburn i did not know that if you drink a teaspoon there's some some of the old goods my mama said hey take a little vinegar and put on your sunburn like what that's gonna hurt you know if you drink a teaspoon or two of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water it'll help with your digestion bowel function cholesterol preventing ulcers all right also the latter also help you with a with less stress all right cyalic acid is what you use on warts vinegar is an acidic acid and works the same way so if you got a water i don't know that's you dry a little vinegar does five percent vinegar mixed in in a solution of your choice can kill 99 of bacteria 82 percent of mold and 80 of germs i'm not saying it's going to kill the corona virus but it does have some of this things that are going on before a teaspoon or two of vinegar will cure the hiccups that's true yeah i haven't had the hiccups in a while i remember you know yeah probably later you know but all right hiccups i thought you were like you're supposed to hold your breath for like 30 seconds you know and that's what that's that was the old way for three minutes okay two teaspoons of apple cider vinegar and honey mixed with enough hot water to melt the honey can help you if you have a headache all right so instead of hitting the the uh the aspirin and you know the advil and all of that okay uh bathing and some okay bathing in some apple cider vinegar can help with urinary tract infections all right um okay so i guess you know you take your little mr mr soap and you fill up your hot tub you take a little apple cider vinegar and it's good for you all right also good for skin conditions helps fight against food cravings and you know going back to when the lord took the vinegar and said it is finished uh those are the you know the three greatest words that a human could have ever have heard all right peter said in first peter 2 24 who is who his own self bear our sins and his own body on a tree that we being dead to sins should live unto unrighteous unto righteousness by whose stripes we were healed the lord's last words it is finished it was right before he drank that that little vinegar and with jesus dying on the cross for our sins that we may inherit eternal life all right when jesus died for us it was to forgive us of our sins and bring us back to god our father isaiah 53 verse 6 says all we like sheep have gone astray and we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all the answer to man's problems church you know this i'm preaching to you guys here it's the lord jesus and it's by accepting him as lord and savior and becoming born again amen amen amen all right we got to look at some foods that the lord eat all right brother gordon you're up buddy all right give us a little prayer and choir come on up and bless us with a benediction and you can have a little call to fellowship", "RdkOqm10qQc": "OH hey...welcome the CW I this week', since we're doing  Mexican food I'll try to come up with a good drink of the episode to go with it I'm thinking something with tequila a rather do you run of the mill margarita or \"straight shots\" I think this week we're gonna do\nsomething called sangriTA not sangria which is a a wine and fruit the drink\nbut this SANGRITA has a tomato base a little of sweet/hot, \nsome fruit juice anyway, you use it as a sipper to go along with your tequila uh, grab your sombrero, get a shot glass, \nlet's get ready go south to the border ...and welcome to CWI!!  :)   I like to mix my sangrita up in a\nsmall pitcher then use that to sever out of... so, mixing\ntogether we start off with soy sauce worchestershire salt and pepper lime juice grenadine orange juice   tomato juice and, about half a teaspoon of Tabasco exactly you don't want to add any more, or any less,\nMake sure and don't add too MUCH tabasco you really don't want it to be too HOT.  :P ...alright, give that a stir and we'll, uh...serve it up! Anyway...a little shot of sangrita...a little shot of tequila now you know, I see a lot of people use this is a SLAM chaser for tequila, \nand, well,  trust me it does work really well but if you've gotta a decent tequila, I mean\nthis isn't  expensive but you know, it isn't \"totally\" rotgut but, anyway I like to use it as a \"sipper\" AHHhh....oh man, that really works!! the sangrita really has mixture of flavors you\nknow that's not fully tomato-y its kind of sweet...spicy...a little fruity, a little tomato-y it's a perfect suit to a tequila. If you actually have a\nreally nice tequila.... this is the way to drink it!! AHH. So, savor the flavor or...\"what the hell\"(gulp)  (gulp)....aaaaah!! (background mexican music) Alright, well for our enchiladas today, I want to do a\ngreen sauce or salsa verde if you will it's a quick one done in a food\nprocessor and has tomatillos, onions,  cilantro, \nuse some serrano chiles uh, whip it real quick,  put in the fridge let\nit chill good good stuff!  Of course I usually prefer to use fresh tomatillos\nbut sometimes you just can't find them in the store or, actually they had some,  they just\ndidn't quite look up to snuff. But anyway canned tomatillos they'll  work just fine. make sure and drain them first tho.... And for a batch this size, I'm gonna use\nabout half of a good size onion Ehh... maybe a little more. It's all done in a \nfood processor so no need to cut it up finely. And about 5 good sized cloves of garlic here. Just gonna smashed these  up here ...and take the peels off. we're gonna start off with the things we\nneed to chop up more finely that would be our serrano chiles and our garlic, so, we'll add them in first. Alright....and next, let's add in about... ehh...let's add in about 2/3 a bunch of the cilantro it's mostly the ends, but I'll throw in a few stems.. It's all good stuff and next up we'll do  the onions, and we'll  want\nto keep them a little more chunky so we'll uh.... add those  in and just pulse them a couple of times...Ah...that looks about right. and just add, uh, the rest of the ingredients juice of a couple of limes...   and start off with a couple teaspoons salt I like kosher salt... ...and our drained tomatillos... ...and we'll pulse till it's pretty fine... (smacks lips) That should do it!   Let that sit for awhile..the flavors should marry... in a it's a little bit HOT now, with the serannos, \nbut all the lime juice and everything's gonna mellow it out at after it sets for awhile So...Good Stuff!! Ahh!!  Thirsty business!!  ;) Alright let's talk enchilada sauce..(this rambles a bit here) The original recipe made a fairly small\nbatch. The original recipe called for three tablespoons of oil,  3 tablespoons flour use that make a\nlite roux... then you take two cups of water, 6 tablespoons\nchili powder whip that together and into that you  also add a teaspoon each of garlic powder, salt and cumin... and then another little  twist I add to that, a lot of them don't add any tomato sauce, I like a little bit and to that I would add a small can tomato sauce Now I am gonna actually triple that for\nthis recipe I want to have enough sauce to make two large pans of cheese enchiladas.. I'm gonna feed my  co-workers tomorrow and\nthis is gonna give me plenty for that ...and also like I said... I soften my tortillas with the, uh,  sauce so\nthis way I'll have plenty of sauce for everything....Let's get started!! I got a pan here over heat... gonna go ahead and add our oil,  I'm using pure (grade) olive oil I use that for pretty much for everything. It's NOT extra virgin, uh... its the second pressing so it's actually got\na pretty neutral flavor. And we're going to do our equal parts, uh let this warm for a second ...and we're gonna stir in our equal parts of flour Now..for those of you that saw the gumbo episode you'll recognize\nmaking a roux and in this case we're not gonna take it\nto a dark color uh, like you with the gumbo this one we're gonna make a really light roux\nessentially we're just gonna cook  this long enough just barely long enough to\nget the other \"flour-y\" kind of taste out of it... well we've got our mixture here,  this is gonna steam,  so be careful.   (sizzle, steam, steam)   you wanna get your heat up to about high And uh we're gonna take and start to simmer this down I'm  gonna bring it to a boil and then let it simmer for probably about  half an hour. I  think a batch like this *might* take just little bit longer uh but we want to reduce  it down to where it starts getting thick now you don't want to get to TOO think, 'cause like I said, we're gonna be softening our tortillas in this... you do want to get it where it is JUST starting to get thick it'll be perfect by the time you finish\nmaking the enchiladas it'll be simmering it's actually gonna be thick for the sauce at the end to finish it with (damn, I ramble a lot at times) I'm gonna go ahead and add a couple cans of tomato sauce. and actually, for something a little different I reserved some of that tomatillo juice and I'm gonna add a cans worth of that too. No one said you couldn't experiment!! Time for the STAR ingredient of the show...CHEESE!\nI like to take cheddar cheese Monterey Jack cheese and blend them myself. I prefer that over the Colby jack cheese it seems to have a better taste/texture to me...but use your own blends, however you like. About a couple and a 1/2 pounds each     Well, we're  getting ready to assemble here' Um...basically I've got a cheap little plate to work with here... ...after I soften up the tortillas...got\nsome onions,  cheese and I've got my pan over here. And the\nfirst thing you want to do is put  a little bit of the enchilada sauce\non the bottom ...to avoid sticking...     Let's put our tortilla  into the sauce, give it a\ncouple seconds for it to soften let  the excess shake off Lather....Rinse....Repeat!! (mexican cooking background music)     Well, out of a 30 count pack of tortillas I got two pretty good size\npans so I'll gonna take and put the rest of the sauce onto them and go ahead and be  liberal with this, you want\neverything covered nicely That's why I make extra... any surface uncovered while baking them\ncan dry out... And well..that's just not as good... Alright..and then we'll put a little cheese on them... I like to kinda go right down the middle\nthat way its a little easer, er...I mean it will spread while we're cooking but it easier to\nsee what you're scooping them out for the enchiladas are right (I dunno what I was trying to say either, too many beers) Alright, I'll repeat this for the other pan.\nI have the oven preheating on 375F, and we'll pop these in... filled the cheese on top, and  we'll let it go\nfor about maybe 15-20 minutes (More cool background music) (oven door shuts)                       OH man.... lotta work sure worth it!!  :) Oh... fantastic!! Well.. I tell you what, is it a lot of work? Yes. Is it\nhealthy for you? Well considering its bunch of cheese we've had  tequila a LOT of beer...probably not the best thing FOR you... But sometimes you gotta treat yourself, \nbecause... if it's not exactly good for your body..I\nthink it IS good for the soul So anyway hope to see you next time on CWI...\nAnd give this one a try!!!

i'm just going to eyeball this apple cider vinegar 2 tablespoons of honey about a half a cup of brown sugar she's gonna eyeball it i don't think those old boys back in the day had measurements anyways get some fresh cracked pepper now from what i understand this comes from a german recipe i guess in the carolinas there were a lot of germans that's why it's so heavy on the mustard we're just going to throw in some cayenne pepper [Music] i'm going to mix it all up we're going to pour it into a pan and then we're going to put it on the weber kettle to cook this down let's go to the weber the weber kettle is at 350 right now just going to put it over direct heat we're going to leave this open because we just want this to cook down a little bit start bubbling just a wee bit and then we want to pull it all right let's start on our pulled pork this is a pork butt that i did last night and i put some uncle steve's competition bird powder on it because i'll tell you what i really like that but it's look at that stuff just comes apart right [Music] so we're just going to tear this apart seriously one day i'm going to do a video on how to do this [Music] but i know for a fact those old

little cursed because every time we try to do a skype episode it just crap we were we got like a hour and 15 minute episode recorded two days ago and it crashed on us right at the end it's my discount internet service well i'm going with cricket cell phone so i mean it could be me too i still do have a spectrum internet but um yeah today we're going to talk about spring bonita fishing and just kind of some of the um casting that you can do in the ocean this time of year as it starts to warm up a little bit more especially um we did an episode not too long ago talking about kind of bottom near shore bottom fishing fishing vertically for sheep's head and tog and redfish black charm and all that but we're gonna we're gonna really take a look today at like benita in particular but talk a little about albacore maybe some spanish mackerel and and uh but specifically how to target the bonita um this time of year i do want to say this episode is sponsored by first class glass here in wilmington north carolina they do uh anything from small gel coat repair to full boat restoration you can get your motors repainted they can take an old beater boat and make it look brand new and do a really good job put new floors in it pretty much anything that you want to do with fiberglass they can they can cover it and painting and whatnot so um like i said this episode's sponsored by them i will link all their information the show notes for the podcast as well as for the youtube channel but definitely go check them out it's it's almost spring great time of year to go get your your stuff done they got a really good turnaround i know he does a bunch of the warranty work for a bunch of the shops here in town a bunch of the big boat manufacturers but they do have a good turnaround time and uh you should you'll be stoked you know get that boat looking right before summertime hits uh also go check out the facebook group uh eastern current fishing check us out on instagram following type fishing following underscore fish falling tight underscore fishing judd brock fishing and then eastern current on instagram as well and i think that's probably it if you if you do love the podcast leave us a review on itunes that's another big thing that helps out a bunch so we'll kind to get into it i me and zayn have been talking a bunch we talk a couple times a week about about kind of what we're doing what's going on fishing wise and uh i will say that i think both of us are a little burned out on doing the same thing so so we're both excited about some bonita showing up and being able to get out in the ocean and do it a little differently sure um but let's let's start out kind of talking about you know what it is or let's talk i think one the one we recorded the other day was we started with uh where did we find these fish like getting out there what are we looking for you know before we're actually looking for the fish i guess okay so i guess we'll take it even back a step further when we're looking for the inlet as the as first light is coming out coming on like at when you can first see you know the bow your boat i'm i'm trying to be busting the inlet yeah and at first light i'm trying to be sitting on where i'm gonna be fishing and that's just like um a lot of pelagic species that's the time they're gonna be up top feeding on top you're able to visually fish for them they're gonna be busting on bait i think you mentioned last year they were busting on some pretty big stuff yeah some big baits um so uh well you know i'm trying to be out there early um you can definitely catch them if you can't get out there early but i think the bike is definitely hotter in the morning hotter in the morning so um it's one of those fish that really plays true i'm i think a good place to start is any type of you know live bottom ars you have or um any type of any type of structure in the ocean it's going to hold that bait right um and that bait will rise to the top and it'll bring the bonito with it it seems like i guess those fish rise to the surface because as the light starts to get up it's going to be brighter near the surface so everything can see better everything in the water column early in the morning sure yeah i mean that's a theory yeah i guess i don't know if the bait's rising to the surface or if they're chasing the bait to the surface i don't really know um i guess it depends on what they're eating for sure but um yeah i think a great place to start is any type of artificial reef or near shore hard bottom um and then you know you want to start with something along the lines of this a small uh small casting jig it's a good thing to just have tidal on always when you're in the ocean but especially this time of year um and you know you're able to unpin this and cast and you know a lot of times last year um i never made it to where i was going right now a lot of times you would get out and bust and yell and you have a destination in mind you just kind of end up in the middle of nowhere um casting that busting fish and then um i think around you know an hour after sunrise you're you're fishing those fish pretty tight to struggle yeah i agree um do you do you feel like there's a water temperature that really keys you into starting to look for these fish is there it's 58 50 degrees 58 degrees dude it's crazy how like exact water temperatures it's like not 57.6 like 58 degrees is when they're gonna be here for sure for sure yeah and once they're here i think once it varies a little bit 65 yeah almost 70 degrees i mean i was they were around for a while last year it was weird last year normally it's like a three week like really hard and then they're gone but um yeah it was yeah i was catching them we were catching them people were catching them kingfishing into like like early drain or whatever i think i think that just shows i mean those fish don't mind warmer water temps if the bait that they want to key in on is heavily available i think that's probably why they're staying around you know just like anything the bait's there they stayed yeah for sure hopefully we'll see a similar year to it i mean we didn't get any crazy crazy cold weather you know we're kind of trending the same water temperatures as last year yeah so hopefully we'll see another solid year that i hope so man i think it's just a blind luck when it comes to stuff like that but yeah for sure it was it was a really good year last year and also the spring albacore man i i love so good yeah i i really enjoyed that last year man it was like a and they just keep going and feel like it's the same as the fall yeah the spring ones fight so much harder you really notice that because i feel like 100 okay yeah yeah okay cuz i feel like man they'll just like they'll take everything you have on a 3 000 man just like a and then you they're a little on average a little bigger than more and i've heard that there's already quite a few out there from like eight to 12 miles ten years i had a buddy catch a few miles the other day so that i mean if y'all are listening and i want to go catch an avcor this is a great time you're down to yourself you got a lot of times around sometimes a little bit further off the beach yeah than you do in the fall but that's not always the case but if you're willing to do that it's it's uh it can be it can be amazing out there man you can just have it all to yourself just acres of them you really can and it's fun i mean and i even caught some like just fishing the liberty ship last year for oh i got a booger on another thing i've even fished in the liberty ship last year yeah catching them yeah yeah so um well let's uh let's let's kind of dive into we've gone through time of year we've gone through let's talk a little bit more about where they're orienting so like you said catch them in no man's land first thing in the morning um but do you start to uh and you start to catch them closer to the structure do you find it playing true that like larger relief higher structure holds if it holds more fish or holds them more often or anything like that sure so um i think you know just like any fish in the ocean they're going to be drawn to that big structure the bait's drawn to the big structure they're going to be there you can certainly catch them in smaller relief spots like i mentioned you before there's a specific ledge that's i don't know like five feet of relief but you could and you weren't marking any fit it was the weirdest thing you know you weren't marking any fish above the ledge right right but you would jig on that ledge and you could just catch them one after the other and i think yeah i mean like it's a i fished that spot i mean there was the bite wasn't as hot as it would be as on the bigger structures but when those bigger structures have 60 boats on them right yeah it just it's nice to have those smaller spots to run off to um what's funny to me too is like like last year the liberty ship was had a lot of fish on it yeah and for me i struggle with like going to other spots like burning that morning bite it's so hard to go look other places yeah when and it doesn't necessarily delivery ship it's like you might have any of your confidence spots you want to go learn some other little stuff but it's like it's hard to push yourself when a fish feeds so much better first thing in the morning to to check out something else oh sure so like what i was doing is i was running to to the to the hot spot getting that i mean you know there's not too many people busting the inland at dark i mean there's you can have it yourself for quite a bit yeah so i would fish them until and even when it is a bunch of people out there they're they're not just in that one spot so they're everywhere right um and then you know i'd bust the inlet go to that spot until it got a little crowded the fish start hugging that structure there's like 80 people trolling over a kitchen table and then and uh that really is i mean it is they have that one mark in their thing and they just want to run over that one mark 20 20 times so uh i would just get tired of almost getting sunk so i would just uh pull a trolling motor and run to a couple spots and and um you there's you know you got to think there's a lot of those spots i think like the one spot i'm specifically talking about is a much larger area than any ar right you know it's just scattered you know limestone hard bottom so it's probably holding more bait than anything anything but it's just you don't it is spread out and the fish are certainly there but they just have more area to cover there's not that one specific spot that they all just congregate on after that um hot bite um and i think the morning bites there can be just as just as explosive and just as good as anywhere else you know it's just like you said it's all confidence you know wherever you feel comfortable um you know and that being said please be safe running in the dark you know if you are if it's something you're you're capable of then you know be cautious if it's something you're not you know there's definitely still fish to be caught i mean we caught i busted out there and caught them in the afternoon you know so definitely um don't uh don't think you have to run with the lights on to to catch them for sure you and i sat beside each other last year middle of the day well yeah we got out there like noon and caught them yes that was actually a pretty good little bite that day that was that specific time i did catch like three big albies man yeah we caught a couple hours yeah and i was like every time i come i was like that's not a bonita man it's just like rip and drag i hope it's a bonita yeah yeah elias that day was trying to do something he was chumming he was chumming with like tiny frozen yeah glass windows oh he was like scooping them off he ordered him or something i can't remember where he got him he always has some like off the wall he was like man the head boats up in new york do this i'm sure they do i know you can absolutely like i have friends in florida who use um um the same kind of thing i'm not sure they might be using little glass minnows but they're using they just use they're just scoop they have like a they use like a tea thing and they're just like steadily doing it and they'll fly fish the the falsies interest in the chum slick yeah so if they have like a fly client that's out there whether they're trying to do tarpon or anything really yeah um and then short bites slow they'll go out to the pass and just kind of yeah just challenge them up the albies and catch them on fly which probably would work here and i don't know about the fall because they're they're definitely well there's so much bait here when they're here usually that's why they're here that's why they're here um yeah it's just different with those things down there man it's funny man it's crazy how different it can be like how safe and they're the same fish but the same waters differently yeah and i guess a lot of that has to do with what they're eating and how they're having to eat it but yeah well cool so yeah high relief low relief it can all be good you're just really looking for that bait now when you ride around how often are you riding around looking at your sounder and like all right there's a school debate let's fish here for a little bit man like are you just more orienting near the bottom and just blind casting you were okay so like there was like it was so different last year because we talked like it was so many boats out there so there would be like i feel like a group of fish people it'll be like two people fishing those group of fish and then everybody's fishing those group of fish and and they just kind of bust up and then you kind of do it get them in groups off like just feeding you know mid-water column yeah um you know often no man's land and you can certainly mark them and a couple times unmark them and and just yo-yo a jig under them and figure it out and then you'll catch four or five and they're gone um i think once the sun's like high enough to where like it's 10 o'clock or whatever you're better off casting to structure and just bring it on ripping it back or slow whining it back and that that you know predator instinct of that bait trying to get away they can see it they'll come grab it because it i think they just i don't know it's weird man they just order it with structure so tightly right in the midday that it's just riding around looking for them a lot of times we were marking fish or marking bait it was probably albies now they were thinking about it but they just wouldn't eat you know 10 o'clock the only way i caught it was casting to structure and just ripping it back yeah yeah that's uh yeah that's funny it's cool i think what's so cool about fishing or what i really like about fishing is like yeah there's lots of ways to catch each fish and i want to know how to do every one of them sure some people will just settle into like oh i'm gonna troll for these fish or i'm gonna catch a redfish on top water in the summer and that's it or i'm gonna go trout fish with a drought trick and that's it yeah like learning all the little techniques and different ways to catch them definitely opens up a lot of doors and and even if you know you're out there one day and they'll eat anything you're throwing to them you know it's it's still nice to have yeah to know exactly what they want and there was definitely days out there where there was guys trolling and catching them and i wasn't catching them and there was just as many of the days opposite where like they're out there trolling deep divers and spoons or whatever and we're just sitting there wearing them out you know and they're not catching them at all right right um and that's when they start running over you yeah yeah that's it that's when it gets a little frustrating yeah you gotta move and find somewhere else well cool let's dive into um some of the baits that that you like to fish and i like to fish um kind of colors you know size and and then go into how we like to fish them so i'll let you start start first let's start with like casting and jigging and then go through that casting and checking all right so what i what i like is something pink was the magic color last year yeah um so whatever you got pink was was pretty much working but just um imagine this is pink i like to take some i like to take something like this and um a tip that helps me out um passed down from kevin colley himself would be upgrade the split ring and put an old doa shrimp hook and what that enables you to do is you're kind of tossing i order all these off of lime these are like cheap molded casting jigs they work just as good as anyone you would buy in the tackle shop i feel like um you know the the the the plus you get from the tackle shop is good split rings good hooks these are all garbage they come in a package like this and and you can i can pretty much just take these out of the pack and straighten that hook right now so that they're gonna have to be replaced anyway i like to put a single j hook and um what that allows you to do is you you might not hook as many fish but you the fish you do hook you keep pinned and you can also you can also um you know muscle down and crank something in with this hook this is like a i mean i think mustad or vmc i don't know what doa uses but it's i'm pretty sure it's a mustang hook it's stout man it's um it's a stout hook you can i'll j i i this is the same setup that i use to jig fish on the bottom um you i've definitely caught 40 plus inch reds on this with tight drag you're able just to muscle them into the boat and you're in the um bonito and and and albies and stuff like that it just seems like you lose so many right at the boat trying to land them they just pull the hook or shake the hook or whatever and like this right here the the landing ratio is just so much better just having that like you can just flip them in man you can build dancing for sure so um and you know that's pretty much what i'm running you know you can go smaller you can go heavier this is a 17 gram this one's gonna the flutter on these little 17 grams i mean they're not really heavy but they're they're heavy enough to with with trout tackle you can still sling them a country mile so um and and they have that little flutter um which is kind of what you're looking for when you're sub surface jigging these we talked about it earlier um they are you know they very pointy at at the top so if you are casting and and um at busting fish they will skip a little bit you know flat side yeah i mean it's even like plain it's like it's like meant to do that i don't know it makes it harder for the fish to eat it which is not ever what you want right right it can be a very natural presentation for sure but when it's staying just under the surface they definitely can grab it so i would even say for subsurface this is definitely the best you're able to jig it you're able to yo-yo it it even has like a little flutter when you reel it it causes it i think that just that being that thin in the middle causes it to kick when you're reeling it in which gives them some action um and speaking of size too that's one of the fun things about the bonita is is like sometimes throwing a bigger jig helped out you know yeah a lot of times i feel like you're smaller the smaller the better and sometimes they'll get on a certain bait and it really doesn't matter yeah you know having a little bit of stouter rod to throw a heavier jig can definitely you know can definitely help grab somebody this is one that i'm excited to throw like this guy that makes these cheeks for him um he uh he's putting all these he's got all these like crazy little add-ons now but this little flashy tail and then using this have you have you jigged much near short with a cyst hooks as opposed to like james so yes so there's actually cabela's makes a makes a like a small near shore jig and they're always out of stock there's some guy whoever you are that buys all the cabela's jigs online it's just like incredible they'll come in stock on like a friday and then they're all gone so you don't get it but they're like this big and they do have those two assistants um and i think it i think it helps for me like for like grunts and stuff like if you're like near shore jigging like sea bass or grunts or anything that's gonna on the bottom smack a jig like that i think for um and you definitely keep them pinned more than you would do in these little trebles these like stock trebles um but i think for me i like this and i mentioned before um because i like to put a gulp on there sometimes yeah yeah and so like you can put those little gulp like like a three-inch shrimp or like a curly tail on this and it just gives it that doesn't want to slide off the hook pad or since it's kind of sharply vanished it's on there man so uh and even if it does come back a little bit like it doesn't matter it's just there for like it gives it like a like a weird like swirly action and it is for more than anything i feel like it just smells yeah a little sound um so why is that shrimp biting the butt of that bait fish i don't know i gotta figure it out sure so but yeah that's sweet i uh i haven't played around with tipping the jigs with a gold but man i fished with a guy local here who like we went out a couple years ago and he was chicken and i'm fishing a bucktail and gold for flounder and um uh he he's he's fishing this and just like i mean stomping out stomping me man like over and over again i'm like okay let me see what you i'll try it out that's awesome yeah so is that your go-to for floundering out too if you're fighter fishing if i'm not fishing like there's con like there's areas like the other side of the shoals that i just always do better with live bait yeah but like in the clear water that we have i feel like they see like you're jigging this up i think that's the case because it's just loaded down there and you can just flip that live bait and catch it but here like um on a little more um heavily fished areas i think they're they see that like i'm jigging this pretty high and then just like serving it back down on the bottom yeah and you'll catch gray trout you'll catch grunts on this thing you'll catch i mean red i've caught i've been on a spot fishing with a guy with live bait and you're just catching redfish after redfish with this thing just because it's like a reaction bit they can see it in the water column from a long way off yeah it's coming up and falling coming up falling down that it catches their eyes flashy and they come out and they and they eat it so yeah this is this is the the deal um he actually it's it's a southern blind fish yeah yeah he caught a big kobe on this one that's super cool i mean that if y'all take anything from this podcast it's start rigging your jigs like that because another thing you talked about on our first recording that died is like how versatile that is yeah wherever your bottom you know bouncing the bottom and albacore pop up or whatnot there's some fish yeah you just pop the gulp off and you already have a casting jig i mean it's it's just adding that gulp to that allow i mean i've made some flounder on metal jigs but yeah they don't typically eat them very well no it's adding that well i think they they i've definitely caught like i'll go out on a lot of times by myself and i'll just be jigging this yeah and i'm definitely caught you know i think it's more so than how you're doing it for the flounder it's like it's not like a like jig jig jig jig it's like up up up and then you're just like you just like ease it down to the watch it's just kind of it's a slow thing and they just grab it yeah yeah but um definitely the gulp helps i feel like flounder just like gulp man i don't know um just the heavy scent feeders um dude i was on the berkeley website last night trying to order some stuff oh no everything is out of stock i mean i went through every one of their jerk baits and every single color i was going to get some jerk baits and everyone was uh i didn't look at the goal but if you uh if you were just doing power bait you're just looking like the power bait no i was just looking at their hard baits okay every hard bait was out of stock so hopefully they're cool i mean there's a lot of gulp at intercoastal angler in the taco shops right now but but if you want to have the tackle you need for the spring go ahead and buy it right now because it's anything like last year and i know people haven't caught back up it's like no no one's called back up man i was talking to um i'm doing um trying to put together a tournament man and i was talking to a couple um boat boat dealers and manufacturers and they're like um we're honestly not doing anything like that this year because like we don't have any boats so it's kind of like it's like it's one of those things where like they'll sell everything they get but they can't get anything i mean they have like a bay boat in the center console and a lot that normally has you know two million dollars what i've heard they've done too is like they're going to be getting more boats throughout the summer but they're all already they're so painful you know they're sold yeah so they drive past some depot dealerships in town they look like they're out of business but really they're doing better than ever but they're just worried they're not going to be able to they don't have the inventory to match the demand right now at all right um dude that's a whole other conversation as far as like our economy or what it's going to do right now yes but it's definitely not a conversation for this podcast or one for me to have you know either so well cool that's something that i'm going to definitely start doing more of is and i got a bunch of these like like the tie flies on that mustang this these the it's just this is the two mustang hook um this one i believe is the this one came out of a doa shrimp i believe or maybe not it's a little short um this one's a three alt so whatever whatever one's in the the doa shrimp if you get the tail bitten off or whatever just take that put it in a hook keep or a cup holder and then now you have a now you have a casting tube yeah that's sweet that's super cool um i i want to say take a break for one second uh after this podcast me and zayn are going to jump on and record another about 10 15 minutes talking about it's completely relevant to this but we're going to dive into spring speckled trout fishing and just kind of some of the stuff that we look for in the spring i meant to say that at the beginning of the podcast but um if you do like the podcast you go check out our patreon page and we'll be over there talking about um about spring's pickle trout fishing it's a great time of year to catch big fish we're gonna be dropping gps locations locations no we won't be doing that i don't want anyone to go over there and sign up for it expecting the gps locations but but we'll get back into it i thought it was a good little segue time um so i think one the one part we've missed about the jigging um is the retrieve like what is the retrieve as far as for bonita let's talk about being an alcohol because you'll see both of them so what what's the big difference in the retreat so there was definitely times out there um you know in the past last year years years years past um that they want a varied retrieve where you're kind of like jigging it really yeah let that sink jiggly like this yeah it's kind of going like this through the water and i don't know if that's because you're trying to find where they're at or if they're just like sitting below it watching that yeah um and then there was times where like they would not eat it unless it was dropped to the bottom and just burned all the way in i mean as fast as you can and a great way to break a rod tip too um i had i had one eat it like i could see my jig and then there's like out of nowhere i almost dropped the rocks on it i just like caught you like oh god yeah but um so uh that that is what i'm doing i'm i'm casting i think i said this before i'm not vertically jigging i mean you that is definitely a way to do it i'm casting like i'm i'm setting up on structure as i would set up on structure in four foot of water to trout fish like i'm backing off a good casting distance away from that and i think that gives you the time to give them to see that jig and then follow it like it's like you got to think about where they're oriented in your cast yeah and if you're sitting right on top of where they want to hang out in my mind they're just like just they're just wherever that structure their your fishing is they're just kind of on the outside circling that structure and they're looking for any type of bait fish that's holding on that structure that they can't get to to leave that safety of that structure and become accessible to that bonito so when you're casting over the structure over the ledge or whatever you're doing you know a pelagic fish isn't gonna like a red like a like a redfish will bust up in that ledge and bust up the school of bait or whatever and because he's just cut from a different cloth you know they can nose into that rock and whatever and dig and dig for crabs well you know bonito's not going to do that you know they're a pla they're pelagic they're they don't they they don't have tough skin they're not going to be nosing into any type of structure they're they they're going to capitalize on whatever is outside of the safety of that structure so the one fish the one fish that makes the mistake so you're hoping that they think your jig is that one fish and you're casting you know past the structure letting it sink down to the level of the structure and then bringing it back to the boat as fast as you can sometimes varying or trees sometimes just to the point where they're going to think oh no there's one that was just there and now it's going oh getting away and then they'll just come hammer it is the goal anyway um that's a really good way to put it like and for me what that kind of opened my eyes to is like one thing i haven't thought about i'm not always thinking about where i'm orienting on the structure like i want to be on the structure but also putting yourself in a place that your whole cast is really pretty you're in the zone longer than like i mean i mean if you're trying to you know i feel like any time you're fishing with artificials you're trying to recreate a a scenario that would be happening anyway how often is there like a sardine just bolting towards the top straight up i mean probably never so it's it's good to have that and it's just like i mean you know as well as anyone like trout fishing like you can and it's always like i learn a lot i fish with a lot of bass guys man and like you learn a lot about like like you know they a lot of times current isn't always a factor there but right but the boat positioning and and the angle of retrieve is like matters so like i'll i fish with a guy man he'll he's a he's a he's a crankbait nut so like he's a weirdo anyway but he'll he'll fish a stump in a lake but he'll fish like a pinwheel around that thing and he'll cast 12 times at that stump and beat the stump with the crankbait every time and he'll catch that fish on the eighth cast dude like at a different angle he's circling that stump so i feel like it's you know just like you know i try to do that with trout fishing you know any time you got to figure out what swing they want or in the current or um so they're choosing especially like a bass but also a bonita but they're choosing where they think is going to be the best place for them to sit ambush a bait so right sometimes that bass is going to turn around and eat it the opposite yeah yeah yeah sure but most of the time he's waiting for that one bait fish that come over to the right direction and then he's gonna eat it that way yep that's the same thing was bonita you can imagine like if they're swimming and yeah i see with redfish so often like if i've got a school of redfish this time of year it can be a thousand redfish and they're swimming directly away from me and i throw out in front of them and i bring that jig back through them right at their faces a lot of times i will never get a bunch right yep um and it's because it takes a lot more effort and i think their little small mental capacity is like all right by the time i turn around on this bait and get to it yeah wasted energy waste of energy and waste of time i'm not gonna be able to catch it sure um it's gonna take off and but but i think that's probably the same thing with the bonita they're swimming so fast that when you bring a jig through them they're probably not turning around you've got to get that quartering angle on where they're at and maybe that's that could be complete maybe a little too technical yeah but who knows but i mean definitely with the albacore you'll see sometimes too like throwing and bringing oh my face that won't eat it yeah no you gotta yeah it's gotta be their idea just like anything angle yeah letting them feel like they found it for sure yeah um so does color play i know you said pink was the hot one last year is there any other colors that you'll play with i think the worst color i did with last year was just like something like this which is like makes sense that i would bring this one as the example but um it looks like it's been chewed up this one's been chewed up by a bunch of spanish so or maybe great trout who knows but um anyway the shiny like um metallic silver color that would would be like what you would want for king mackerel or um or spanish mackerel or whatever did not was not the winner for the benito the winner for the bonito was something um you know let me see that this one that one yeah that's the one i mean this is blue this was made by someone else that this it has this little tiny metallic strip so it's still able to catch the sun and a little little flash but it's this just the matte finished non-metallic finished pink or blue or this little color it's a little too shiny but that yes well something like this man um you know i think i had i think i had some like um some like sardine pattern like sardine green or whatever like like a like a matte green um with a white you know it was different mold in this but very similar but it was just green on the top white on the bottom and that one strip running down the middle and flash um and and that that did it i was you know i was using these last year as well um these are these are cheap and these fish do have teeth so it's kind of um what i like to do is have a few of these on the boat and two nice ones and keep them in the tackle box and then if these aren't working because some days they like you said they were eating everything right right um and then some days it was like the most finicky fish that i feel like there was man um so i like that color yeah that's a good one that's a good color yeah you know what you could do with these too that the paint's coming off if you built yourself a lure turner like that yeah you could you could paint them in epoxy just epoxy top coat them yeah you would never ever lose yeah it would stay on there so i mean that would that that lower turner right there you can't see on the camera but that's a like a 30 uh grill rotisserie thing that i mounted on that thing yeah so the only thing man is like i feel like with these like i feel like the the better they get like this i feel like they work better for like the bottom fish oh just kind of beat up just like looking weird looking like kind of metallic kind of white i don't know let them get like that and then paint them then keep them forever um well sweet well let's did you catch any this color right here is crazy yeah it's like a yes it looks like those are the those these colors right here work really good on like the other side of the shoals bottom the night fish the big reds yeah yeah i like that color sunburst oh well cool let's move into go from casting to uh we're still casting let's let's talk about trolling a little bit but let's talk about this so what this is a usury magmino they make them in different weights um i don't know the weight of this one but um basically it's it's a heavy it's a sinking hard bait um and i don't know if it's designed to troll it or designed to cast it or whatever but it casts really well that the weight transfer is good and you're able to cast it at busting fish and for me what this gave me the ability to do last year was when those fish are seem to be busting in one spot i'm able to kind of keep this bait there it's i'm working it like i would kind of work a you know a mirror or really or well i guess faster than a mueller but you're kind of just like twitch twitch twitch stop it and then it'll sit there and kind of sink down a lot of times they would grab it on that pause um and you're also able to you know cast that past them and crank it through them just like you would a metal i just feel like a lot of times there's it always happens to me man um like you'll like fish will come up um and you're able to make one cast on them and then like you you've realized that like if you're still watching the fish bust in front of you when you've already realized like i'm not going to catch them this time right so this gives you the ability to kind of keep this i think this one goes down like like five feet and just stops and there's also um i don't even know if they i think so i think they've turned this line of stuff into the what is now the yoseri vibe the vibe okay yeah so like they make a they make a small vibe which i think i need to go in and order now um now that i just thought of that but um it just it gives you the ability to fish a hard bait that's still got that metallic the pink um and you're able to kind of keep it in their zone um longer than you would be able to do with like a piece of metal or whatever yeah that's cool that's super cool yep um it's funny man those fish like sometimes they want it slow sometimes when they're fast like with the albacore and the bonita and i know you've done it i've talked to elias he's done it like bringing back a bottom sleeper jig or like smack it yeah caroline treats jake real fast and you end up hooking them on that like yeah they're they're just they're aggressive they're fired up you get something in front of them this time of year they'll eat it they'll eat it yeah i've never caught them with soft plastics ever yeah so man i didn't bring a example of that with me and i might leave one here anyway the um arrowhead tackle company that makes a it's a bloody mind he makes a one ounce bullet head jig he'll paint whatever color you want yeah and you can order bulk order from his website you can order you can get up with him on instagram arrowhead at arrowhead tackle company and so yeah he's he's like yeah yeah um so the the the web the it's just a plain near shore jig man but if you put a fluke if you put a zeman fluke on that thing a white one um that's what i call it more i caught more albies on that on that this year than yeah man it's just like a oh sweet yeah yeah just a good it's just like there's nothing there's nothing spec it just it's streamlined it goes through the water good you're able to jig the bottom with it and you're able to cast that thing as little as much line as you have on your real dude um yeah it's a good tool to have in your bag for sure and it's just it's like i said it's nothing special it's a it's a solid um good hook that you can sharpen like those hooks are not something you're gonna have though you're not gonna have to throw this jig away after you use it a few times you can here they are yep you can you can um you know sharpen those and he'll and like i said he'll paint them whatever color you want um i love this one dude the orange green well it's like it's pink or that one might be on oh it does have some pink in it yeah i like the pink and green and i put that like cotton candy um zeeman like seven inch or five inch um jerk shad and and on like clear water deep redfish love that thing man i don't know why i think the cool thing about that too like you're saying the versatility like you have with that longer hook on that jig is you can jig it on the bottom and then you can just and those are in a a five inch diesel minnow on that thing oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i would definitely if you're going to be casting it to where i i've never done well with paddle tails for the for the football fish no you just wanted to kind of you want to just a dart and it'll kind of it'll kick i mean there's action there yeah but you don't want the paddle tail you want the the jerk shadow fluke style bait that's sweet um so i know we talked about this in the last but now it's starting to run together in my head i'm like all right the one that we lost did we talk about that on that one but let's move into some of the trolling scenarios him i know that's not your preference or my preference but we both certainly know how to do it definitely a it's definitely an effect it's a productive and effective tactic so um if you're into trolling um i think i brought this this is just a crystal minnow deep diver um this is like the medium-sized one yeah um there's a smaller one than this i don't think you can go wrong i've definitely caught 30-pound kingfish on the tiny one so i mean it's it's flash it's kicking i always if i'm gonna troll um i'll get one that like uh they have the feet that it's supposed to get down on this on the box i'll try to vary that to wherever i'm troll like if i have one of these on the left i'll put a more shallow running down on the right and turn a little sharper yep and here they'll definitely eat spoons i think they were eating back to the pink color um last year i have a buddy who um runs a big boat and was troll doing trips trolling for him last year and he was catching him on the this solid pink dr not drone spoon but clark clark spoon um yeah so um definitely an effective tactic i think um you know what what is good to mention at this point a good segue was if there is someone casting at these fish like it and vice versa if there's someone trolling you know cutting in front of them and casting at these fish is would be i would be considered disrespectful and i think it's equally as disrespectful if someone is set up casting at these fish and and you uh you troll right past them and you know so i think a good thing to mention would be like if there's some if you came out there to troll and there's someone sitting um there casting i think a respectful distance away a safe distance away and try casting for them you know get have a couple of these jigs in your boat um if the bite's not there maybe you say like hey you guys want troll or you troll for them or um you know troll pass them or buy them or or whatever but just when you come so close to someone that's casting you're kind of ruining that and just i've seen just as many scenarios where especially on the albacore um and in spanish you'll have people out there trolling and you know trying to troll for these fish and people cut them off and cast for them it's just it's all about it's all about respect when you're out there on the water and just be respectful of each other treat people like you want to be treated um always but especially out there on the ocean man um plenty of room plenty of room um so but i think like like i said like fishing for them with jigs if you're out there casting jigs with these fish you know come up just be respectful put your trolling motor down drop your anchor do whatever but just come off a plane and approach you know the area slowly try not to throw a big wake um it's just all about you know like i said keeping it cool out there on the water man so uh trolling trolling the drone spoons and clark spoons is definitely an effective tactic just as well as these deep divers i think you'll probably get more strikes on the deep divers just this is pretty much trolling for anything i think you'll probably on the deep divers get more strikes if they are in that um water column within that zone i think you'll definitely catch more on the on on spoons yeah definitely um and you can catch them so much quicker when you're casting you know what i mean like yeah you hook one on a deep diver or especially like a planer rig with a spoon are you are you telling much you're just trying to show yourself yeah yeah i would say you'll yeah i would i would you yes i kind of miss them yeah they come these these come with treble hooks i'm guessing you could put something like this on their inline j hooks yeah they've got those those ones that are for top waters yeah inline j-hooks and you'll probably keep them pinned these things just scare me when you have a fish on man you just like i feel like you uh you lose probably at least at least half of the fish that eat those you lose them and i don't know if i'm fishing with too tight of a drag with them or something like that what it boils down to man is is if you're gonna fish troubles of any on any lure you need a lot of giving odds right if you've got a heavy uh there we go if you've got a heavier rod tip on it there's really no give and so that you and it's like loosening the drag i've seen doesn't really affect it at all it just needs to have that give where it's keeping the same amount of pressure as that fish pulls you know sure so a lot of times fishing these are like maybe a little bit stouter live bait rod yeah uh like your king macaron or something like that could do better and i usually if i'm trolling i'll fish the uh the little ones or a fish that they're going to i've got some little ones that are like this green and blue yeah they do real well and then i do fish the spoons a lot on number two planters yeah um but playing around with the depth having a couple different deep divers having a couple different sized planers yeah and i think a good thing a good thing to keep in mind for people who like trolling and i see this happen so much out there and it just um if you're if you're trolling for fish and you and you're making a circle or making a loop or doing whatever you're doing i think it's good to have that and you know a lot of them have that man overboard feature you can just store a waypoint like if you catch one then hit the button on the on the on the or just kind of look around where you're at but you know electronics just hit the button where you caught that fish and then continue to make that loop and then if you catch another one there and another one there and then they're all in the general same general area well those fish are you got to think what's going on below the surface those fish are holding to something so it would probably work out to to you know stop trolling for a minute bring the lines in go to that location where you're catching those fish and try catching them on jigs i think you were talking about earlier you'll definitely like for the time it takes you to get a fish in on this do back the circle get the line back out you could have caught three on this man and it's like they're they'll get fired up and you we were talking about it last time man like there will be like a 30 minute period or 15 minute period where like you can't not catch one right and i think having having the ability to use a jig and sit over top of them or cast these fish gives you the ability to capitalize on that short bite and i mean yeah you've got to be more dialed in exact area where they want to be but if you if you find that area the jig is going to really let you yeah and i think and i and i mentioned like i i trolling is a very effective way to find fish man so like if you're out there and you don't have good electronics or if you don't out there i mean you can certainly do this and john's john boats out there last year doing it so there are some tiny boats on some gnarly days one more time i had a buddy i had a buddy come to town and he's he's a seaworthy man so it was like really sporty and i was like dude let's just run out there because i think one thing that needs to be mentioned is how good these fish are taste oh yeah the atlantic bonito is like one of the my favorite fish to eat and last year i would i was bringing out this glass bowl of uh a little bit of lemon juice and i was just tossing them in there and then putting some soy sauce and some yeah eating them raw man well it wasn't really having time to cook it so i got yeah whatever um but yeah man yeah i was just i had that on my leaning post and we're just catching them and eating just living look that's awesome um so uh yeah god i got distracted with food again what was i how quickly you can cast to them and catch them small boats small boats yeah there was some guys out there and so and it was like a day that in my boat i was like well let's just bust out there real quick and come back and it was like four foot seas and white capping and um i get out there and there's like three john boats i'm like kind of embarrassing and i was like tell i was like talking it up it's going to be sporty when you get out there there's like some dude in a one of those 14 foot bug busters who is do you know what i'm talking about that gray one that wasn't with a little bell yeah that's like a it's like a high tide but bug buster who is that does it have a polling platform no it doesn't i haven't seen that it has like a or it may now it didn't then i don't know if you added a polling platform but that guy was like on it i'd be out there like scared on a bait not scared but like puckered up on the bay boat he's out there but yeah not to be encouraged i guess but hey man whatever gets it done the water's still cold this time that time of year like yeah it's not safe i mean hypothermic is definitely below 60 degree water temperatures you're definitely flirting with hypothermia so yeah just definitely as always on the water especially in deep water so um but yeah i mean that's that's kind of what it boils down to if you're trying to figure out what to do if you're if you've got to try to relocate them the trolling can definitely be helpful but if you kind of know where you need to be the casting can be quickly or quicker quickly or quickly more quickly more quickly or productive no you can be you can catch them quicker and be more productive sometimes they get i think they got what you meant yeah you got your pointer i'll go over it one more time now i'm just kidding but yeah i mean just having a variety of jigs variety of lures to troll um can be important now let's talk one thing we haven't talked about is the rods you like to throw these on man let's talk about when you're jigging i mean does it vary between the jig and the casting kind of crankbait so not really i'm using like a medium light um medium fast just this whatever i'm using for redfish um inshore i'm using you know light pretty light tackle um you know light rods 2000 3000 spinner reels 15 pound braid 10 pound braid on some reels nothing nothing heavy um i think uh last year i was using um i guess i was using more out i found it helpful to use more like a like about an 18 inch st piece of stiff leader so like heavier leader than you would normally need like 40 pound um and it just helps when you get this thing in the boat and it doesn't end up like all tangled up yeah man you know just you know trout tackle man yeah um pretty pretty much you know when you're trolling um you know i have some you know conventional like conventional reels and rods that i'll i'll throw on for trolling just because they sit in those rod holders better yeah um but um yeah just you know normal light tackle you don't have to buy anything specific anything that you're going to go out and throw a top water plug with in the morning you can certainly um go out and toss around a piece of metal i like it um is there this is going to be a harder question to answer than to kind of just do on the boat but drag wise on the bite like where where do you want that drag kind of set um so i i had it a lot tighter than you would do like if you're normally casting these in spanish if you're if you're uh if you are familiar with that i was doing it much tighter just because they do have a little bit more of a um tougher mouth you can actually get that in there um i was what i was doing last year was i was like having it not cranked down but relatively tight and then you'll get that like with these fish it's always like rip rip rip rip the rod loads up you feel a head shake and then kind of like once you get them up off the bottom you can kind of loosen that drag a little bit and let them do that just they'll run until they're tired and then you kind of you don't like the verse of a lot of fishing where you'll tighten the dragon right just give it a little bit just loosen it up and let them do their thing and and and just be mindful of i'm using a lot of like i use i have a um like my three thousand four thousand rules are tsunami the shields and then like my light tackle um is like two thousand the bg's the diamonds and um those bg's are great for casting and trout fishing and redfish but like their spool is so tiny the 2000's are so tiny so like a couple times last year i was out there just having fun i'm like oh crap like almost yeah you can see the little rubber black backing in there so uh yeah just uh you don't have to have it too too loose but they're explosive fish and just like any explosive fish they can they can definitely pop some lime man for sure for sure uh one thing i will share is uh you know if you haven't caught albacore or bonito before they will change direction real quickly oh you'll be going one way and then completely change and fly back the other way and you think you lost them yeah yeah i had a few clients last year they would like like kind of the same way like oh it's gone and they're like doing something else and it's like and and with that they'll break your rock like oh yeah they'll go away from the boat and they'll turn to come straight at the pressure yep and they'll break it and someone will be sitting there you know i lost i broke so many rods last year dude though and they'll go around and just pop you on the goblins yeah that's so so be careful yeah you know don't think the fish is off until you've got the jig back sure yeah it's crazy sometimes especially near the boat you'll watch them like go 10 feet one way turn fly the other way 15 feet i did a four person trip last year out there and it was like um one of those days man where it was just like everyone had a fit like all the i feel like from the time we came off plane to the time we jet back in like someone had official yeah and um and it was i had a video i was standing up on the back of the boat and they were i just i was filming dudes like trying to that's funny that's all you're like i'm enjoying watching it yeah watching you guys struggling with the rise oh man well cool well let's uh i think is there anything else we need to touch on about the we're at where dude we're in an hour so uh let's see going over color size you know changing those hooks up that's another thing some of the baits you get will have some pretty terrible treble hooks on them dude like these are garbage man like uh oh like you could take these out here and like i mean i can just like straighten that hook right now oh yeah okay so you know test it a little bit if you can do that with your thumb change the hooks yeah you can buy trouble it's pretty cheap and you know color doesn't really matter as far as this fish is the hooks like more of a white color or metallic black right yeah it doesn't matter no no no man don't you know that spanish only eat gold hooks i have heard that gold bear hugs but yeah that's the only other thing i can really think about is change it you know fish these you can try fishing these assist hooks a little bit but they're i think they're more so designed for digging on them yeah yeah because it keeps that hook straight up yeah yeah straight up and down when that fish grabs it but um yeah i mean definitely uh change the hooks out a little bit style these are some mustad trebles that that hold up pretty well and uh it's all about the j-hook it's hard to really see these it's all about the j-hook yeah i'm telling you once you i mean what i mean i just like the versatility i guess is just what really helps me just like you said you like you can go bottom fish with these and don't even have to like change rods you can rip this to the top and make a cast and catch a i'm going to have to try that out so well guys i think that's it for for our benito we might try to get out and do a little video catching them at some point when they show up but um if you have any questions or comments leave them you can leave them on the youtube video we'll try to answer them if we didn't answer them already um and i think that's it remember we're going to go over and record for patreon right now just a little bit about spring trout fishing kind of some of the stuff that we look for book a trip book a trip yes if you want to go catch some bonito if you want to have some fun and they're great table fare i think they are delicious one of my favorite definitely my favorite in this species like the mackerel gums the mackerel variant these are by far i mean you just seared on the grill eating raw whatever man they're just really mild tasting like great flaky fish they are yeah there's kind of like when you're saying that it just reminded last year there's like always this little buzz in the air during when bonita around because everyone's just kind of stoked everyone's happy to go get something yeah it's a fun it's a fun time it's a good thing if you're not doing it on your own boat and even if you have your own boat call us i mean it it's a cool type of fishery that we're happy to share with and there's so much man like so many like last year we would go out and catch 10 or 15 of these things and you have a big cooler full of fish and you can go i mean there's so much going on in the spring trout fishing not to mention it was very good last year and consistent more consistent year than i've had on the spring trout pretty much ever yeah last year it's really good um so trout sheep's head is just like insane this time of year and it's the big ones man you're getting those migratory fish that are moving back up into you know chesapeake bay even more north to new jersey or whatnot so uh it's a good time to go out there and get it all done there's plenty to do so yeah it can be a very productive and species a lot of riding your species fall and spring for me it's like i know i wake up every morning i have no clue what i'm gonna plus turkey season too so i know i uh dude i mentioned to do some turkey hunting but yeah but yeah so uh i'll link all zane stuff on here it's falling top falling tide

crossed the road barefoot oh like oh my gosh it's fine it's healthy you've got your headphones and that's what counts i admire the dedication right there okay fantastic so without any further ado let's get into it shall we so our adventure takes place our adventure takes place on the new world a massive continent full of intrigue and fantasy across the kingslands we find many different cities and towns that are built the vast city of the vast city of dawn haven covir dagger guard black gate up to the north we have the blue stone city of aegis just below it smiling next to the crystal blue sea is a harbor of ages as we zoom in closer from our eagle's eye view we can see a lot of activity going on down at the harbour several ships are docked up sailors and workers carrying cargo off and on we see several merchants and traders set up along their stools along the seaside a lot of lots of activity a lot of hustle and bustle going on down there now um of course it is a harbor so there are several inns alongside the harbour in one such inn we find a individual she's sitting um alone at a table nursing nursing a small a small flagon of ale she has placed um her black pointy hat off onto the side and she is gazing around the room sigi very quickly could you give us a very brief description of what your character looks like um so my character is a female um she's a human so she looks very much like me uh red hair uh tall but um not too tall you know like not six foot one tall like a normal like an average jane you know you wouldn't pick her out but you wouldn't you know forget her it she blends in with the background sure um siggy as your character sits there um as if you don't mind me using your character name as our celia um since they're at the table um you sort of drum your fingers against the wooden um the wooden top of the table looking around a little bit impatiently as the thought crosses your mind they're late um the bartender glances over to you as he cleans his glasses this is my default for cleaning glasses by the way i still have to raise my hands to do my actions and just that's even worse never mind we'll go back to that um the bartender is cleaning glasses he saw glances over in your direction sees that you're still nursing your flag and unveiling carries on um across the in there's a little bit of activity going on a few sailors a few traders have sat down there appears to be um some sort of wrestling match going off um in the corner um and all of a sudden you hear coming from from one side of the inn and you see um this person wearing much clothing but just enough to um to appear decent standing up with a victorious arm in the air and you see his opponent from the arm wrestling match sort of nursing his wounded arm against the against the wooden top of the table gekko would you like to give us a very quick description of what your character looks like all right so he's quite tall six too at least um he has one eye looks like he's been [Music] beaten multiple times um obviously he's he's a monk so um it's part of his training um he has tattoos over most of his upper torso shoulders arms and over his face like the sides of his head big tunnel earrings looks looks really really you know beefy but he's a sweetheart okay gecko as you stand up victorious from your arm wrestling match your opponent who you just beat looks up at you and slides five silver pieces across the table going that was a good bow we'll do it again once you're back on shore be seeing you later gekko stands up and leaves the table as you glance around the inn you spot your crewmate or celia sitting at the other table you stride over to the other side and stand next hello how'd you do this fine night not bad not bad flexes [Music] i see the drink has already taken you a little bit just a little bit gecko as you say this um you see the bartender materializing behind you wanna be for the victor in one glass everything yes we got some pretty strong stuff but i guess you can handle it can't you and he turns around to fix you up one of everything within one glass as you sit down the wooden door swing at the wooden door to the end swings open and in walks a [Music] well the first thing you notice is that the shadow cast by the afternoon sun outside appears to be a little bit smaller than one would first expect into the inn walks a creature that does stand out a little bit even though it stands on two legs um uh it's glossy fur sort of um reflects the sun coming in from the outside and there's a quick as its tail um whisks through the air um magic man would you like to give us a quick description of your character yeah of course so um my character is very small um he looks to be like your average everyday house cat but he is uh he he keeps himself you know he stands he stands on his back legs he's about i'd say maybe two feet high he carries with him a weapon that seems a bit bigger than he should be able to manage to use um he does have an eye patch over his uh his right eye and um [Music] he's very what weapon does he have on his back um it is a uh it's it's it should be a modified version of a short sword because a short sword might be a bit too big for him to carry but he calls it a short sword okay cecil as you walk into the inn you notice your crewmates off to the side what would you like to do um so i would like to sort of pounce and bound quickly over towards them and jump up on a stool next to them okay um for the sake of theatrics um give me a performance role on on roll 20. so go ahead and type in it's a b roll 1d20 and then plus whatever your modifier is uh that came out as a three okay all right that's fun so um you notice um a couple of crates that that have sort of been um stacked up off to the off to one side of the in that sort of lineup leading towards the table where your teammates are sitting down you pounce very gracefully onto the first one and with the momentum you make a second leap onto the second one however in your efforts to razzle and dazzle you don't notice that the second crate is actually partly open and as you plummet into the uh slightly open crate you are surrounded by the very strong smell um of the sea as you land in a crate that is full of fresh fish um oh you you fish yourself out no pun intended and make your way towards the table with your crewmates um slightly more aromatic than when you first entered the okay um i would like to uh wave at everyone hello and then lick the fish off my paw sure all right okay it tastes it tastes exactly like you want it to taste freshly cooked just this morning right as you um come up to the table uh the bartender appears again echo one of everything he places this very large very large flagon down in front of you as you peer inside of it you can see there's this almost almost solid car like um substance that's very gently for some reason circulating inside the flagon itself it also appears to be giving off a slight smoky vapor to it perfect nothing this is everything i trained i trained for perfect okay there's nothing in this in this tavern that i cannot handle would you like to go ahead and take a swig of it yes all right okay um as you put your lips to the glass and heave it down you realize huh when he when you said one of everything the bartender really did understand one of everything you taste a variety of different flavors um including uh ale beer whiskey you're pretty sure you detected the infamous and exotic dragon fire ale mixed in there as well somewhere and as you take huge gulp and set it back down you let out loud belch and very very small blue flames suddenly flicker out of your mouth as you do so yep there was definitely dragon fire ale in that you see the bartender turning to you cecil uh you want a source of milk for the cats i i want to look up at the bartender because that's what's going to happen and uh sort of in a macho sort of way to try and keep my dignity i sort of one sorcerer milk coming right up and you see him bustle off as you do so the wooden doors of the end swing open once more this time revealing a more averagely proportioned shadow cast by the afternoon sun and into the tavern walks the fourth member of your established crew hammer time would you be so kind as to give us a description of your character of course so you see a middle-aged man in his late 40s early 50s he seems to be wearing chain mail i mean you know him by now um the classic blue chain mail of his order he has gray hair and a long beard he's also missing one eye like many of you but uh he he doesn't wear an eye patch he leaves it on display shall we say um he's also wearing his signature tricorn hat and has a cigar smoking in his mouth as you step into the room facts you see the rest of your crewmates and you start to make your way towards the table and you razzle on dazzle as you walk there um not so much razzle and dazzle but um i just walk into the walking to the end like i own the place kind of look around i'm content with what i see and walk up to my crew sit down look right at gekko and say hey it's time for you to pay me that drink you owe me indeed slides my glass forward let's see what this in has to offer and i down it you down the whole thing no yes i do yes yes give me a constitution check if you don't mind [Music] just read it out for me because i'm i've got other things on the screen i got the nine how much nine oh we're doing really well today okay fantastic so um that's not so bad this is your first drink um just make okay so um as you down the drink um you've had your fear of intoxicating beverages in the past folks uh you immediately notice the wide variety of different flavors and that have been mixed into this beverage um after you place the drink back down you feel a certain just just a very the slightest tinge of wooziness come over you just for a moment you tap your chest a couple of times and let out a belch um the belch comes out as a moderate plume of blue fire that sort of blazes in front of you for a moment before receding um before receding backwards into your mouth ah dragon fire ale the ice type your favorites this is a good end i ordered two more okay the same thing again yes sir all right okay we can handle it um a source of meat uh source of milk clatters down not meat a sauce or milk clatters down in front of you as well cecil any lassi will he be having another one um at this point i move seats so i don't sit in front of either both of them so that i don't get you know the blast after their drinks um and i'll ask just just a fire air what's your preference whatever you got surprise me we got fury we got icm we got acidy let's go with fairy here he is yeah and he marches off to grab your drinks as he does so you notice um an individual approaching your table very plainly dressed um in fact so much so he did not really stand out in the crowd earlier this individual has um is uh a human an overlooking human with um white hair that sort of curls slightly as it comes down his head to form sort of a bowl haircut all the way around it like this um he's also got a mustache that sort of come comes down about this much and then curls upwards towards uh towards his chin again um sorry not a mustache a beard i was going to get to the mustache and moment he also has a white massage that sort of curls like this inwards for him um he also you notice has um the hair coming out of his ears appear to even curl as well um he's somewhere in his maybe early 70s something like that his skin is a little bit wrinkled he's got a couple of um a couple of warts with little white hairs poking out of them of course curling as well and he's wearing um a sort of dark dusty trench coat with a belt um a large white belt that sort of slung over it off to the side he walks up to the table um the four of you glance upwards you know that you had been sent here by the crosstied company to meet someone a man by the name of theodore excuse me theodore white bay good evening uh good afternoon theodore white bay i believe you were sent here in order to uh perfect a transaction with me are you from the crosstied company it depends yes well yes all right it's okay then um yes i will i will thank you my dear as he sits down he glances around weren't there meant to be more of you i requested five individuals and as he says this the wooden doors swing open for one last time and another short shadow um graced by the afternoon sun appears in the doorway tronix would you be so kind as to give us a description of your character sure so peak wildwonder is a he's a forest gnome so he's about maybe three feet maybe three and a half still not still going to be the shortest person in this party um uh he has yeah i know right um he has a black long hair um he looks like he's been living a bit rough so you can see he's got some dirt on his face but i think the other thing is he kind of carries a ton of mundane items he kind of kind of sees things and he wants to acquire them so as he walks in you know um a random bar of soap drops from his coat he tries to pick it up and shove it back in he's got like a saucepan hanging from the side just random mundane items pretty much looks a bit of a collector um and he carries with him a staff with uh kind of like an ornate dragon head at the edge of okay uh peek as you step into the inn you reach into your bundle of items and pull out a letter as you unfurl the letter at the top is a small symbol that has a little a little boat on top of it and there's the sigil of the cross side company written across it um you've been given instructions seeing as this is your first mission uh to meet up with four different individuals at the end in order to um in order to speak to a particular benefactor by the name of theodore white bay as you glance around the inn um the first thing you notice um is obviously the bustle and activity within the inn however you do notice the individuals off to the corner and you slowly begin to approach them meanwhile at the table yes i was told that there would be five of you anyway once we wait for your crew mate um theodore white bay at your service uh i i'm here in order to um go on a particular expedition in order to acquire an item um how much did the cross-side company tell you about um about this expedition oh ah i see okay well that's fine i can um i i i can give you a brief of what we are what we will be doing um speak as you get up to the table uh the others you guys notice um you guys notice this small um the small gnome walking up to your table you have been informed that you were going to get another member of um of the crew joining you do you react in any way that seems like the fifth is joining us right now uh hi guys okay i raised my hand so i'm guessing everyone's sitting down so they can only see like maybe my head next to the table sure just a tough top hair poking over the tabletop i start to kind of take take off my my backpack and all the items um i'm i'm supposed to meet you guys and i guess i show them the letter yeah sure um letter comes down on the table and you will notice the official sigil uh of the cross side company ah well the fifth has joined us then fantastic uh theodore white bay and you are appointed a pleasure to meet you peek and yourselves my name is gekko he gives him another mug who you calling cats you know what happened the last time you called me cat let's not try it again i stand up all proud like when if if the stool is high enough to the table i assume it's not it's how high in relation to the table the stool is quite low yes for for the sake of comic relief we're going to say that it's high enough that your ears poke off over the top of the table cool okay so i want to jump on the table and act all proud like and introduce myself i'm cecil don't listen to him i may look like a cat but i'm more ferocious than you think at this point yeah at this point i reach on my hand you know i scratch behind the ear you know two people from two sides going for it um and i turn around and i say and i say i'm marcelia nice to meet you wait would your character be okay with getting bad doesn't it um i was actually going to say that the scratch behind the ear feels really good and my back leg sort of goes on the table but but i think i think as crewmates possibly you'd know that behind the ear is the only spot that i'd allow for petting i'd like to pleasure to meet yesterday i'd like to address our new known friends a new business associate when the drinks arrive i say i never trust a man i can't drink with nor a woman for that matter so and i put place the drinks in front of both of you oh brilliant yes um so peek immediately kind of you know he his eyes you know they beam i i approve yes i i saw everyone had a drink i was about to you know order one so thank you drink oh and he um he he this is the strong stuff right this is the the concoction you guys create right yeah i i kind of like side eye you and just just like good luck so obviously he's got a way smaller you know body frame than all of well not all of you but the most of you and you can see this you know this concoction of of an abomination of a drink where you guys created it i think he would try sip first he'll go for a sip first he's not gonna you know down it in one go he'll go for a specific that's fair yeah yeah awesome will be fine um as the drinks come down actually the drink in front of you our celia is um a little bit different to the muddy abomination that that has been created in the other flagons uh what you see actually um the liquid itself is a very very dark brown however um as you look at it it sort of shimmers in a orangey golden tinge to it as you grasp the glass you can actually feel a warmth radiating radiating from it and there's a smell of sort of like if you were down um down at the beach and you had just made a bonfire that sort of embarry smell that smoky smell seems to be coming out of it it's a drink that you have tried before and a favorite of yours all right thank you all for coming like i said my name is sorry did he drink uh no he hasn't drunken yet but before before we um before we engage in um in intoxicating pleasantries i just would like to give you a brief of what i'm hoping and what i'm expecting to accomplish he sort of gives you um gives you a glance falxx and raises the cup to his lips and takes a cursory drink yes when i was young i was part of a sailing crew seeking a treasure called the treasure of silver pete our captain um was a very good man captain shelley had won a telescope in a shark eating contest um this telescope was said to uh to point towards the the direction of of this treasure uh in fact so much so that it was known as the maiden's gaze however um uh this telescope um well we we went on several adventures and perhaps i can um entertain you and elaborate on them uh in the days to come however um the crux of it is we experience a very dreadful storm at one point our ship was attacked during the storm by a massive leviathan of the depths unfortunately my crew were lost to this tragedy and the telescope itself was um unfortunately i i am lost to the seas uh this telescope was a curious piece in that i would watch the captain disassembling the telescope into pieces it was in fact quite the miraculous looking miraculous looking device coated with gold and embedded with small red jewels he would disassemble it in small pieces and keep it within a red velvet cloth bag unfortunately uh the pieces were scattered during this storm and during the attack i have spent the majority of the rest of my life gathering knowledge on where these pieces might lie now i have come to the point where there is not much uh time left for me and now that i have found out where all these pieces are as a final homage to my my lost crew i would like to find these pieces put them together and find the treasure of silver peat i have no use for the treasure itself however it will be donated to the crosstite company should we be successful in our endeavors to this end i've reached out to the cross sides and requested um a crew in order to go out on this expedition my final adventure at sea and this is why uh you have been commissioned is this something worthy of your time depends uh i believe you are given your wages by the cross sides however um you are also of course welcome to a share of the treasure itself i'll go wherever my crew goes but your story is touching thank you i likewise appreciate the support what do you guys lances he glances around the table i look at him and i i asked him so how come after all these years you haven't given up well it has been a long journey and there have been many troubles along the way however i have finally come in position of the last the location of the last piece and so [Music] like i said there is not much left for me to do in this world and i would like to finally locate this treasure all right i will be coming with you on the journey however i do have one condition whilst of course i am sure that you are all trustworthy individuals um the treasure of silver pete is something of a legend that many believe does not exist and i do not want to risk losing the chance to find this this marvelous horde therefore i will be dispensing um the information on the location of each piece after we have located the last one that would also make me invaluable to you to see why i would do this you seem like a frail old man what if the worst were to happen and in the middle of the sea with nowhere to go because you uh well couldn't keep up well then you can cast my body to see and receive your commission from your company and wouldn't be any worse footwear my question is why would you want why would you want to find the treasure if all you want is the looking glass the tray the telescope is magical when you peer through it it is meant to point you in the direction of the treasure i have never been privy to the the telescope was kept by the captain and only the captain would look through it so i assume that there is some magic to it that allows you to see where the treasure is located and what was your position on the ship me i was simply a humble sailor um so as you're explaining p kind of like starts rummaging through his backpack and he pulls out this very you know small broken looking piece and he puts it on the tape it was like this this is in one of those pieces is it it's it's monday just to make it clear it's a what sorry some like a mundane piece of glass it's not a telescope piece all right okay he thinks it might be uh because you know if it's a piece of the you know magic telescope we could call hey here but um i guess maybe it's not um [Music] how many pieces are how many pieces are there of this telescope that is that information i'm afraid is something i will need to disclose to you as time goes by [Music] so there could be like two or a hundred no there are far fewer than that enough to count on one hand i look at my pawn i'm like uh one human or do you have like you know opposable thumbs on everything um so my paws are i would say very much resemble cat paws but they are uh there are sort of a little bit opposable thumbs e just to make it easier for him to hold things but they do at first glance you look very much like catboy's but only after close inspection do you realize that there are subtle differences oh all right so i i okay now go on let's say one of us is in possession of one of these broken items what happens then then we keep it on the ship and we go to find the next piece of the telescope and how many have you found so far none none of that's why i need you you said you were attacked yes by what a creature of the depths it happened a long time ago but i remember large mashing jaws and humongous tentacles reaching over the sides of the ship before it was torn asunder torn us under why would a creature like that tear your ship apart did you anger it i do not know exactly to be frank with you all i know is that we were in the middle of the most dreadful storm we had ever encountered before when this happened and if we were to go on this uh little jaunt of yours do we run the danger of meeting this thing well you are all seasoned men and women of the sea at least that is what the crossline company has has guaranteed so i would assume you would know how to handle it with a very fast chef do you have a very fast ship you do have a very fast ship yes we do all right all right you know all right one last question for you describe what happened when that happened to your boat to your ship was there anything in particular that you've seen or that happened in the any effects in the sky any details that you remember from what happened this was over 40 years ago laddie uh i remember the skies swirling above us i remember streaks of lightning crashing down across the surface of the water it was a storm like none i had experienced before okay okay okay quick quick quick question not not to him to to you see um does the crosstie company give us a a contract per mission like so what he's saying that we we get to kind of keep the treasure and all that is that gonna be in writing or is this just we have to take him you know by his words um so uh basically um out of character of course um yeah the crosstalk company you get a you get a a wage a salary for going on a particular mission however um if you find any treasure which you submit to the crosstalk company you receive a portion of the treasure itself and you also um you are also elevated in rank which means you would be then given um perhaps um more lucrative uh missions that would um you know reward you with even um even more booty okay um peek has one last question then for theodore he he tries to lean forward but obviously you know since his height he can't do much but he tries to look a bit menacing and he asks so what is this treasure what's in it gold gems art the treasure of silver peat is a legend it's been passed down from deckhand to deckhand for several decades it said that captain silver pete was once one of the uh most notorious privateers of the uncharted seas and that he amassed the treasure beyond the wildest dreams of any sea man or sea woman i would assume we would find gold silver the blooms and gems within it but who knows no one has seen it for over a century okay yeah um okay i think peak is just i think he's finding it a bit curious that he's going after this telescope rather than the treasure um yeah i'm not gonna i'm gonna say he's doubting what he's saying but he's just finding it a bit curious for such a person make an inside check okay yep give me an insight check and an 11. nothing um theodore seems like a relatively harmless old man to be honest um he seems genuine okay so yeah he cleans back um and kind of has another uh slightly larger sip from his drink so he forgot the concoction he's drinking um okay that's a bit of a slight big belch out all right i grabbed the cat and i i you know i i just drag him away from the crossfire [Laughter] as the flames like go right where cecil was standing okay i am very uh cecil is very amused at the flames but is somewhat annoyed at being manhandled like that if you hiss i will put you in the fire myself i didn't hiss but i'm i'm going to ask a question not to theodore but to you paul um in relation to um something that i might have known from my backstory you know captain redbeard would captain redbeard have heard of this treasure oh yeah um let's see um [Music] the three of you for sure would have heard at least like a rumor a sea man's tale you know something spoken um over time kurds on on a drunk evening about the treasure of silver pete um mostly dismissed um has sort of yeah everyone knows that there's this treasure that everyone talks about but um a lot of people don't really believe that it's a real thing there are hundreds of sea legends who knows which ones are true exactly you know he could be telling the truth you know um there there you do know for a fact that the uncharted seas are called that for a reason you know and all sorts of adventure and intrigue could happen while south sailing so he he could very well be on to something okay so um knowing this cecil sort of brushes himself after being manhandled like that and uh faces faces everyone around the table and says well if we're going to be looking for this treasure we better start looking for this treasure shall we not let us just enjoy the afternoon we ought to eat a little ought to drink a little more then we'll set sail what do you think you and your drinking as long as you keep as long as you keep the flames to yourself remember this pain this tail can get easily singed okay listen uh i'm as excited as you are to start okay but how do i know i can trust you trust me no not you z well you have no reason to i at the end of the day i am offering a job right i'm in it is really up to you i i mean it's right like i will keep a very very close eye on you as he says that i'd like to join the other shoulder oh what yeah as he says that keep a close eye i'd like to jump on theodore's shoulder and say i can do that he sort of reaches up to pets you but not in the right place he looks like maybe he's not very familiar with cats and ends up trying to rub your belly instead oh oh i i swipe with my paw i'm a goose at that point can i can i drag the saucer of milk that cecile has barely touched and um let darcy off of my off of my shoulder you know where he was hiding and let him drink from the saucer and then look up at cecil well if you're not using it oh yes good vision sure there's a quick yeah the milk slightly did you just call him a pigeon no drunk nothing yes at that point like darcy just looks up at you and gives you the like the nasty eye you know that gives you a real bad side eye and just continues drinking i don't even have to say anything has has peak come across um cecile's race or not are they not that seeing that he's uh they are not common in the slightest no okay so he wouldn't know like a you know special petting place or anything like that since he's good with animals i don't want to say make an animal handling that's what i get no no no i'm surprised very very very wrong so no he wouldn't know give me an insight check inside insights oh this is gonna be horrible i'm gonna poke you in the face accidentally sure um you saw the way that theodore initially reached for cecil and you're like okay belly is definitely not a thing and so you saw reach around watching um watching cecil um as your hand reaches around trying to find maybe the head maybe the ears does he find somewhere that's a sorry yeah yeah caesar sort of picks up a little bit turning his neck sort of to get behind the ear sort of easing him to that right spot i'm guessing you're you're still on top of theodore though so maybe maybe i'm using my staff like me [Laughter] move things along a little bit you write an adventure then they get stuck on the freaking cat i knew it anyway um so actually uh actually it's almost nine o'clock so we're going to take a quick five minute break because z needs to pee um and when we'll be when we're back we will compress time a little bit and move forward a little bit with the adventure what we're going to say in case you want to prepare anything um theodore looks you as this is happening and goes well perhaps we can set sail at first light tomorrow i have a couple of affairs that i need to take care of if that is um accommodating for all of you that would work that's fine good for me bring your own heart said bring your own hammock uh uh could i have a bunk we barely have enough space for the goblins you're not getting the bunk goblins who else will clean the deck don't worry bring bring you'll be surprised for the record you do not have goblins we do not what and i will see you guys in five minutes oh not the goblins you called cliffhanger a five minute break no don't tell me how many people are watching because i freaked out last time i found out there were people only about i don't want to know how many words all right we're live okay i think that's more than i had before oh my gosh okay i don't know people again right so um you spend the afternoon um having a few drinks together um now before you set sail is there anything during that day that you want to do to prepare before going out to sea i i use mending to make sure you know i go over the ship and i make sure it should shape you know what i mean i definitely would like to go into my quarters and you know set everything up make sure everything's in place and meditate all right okay i also want to make sure we have um sorry i'm sorry i also said i want to make sure we have enough supplies and stuff all right okay so um uh let's go through that very quickly one by one so firstly let's start with you fox so you go over the riggings you check the hull of the ship um mending a few things here and there you've already been on you've already been on a couple of expeditions on the tide seeker and you notice a few members of the crew wandering around um they are of course uh familiar with you um and there's a degree of respect um as they address you uh afterwards you have a talk with the captain captain um captain dane windbreaker and she informs you that you have enough supplies on the ship for a two-month journey as you step into your quarters what do you want your quarters to look like it itself is a wooden cabin and you have a porthole at the end that can be opened up close but in terms of the furnishing in the room what was your particular purpose tapestries like lining the walls carpets along the floor you know kind of keep it you know uh like a good space for meditation and keeping myself you know in line with myself also um there there is a small small no not too small hole in the floor behind one of the cabinets where there's a small wooden box that i keep and as soon as i go in i check and make sure it's there kind of like looking around see if there's anyone around me just making sure it's there it's still there perfect it's okay yeah that's about it very simple no bed no like unnecessary chairs or anything else just carpets tapestries that's it you don't need any of these exactly possessions to weigh you down all right okay siggy uh sorry rc i'll start remembering to call you by your character names are sylvia um i'm going to say something um no uh i was i was gonna say what i was gonna do before we entered the ship but would you like me to yes of course well you have the whole afternoon to prepare so you know um you are nearby the city of ages so if you need to go and get any supplies or if you need to get anything from the harbor to prepare for setting sales next day yes of course you have more time too more than that i want to find pipsqueak and ask him for um a needle and some tread um i think i'd have something like that on me yeah yeah definitely yeah i'm just testing to see what you have and what you absolutely it takes it takes him some time or maybe even a minute rummaging through his backpack you know he hands you a a a bar of soap that seems to have a bite markness um and then finally pulls out he pulls out this needle and tread uh and hands it together here you go thank you and i just scored off to my room okay all right um okay i was waiting to see if you're going to elaborate oh yeah all right okay um all right okay uh cecil what about yourself is there anything in particular that you do during the afternoon um in preparation to set sail the next day um i would like to clean their litter box funny joke no i just uh i'd like to go uh walk around the ship um and eventually i'd like to go into uh the kitchen um and i i sit i'd like to sit in the kitchen wondering um if or when a chef is going to be joining us um unfortunately at the moment you don't really have um a chef as such um mostly it's a couple of members of the um of the sailing crew that come down here to prepare lunch it's it's not normally the most appetizing of food mostly just some gruel on a plate okay so you make a mental note you definitely need to get yourselves a chef at some point yeah yeah yeah i i make that mental note and um uh keeping in mind the usual uh let's call it flop that's the the crewmates put together as food i'd like to go to um uh is there a nearby market yes sure i mean you're in the harbor there's all sorts of trade questions at the moment so i'd like to go and grab myself a bag of goodies uh and a couple of snacks that i enjoy and uh to prepare them just for myself not for sharing with anyone but just for just for season sure so you make your way down the side um downside of the harbor of ages um and the smell in the air immediately indicates to you your proximity to the market as there's this rich aroma um of um fish and sea crest stations um mixed into the salty sea air as you get to the market place there's a lot of activity and hustle and bustle going on and on either side there are stalls upon stalls lined up with all sorts of produce that can be uh that can be harvested from the sea um you step up to your favorite vendor um and he looks uh down at you and tells you the usual cecil you know me usual please sure he wraps up for you um two large um silvery scaled fish um in some brown paper and hands them over to you um i say i i tell him to put it on my tab because gonna be i'm i'm leaving and we haven't you know gotten the pay yet [Laughter] right i'll be seeing you when you step on land once more and i sort of to and i will head start walking back towards the ship sure okay in the meantime squeak what do you do um did you do anything in particular um before preparing to set sail the next day um i think peak wouldn't um wander into markets or anything he always thinks that he has the right stuff on him doesn't mean he does he just thinks he does um this is the first time he's going on this ship though so i would say that when he gets to the ship he'd want to kind of maybe get accustomed with the crew a bit so maybe pardon so maybe he'll talk to some of the people and kind of walk you know aboard and have a look in your word things are being held um and even ask um uh ask gekko uh him being the captain uh you know where you know if there's any you know rotas or routines around the ship like uh gecko is not the captain of the ships no he is captain gekko but he's not captain gekko but not catholic okay see that's what i got okay right so uh just very quickly out of character just to explain very quickly um the way the cross-site company works is um i think i had gone over this but i'll just very quickly go over it again um you form a group together in this case the group was uh gekko falks cecil and arsenia and with your own ship and with your own um crew you basically register with the cross side company and the crosstalk company will start giving you certain missions now should the crosslight company feel that you um the this particular group might require an extra member such as in your case they will uh commission you to join the crew as you do step on to um off the plank and onto the um onto the deck of the ship peak um a um a human dress in admiral clothing i'm in red and gold and blue admiral clothing steps up to you um and tells you good afternoon i believe you are the newest member of our crew my name is captain dane windbreaker welcome on board well thank you um so uh what what do i have to do around here uh do i do i get my own uh quarters uh are you and she sort of glances down that's paper uh peak wild wonder yes yes that's correct and he pulls out the paper he got from the crosstied company kind of to show he's you know he's he is who he's saying a pleasure to meet you have you gotten your sea legs yet um yes and he stutters for a bit um yeah um yeah i've been on a few missions with the company already excellent fantastic let me show you to your quarters and she takes you below deck where um she takes you to a small cabin with a porthole in the back uh it is modestly arranged there is a bed um off to one side and a small trunk placed in front of it after the other side is small chest of drawers and a hand mirror placed on top of the on top of the unit brilliant this is where you can place your possessions should you need anything please um feel free to find me or find boson let me introduce you to a few members of the crew and she begins to take you around the ship she introduces you to the bosun boson dave um who is a short stocky individual who seems to have the run of the crew under his thumb she introduces you to a few of the um a few of the deckhands on on the ship and also to the two lookouts um two elf um two elf twins who sort of swing down simultaneously down the side of the masters they come down to greet you go flacco maker at your service pleased to meet you you're a little tiny aren't you well that's all right then we'll be looking out for you oh brilliant do you think he can look outside of ship no i don't think so mako you shouldn't be talking about that all right okay then and they saw go up the crow's nest they're a little bit energetic and sort of um uh like they can't win they can't wait to get out the next sentence when they speak to you sort of thing um and yes um captain dane windbreaker sort of takes you around the ship and introduces you again to a few of the other deckhands right so if there's nothing else we're going to compress time a little bit and move forward you set sail upon the tide secret next day it's a beautiful morning um as the sun is peaking just over the edge of the horizon and the waters are crystal clear perfect sailing weather um theodore um theodore obviously joins you um upon the ship um he is given his own um his own cabin by the way he's not forced to sleep with the rest of the crew and he did indeed bring a hammock because maybe he was a bit wide or maybe he took you seriously about it but he didn't bring a small rolled up panic on the one arm just in case perfect tell him to set it up under the crow's nest he is given his own cabin um upon the ship um all of your cabins by the way are located um towards the stern of the ship um close to the captain's quarters um in general the captain normally will have run of the ship however um because um you know the entire crew is um is working under you guys and basically when you guys receive um your commission girl so paid as well they sort of um the captain will always refer to you on more important matters but not normal normally nautical matters in general um i specifically don't sleep in my cabin i sleep with the crew all right okay sure of course that would make a lot of sense um the cabin i keep it for like spiritual purposes i have like a shrine in there to my god all right okay fantastic so as you set sail you spend a couple of days um a couple of days on the waters during this time theodore appears to be um he appears to be in conversation with the captain and sort of um he um appears to be giving navigational directions on where you are going exactly i'm not sure if any of you um i know you are most of you are of nautical persuasion but i don't know if any of you in particular would feel that your character would be involved in the navigational um discussions of where exactly you are going i would say my character would definitely be involved i would i would say i would mix it with me too sure yes okay okay um so in this case yes um um anyone else before i move forward my character is clinging to the edge of the boat because he's not entirely used to this i'm just trying to cecil is just trying to keep himself dry all right okay so during these two days of journey uh falks and australia you do frequent the um you do frequent the captain's quarters a few times as there are discussions between theodore and captain about where exactly you are going and um apparently the first place you are headed to is a small island called the meek dawn where the first piece of this telescope would be located yes i will just post that in the chat for you one second okay so the first two days pass without much trouble peak um you is give me a contract give me contract before anything else do i really i mean it's a minus one so you you tell me i got an eight i got an eight i rolled it for you all right okay okay so let's say the first day's journey you get a little bit seasick um sort of going over to the side of the ship wretching up a couple of times feeling a little bit woozy um but by the second day you start to get your sea legs a little bit however when the ship does tilt a little bit erratically well let's just say your tiny tummy doesn't really enjoy that meanwhile um cecil um i mean you're pretty used to being on the ship so yeah in general um you know your way around it and you're comfortable around and you manage to stay dry for now so as as the third day approaches you hear from the crow's nest london port side you glance over the left side of the ship and you see often the distance along the um along the edge of the horizon what appears to be a tiny green blob um just um quite far out to sea maybe two to three hours journey away those of you on deck notice theodore coming up and coming up on deck as well ah i believe that we have finally found the island of the meek dawn the first part of the telescope is within our grasp it's it's quite a questions island do you have any idea where to pinpoint um the artifact or whatever you call it well um the island of the meek dawn is apparently a tropical island and it has upon its um these creatures that the the person who told me this told me that it was populated mostly by land sharks if you have heard of them quite dangerous creatures quite rare too they're yes they're quite dangerous creatures however um we should be fine as long as we uh tread quite lightly um they they apparently can feel the vibrations of the ground so as long as we're very very quiet we should be we should be fine there is also apparently a sentient race that lives upon the island but i haven't found much information about them all right um i turned to look at our cleric and i just i look him up and down and say well we're gonna have a right good old time aren't we i think so are these sentient creatures hostile not that my source has commented on uh cecil pipes up and says that he's no stranger to uh tropical islands you know like like like this one and uh just just for this is the first time we've ever been to this island correct yes okay okay okay just to clarify so yeah so cesar says that uh he says i'm no stranger to tropical islands myself and i do suggest hearing about these land sharks uh gecko you should you should tread lightly you know we know we know how what a big guy you are so just just be light-footed you know think like a cat they call me twinkle toes oh right okay standing up now right so as you begin um as ship begins to bank around slowly you start making your way towards tropical island however you notice often the distance actually give me quick perception checks before we move forward i got an 18 i got 17. does passive perception count um yeah if your past perception is higher and then what you wrote go ahead and give me your passive i got a 17. all right yes all right so okay okay so uh those of you who rolled above 15. you notice over the starboard side of the ship off in the distance um these skies appear to be darkening slightly like so the in this um the the rest of the sky is this clear blue with little white puffy clouds everywhere however off over there um if you're facing the iron island directly this is off to your right you notice yeah the the there appears to be like a black mark across the um across the sky's horizon um stretching out maybe if you calculated like an index finger along um cecil pipes up and says storms are coming we don't want to be out at sea when the storms are coming um i turn to the captain and i i suggest like you better make anchor before the ship ends up drifting away oh well sorry you were gonna say something it seems to be a bit far out we should be able to reach the island before it reaches us okay would pique have any better understanding seeing that he lived most of his life in the wild like could he tell if it's gonna reach us or not in time it's so far away it would be difficult to tell how fast it is moving at the moment okay okay if uh if the storm catches up with us i can always cast some wind to the sails and speed us up ah yes that would be extremely useful after about five minutes you do notice that the storm appears to be getting quite a bit closer above you here stronghold coming from the elves above you yes it does appear to be moving at quite a rapid pace towards you where before it was one index finger long now it appears to be four index finger lungs and you can clearly see um the black cloud performing as it makes its way i deliberately towards you you also notice tiny little arcs of lightning reaching down from the billowing clouds and striking the surface of water as it comes closer however one thing you do notice um those of you especially with high perception high passive perception um or with those of you paying attention is that it appears to be very condensed in the way that it is moving like it's not sort of like a storm cloud that has stretched out across the entirety of the horizon itself no no this appears to be um moving over a patch down maybe is a mile across or something like that but it's also moving quite rapidly sorry it doesn't look completely natural is what you're saying that's what i'm trying to indicate yes um if the crew is okay with it i'm gonna put some wind in our sails all right how are you how are you going to do that i'm going to cause gust of wind it's a second level spell um give me one second sorry i'm just gonna ask something really quickly um i can cast druidcraft to find out like about the weather but i'm guessing it's not going to help us would it help us think that's is this something a bit more magical isn't it um so um okay no problem um peak um you take a moment to calm yourself you feel the um the breeze across your skin and you tap into the natural spell weave that moves and twists around you um reaching outwards towards the skies above you um the trench tendrils of your sensory druid craft um moving towards the storm clouds inquiring in the most modest way possible what you want to no response this is not a natural thing whatever is moving towards you at least nothing within the skies is natural about this okay can i obviously can i relay this to the captain and the crew um uh as you do so you see the captain pale slightly and she goes what do you mean there's nothing natural about it i i i didn't feel anything natural about about that cloud it's um there's something off about it yes it does appear to be a bit strange doesn't it uh we should make haste um and uh because he was going to do this earlier um you see falk's turning towards the sails um muttering a few words under his breath um not sure exactly how he's going to do the praying to his god things so we will let him role play that later and um a gust of wind begins to buffet the sails outwards and you feel a surge as the ship begins to move with an increased speed towards the island itself we need to make land before that thing reaches us so it's the captain and you see um the boson and the wheel of the ship um sort of barking out orders to the rest of the rest of the sea men sorry assassin i said i second that okay uh how much time you're back with us yeah that's right no problem um i went ahead and took your initiative on the gus of winting and you are now moving um at a fast pace towards the ship towards the island from above you you hear twins in and crow's nest calling out one more time storm sharks um glance upwards towards and towards the crow's nest and then outwards towards the storm you realize that the um the this patch of moving stone has um come towards you at an almost supernatural pace you can now quite clearly see the arcs of lightning um uh arcing down towards the surface of the water and because this is only about two to three miles away from you you can see that as the lightning is connecting with the surface of the water there's a brilliant flash of light every single time and very clearly illuminated just below the surface of the water is these almost torpedo like shapes that break the surface in white fin that appears to be the center of where the lightning is striking now before we go forward i need to explain something to you guys have you guys ever heard before of a dnd skill challenge i have i have not okay so for the uninitiated for 40 uh one second someone's sending something for the uninitiated i am going to explain give me one moment and grab the papers sorry storm sharks i know when he said storm sharks i was like what did we just get ourselves into i have never reminded me of sharknado storm sharks that is that is a new one in my book that is yeah we'll see how this one um goes me if i'm wrong um our celia has a familiar doesn't she uh i have a little pet bird well little okay as big as my face okay so i'll tell you later i'll tell you later why aren't you showing the crow okay all right okay so what a skill challenges is it is a it is a timed challenge which does not actually use um which does not use combat mechanics so oh we're all rubbing our heads it's so cute so um a skill challenge actually involves a series of skill tests in which you as a group will need to decide who is going to make the skill uh who's going to um take on the test so i will present you with a problem and you have time to discuss amongst yourselves in character or out of character should you prefer actually normally with skill challenges out of character is normally much faster because you're being timed at the end of the day and you must elect amongst you the person who's going to make the role so let's say for example i tell you something like um ah a knife um flies towards your group what do you guys do you have a quick discussion and you say okay cecil is going to dodge out of the way of it okay cecil will make an acrobatics check he passes or he succeeds this is not something i will relate to you and then we will move on to the next um to the next test so there's never going to be a moment where it's like oh we have to stop the challenge um you need to accrue an amount of successes in order to succeed at the actual challenge but we will always move on to the next to the next test um can you hear me because you already froze on my screen we can't hear you we can't see you're moving oh we just stopped her all right okay oh no uh let's give her a minute let's see if she can come back could be the usual internet connection issue yeah probably did she say biotics before she left oh hey she's back hello okay okay okay yes yeah yeah we can't hear you what was your question sorry okay um so if cecil uh does an acrobatics check can he do another one or could someone else do an acrobatics check after that no you will always give me one person who will make one roll to try and pass that particular check and then we move to the next check and i will write down whether or not it was a successful video so the person tells you if it's so successful the person that most likely will pass will do it for that turn yeah yeah so i mean it's up to you guys well yeah i mean now there's a certain limitation to this in that if you've used your skill for a particular check you cannot use that skill again for you to check so if cecil decides to use acrobatics for the check then cecil i hope you got your mileage out of it because you can't use that one again someone else can use acrobatics for another check at another point but not cecil so make sure that on a notepad or something you're just marking down the ones that you've used this is only for the skill challenge we reiterate it's only for the skill challenge you're not permanently using you losing your ability to use this skill often skill challenge is done okay now um apart from using your skills your athletics your nature your acrobatics your survival whatever you also have a couple of other options the spell casters amongst you can also use your can trips um so let's say you have a fireball scan trip or you have a primal savagery can trip or you have a mage hand can trip um you can use that instead of using a skill and that will be your proficiency so it will be a d20 plus your spell casting modifier plus your proficiency um and again like with the skills you can't use that again someone else can use fireballs if you've already used it but not you okay finally the last thing you can use um again for the spell casters amongst you is your spells spells are an automatic success but they do consume a spell slot okay okay so this is even outside of the challenge moving forward you've used up that spell slot until you regenerate it again on short or long breaths depending on your class okay okay now the last thing about this um well two last two things about this um number one is that um in order to make the skill test in order to do the skill check or the if you want to use your kant trip or your spell you need to be using it in a way that makes sense so if i tell you for example a massive oak tree starts crashing down onto you you tell me okay um peak is going to use fire vault um i will tell you no that's actually not going to be possible because firebot is not powerful enough to do what you're asking it to do i'm not going to automatically fail you on it i'll simply tell you choose something else that you guys can do okay um number two is that there are a number of successes that you need to accrue again i'm not going to tell you the number but there's a number of successes that you need to accrue but there is also a number of failures that you can accrue and if you do accrue that number of failures we're going to automatically stop the challenge and there will be certain repercussions for failing the challenge okay okay okay okay now the challenge is a 20-minute long challenge i have a timer in front of me and you're more than welcome to set up your own timer so i'll give you a minute if you want to set up a timer so you have an idea as well of what you're actually going to be doing yes please we won't i i will tell you guys when we started so i'll give you a very brief description of what's happening just before we get going okay everyone ready to go doesn't you have your time yes ready yeah okay so you see this um this condensed storm cloud rushing towards your ship as it passes by overhead um because it's like a mile or so across um the sun is completely blotted out um a new cast in shade you see streaks of lightning arcing down from the cloud and smacking against the surface of the water all around the ship as you peer over the sides you see several silhouettes just below the surface of the water these shark-like silhouettes with white fins that poke out over the surface of the water we're going to be starting the skill challenge in three two one okay so as the storm stone blows by overhead there's a splashing sound coming over the side of the ship you see this white form of a massive shark and you can see that the bottom of it has streaks of yellow across it um it's not size of a great white it's a little bit smaller than that about size of a tiger shot it arcs over the side of the ship and sort of flies across the ship about 10 feet above you um as it's going by overhead you hear a rumbling sound coming from the storm cloud and you see a lightning bolt zigzagging down towards the shark itself what do you guys want to do your first check oh the lightning is going into the shark i mean well apart from like stare and astonishment um um [Music] what do you do with it is up to you okay so reaction i have a reaction yes um so i'm using gust of wind which lasts for a minute to blow this to blow the cells right when he jumps into the air can i just like quickly move my hand slightly to blow him off course and then moving back into the sail because you're concentrating on it i'm going to say sure sure that that that's fine that's okay um as long as the others agreed um that that will be your action for for this check yeah i agree yeah yes are we happy with that yep definitely all right okay um so um folks you're concentrating your hands up in the air and buffing um uh using the guts of winter buffeted the sails upwards as you see this shark suddenly coming into view over the side of the ship you very quickly shift one hand forwards um there's a crossbree um across wind that sort of moves the shark um it sort of turns slightly with the wind and is pushed off course moving back off the side of the ship you watch the lightning bolt as it's coming down and then moving off to the side as it follows the shark downwards towards you and crack as it hits the surface of the water and there's this big splash um of water as the shark re-enters uh re-enters into the sea as this is happening the storm cloud which has brought with it also rain and wind begins to rock the ship slightly from side to side you notice a small collection of cargo some crates and boxes that had been tied down perhaps the rope loosened or something like that beginning to slide across the surface of the ship and there are some sailors in the way what would you guys like to do um well i have really high i got proficiency in acrobatics so i could try to jump in something towards them same here i have acrobatics plus five i've got one those boxes are gonna crush we can i i don't mind i have let me do it you do it you do it you do it you're a cat so you know big boxes heavy so i'll do it i'll dash towards the the other sailors and try to push everyone out of the way that would be an athletics check if you want to do that um gekko right um well plus three so still how much did you get five in total thanks noted wonderful all right okay um ooh hit you with the low tip as you run towards the crates um as you won't run towards the crates you see two of the sailors turning round and far um as these massive wooden boxes are sliding across the deck towards them you run in front of the crates looking extremely confident as you reach out with just one hand pretty sure you can stop the um these three large boxes moving towards you apparently you can't as one of them shatters against you and the momentum of the other two um pushing you backwards and you sort of trip over backwards and as one of the crates mounts on top of you and keeps on going um keeps on going past you it's fine though you get yourself back onto your feet and you look around for um for the next problem as you do so you hear from above you rocks as you peer over the side of the ship you can see there are a couple of uh jagged rocks as you're getting closer and closer to the islands um the rocks from the from the uh from the sea bed um have started to you know create some dangerous terrain what would you guys like to do about that um it would make sense to try to steer the ship away someone get on the wheel so what would we need to check yeah because i'm on deck so i'd have to dash towards the how far is the wheel like are we is no one close enough you've got the bosun up there who's trying to navigate right now okay you could attempt to assist him in some way what what would be the skill check on that that's up to you all right you tell me how you're going to help this might be stupid but i could use step step of the wind i can you like if i use it i use one one key point and my moving distance is twice the speed for this turn i understand the class abilities don't count for the skill check that would be a cool idea but unfortunately class abilities don't succumb i was about to ask because so i'm guessing so my wild shape is out of the question i'm afraid not class abilities don't come skill checks okay um okay what would it work um if i go up to the boson and with my athletics help him steer and like push down the wheel to steer the ship would something like that help that's definitely an option yes sure okay okay is everyone okay with that should i roll yeah just one question while she's doing that can i grab like some of the the ropes for the mask and like start turning it or anything like that turn the sails quicker than they are that would that would have to be you know okay let's do let's let's do this bit first forget me really quick sig for for the sake for the sake of it i don't know what you rolled don't tell me what you wrote because at this point you haven't taken a decision on what you're rolling yet uh because the others are still discussing so that's fine okay don't worry whatever you know it doesn't count that's good really you guys are still discussing i don't want to know what the rule is you guys are still discussing at this point because it has to be only one check i'm afraid really good question how do you add the multipliers with on the the modifiers on the roll itself the number whatever it is like plus three or whatever if you want to test that quickly but uh just so that you know you guys have um 12 minutes left yeah yeah yeah not a lot can i can i go help the the the boston navigate please yes do it roll for it do it okay okay just saying unrecognized command [Laughter] i rolled the two earlier when it wasn't supposed to be a roll and now i've rolled a tree so that makes it a four oh a five you know what five all right okay you dash up the side of the ship um towards the upper deck you can see the boson struggling with the wheel as the wind begins to um begins to buff it further even with the efforts of falcon falcons the cleric um you get onto the other side trying to help him push the wheel to navigate past the rocks however as you do so you hear as some of the timber of the front of the ship um smacks against one of the rocks overhead um overhead you see uh sorry from the side you hear another splash of water from the other side of the ship and you see another shark flinging itself up um as it goes over the top of the ship it gets caught in the rigging in the ropes that are hanging down from one of the masts um and sort of tumbles down onto the ship itself covered um covered in rope it rolls around on the deck in front of you um and as you watch you see above you another lightning bolt begins to arc down towards this shark that is now on the deck of the ship what do you guys do [Music] i got a cat i've got a javelin but i can also if paul allows it i can cast and tangle but that normally requires some sort of ground so but depends you know how maybe the wood is i can actually you know point out the the shark itself is not the threat right now because it's tangled up in the rope it is more the lightning bolt that is flying very quickly down towards the ship that is okay right lightning is attracted to any kind of metal right so can we throw like a dagger or a metal up into the air throw a metal you want to throw a metal can i could i could throw my javelin out into the sea but that doesn't i that is not going to stop flying i think someone has to throw the can i keep it out of the way kick it okay are you going to use strength let me just check my character sheet real quick oh man what what do you do to stop lightning eight minutes left to go away i will point out very quickly that the last time when fox pushed the shark off the lightning box bolts did follow it on the ship yeah yeah are you like a shark just someone go kick the shark off yeah go kick the shark oh shark just probably get an athletics check if you want to do that uh okay i just rolled an athletics for the for the massacre of the ship i can roll an athletics check it's gonna should we can we all roll yeah we're all using who's doing it who's got the highest athletics pro uh yeah i have plus five r plus four yeah it's going to be getting i have to decide who's making it i'll do it i'll do it it's gonna be gecko with plus five for sure didn't you use that already you already used that oh yeah just kick it in the face just kick it off the ship hey what does she get 15 15. all right okay um you rush up to the shark it snaps at you with you uh with his jaws you jump back for a moment you notice his tail flailing away off to the side um outside the rest of the rigging you very quickly grab it by its tail spin twice in the circle and hold the creature off of the ship just in time to see the lightning bolt just go uh just go by use uh so close that it actually singes your hair as it goes and follows the shark off the side of the ship okay the floor um the floor of the ship um appears to be getting more and more slick with the rain that um that is beating down on the sides of it um all of a sudden you hear a shuddering sound and and the ship moves till slightly off to the side as you will rush to the side of the ship and peer over the side you can see in the water a much larger um silhouette below the surface of the water um it appears to be moving away from the ship and then turning ground and moving at full speed towards the side of the ship you can see a fin far larger than the fins of the other sharks breaking the surface of the water white as well it's moving towards the side of the ship it appears to be about to ram it again what would you guys like to do about that um can i i think the best thing to do would be to embrace or brace for impact so could that be a survival check that would not be a survival check that would normally be an athletics check something like that okay how about uh acrobatic would you accept acrobatics not for that that would be an athletics check yeah nothing we can fantasize more about um tumbling and moving dexterously is the lightning lightning happening as well with this or is this just at this point how how large how large is the creature um you'd say from what you can tell because it is below the surface of the water but it must be at least 20 feet long okay no um okay uh sorry i was gonna i was gonna ask um i can cast minor illusions is this something a scenario where i can cast something to distract it in the water but i don't know how intelligent this creature is if you can't think up something interesting enough to distract it that might be an option shoot up with a crossbow it's it's either that or i don't know if this would work but i have dark vision up to 60 feet so i can like have a clear look of what it is how big it is where it is unfortunately dark christian doesn't let you appear [Music] um this so this shark is attacking the boat right it wants to come after the boat it's moved it's moving towards the starboard side of the ship right i can only make minor illusions so the best i can do is make like floating driftwood close by so maybe it tries to bite the driftwood rather than the boat time give you an idea okay yeah this might not work but this looks a lot like the thing that our uh friend that they at the end was talking about right no that i would like i would have thought was more like a fracking sort of thing i'm clarifying this looks like a giant shark this looks like a giant shark so not what attack do you do no no um can i can we throw what i'm sorry i heard two different things i didn't wait do we have gun powder we have barrels i got a crossbow can i try shooting it in the eye um to answer your question gekko yes you do have cannons however that would be an attack which you cannot do during the skill challenge and same thing with you are siri unfortunately can we um you cannot make attack from the skill challenge uh could we throw uh food overboard rations maybe that that entices it to go for it oh no wait wait wait wait uh animals say that'll be an animal handling check for example element handling yeah yeah yeah you want to go with that we've got a cat on board i'm very low animal handling so you guys are gonna have to do that i know i know but my animal handling is low okay okay uh one of those pets that doesn't like main draw this is let's go check anyway what's your what's your what's your bonus do we have it's plus two for animal handling do we have oil on the ship oil yeah why would we have oil if we have oil to lubricate the cannon and clean it all right yes um yes yes sure fair enough you probably have some with somewhere on the ship can't we just you probably don't have time to go looking the little deck yeah no we we've really got no no time at all um okay so my suggestions would be either a minor illusion or we control we have to form we have to try it try it try it all right okay i'm gonna i'm gonna cast a minor illusion that looks like driftwood that is a first level spell or it's a cantrip rather than driftwood i can make it look like a first person or a dead person a person driftwood that looks like a dead person got it there you go do it do it all right quick okay i need a d20 roll with your uh spell casting modifier plus your proficiency bonus well that's a long world my bad my bad two seconds oh boy i'll have to i have to make this manual so wait uh what can you repeat that proficiency bonus and and your casting modifier so in your case your wisdom modifier yep ten seconds by the way oh that should be it fifteen oh all right okay and with that the last roll of the skill challenge [Music] did the shark do anything so um as you concentrate downwards um in the water this um this small creature that looks like um it has two arms and two legs but appears to be made out of wood you got a bit confused and frazzled when you were trying to cause a spell and so you attempted to create a human that was made out of driftwood um you see um you see the silhouette of the shark breaking straight through your illusion and running against the side of the ship as you all race aside for impact you hear coming from the other side of the ship sorry i can't do responses that's as close as we're getting and you see one of your crew members flying over the side of the ship there's a brief from the other side and you see splashing water um as you dash to the outside to try and rescue your crewmates all you see um bubbling up from the um from the murky blue is this red plume of liquids that sort of um stabilizes and spreads outwards as it reaches the surface of the water you hear um coming from the upper decks the boson don't worry he was just a bilge rat let's just get out of here folks more wind i don't have time to think so i just like i continue the the stream will put into the sails let's go let's get out of here sure um you double your concentration um on your spell pushing the um pushing the ship until finally it breaks out of the storm that is following it um as you look behind you um you can see the red uh the red liquid settling on surface of the water just behind the surface of the ship you break out of the storm cloud and all sudden rays of sun illuminate the deck of the ship once more um you glance upwards and you can see the storm clouds still hovering over this red patch of liquid in the middle of the ocean as you make your way towards the island of meek dawn we're going to take five minute break there because yeah we are way over the time and unfortunately you have failed your first skill challenge but don't worry there weren't many men but you did pretty well you needed three successes and you managed to get two two successes but you accumulated three failures i'm sorry guys it's okay wait you're sorry i made a floating piece of driftwood that looks like a person for nothing i know i'm sorry but it was not the idea that that didn't work myron oh no i know the role for the very last check was uh man the bridge time pressure the time pressure i know i know it's part of the fun of skill challenges so i i really love running could i like all right so you have the sharks right and they're attracting lightning but we said that metal attracts lightning how much iron do those sharks have in their body that particular part of their anatomy but i i would say a lot i guess is saying we need to forget the quest go mine these storm sharks right and then they're scared exactly profit i mean with the amount of iron in their blood if you hit them you're going to break your hand like it is just pure iron well when you use like a gigantic magnet [Laughter] you know what next time you get peep probably has one before before we go to break yes go at this point i had my hood on right i take off the the needle and treads that i borrowed off of pipsqueak and i say thanks i don't think i need that anymore and i just give it back to him as then like i walk away and you just see like holes in my pants everywhere just ripped off like from from the from when i was trying to navigate like there's no hope for these bands i'm just i'm just going to throw them away oh and by the way all of you guys are absolutely drenched because of the stock yes yeah obviously she still is in a bit of a bad mood yes okay guys so uh it's about quote past ten we will convene back at 20 percent okay so go have your cigarettes go have your p breaks whatever and i will see you guys in about five minutes all right away from the um the thundering and blowing clouds oh dear i have the twitch thing open and now i can see myself and that's really distracting how's that all right so as you stir steer away from the thunderheads overhead um cast by the storm sharks um you make your way towards the island of meekdom you managed to ground yourselves ashore and actually no you wouldn't because there's a large ship so this is a point actually where you get to decide if you want to bring anyone with you you can bring with you at this point um franco or mako as we progress further and further along you might have more people that will join you when you go off on the little land expedition or would you like to bring yes just one of them for now aren't they a set no unfortunate normally yes however because this is only the first mission you get basically one follower to join you okay did any of them get hurt foreign apart from that that one that the bilge rat who got eaten who are we taking with us wait why didn't why not take the dude that actually is looking for the treasure uh you have a few sailors and you have captain uh the captain and the boson but neither of those guys lead the ship for island expeditions i'll say mako over okay let's go with mako then if everybody's going makeup right so mako just so that you know is an archer so he will provide backline defenses should you need them good theodore approaches you as you get ready to disembark off of the ship he takes out a small piece of parchment and you can see that he's scribbled a very rough outline of the island here in the center of the island is where you will find the first piece of the telescope apparently this sentient race think that this um think that this piece of the telescope was something given to them by a god or something along that flavor so you might have to negotiate with them or find another way of acquiring it do you have any information of what language they speak um well they live quite far away from uh from the central hub of the new world so i would say that most probably they don't see much um much in the way of trade and commerce so native tongue pretty much so it's okay yes but but we are only three days journey away so there might be some of them that um that have met um some of the people from new world before you might be lucky i say we take some extra actions with us for trading extra rations i was just going to say that uh i can sneak in grab the thing sneak out well there's thought there is that i mean who's going to suspect a cute little cat i mean if you get naked maybe you'd look like an actual cat okay and i'm thinking as well if these are worshiping a small piece of glass then i don't know how much they've actually seen of magic so we could easily pose ourselves as the new gods for them as well true a kind of like i mean do you have do you have a like a piece of glass in your belongings yes right with you and like say look we have one as well i do i have random pieces of glass i would say perfect i have really nice everything i have a number of spells on me like minor illusion that just makes minor effects i can make you know flowers blossom and stuff like that so good i i put on the show i can have an information for you once we get there just bring it with you okay i'll say you guys are discussing this as you're on the robot making your way towards the show by the way is it i have one question is it daylight or is it nighttime oh no it's it it's around about the middle of the aft middle of the sun is the sun is overhead okay okay so uh as you guys um uh breach onto the sandy shores and step off of the small road boat you can see um a white sandy shoreline that stretches out on either side of you um in front of you about 30 feet away begins the perimeter of a line of tropical trees that make up the bulk of this island you can hear from where you're standing various chitters and squawks of the indigenous wildlife living within uh within the tropical jungle unfortunately i have no music or audio so you're going to have to imagine that um you are currently six people uh just to reiterate um you are the five of you and also mako is joining you as well as you start making your way towards the tropical forest um you can feel um you can feel the heat of the sun beating down on you you can see across the shoreline there are these small blue um bluish green crabs are sort of skittering up and down sand and as you step inside the palms of the trees overhead are enough cover to shut out most of the sunlight which is in a way kind of relieving however inside the tropical forest itself um you can feel certain heat that um that is happening from the rays of the sun that are sort of cooking the top of the trees um and increasing the um the heated humidity within the forest itself as you step through through the bramble and undergrowth what is your marching board i mean who's in front of basically who's in the middle of the feedback me and um falks up front yeah um the smallest ones in the middle can i i'd like to be sitting on one of someone's shoulders can i see your shoulder okay yeah okay i'll be i'll be on his shoulder gekko's shoulder perfect i'll be i'll be right after them um with darcy right on my hat like perching on my hat i received my birthday and mako next to each other kind of like behind like right next to um oh right next to me yes i keep writing your name arthelia rc is so my name is rc my bird's name is darcy perfect okay i didn't notice that till now was that a happy coincidence or did you plan that i kind of planned that one proud all right okay uh peek where are you standing um it sounds like i i think i try and stick in the middle but if everyone's moving forward i can like be the one at the back so checking everyone's six you can stay in front of me i can stay with marco at the back okay yeah yeah sounds good um at this point can i oh sorry can i can i let darcy fly um before us um i was gonna say that yeah can i just let him fly before us see if there's any danger like if any dangers back he'll come back to us normally i would say yes however because you are moving through this um sort of tropical undergrowth you do have a lot of trees that are in the way that would make it a little bit difficult for darcy to navigate properly even though um even though he does have some experience with you at sea and everything he's not the sort of bird who enjoys being in this more enclosed sort of space so it might be a little bit dangerous for him to do so so he just saw a purge on your shoulder he's on my hat today sorry um just a quick question um because peak spent a lot of time in forests and also on the road he has a you know a high aptitude for survival um can he you know notice does he know does he would he notice anything that would help the party traverse this jungle a bit easier it depends you have um you have a spell or something that can help you out here or are you talking more about um something you would like peak to do physically or something i i would say following the you know following the instructions that are being given to us and also you know looking ahead we're traversing to and you know noticing the nature surroundings i'm talking maybe more around like just being just making sure that we're not like you know if i notice that we're moving towards into you know dangerous vines or anything like that or impossible who knows so i'm just noticing trying to know these these things before we head into them i would say yes that that'd probably be a survival check however you probably want to be at the front of the party in order to be doing that's not at the back true true can i let them know once they step into the quicksand uh um i don't know i mean yeah i'm happy to kind of jump to the front and keep you know my eyes peeled doing that why don't you give me a quick survival check okay i i scary off you can hear like a bunch of stuff jingling in my backpack of six six all right okay um uh how some um well would he make it known what he's doing i mean he seems to be just scouting ahead a little bit so um if you know a way that you could help him out sure why not i can't think of anything other than survival to help it but um yeah uh don't you have a guidance spell guidance country no i don't all right okay nevermind all right okay um so peek as you step forward you notice the trunks of the trees you um these are not um native species that you recognize however it feels nice to feel back at home surrounded uh surrounded once more by nature um the bramble um the rumble sort of scrapes against you as you make your way through the forest um you you feel a little bit light-headed after three days on on that um floating vessel finally your feet are back where they're meant to be um you're a bit unarmored about being where you are at the moment and even though you do try to keep track of where you guys are going um you're more fascinated with the different creatures are you seeing flitting through the branches and you notice a couple of multicolored monkeys jumping from tree to tree screaming loudly as they chase each other through the treetops uh you see different sorts of birds of every sort of iridescent um and colorful plume um making their way through the jungle foliage as you guys step forward a moment you're sure that um you feel the ground shift slightly underneath you you glance downwards peak ah seems like the the the leaves um seem to be settling back down onto the ground settling back down as in like there was a gust of wind something like that yeah well like they appear to be just fluttering like i wanted ground again oh um i okay i i kind of raised my stuff up a bit bit of a signal like to you know stop the march like there is something off here quite sure what though and i start looking at the leaves can i kick the leaves with my foot sure um they buff it out of the way that's fine okay uh since i'm sitting atop gekko's shoulder can i make a perception check to see if i saw anything or see anything with this you know gained height and the height sure do it with advantage oh that's 20 plus plus nice i think um my shoulder i don't think i'm going to get a higher role so i think [Laughter] okay so i'll say that at the same time that um peak seems to pause for just a moment you notice cecile the leaves all around the vicinity appear to sort of raise up for a moment about an inch above the ground before settling back down again you also notice above you um the palms and the leaves within the trees all seem to shake just four moons ever so slightly it puts you off though raising the hairs on your back yes okay um [Laughter] yes there are several um if since everyone is kind of concerned with looking towards the ground i will also point out that we should look up because i also noticed the leaves above us moving so i point that out to everyone to not just look at the ground as you all looking around now actively trying to figure out what was that that just happened i'd like you all to make quick perception checks for me as you take a moment to concentrate and peer around at your surroundings i got a 12. uh did you say if our passive is higher we use the passive yes yeah okay so make that a 14. so am i rolling again um uh no um yes because this is um a separate uh this is a separate event wow reception right can someone look at my role um yes how is that possible with a plus four [Music] yeah that that i think that just glitched out to be honest i did yeah can i can i reroll that one because that doesn't make sense um did you make sure to type in slash role yeah no ziggy you you made a mistake on that there there's a full stop after that can i rewrote it yeah of course nice one oh actually um no it makes more sense cecile will keep your role from the previous one okay because um it's still the same uh skill that you're using right now and you're still paying attention you didn't stop paying attention technically so we'll keep that one right so um everyone above a 15 you are the first people to notice this um but the others you do notice it after a moment so everyone above a 15 um you notice um you feel firstly you need the souls of your feet or in cecile's case um you feel um through the shoulders of gekko a slight rumbling vibration coming from okay coming from the phonage covered ground below you explained how he felt it through my shoulders and i didn't well i would say he's smaller and probably more sensitive than yes also the higher up you are the more likely you are to feel when something's moving if i understand physics correctly probably not i don't understand physics very well so from that so anyway you feel a slight rumbling sound coming from the ground beneath you you notice all of the leaves suddenly shifting upwards and then settling back down and the leaves and palms above you vibrating slightly as the very trunks of the trees move for a moment i think we should take cover i'm gonna i'm gonna just climb a tree you're going to climb at me are you sure that's a good idea did you say it was 15 to fi to feel this sensation on the road to feel it first uh the rest of you feel it after a few seconds oh okay so everyone felt it by now yes yes yes and i can cover behind the rock it's coming from the ground right so if you go higher up what i'm what i'm guessing it is obviously sentient creatures if if they are thinking they are no not landsharks as you are standing around the baiting at the very moment that you are serious a landshark you feel the ground once more moving beneath you this time no role is necessary as you all sort of brace as you feel the very ground beneath you shifting slightly this time it's not a single rumble it keeps on going okay you see the leaves rising up um a few feet above the ground and sort of move um as the ground beneath you begins to vibrate it feels a little bit like a minor earthquake and it seems to be intensifying okay i'm gonna climb a tree i too i'm gonna climb a tree i'm gonna get shoulders and climb up a tree that's acrobatics right okay athletics actually oh can it be acrobatics can i i'm afraid climbing is athletics can i turn into one of the monkeys i saw and jump onto a tree quickly oh my god you can indeed that would also be an athletics check um um use a dexterity modifier of plus three for that please store next plus three i got a 13 on my roll it could be an arthur having is it just plus three with also my athletics plus three or just with your proficiency oh oh okay no no it's a d20 plus your proficiency plus three okay so i i got a natural one plus two what does that get me [Music] tears in the middle of the road let's dive together i'm just waiting all right there's your roll and tournament so yeah i'm i'm writing the whole thing so you said plus three plus my proficiency and that's it yes yep okay so okay gotcha d20 plus three plus your proficiencies yeah all right so at this point me and fox are just like standing in the middle just like doing nothing i mean apparently so no no no no no okay all right i'm just not climbing a tree yes for the sake of consistency i'll find out what you guys are doing now and then we'll play it all out so folks what are you doing right now i basically duck and cover behind a rock and cover myself with random foliage from around all right okay sure and um actually give me a give me a stealth check for that please meanwhile gecko what are you up to i like grip my quarter staff a little bit harder you know and just like stand in the middle just like act like you know a merchant just passing by and trying to look as unintimidating as possible exactly kind of like a guinea pig for the rest of you know the crew okay um meanwhile mako um who is most at home up in the trees is also going to climb a tree so what happens is this the rumbling continues to intensify sesame you turn around leap gracefully onto the trunk of the tree and skitter upwards to one of the um outlying branches um peak as you spin around you spot one one of the monkeys inspired your form shifts you become smaller um green and purple first sprouts out of your body your your face elongates slightly and simian whole uh a similar nose appears uh on your face your eyes become this um small and pureness and black and you i tail i prehensile sprouts out of the base of your spine and curls around you as you begin to skitter very quickly up a tree arsenia noticing your friends running up the tree you turn around grab the closest branch and begin to hold yourself up however unfortunately branch snaps and sending you straight back down onto the unfortunate peak both of you tumble two both of you tumble to a halt in front of gekko who is standing there trying to look as unintimidating as possible in the middle of the horse as the entirety of his crew have abandoned meanwhile behind the tree grabbing some palm fronds and shifting them over you in order to try um try and blend in with the rest of the foliage [Music] no actually what happened was you fell onto him and you both tumbled across the jungle floor and landed in front of gekko meanwhile the rumbling sound which has continued to intensify um causing the ground below you to shake and tremor um all of a sudden appears to come to a peak no pun intended as the ground in front of gekko peak and arsenia bursts open a hole of about two meters in diameter suddenly forms and out of the hole springs this monstrous looking creature it has um a sort of bullet-like head um the um the other part of it is this sort of vanilla vanilla cream um colored and on top it is a silvery blue color it has two little yellow isolates on either side uh you see massive hulking shoulders digging out of the ground on either side as large jagged claws hold the creature out of the ground its skin itself seems to be um of a hard um a hardened carapace sort of texture and it appears to have just above his head um three fins um that poke out of um out of the back of its spine and move down the back of its neck i'll show you a picture the creature that you are facing unfortunately i cannot show this to the people at home as far as i can tell so oh wow okay okay great well damn um this thing is quite large in fact its head is about the size um its head itself is about the size of a human so as it pops out of the ground like i said it does create quite a hole and as it rears up out of the ground spotting you its jaws open up and there's a loud that comes out of it um you notice um a long red tongue that sort of that sort of curls out of the jaw and appears to be wrapped around a creature the creature is holding on to the to the top of the jaw and using its legs to push um the bottom of the door so it's sort of suspended in between um standing in the middle of the joyland of the creature the um of the landshark um the creature appears to be humanoid in nature it has greenish blue skin it has a long nose um long pointed ears are sort of flat downwards to its sides and it appears to be wearing some sort of tribal garb that's wrapped around it's it's also about four feet high it's a goblin it looks at you and just screams in panic okay jesus okay roll initiative wow my roles are incredible huh they're they're just either mediocre or ice rolled byron are you taking note uh z or do we tell you uh i will need you to tell me i'm just finding a spare page there we go right so when you give me your initiative please give me your current ac and hp if you happen to be using a shield and you have it out at the moment go ahead and give me the ac with and without your shield please okay okay so mine uh my ac is 14. oh um uh let me just check so initiative 21 plus no okay all right okay so peak you go first give me your ac and hp please ac is 13 hp is 15. thank you uh anyone else exceeds 20 no 11 to 15. you're on 18. i got 12. okay ac and hp please uh ac is 18 but i have a shield so without the shield at 16 and my hp is 24. okay are you currently using the shield yes okay thank you uh okay i got at 17. you are 17 gecko okay you're a cnhp please uh ac 14 max hp 24. okay and you wanna 16-20 i got a 12. oh got it all right no no that's fine um uh you got 12 ziggy what did you get an 11. okay so um let's see firstly cecil give me your ac and hp please buddy uh ac13 hp 21. the team 21 okay and our celia ac dc and hb please ac14 hp 21. 21. oh my the tank okay and mako is not uh mako is lost on the initiative list by the way that's okay okay so just just so that you know the current um the current initiative order before we jump straight into combat is peak falks gecko the landshark cecil australia and mako okay so okay you are currently um on the floor about 10 feet away from this creature that just burst out of the ground um this landshark creature that possibly is a uh possibly landshark creature that theodore spoke about you can also see this goblinoids form trying to escape from the jaws of this massive um this massive bullet shaped monster what would you like to do um i'm still an ape right i guess currently what do you want the apes at blocks uh i already have them open just in case thank you um the problem is this i can't cast spells as an ape [Laughter] okay um technically you're a monkey but we can use the ape stop block i can bring up the monkey stats if you want no no no no ate this one um okay unfortunately i'll have to kind of get rid of my into that shape because my spells are gonna be way more effective that's what pique would think um to try and uh only get get the situation under control so so yeah so peak i would say you know he shakes off the wild shape and you know his you know cloak reappears and you know he's you know looking back to normal um i think the first thing you shed the purple and green flutters off of you brilliant um yeah i think the first thing i do is this shark on land as in like it's not close it is it's not hanging on the hole or anything he's actually grounded now um he he is poking about halfway out of the ground as initiative started so about half of his body is out of the ground at the moment and he's sort of hauling himself out of the ground with his front legs okay um i think uh yeah okay peak peak is gonna cast entangle he wants vines and you know weeds to come out from the ground and try and wrap around this creature um just to immobilize it so whoever else needs to do what they need to do which is kick-ass you know they can do it um all right yeah um just to confirm this is do you have a slots for that i don't know yes yes i do all right i do i um so far the only spell i've cast was minor illusion and druid shape druid shape is its own like two small spell slots exactly all right okay um no problem just to confirm how large this creature is because entangle is in a twenty-first house there's a large this counts as a large creature okay so i should be able to entangle it's it's okay fantastic okay so what do you want me to roll should i just roll to constant angle or is there anything else nothing it needs to make a string saving throw i've just rolled that uh that is your uh these well that's please well it's 12. probably 12. yeah it fails um okay uh you place your hands down on the ground um the ground below you ripples almost like water you feel the spell weave bending below your fingertips and you sense the tendrils of nature energy moving through the ground towards creature there's a moment where um where you see the ground around the creature again ripple and then vines grasping vines thorny vines bursts out of the ground wrapping around the landshark and pulling it downwards so it's sort of immobilized against the ground you see parts of the vines also ripping around its head causing its jaws to snap back shots and you hear from inside um from inside mouth um okay that was your action um definitely have movements if you if you'd like you had to use half of your movement to get up but you still got about 15 feet of movement left if you'd like to move off to the side or something i think i'll uh try and get to the side of it i don't uh you know you said i'm like 10 feet from it um so i just maybe reposition myself so if i if i get another round and i attack or do anything i can like try and hit it from the side okay sure you scatter off to the sidelines all right falx you're up next gekko you are after what are you doing um has it i mean i'm still hidden right yes 100 it has not noticed you in slightest this is far more focused on your three crewmates at the moment and whatever creature is stuck within these jewels cool um i want to get out of my place of hiding and i i point my my mace towards it my warhammer sorry um and i left i i offer a few words in a primordial tongue and as i do so a sliver of blue light starts coalescing around me and then around my war hammer and it shoots out right at the creature and i cause guiding bolt at first level um go for it let me just check this um i believe you are doing this with advantage if i remember correctly because this is currently restrained yeah you have advantage on this how much is that to hit i'm just checking uh 20 unnatural okay that hits road damage 14 it's a lot of sorry it's a lot of damage for a first level all right a lot of damage also next attack against this creature has advantage but because it's already wrapped up i guess it's already restrained so um but if it does manage to break free before someone else lands an attack yes then or makes an attack then yes next attack will have advantage all right okay so um this um blue glowing light emanates out of your mace and then streaks towards the creature um as it impacts um there's this dull against its hard carapace and you see part of part of the shell indenting slightly as the spell hits home it growls at you through restrained jaws echo oh wait sorry uh fox are you moving away or anything or moving closer to it what is your current position actually i offer i shoot off the guiding bolts um i charge you charge towards it all right okay you get uh you have enough movement speed you get right up in front of it echo what are you doing all right so i'm gonna try and save the creature in its mouth so i try as quick as i can while it's still on the floor um i assume the creatures and then it's about trying to like push it open you can't hear the picture going from inside like i'll try my best to try and make it open its mouth back like you know tap it on the nose with my quarter step or something and just to give you an idea its mouth is closed because of the vines which are covering its entire body so you might have to pull away the vines from its joints that would which would require strength i'll i'll try doing doing that actually can can i cut the vines if you have something to cut i do have a short sword yeah you can make an attack on the fines sure sure i'll allow go for it so was that d20 d20 plus uh you're a monks or you're proficient with four short swords so d20 plus your dex modifier plus your proficiency uh plus dex plus that's it 10 10 sure um that should be about enough you rush up to the creature and make a quick shing along the side close to the jawline um tearing uh slicing away a few of the grasping weeds and vines that are keeping the jaw of the creature itself closed um you see the jaw trembling for a moment as if the creature the small creature inside is trying to open up the jaw again however it um for whatever reason it's not yet able to open it up and we'll get to that in a moment um you still have your bonus action um but i don't think you can do anything with that but you could do some monk things i believe with bonuses uh let me see yeah you can you can make a bonus um you can make an unarmed attack as your bonus action with a monk if you if you've already made an attack if you want to strike punching it or kicking it or headbutting it or something like that nah i'll i'll just i'll just move slightly to the side of it just like waiting for an opportunity for it to open uh its jaws okay all right okay um as it move as you move off to the side it's going to go ahead and take its turn now um you're up after the line job takes his turn okay so um the line shark um you see the yellow eye of the landscape following you gekko as you sort of duck away to the side and you see it's your turning towards you very rapidly opening as it tries to take a bite at you which is going to do so with this advantage because it's still currently restrained so that is oh my god you are so lucky i did that with disadvantage wait can i show something else so now no this is it's it's taking it um okay so that is a 26 to hit yeah uh holy moly yeah because it rolled in 19 under 20. so i'm taking the 19 because it's with disadvantage right let me just roll the damage on that sounds like it's going to be a lot of damage it is a lot of damage don't worry i have cured wounds it's all good yes so my body back together no this was nice knowing yourself so that is that is 39 damage um what what the heck you know we're level one we're so i'll just explain what happens so you see the larger shaped head suddenly turning snapping around almost like almost like a snapping turtle or a shark surging out of the water the jewels opening up wide um as they open up you see you see the goblin creature inside um it sort of pops out i'm bumping into you gekko um and so rolling up across the floor as you turn around to see what the creature is doing you don't notice the massive jaws looming behind you reaching down towards you and snapping down on your side um you are um you are about halfway covered by this creature and it's all raises head up and slams you down on the ground and you lose consciousness for a moment as you take the damage you are currently knocked out oh bye great that would have almost been one shot dude like wow it did run really high admittedly um cecil you're up next okay that's scary you're gonna run away everyone's gonna be serious now okay back to the ship guys okay um i okay just to clarify with you z um the feats that we chose at the beginning are in play okay yes okay no good good just no because i have a dual wheel their feet just to make sure that i'd be it would be okay to use yes yes of course okay 100 so um i being up in the tree um would i be able to sneak attack uh yes because you have allies within five feet awesome okay so um i would like to sneak attack with both of my short swords yeah okay um i tell you what give me an acrobatics check if if you roll well i'll let you have an advantage as you pick yourself up with the tree okay awesome okay thank you man here comes acrobatics well that's a nine okay so you land on top of the creature um however it doesn't notice you you've still got sneak attack though because you still have allies within five feet okay all right so go ahead make the first attack so [Music] that is that's a dex for short swords right oh technically you still have advantage because it's still restrained okay yeah short sword is your uh decks uh plus your proficiency yeah that would be 13 days 13 to hit 13 does not hit your uh wait did you roll with advantage or not no sorry second roll is a 12. i thought it would happen to 13. 13 does not hit i'm afraid your shoulder bounces off the um of the hardened carapace you still have your bonus action though yes um so this would be the other short sword uh net 20 plus three roll that damage okay so remind me yes so basically short sword is a 1d6 damage so you're going to roll 1d6 plus plus your dexterity which i assume is plus 3 right now yep it is okay so it's one d6 plus three plus one d6 for the crypt plus your sneak attack which should right now be 2d6 but you crit so 4d6 so in total you're rolling 6d6 plus three plus three yep so those 66 come up to a total of 26 plus three which is 29 29 damage all right okay hey you guys can do big damage too okay um so a quick question because i have um uh fancy footwork as uh as a swashbuckler um that can take an effect now right so if i make a melee attack against the creature or that won't be immediate with the finesse weapon with it or it would be no no it's still a melee attack okay does what exactly so during my turn if i make a melee attack against a creature that creature can't make an opportunity attack against me for the rest of my turn oh yeah sure that that applies yes okay i mean technically its drawers are full with delicious gecko okay all right okay um so your first sword bounces off of the creature you look around quickly you notice it's its yellow eye glaring up above you as it thrashes around your friend you very quickly hop off to the side bringing your second blade around and sinking the tip of the sword straight into that yellow pulsating eye it lets off as red blood spouts out of the eye okay it is that that hurts a lot by the way and our celia you are next what would you like hello um so i i grab my crossbow and i i'm right in front of it right yes which means if you're going to make a ranged attack that's done with disadvantage no because you're tempted to wait so that's fine okay um i wait for it to like so it just shouted because it's in pain because like cecile like so i'm gonna just aim right in its mouth and shoot go for it do so with advantage because it is still restrained wow advantage right her first role i think there was a typo it didn't actually roll it just printed out one oh yeah you you you must have made a mistake again okay all right attack bonus 18 plus your proficiency and dexterity please no i mean but that hits anyway regardless so go ahead and roll the damage please is 1d6 plus 2. actually um you're adding your sneak attack to this so it's 3d6 plus 2. oh okay thank you okay i i know how rogues work very well when my first players play the rogue and didn't know how to sneak attack until the fifth session so um i've learnt the mechanics tell me how much that that's a 12 total further in total all right okay okay so as you take a moment line up your shot you wait until the creature um is within your vision and fire of a boss towards the creature um the bolt um flashes through the air and you see it embed itself um inside the um warm um slimy red tongue of the creature it immediately tilts its head upwards and gekko your unconscious form goes flying off to the side crashing down in front uh in front of you falks and it is currently bloodied now for the people who haven't played with me before i use the term bloody because i don't like to use uh i don't like to use numbers to explain the health of a creature because i think that breaks immersion a little bit um so bloodied means that the creature has reached its halfway point on its health okay so it is uh currently missing at least half of its health i will also tell you when it is severely bloodied which means it be close to that but it is currently blooded okay finally uh mako is going to go ahead and make his shot you see him um on slinging a little hubo from behind his back and lining up an arrow let's see how he does oh well all right okay um ah unfortunate you see the arrow coming out being knocked in the bow and firing towards the creature however it shifts its bullet-like head away at last second and the arrow shaft snaps against the head of the creature we go back up to the top of the round pick your first alex you're up next what would you guys like to do okay um so i see gecko like you know he's on the ground or he's is he still in the jaw no no no he he he um he got flung and he rolled to a stop next to fox okay um is he dying do i do i notice if he's dying yeah um he there's blood coming out of him so mechanically he would be making that saving throws on his turn okay yes if i if i use any of my spells something like healing word or anything like that will that help him stabilize um that will just bring him back up it bypasses the same thing and brings them back up okay okay and the shark okay emotions and the shark is it completely free from my vine no no in slightest it's still restrained it it didn't use its own strength itself it needs to use its action to try and free itself otherwise it remains restrained um for the entirety of the spell which is one minute okay awesome so i'm gonna remain you know remain keeping concentration because it's one of the things i need to do as far as i'm aware for foreign tango yes yes um you cannot cast another concentration spell you can cast out spells just not a concentration spell yes very good point okay good so i'm gonna cast healing word as a bonus action um and i'm gonna instantly bring gekko back up um so i speak a druidic word um underneath my breath and uh you know point my staff at gecko um do i roll how much health he gets back or you're just gonna how you do indeed it's um healing word environment correctly is a 1d4 plus your um spellcasting modifier that is correct yeah it is correct all right um okay so i'm gonna go i'm gonna click on some stuff you're gonna hear a few things uh so healing word and it rolled a six oh the full uh the full healing nice okay um there's a brief moment um as the natural spell weave curves around um around you gecko and you awaken with a start um and looking down you see um some of the uh sorry on the outside um right now by the way if you've ever seen a shark victim um you know with with the sort of jawline that comes down the side like that with the several um teeth embedded uh the the teeth marks um uh embedded inside you that's kind of what it looks like um you have bloods pouring out of them but you see the wounds beginning to heal the flesh beginning to stitch and mend itself together um as your druidic companion casts healing word upon and you awaken with a start that's your bonus action peak and you still have your main action which you can use to well do several things by if you want to cast spell it can only be a can trip because you've used your bonuses that is correct um falx the weapon you use is it a one-handed hammer it's it's so warhammer so it's versatile but right now i'm holding it in one hand yeah okay what is the damage die on that give me a sec it's a one v8 okay so if i cast shala that doesn't do anything because that just turns it into a one d8 again unfortunately the way that the spell of shilaeli works is that um the caster has to remain holding on to the weapon itself for the spell to continue working yes yes you are right okay sorry i know too much about this game no no no no you're spot-on don't be sorry about that z i'm mostly i'm honestly at a loss here i want to cast some stuff but i don't want to waste my spell slots just like that well you wouldn't be wasting a spell sloth because the only thing you can cast with your action at this point is country so those are all free no i'm aware that i'm just realizing that the stuff that i have for cantrips are just supports for other players not much for myself uh like the illusion stuff like that if you have a ranged weapon that you could use i could but i will have to swap it because i'm holding a quarter staff right now um as part of your action you can draw a new weapon but in order to do so you're going to drop the staff to the ground yeah yeah all right let's give that a go all right i'm gonna drop my quarter staff and i'm gonna pull out the javelin um and uh i'll cast i can't cast shala and attack can i uh no because that consumes your bonus action should you use opponent's actions that's fine i'm just going to throw the javelin then i'm just going to throw it in just javelin is your strength plus if you're proficient which i think you are your proficiency yeah okay um so that's one plus three um yeah peak's just like not sure what's going on so he just does what he can a nine oh terrible um i'm assuming there's a wooden sort of javelin but yeah with a metallic nature yeah um the javelin comes out flies towards the creature however in in the panic and confusion of the moment after having just brought up your companion you misjudged the distance and the javelin comes down just maybe a couple of feet in front of the creature itself okay fox you're up next what are you doing ox i can't hear muted sorry so i moved up to my last time and what i'm going to do now is i'm going to smash it in the back of that uh [Music] right so let me just make the that's a 16 plus 4 to hit so 20. that's it nice sorry oh that's nice um 10 damage all right okay you bring your war hammer swinging round over the top of the shield it smacks into the side of the creature you hear the carapace shattering slightly as it takes 10 bludgeoning damage okay um you still have your bonus action and movements if you want to do anything else i basically just want to place myself between uh the creature and gekko who's like still recovering sure so if it attacks anyone i'm the one who's attention at the moment hopefully all right okay gecko you're up next you have to use half of your movement to pick yourself up so um but you still have about 15 feet up movements left what would you like to do right so obviously stand back up you know grab my quarter stuff kind of like push myself up a little bit look at myself you say it's only a flesh wound fine and kind of like slowly walks away just just like walk away right okay you backing up a little bit from the crew yes yes please um what is my current hp after the healing and everything six you're at six hp right now all right do you have any range of attacks or anything that you'd like to do to give support to the party from the distance um not really no so i i really cannot apart from dodging or getting out of the way then there's nothing else i can do all right okay no problem completely understandable so um you take a few steps back a little bit startled by what just happened trying to recover yourself at the moment and just take a deep breath meanwhile the lime shark is going to take its turn it turns to you fox with an evil uh with an evil look on its face um as part of its therapist sort of like um cracks and falls off okay i'm going to go ahead and make the bite um it is it is doing so with this advantage because it is still um because it is still restrained well that's a six or a 15 so the six plus the modifier so 13 to hit 13 does not hit um it um snaps towards you but however with your with your shield you duck underneath and the jaws slam against the shield itself you push it backwards cecil you're up what would you like to do our celia you're next nice um just before i say what i do can i just clarify something with you um yeah does cunning action give an extra bonus action in addition to my bonus action for my turn no you only have one bonus action per turn and only if you have something that can use a bonus action okay okay cool so i am going to once again um uh both my shorts like dodge disengage and hide for the rogue you can do them as a bonus action where most people would use them as a main action yeah yeah um so i'm gonna go again once again uh double short swords at this dude go for it first roll you're doing so with advantage first roll that's one that's two both of them are 12 so we'll take a 12. plus your modifiers no modifiers or anything 12. no that's total 12. okay unfortunately the first attack whiffs um as your first short sword slams harmlessly against the characters not quite enough force to pierce the hardened um the hearted outer shell of the creature go ahead and make the second attack with the bonus action that's one this is okay so 23 23 hits all right okay go ahead rule damage on that you still have sneak attack because your allies are still within five feet so it's uh 3d6 plus 3. so that is 3d6 is 12 plus 3 15. okay it is very bloodied of course celia what would you like to do or celia you are muted i'm still in front of it right [Music] yeah um i reload my crossbow i aim steadily and i shoot it right like up its jaw like its upper mouth like up towards his brain do you know what i mean i'm gonna that's where i'm aiming to try and kill it go for it go ahead and make your road remember you still have advantage because it's still restrained okay so so i got a 15 does that hit unfortunately that does not hit um you take a moment before you shot however at the last moment the creature's jaws snap open uh snap closed once more um and the arrow and the ball shaft breaks as the impact the trajectory which was slightly off snaps against the jaw wait i forgot to add the plus like i forgot to add the plus four it's okay it's it was my mistake keep going no that's fine it's still on your turn uh it will retractably um stop actually we'll carry on with that so um as the bulb breaks a part of it embeds itself within the uh within the eye as the bod sort of snaps and it's um the part of the box heads towards the eye go ahead and roll the damage on that that is your short bow so that is 3d6 plus your dexterity modifier that was always the plan to br the balls to break and exactly your phone is out of my ear oh six six damage no because i don't know how to type it's 3d6 plus plus you're next 11. 11. okay uh you see the creature trashing about for a moment as the second ball blinds its only remaining eye it is now blinded by the way um it is also extremely bloody do you notice its movements are very sluggish as it begins to sort of like try to pull itself out of the ground just growling at you and it's mako's turn next or if he kills this he's [Laughter] [Music] no he rolled the 19 together i'm going to go ahead and see what he actually gets though he's going to boast about it how he single-handedly took him down oh is that enough that's enough all right okay the creature the creature had three health left mako strides up confidently taking out an arrow another arrow from his quiver knocking it in this boat wait watch this guys the airport whizzes towards the creature somehow finding itself uh finding its way into one of these small nostrils at the front of the creature just zipping straight into the nostril um as the amount of projectiles are being bombarded towards the creature the the blades from one side the warhammer from the other side the broken um crossbow ball shaft entering its other eye and finally this um this long arrow embedding itself into the creature you see the creature stop for a moment its head raised up about two feet above the ground you see the the slow stream a slow river of blood trickling out of the side of its nostril as more blood gushes out of its eyes and it just sort of slumps forward it's not dead it's breathing still but it appears to have lost so much blood that it's completely unconscious and behind you you hear me you saw me you saved me and you see um this small goblin annoyed looking creature coming up to you so being like yo master save me thank you thank you it was going to hit me i is now your servant i will come with you wherever you go can i wait who in front of who is he um well gekko actually is the one closest soon because he stepped back so gekko right now he's in front of you so thank you i have earned adobe perfect uh can i ask him what his name is um my name is michine chica but um uh in in your tongue is uh and you saw him seem sort of reach around his body and down towards the loin cloth that's covering a part of his bum and you seem sort of like wiggling around in there and then pulling out this just became not pg-13 by the way pulling out a small piece of poo is down to the ground a sort of scrapes against the ground [Music] mark good morning cecil would like to embrace get mark in a hug but making sure his hand doesn't touch me he wraps his arms around around you sessom season and he looks up at the others and goes this one food reacts and and wriggles out and like cat cat scans sort of you know like uh fangs [Laughter] thank you thank you my family they they give me to this creature they don't like why why didn't they like no reason you won't slide keep mike okay listen i i appreciate we're getting to know you but half my body is dying someone help me that's fair um can i cost your wounds on gekko go for it 1d8 plus your spellcasting multiplier environment correctly yeah so um i basically this is how i do it um i have like a gourd of water um which i carry around with me and this filter you guys would know it's like ceremonial water from a fountain from a temple somewhere and i bring it out and i start like manipulating it with magic and i pour it over your wounds and yeah you basically start feeling better like the wounds start mending and you start feeling healthier so then you know that you get 11 hp oh i'm alive wait um i would like to ask skidmark so uh where where do you where did you come from where do you live around here yes yes but no more me stay with you now you much nudger ah okay i come from over there and he gestures towards what you assume would be like the center um of the island the destination you guys were moving towards okay so we try to like speak to him like as as you know clearly as possible we are looking for this and show him what like a drawing of or or whatever of something they might worship or know of or whatever oh god don't tell me goblins are the same sentient race on this island i think so oh god i can see like see if we can ask him like if he knows about this we are looking for something do you know something you know unfortunately i don't think um you probably know exactly what it is you are seeking at the moment because theodore only gave you a very vague description of what it is that you're looking for um i can attempt to communicate that and we'll see how that works out okay what do you worship do you worship oh worship i mean let me change my voice because i was so bad do you do you have a do you have a god that's a personal question yes dear god interesting we might have ran into meek talik on the way here can i wrote a religion check on me oh man if you find out something this is going to be so good i i love how you stay in character yeah can you take care of you very much a body language dm so uh even like if it's online i i i feel the need i love remaining characters wow wow that's a role this is your third one not 20 today by the way unfortunately even when i'm not 20 you've never heard of meek to leak before you could make the assumption that um this is um the native word for a god that you might be familiar with but the name make the leak itself does not ring a bell in the slightest to you um can you show us i mean that is information in itself you can definitely assert and this is probably a native name for for for what might possibly be a god i wouldn't just tell him like can we can he show us yeah i'd be like i i'm going to look at me look at me mark i am a priest of

on get stuck into a few all the best with the screen Cheers you [Music]", "UOE5LLTFwCc": "[Music] okay guys I'm Tyler and I'm TG from Hester sportfishing and today we're talk about sense with walleye fishing now as most you all I fish for no scent isn't one of the big key factors that walleye key on when they're looking for bait you know sight vibration is really the primary two but there's a lot of days especially right now where the rivers start get more blown out and they visibility different yeah visibility is a little less it can make a huge difference so when you're looking for sense you want to try to match the hatch if you will so there's a bunch of different sense eyes you can see here on the table now one of the most popular one the last couple of years that's kind of new to us in the Columbia River is shrimp there is a an invasive species called Siberian prawns in the Columbia River House of about 2004 I thought it was a myth it's real and a lot of these walleye are feeding on these shrimp and it's become one of their major food source so of course shrimps you wonder your top notch you're looking at the old standby the classic trophy walleye now procure houses down in some deep vault down 100 yards and in the ground where they store all their gold but I mean the formula for this but trophy walleye is also one of our favorites it's been proven years and years and years now and it's just kinda your old standby it's your chrome and yellow quick fish for salmon to go to for sure and then from there you can really very out for anything you want you go into your garlic's your leeches your crawfish just stay fishing you stay what these wall while you're actually stay with what these walleye are actually eating and then from there you can kind of vary a little bit for instance there's the eel scent yep so a lot of these walleye are feeding on the lamprey eels the closer you can get a lamprey sentence gonna be eel so again mix and match you have your super gel which is great for put on everything it sticks really well you have your bait wax which is almost like a glue stick that you would just rub right on the jig or whatever you want to use and it sticks on really well and as well as your bottom water setup you know you can rub these on your smile blades run them on your metal blades run them up the leader however you feel like some of the best help you on the water alright guys so for applying these scents with the bait stick all you do is pop the cap off make sure you have enough there and what I like to do is not go over zealous with it I just take the tip smear it all over the front of the bait a little bit on the edges and you're good to go and for our gel you can apply it onto a jig like that this the same way or like what I like to do if your jig has eyes just go ahead and squish it right into the eyes and most of it will come off but just enough will stick on to it and you'll be able to fish for a good amount of time like that alrighty guys thanks for watching again walleye sense I can be really big and tough bites it's always something to have your tackle box and use when you need it you know make sure to LIKE subscribe share this video and we'll see you on the water [Music] you [Music]", "0qVmir3OCvw": "hi i'm jane esselstyn i'm ann esselstyn and today we are making a dessert that i have sort of loved and how would you say well no i have something to say when we were deciding to make this do this cookbook jane called me and said i have just made a kale cake with blueberry frosting and i thought all right that is the cornerstone of our dessert section but it's not on the current cover actually it is in the dessert section it's on page 256 257 if you're following along and when i made this cake our kids were younger so we had a bunch of kids playing in the yard neighbor kids around and when the neighbor kids tasted it and liked it i mean look at this thing it looks like dr seuss came to cook with you wait can you see it bub it looks like dr seuss was in your kitchen making a green cake with blueberry frosting so we're actually going to make raspberry frosting today and we have a video about raspberry pudding raspberry moose raspberry frosting and we will uh direct you to that when we get there the key to this kale cake being green looking like dr seuss was really there with you is to cook your kale ahead of time and we also have we already have a video about that so we're not going to burn some time here doing that but you strip your kale boil it cook it steam it till it's just defeated two cups of cooked kale and then you're ready to go and jane do you know how do you do the two cups when it's finished or no it's a whole bunch to hold no it's a whole this it's a whole bunch of kale which equals like four plus cups raw and you cook it down to about about two cups this and there's gonna be a little moisture in it which is fine um don't add too much but it's um some people call that pot liquor it's good we'll do a little bit oh so you have your cooked kale and the key is to make this just it has to be as fine ground up as possible so we're going to add other fluid to this for the cake and ann can you combine it we're going to add maple syrup vanilla applesauce apple cider vinegar that's vanilla this is apple sauce apple cider vinegar and this is apple cider vinegar and there's that little flavor so this is all ground up and we're doing it the whole time here um and also let me get the sides down so this is just such an intense look at that green oh my god wait can you see this green crazy green are you getting how green it is i mean it's maybe it's bouncing off my shirt but it's like see i don't know that is true emerald the greenest yes it's emerald green it's wizard of oz green yes i was actually thinking that sort of magical okay so now we're going to add to this green almost not paste but it's almost we're going to add all this other liquid our wet ingredients right in there so now this is going to turn into this green smoothie oh the water did i put in the water yeah 3 4 cup of water you want that in there okay yeah in three fourths cup water we're up to about the limit there of our season art okay so put this in your food processor blender and go this is the key to this cake make it this green smoothie of just the kale and this and the maple syrup and the water and the apple cider vinegar and all the things we added this being a solid colored green is key if you dare to just sort of put everything in a you know some cooked kale and with some just stir it all up if you're going to have a chunky looking like throw up it's going to look just gross so please combine the kale and everything as we talk about in the recipe first so it's a it it's almost like it's a dye or it's a stain so we're going to have this all ground up and smooth and while i continue to grind this ann's going to put the dry ingredients which are just whole wheat flour and um baking soda if you want to do it with flour in the bowl every three three cups and then um if you want to do oat flour or um maybe a mix of oat and wheat you can do that too i've actually made this whole recipe with oat flour that we're going to pull out as our example because this has to cook for 30 minutes if you want to get going and get it done for you so but we'll also show you the other cakes at the end as well um three cup there's a that's half oh um and so i'm going to continue with this isn't that just so isn't it so i want you to see how green this is wade it is can you are you picking up from this camera how green this is i don't know if you can from the side but from up top man oh man all right ann are you done with that yet how you doing whoa you're a baking soda isn't open enough to oh sorry okay all right will you stir this up here this might be better now we're going to add our wet ingredients to our dry ingredients oh it oozed out a little bit all right stir it on in okay greedy green it is such a stunning stunning green we should have done this on st patrick's day oh is it st patrick's day jane you're dripping maybe we should post this on st patrick's day yeah okay if it's say patrick's day we didn't think of that until just now is it's what day you say patrick is the 17th right yes oh there you go we'll do it then um i'm having trouble no you're doing great you don't want to over mix it much no that's okay that's all right that's all right i've never made this cake because jane has always made it now i think i could nothing we make is very complicated nothing nothing nothing okay let's get this i'm going to get this i've got a little bit of the seaweed color now what is it is it all good way to go okay awesome so now we're going to put these in two pans because this is a layer cake because you want to show off those green layers don't you um so our two pie pins are sort of sort of um nonstick not pie cake pan cake pans this one's doing okay this one we're going to put a little bit of parchment paper we're going to crinkle it up so it can sit how we want it to this one has a little of the new crinkle tip this um this uh had some rust on the bottom of it so we don't want to have a rusty green cake it's already sort of a little challenging to love anyway so we're going to put half in here oh there's some we have some exciting clumps i do oh no it'll be good the winners the winners will get some clumps all right and you're like it's not a clump of baking soda oh gosh i hate it when i get that um okay get all this in and the two layers are great to do because the when you have a blueberry frosting or we're having we're doing raspberry red frosting pink frosting today can you can here um which one needs more uh that one looks either or no matter okay once you get this in you're ready to cook it at 300 oh my gosh attack of the green um we were ready to cook it for 30 minutes at 3 50. sorry 30 minutes at uh 350. all right we'll be right back our kale cakes are in the oven that are cooking with whole wheat flour i made these with oat flour last night so we'd have something ready to go and frost right away and we're frosting it with our raspberry frosting which we have a video for it and we'll list it right here i think it's called raspberry frosting and mousse or it's lovely and it's such an easy quick thing to make again with the light still confirmed tofu that we tout about with our smooth frostings so which one should be on which one should be the bottom which would be on top this is the top okay so let's hope these come out this one just like the other pans we use which is the oat one these are these are both flour and the ones in the oven are whole wheat flour the ones we just made wow so the ones with your the ones with you know that is so nice to know for anybody who doesn't want to have uh gluten yeah you get um so here we're going to put down the first layer and we're going to uh coat it with coatings you want me to frost it please frost please frost frost away um this is so frosty like yeah we press some of the water fluid out of the um out of the tofu over now overnight i actually soak it in towels to make it thicker do you want it down the sides yet we will but let's okay so here's my my cake pans kinda like my mom's cake pans i had one that was really rusty and one that was fine like this one worked perfectly it was still nonstick this one i had to put some parchment paper in because it was i didn't want all the rust to get on the cake did it get rusty no it's fine all right so let's ready for this ready face down or face up how do you want to do it we don't really care yeah we're not fancy schmancy some people cut it level like i don't know who it matters to um okay so this we are gonna now both work on frosting and we'll see you in a minute while we we're going to frost really fast ready go so we've kind of quickly put all the frosting on you can put more or less whatever you prefer but and what were you saying about the frosting when we were doing it oh it's the best the best in fact it's nice to even jane have a little extra frosting to dip on your cake while you're eating it yeah i want to crown it now james you are doing that but i found in jane's refrigerator some leftover little flowers from from a delivery we got from the cleveland vegetable no culinary vegetable institute i'm supposed to be in cleveland and these flowers are so spectacular that i just have to find a way to put these flowers go from up top on that one do you see that beauty and then here's a little yellow i think i'll just have to put a little yellow these are edible flowers by the way don't go eating any flour i mean ground flour but you know like petal flower and then look at this let's just put that off to the side oh this is like a tea party this is like i'm going to move i'm going to move her over a little bit just because i want to get the raspberry in there that's a fun bushy one wait maybe we are too crowded with the flowers oh nearly too far and then i also like to put um berries around the base because then it makes it look like it landed in a big pile of luscious i mean i know flowers aren't usually in the middle of your cake but oh hell yeah the culinary this amazing farm farm in huron ohio oh no they're from the chef's garden sorry the culinary vegetable institute was where i the chef's garden chef's garden is where they and uh they they have the most beautiful beautiful things and these are just some a few i found one more little flower i think i would like it where we'll just put that there oh this has got to be the most spectacular cake ever created wait wait do you see it how beautiful it is up top oh yeah oh yeah okay well enough oohing all over our cake i think we need to eat some what what yeah let's cut it we have to show you how great you know amazing on the inside it is almost too pretty to

[Music] [Music]", "ApQ0VgaR_50": "what's up fellas back again that's right I'm here at my home and we're doing a new video for you kind of a different one a little kitchen cook that's right it's Christmas time I figured I'd drop a little present for you and show you how to cook tripletail that's right tripletail we went on an unbelievable fishing trip with my boy Josh that's right kitchen big tripletail and we said we're gonna do a kitchen cook with the man the myth the legend Sam Edwards what's up let's go be careful that knife my friend so here's what we're doing we're gonna leave you guys here just a second and show you some fishing footage just right because you've got on the channel to see some epic fish catches and then we're gonna come back and we're gonna show you how to cook triple tail and he's gonna do a special recipe we're gonna talk all about it it's gonna be awesome so let's get right to the action check it out all right so here's what we're doing guys you're welcome welcome to black tip bait that's right you know what we're doing today we're going triple tail fish and he invited me to go with Scott lung that's right big triple tail coming at you I'm taking you down how about that [Music] you [Music] was that not crazy or what now look I've caught tripletail before but I've never in my life country will tell that big Josh put me on that was awesome and matter of fact guys we are gonna have a full fishing video because we caught like 20 of them we caught a bunch of tripletail so there's gonna be a video droppin soon after this one so be sure to check it out but getting back to the cooking catch this stuff is looking amazing Sam what is the plan for tonight my friend well we're gonna start with some ceviche this tripletail I call it the blue viola no water yeah because it's nice and firm and super white and it gets really really it takes this acidity for we got some sour oranges from the woods out here near Clewiston and we're gonna let it marinate and then while that marinate so we're gonna get some fillets going on the trigger dude I'm all about it I love learning new recipes okay so we're cutting this meat into cubes it's very important that the cubes are of similar size because it marinates in the citrus as it marinates in that citrus the citrus cooks it so if one cube is bigger than the other then it's not going to get cooked all the way to the middle and like the smaller cube so it's very important that they're all the same size [Music] you [Music] okay so now that we've got the fish cut up into cubes we're gonna start marinating it so I've got this glass bowl here that looks like money dude that looks like money this is the cleanest fish Scott I'm telling you I was so excited when you called me about this so we've got some of this down in there just right right so this has acid in it lots and lots of ass sour orange sour you don't eat this orange like if you ate this one for yourself you would not like it cuz that's why they call it sour so we're gonna let this sit in here and marinate for about 20 minutes so I didn't have sour and just say they live like somewhere else right so you don't know sour orange juice you can use a mixture of lime juice and normal store-bought orange juice that you drink every morning okay orange juice lime juice mix it together right okay so we'll say about 50/50 lime juice - orange juice okay so now I'm just gonna salt it up a little bit this will help the the fish marinate the salt helps the fish it helps to brine it helps to cure it which is exactly what we're looking for actually here's what we do on boats so there's a lot of fishing trips that go on and like literally we could have done this yesterday part of prepared you can take these ingredients here's what's neat about it you take sour orange juice you take some salt you have in a bag having a container you catch a fresh fish fillet it literally clean it keep it up like this put it in a Tupperware Bowl or whatever put the ingredients in like he's doing and just let it sit and fish and then when you come in from fishing or halfway through your trip you pop it open good together people do all the time it's awesome yeah I get invited on lots of Christmas fishing trips just because I got makes Italy take forever dress all right buddy on right there just like that all cleaned up ready for the grill my friend we've got some something here from Traeger there's some salt we have the most important person in the world right now mr. Sam time to hit the grill dude look at they're not it's raining outside it's raining like a lot so that is a problem well it's a good thing we got the official Scott Martin challenge outdoor kitchen we do have that okay so Scott I'm so excited people complain to me all the time yeah Sam my fish sticks to the grill every time I try and cook it on the right well easy solution put a thin slice of an onion on the grill it offers its a buffer for the heat so yeah fish cooks nice and slow they even and impart some nice flavors if you want to eat it you can that's great you don't want to you don't have to and you don't have to use a ring teeth I've never done that you could use whatever you want really it allows you to still get that grill smoke flavor that you get from the trigger that's nice clean smoke yeah but you don't have to deal with your fish falling apart you don't have to be able to stick into the creek just make some nice things that's what I love about the trigger is because it's indirect even what we have here is wood chips basically right there they have different flavor wood chips this is actually cherry its those are they have different flavors for different things but just put the wood chips in there literally turn this thing on let it get the heat and then set your temperature right now which we've got it cranked up we've had the lid open but it's a 243 now but we're gonna cook this into about 3 375 375 is where he's wanting to cook this meat so the best part about the tray or chicken pork chops fish you're not gonna burn it you're not gonna like charred up you can literally set it get everything working right and go and tend to something else come back in your fish is ready so Scott and after I put the honey down I like to layer paper-thin slices of citrus to put the fish on this imparts a nice citrus flavor it keeps it from being too oniony which can be a problem sometimes for people that don't like just gets thinly sliced just thinly sliced lemons and limes lemons and limes and as those heat up the oils and the skin are gonna they're gonna volatilize and go up in the air and and get into that yes I can't spell the word volatize all right so you season the bottom of the fillets yep what's a trigger veggie shaker and now we're going to do the top yep so we got the bottom season we're gonna season the top we're gonna do exactly what we did but in Reverse so after we season it we're gonna put a couple of citrus slices on there as well [Music] boom that's how we do it right there see I was gonna do BAM cuz I do bandwidth in my videos but being that it's a cooking show or a kitchen cook Emeril Lagasse might get a little mad we may get a letter yeah we might not yeah we have to do that yeah and we'll do BAM later on so now that we've got it set everything laid on there what do we do now that's the best part we send it to 375 when we close it up and we let it cook for 15 to 20 minutes until that dish is nice and tender really that's it out the mount checking a couple times make sure and if it's a thinner or a smaller piece it would be a little bit less right I bet I'd be a little bit big right depends on what kind of fish you got cooking dude here's the best part of love about this trailer [Music] chill whichever that's a BJ [Music] okay so we're transferring this fish from the sour orange juice over to a dry bulb we're gonna keep the sour orange juice because we're gonna need it later let's mix up the ceviche super simple we've got some red onion finely diced we've got some tomato that I peeled and seeded it's very important to cut the peeling and seeds out hmm see how what I'd never know that I would just cut it diced it seed peel and all we've got some fresh cilantro roughly chopped and then I've got a red and an orange habanero that I diced up very finely and I took all the seeds out so we're just gonna start with a little bit because we can always add more and if you don't want have an area you can use jalapeno you can use whatever you want how about ghost Reaper peppers you can get those three professors I'm gonna straighten my peppers he doesn't need a few lovely yeah I've heard about that I'm gonna I'm gonna stick to the to the habanero no this is the lime juice yeah this is the juice that I've marinated yep yes so we're just gonna add some of that in there it's gonna continue on we are all of it all right not on it yeah we don't want to make soup we just want to get it nice and wet whether you can see the liquid in there but it's not covering any right I've had this for restaurants and everybody cooks a little bit different but honestly what I just ate right there and I didn't even eat it with all the extra stuff in there was the best of each you have ever had so whatever he just put in there whatever he told you about putting in there if you want an awesome seviche recipe that's exactly what you need to do let's give it a try [Music] you all right well guess what we're not the kitchen anymore you know why because Sam's cooking was so off the chain it corrupted the last five files yes it exploded them they're gone we don't know what to do man I can't believe you no but I will say this Sam how good was that fish that fish was off the charts dude the ceviche the triple tail on the Traeger it did not get any better than that my friend the trigger gets it right every time anytime yeah it really does guys if you're looking for a good smoker you're looking for a good grill it's right around Christmas time as well be sure to check out the links in the description below for all that also be sure to follow this guy because you know why Sam Edwards is starting his own YouTube channel he doesn't have a single video up yet he doesn't even know what he's gonna call his channel just drop some comments below and let us know what his channel should be called so guys appreciate is gonna see you man Sam thank you very much you don't need my friend alrighty we'll see you next time BAM [Music]", "PrumIij7Q4I": "[Music] morning morning oh boy alright tarps off let's get to the lake [Music] [Music] ah well we are finally on the lake here and we had a huge cold front come through dang that's bright lady huge cold front come through last night temps this morning were in the low 40s and water temp is actually holding decent 51 52 but unfortunately I couldn't find any spawning crappie the last time I was on this body of water I've heard reports that in far northern Wisconsin there are some spawning crappie but I'm guessing with this cold front these crappie probably pushed out deep which is fine because today we're actually gonna be using the wobble bobber and some minnows there we go all those minnows so I'm gonna tell you a little bit about the wobble bobber one it's fun to say - it's white so good in deeper water situations especially post cold fronts like this show you how to rig it up and then we'll put the minnows on hopefully buy it catch a bunch of crappie but first we got to find them I'm gonna guess they're about 10 to 15 feet of water right now so hopefully that's where they are and I can find them let's go since I forgot to explain how I rigged this wobble bobber up I'm just gonna do it briefly here so I have a 1/16 ounce jig head tie it onto six pound monofilament it's tied on you can use it either use a loop knot or I think I tied on an improved clinch knot here you can use either one I'm and then I have the wobble bobber to say one sixteenth ounce wallet bobber which makes sense because I'm using a 1/16 pounds of jig head and above the wobble bobber is just a bobber stop of some kind I'm actually using using the rubber bobber stops that a lot of guys use when they're pitching into heavy grass for bass fishing and they want to peg the bullet weight to the hook that's they sell them for a dollar for a pack of a dozen I do recommend one thing when you put the bobber stop on then you slide the wobble bobber on and you should probably put another bobber stop like six inches above your jig or so and the reason for this is the bobber will not slide all the way to the jig and allow that fish to gain any leverage to shake off the hook all right we're set up good to go let's get some of these wall robbers in the water here and I was right there at about 13 feet of water suspended put that middle on there is well not a slab but it's getting better I like when they get a little better about an 8 inch fish now let's go to nine and then a ten and then a 15 right that's how it works I need a rod holder definitely need a rod holder might be a video and it works on that do-it-yourself rod holder so I'm gonna do that but I'm sure I can figure it out crappie crappie not a big one and yes 8 8 inch fish Oh 9 9 inch fish wasn't on a minnow though no fish on this guy's oh there he is that might be a good one that's not a good crappie hmm this bobbers no and he took my minnow oh we're on him we we are on them and if it's gonna be like the last time I was out here just a bunch of the 8 inch crappie oh we threw my minnow there eight inch fish there we go hit it on the drop we can tighten up the drag another eight and a half inch er all right one would be shorter rod today for the wobble bobber this is a seven foot six they're a little deeper it's weird I'm finding crappie they're suspended ten feet down in 20 feet of water I'm finding crappie on a six to ten foot break right off the shore so they're all over the place so this video you're watching right now this was filmed actually about two weeks ago most you probably know the weather went from winter to summer in most of the US so this was kind of this was early March late April I believe I think there's a turnout early March early May I film this so the water temps are still cold fish were deeper I filmed two videos of spawning crappie I got some underwater footage so that'll be next week but I just want to walk through the wobble bobber setup that I had tell you a few more details about it that I've learned it again this bobber the reason I'm putting out this video now is because a lot of you are in post spawn mode so fish are starting to move deeper and that's kind of what this bobber is for it's a it's a deeper water bobber obviously because there's a slip bobber you don't need to fish with a fixed bobber here but this is great in waves okay when has a rougher water when there's wind I wouldn't use this if it's called dead calm because if it's dead calm odds are these fish are going to be fairly lethargic they're not going to be biting the lure is hard if you're fishing men an artificial whatever you're using these wild bobbers are definitely made for an aggressive strike and this is a 1/16 so this is a one sixteenth ounce wobble bobber the one downside to these the 1/16 is the smallest I could find that Phil makes for these wobble bobbers I think the primary reason for that is these wild waters that's really fun to say these wobble bombers are actually meant for bigger fish walleye bass pike it's it's mainly targeted towards walleye fisherman because they fish in waves and that's what these things are great for they stay afloat you can see them in the waves you can see a strike in the waves windy windy days rough water that's what things these things are made for and I think that's why they don't make a thirty-second ounce or a 64,000 sized bobber so it's definitely a certain type of condition to use something like this okay I'm not saying go out and use these all the time I wouldn't do that I don't do that but windy conditions these things are great and I know something you're gonna ask hey what were you throwing them on I think the videos has footage from two maybe three different outings again I didn't catch any big fish that Lake that I'm fishing on and all those outings I'm disappointed this year last year I caught some good fish out of there this year not so much the bed fishing video that I got coming up I got two of them potentially three bed fishing videos it's on different Lake and there's some good sized crappie biggest one I caught I think on video is twelve and a half which is a solid crappie I'm not saying it's a 16 inch slab slab Zillah but it's a solid crappie so you can look forward to that hopefully sometime this week we've got a got to get this one out first and then I'll get to those but what I was using so a couple when these fish were kind of spread out and they wouldn't stay under the boat because I could see him on the sonar under the boat but they wouldn't stay under the boat they get scared they were skittish I'd have to cast so I'm using a seven and a half foot casting rod this is an ACC crappie sticks casting rod it's a seven and a half foot medium light and works great for when this is actually I'm going to use this for post bond when these fish come off their beds and start getting that six to ten foot range of water and I'll be throwing beetle spins maybe some small crank baits this seven and a half foot rod also I have an eight they make an 8 foot rod no these are gonna be my main casting rods and slip bobber to style Raja these are great I mean look at seven and a half foot rod it's a fairly common multi-purpose both pan fish wall-eyed maybe if you're using finesse tackle for bass 7 1/2 foot rod that's most of what most people are using but in first I think the first part of the video I was using this guy this guy is an 11 foot jig pole but it works great for slip bobbers or I've used the the fixed bobber video with the crappie nibbles that pencil bobber I could set that pencil bobber to 10 feet and I still could reel all the way up with this thing because it's 11 foot rod and this is great for when I can get almost right on top of the fish I know they're right around the boat but I just need to pitch it out I need to pitch either the bobber of the jig just out a little bit from the boat nowhere in 20 feet that that's where this one was perfect but this one's definitely more of a vertical jig style rod obviously it's 11-footer you're not going to see a lot of these in the Midwest but these were great and you're jigging in cover I'm actually going to show the next bed fishing video jigging and brush a lot of you guys down south us Maine bread-and-butter besides spider rigging so this 11 foot rod definitely come into play probably later in the summer when I'm jigging brush piles or jigging actual brush emerge brush and let's say five to six feet of water when they push up shallow in the early mornings and late at night but this one worked was most of the video I was shot with this rod this 11-footer they weren't great for just pitching out in front of the boat when these crappie were schooled up tight and in deeper water oh there is hit it on the drop well no no you want to see catching 8-inch fish all night I think we should move I'm watching this video I sure as heck don't wanted to see 8-inch fish well I see some actual 10 plus there's a fish came up from underneath oh yes there's the crappie we've been looking for that's a good good fish right there I think that's a 10 inch 10 inch fish let's put her on the measurement sticks please be 10 inches that that that's what she said yes there we go Oh hold on I got crappy stuff on my gonna make sure you guys can see that he's he's well I think he's just shy at 10 actually oh he's like nine and seven ace 1970s dang it oh there is that's a good fish too I don't know if that's a harpy if it's crappie it's a good crappie that's running like something like a rock bass maybe then it's a rock bass you let it go so again the reason why I'm posting this video now is because crappie moving the kind of the same pattern when they go from pre-spawn to spawn and then that right after the post spawn they're moving in that same channel let's let's call it that so when in pre spawn mode I finally was finding crappie mix between hey hey hey buddy try to film here what a dingleberry let's find a crappie between 15 to 20 foot drop off and then I'd find crappie and that's six to ten foot drop off those crappie in the six to ten no they're pushing up they're trying to get ready to spawn but that's kind of they're just gonna do the reverse now and in post spawn so they went up and did their spawning they're in less than five feet of water I got video there's some of them are less than two feet of water some beds that footage I got but now they're going to push back out into that six 10 foot range and then eventually in the midsummer when gets really hot they're gonna try to push out to deeper water so that's kind of why I post in this video it's just gonna be the reverse of pre spawn as soon as the spawn gets done they're gonna move back out and that's when you're going to be able to use this tactic again windy conditions or rough water these water bombers work great so if you if you want to check these wobble bobbers out this again the smallest size is 1/16 ounce so just be aware of that I'll leave a link below you can check them out and also if you want to check out the rods 7.5 foot 8 foot and an 11 foot where the three main ones I was using in this video that link will be down below ACC crappie sticks comm also you can use a promo code to get yourself ten percent off FC ten F c10 get yourself ten percent off helps my channel grow and try to fish new lakes also you get a great fishing rod so I don't remember if I shot an outro I haven't looked through all the footage yet if I haven't as always I appreciate you watching be sure to like and share that video the last bobber video just passed like 8,000 views which was awesome thank you so much I definitely am probably gonna be doing that one again actually this is the setup I'm using for spawning it's a smaller balsa wood bobber but I'm gonna do a full video on that so don't worry just a little smaller balsa wood bobber and I got a hand-tied jig from a subscriber so those videos coming up if you're not a subscriber below the video there's a red button click that subscribe button and be sure to click that bell it notifies you when I post a video so you can watch it right away also at the end of the video you see my face holding the crappie you can click on that to subscribe we'll

time and I don't like to do it all the time I like to give it a break and then do it again give it a break do it again so today is that day so we've got the Canadian pizza with the Italian sausage mushroom and pepperoni and extra sauce and I've also got the pizza well done and I've also got their chicken alfredo I've never had this it looks really fired I could see the chicken I can see the pasta and obviously the sauce style flavor sauce and it looks like they put it in the oven because you see the brick marks at the ends you guys I'm going to smash smash this food if you guys do enjoy that type of eating don't forget to Like subscribe and comment and let's get all this food in my belly right now guys so I've got the ranch and I've also got their roasted garlic I've never had it so I'm down to try that roasted garlic right now sauce Wow Wow actually love mushrooms on pizza you tellin salted is fire on it because that Hardy like kind of like the immediate heart II feel through the pizza dominos pan pizza is my favorite pizza it's so soft that chicken is so tender the sauce is really good I taste garlic but it's very soft like the taste is very soft it's not like your strong pungent like alfredo sauce flavor by taste of garlic for sure it's so good it's really creamy oh yeah okay Ranch you mr. Domino's so this pretty much what it is an Armenian Japanese and Italian right now the reason why I get it well done is because if you get if you don't get it well done it's super oily so when you get it well done it dries up the oil and then I get extra sauce on it because the sauce would be dried up a little bit so you get extra sauce to make up for that sauce that would dry up when you get it well done it trust me you will love it next time you go to Domino's when it gets Tang do that you'll thank me later I'm actually using this so fast eating it really freaking fast [Applause] [Applause] by the wish I had points with my pizza I just got this because I've never had it before I'm like let me try it let me give him wings a break because I've been eating a lot of chicken chicken wings and stuff so I'm like let me do chicken alfredo but I do rather I do rather eat it with the wings [Applause] [Applause] would you tell that I'm reading hungry I'm not talking I don't want to talk today cuz I just want to go smash his food don't always eat dominos pan but when I do I prefer to eat it like this I don't know why took a sandwich take a delicious Domino's pound sandwich I really like this roasted garlic sauce [Applause] remember so in the comments one said why are you that hungry I feel like we eat this there's something you eat on its own now you will eat it with a pizza [Applause] threw in the towel more like four four now you guys see me for four I hope you guys all enjoy this you guys too enjoyed this video that was Bom Tom I eat after this video to be honest I might go get some tea again I'm probably gonna go get some tea after this video fill er up fill er up but if you guys do enjoy this video give it a like subscribe a comm and if you guys don't enjoy this video don't forget to Like subscribe they call me", "dBnniua6-oM": "- [Announcer] This program is presented by University of California Television. Like what you learn? Visit our website, or follow us on Facebook and Twitter to keep up with the latest UCTV programs. (upbeat techno music) - I'm going to tell you, tonight, a story. And this story dates back about 30 years. This story has a little bit\nof something for everybody. It has a little bit of biochemistry, a little bit of clinical research, a little bit of public health, a little bit of politics, a\nlittle bit of racial innuendo. The only thing it's missing is sex. (audience laughs) But, well, we can see what\nwe can do about that, too. By the end of the story I hope I will have debunked the last 30 years of nutrition information in America. And I would very much appreciate it if at the end of the\ntalk, you would tell me whether or not I was successful or not. Okay? So, in order to get you in the mood, as it were, let's start\nwith a little quiz. What do the Atkins Diet and the Japanese Diet have in common? Anybody? Hm? Oh, you have the answers\nright, never mind. That's right, you have\nthe answer right there. So the Atkins diet, of\ncourse, is all fat no carb. The Japanese diet's all carb, not fat. They both work, right? So what do they share in common? They both eliminate the sugar, fructose. So, with that, think about\nwhat it means to be on a diet, and what macro-nutrients you're eating and which ones your not. And then we'll go from there, and I'll try to explain how this all works. So, you've all heard about\nthe obesity epidemic. Here are the numbers. These are the NHANES\ndatabase Body Mass Index. Everybody knows what that is now. Histograms marching ever\nrightward as time has gone on. This was what was\nprojected for 2008 in blue. We had so far exceeded and surpassed, this is not even funny. This was from 2003. The reason I show this is not just to show that the obese are getting obeser, of course, that's true, but in fact the entire curve has shifted. We all weigh 25 pounds more today than we did 25 years ago, all of us. Now, it is often said that obesity is the ultimate interaction between genetics and environment. And Doctor Christian Vaisse, who's sitting in the back of the room, will be talking to you next week about\nthe genetic component, which I am also very interested in. But, having said that, our genetic pool did not change in the last 30 years, but, boy oh boy, has our\nenvironment sure changed. So, tonight, we're gonna talk about the environment rather than genes. Now, in order to talk\nabout the environment, we need to talk about what is obesity. And, of course, you're all familiar with the basic concept with the\nfirst law of thermodynamics, which states that the total energy inside a closed system remains constant. Now, in human terms, the\nstandard interpretation of this law is the following. If you eat it, you better burn\nit, or you're gonna store it. Now, who here believes that? Oh, come on, you all do. (audience laughs) I used to believe that. I don't anymore. I think that's a mistake. I think that is the biggest mistake. And that is the phenomenon\nI'm going to try to debunk over the course over the next hour. Because I think there's\nanother way to state the law which is much more relevant,\nand much more to the point. Before I get there, of\ncourse, if you believe that, these are the two problems,\ncalories in, calories out. Two behaviors, gluttony and sloth. After all, you see anybody on the street, \"Oh, he's a gluttonous sloth,\nthat's all there is to it.\" Tommy Thompson said it on the TV show. \"We just eat too damn much.\" Well, you know, if that were the case, how did the Japanese do this? Why are they doing bariatric surgery on children at Tokyo\nChildren's Hospital today? Why are the Chinese, why are the Koreans, why are the Australians? I mean, all these countries\nwho've adopted our diet all suffer now from the same problem. And we're gonna get even\nfurther in a minute. There's another way to\nstate this first law. And that is, if you're gonna store it, that is biochemical forces\nthat drive energy storage, and we'll talk about what\nthey are in a few minutes, and you expect to burn it, that is normal energy expenditure for\nnormal quality of life. Because energy expenditure\nand quality of life are the same thing. Things that make your\nenergy expenditure go up, make you feel good. Like ephedrine, it's off the market, coffee for two yours, then\nyou need another hit, like me. Things that make your\nenergy expenditure go down, like starvation, hypothyroidism,\nmake you feel lousy. And how many calories you burn and how good you feel are synonymous. So, if you're gonna store it, that is an obligate weight gain set up by a biochemical process, and you expect to burn it, that is normal energy expenditure for\nnormal quality of life, then you're gonna have to eat it. And now, all of the sudden,\nthese two behaviors, the gluttony and the sloth,\nare actually secondary to a biochemical process,\nwhich is primary. And it's a different way\nto think about the process. And it also alleviates the obese person from being the perpetrator,\nbut rather the victim. Which is how obese people really feel. 'Cause no one chooses to be obese. Certainly, no child chooses to be obese. Oh, you say, \"Oh, yeah, sure, \"I know some adults who don't care.\" You know, Rossini, the famous composer, you know La gazza ladra,\nFigaro, and all that. He retired at age 37 to a lifetime of gastronomic debauchery. Maybe he chose to be obese. But the kids I take care\nof in obesity clinic do not choose to be obese. In fact, this is the exception\nthat proves the rule. We have an epidemic of\nobese six month olds. Now, if you wanna say that it's all about diet and exercise, then you\nhave to explain this to me. So, any hypothesis that you wanna proffer that explains the obesity epidemic, you've got to explain this one too. And this is not just in America, these six month old obese kids, but these are around the world now. So, open your minds?, and let's go and figure out what the real story is. Let's talk about calorie intake, because that's what today is about. We're gonna talk about the energy intake side of the equation. Sure enough, we are all eating more now than we did 20 year ago. Teen boys are eating 275 calories more. American adult males are eating\n187 calories more per day. American adult females are\neating 335 calories more per day. No question, we're all eating more. Question is why, how come? 'Cause it's all there? You know what, it was there before. We're all eating more, there's a system in our body, which you've heard about over the last couple\nof weeks called leptin. Everybody heard of leptin? It's this hormone that\ncomes from your fat cell, tells your brain, \"You\nknow what, I've had enough. \"I don't need to eat anymore. \"I'm done, and I can\nburn energy properly.\" Well, you know what? If you're eating 187 or\n335 calories more today than you were 20 years ago,\nyour leptin ain't working. 'Cause if it were, you\nwouldn't be doing it. Whether the food was there or not. So, there's something wrong with our biochemical negative feedback system that normally controls energy balance. And we have to figure out what caused it, and how to reverse it. And that's what tonight is about. But, nonetheless, there are 275 calories we have to account for. So where are they? Are they in the fat? No, they're not in the fat. Five grams, 45 calories\nout of the 275, nothing. In fact, it's all in the carbohydrates. 57 grams 228 calories. We're all eating more carbohydrate. Now, you all know, back int 1982, The American Heart Association, The American Medical Association, and the US Department of Agriculture admonished us to reduce our total fat consumption from 40% to 30%. Everybody remember that? That how Entenmann's fat\nfree cakes came into being. Remember that? So what happened? We did it, we've done it. 40% down to 30%, and look what's happened to the obesity, metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver\ndisease, cardiovascular disease, stroke prevalence, all jacked way up, as our total fat consumption\nas a percent has gone down. It ain't the fat,\npeople, it ain't the fat. So what is it? Well, it's the carbohydrate. Specifically, which carbohydrate? Well, beverage intake, right? 41% increase in soft drinks,\n35% increase in fruit drinks, fruitades, whatever you wanna call them. Just remember, down here, one can of soda a day, is 150 calories. Multiply that by 365 days a year, and then divide that by the magic number of 3500 calories per pound, if you eat or drink 3500 calories more than you burn, you\nwill gain one pound of fat. That's the first law of\nthermodynamics, no argument there. That's worth 15 1/2\npounds of fat per year. One soda a day is 15 1/2 pounds per year. Now, you've all heard that before. That's not news to you. The question is how come we don't respond? How come leptin doesn't work? How come we can't stay energy stable. That's what we're gonna get to. So, I call this slide, very specifically, the Coca Cola Conspiracy. Anybody here work for Coke, Pepsi? Okay, good. All right, so, this over here, 1915, the first standardized bottle\nof Coca Cola out of Atlanta. Anybody remember this bottle? Sure, a lot of you do. I remember this bottle,\nbecause my grandfather in Brooklyn, took me on Saturday afternoon down to the local soda shop\non Avenue M and Ocean Avenue, and every Saturday afternoon\nI had one of these. I remember it very well. Now, if you drank one of those every day, assuming of course that\nthe recipe hasn't changed, 'cause after all, only\ntwo people in the word know the recipe, and they're not allowed to fly on the plane at the same time. You know that, okay. Assuming the recipe hasn't changed, if you drank one of those\nevery day for a year, 6 1/2 ounces, that would be worth eight pounds of fat per year. Now, in 1955, after World War II, when sugar became plentiful again, and wasn't being rationed, we have the appearance\nof the 10 ounce bottle, the first one that was\nfound in vending machines. You probably remember that one, as well. Then in 1960, the ever ubiquitous, 12 ounce can, worth 16\npounds of fat per year. And, of course, today, this, over here is the single unit of measure, 20 ounces. Anybody know how many\nservings are in that bottle? - [Audience Member] 2.5. - 2.5 eight ounce servings, that's right. Anybody know, anybody gets 2.5 eight ounce servings out of that bottle? That's a single serving, right? So that would be worth\n26 pounds of fat per year if you did that every day. And then, of course, over here, we have the 7/11 Big K, Thirst Buster, Big Gulp, whatever you wanna call it, 44 ounces, worth 57\npounds of fat per year. And if that wasn't bad\nenough, my colleague, Dr. Dan Hale, at the University\nof Texas San Antonio, tells me that down there they\ngot a Texas size Big Gulp. 60 ounces of Coca Cola, a Snickers bar, and a bag of Doritos, all for 99 cents. - [Audience] Oh. - So if you did that every day for a year that would be worth 112\npounds of fat per year. So why do I call it the\nCoca Cola conspiracy? Well, what's in Coke? Caffeine, good, good, so what's caffeine? It's a mild stimulant, right? It's also a diuretic, right? It makes you pee free water. What else is in Coke? We'll get to the sugar\nin a minute, what else? Salt, salt. 55 milligrams of sodium per can. It's like drinking a pizza. So what happens if you take on sodium and lose free water, you get... - [Audience] Thirsty. - Thirstier, right. So, why's there so much sugar in Coke? To hide the salt. When was the last time you\nwent to a Chinese restaurant, had sweet and sour pork? That's half soy sauce,\nyou wouldn't eat that. Except the sugar plays\na trick on your tongue, you can't even tell it's there. Everybody remember New Coke, 1985? More salt, more caffeine. They knew what they were doing. That's the smoking gun. They know, they know. All right, so, that's why\nit's the Coca Cola conspiracy. So, are soft drinks the cause of obesity? Well, depends on who you ask. If you ask the scientists for the National Soft Drink Association, they'll tell you there's absolutely no association between sugar\nconsumption and obesity. If you ask my colleague,\nDoctor David Ludwig, remember, I'm Lustig he's Ludwig, he does what I do at\nBoston Children's Hospital. Some day we're gonna open up a law firm. (audience laughs) Each additional sugar\nsweetened drink increase over a 19 month follow up period in kids increased their BMI by this much in their odds risk ratio\nfor obesity by 60%. That's a prospective study\non soft drinks and obesity. The real deal. If you look at meta-analysis, everybody know what a meta-analysis is? It's a conglomeration of numerous studies subjected to rigorous\nstatistical analysis. 88 cross sectional and\nlongitudinal studies regressing soft drink consumption against energy intake, body weight,\nmilk and calcium intake, adequate nutrition, all showing\nsignificant associations. And some of these being longitudinal, this came from Kelly\nBrownell's group at Yale. I should comment, a\ndisclaimer, those studies that were funded by the beverage industry showed consistently smaller effects than those that were independent. Wonder why. Now, how 'bout the converse? What if you take the soft drinks away? So this was the fizzy drink study from Christ Church England James et al, British Medical Journal, where they went into schools and they took\nthe soda machines out. Just like we did here in California. We haven't seen the data yet, but they went and did it for a year. So the prevalence of obesity in the intervention schools stayed absolutely constant, no change. Whereas the prevalence of obesity in the control schools\nwhere nothing changed continued to rise over the year. So that's pretty good. So, how 'bout type two diabetes? Are soft drinks the cause\nof type two diabetes? Well, this study from JAMA in 2004 looked at the relative risk ratio of all soft drinks, cola, fruit punch, and found a very statistically significant trend of sugared soft drinks, fruitades, et cetera, causing type two diabetes. And you know we've got\njust as big a problem with type two diabetes as we do with obesity for the same reasons. And this was a sugared\nsweetened beverage against risk for type two diabetes\nin African American women. Looking here at sugar\nsweetened soft drinks, just the downward arrow shows that there was a significant rise as the number of drinks went up. You can see that here. Whereas orange and grapefruit\njuice, interestingly, did not. So, two different studies,\ntwo different increases in type two diabetes, relative\nto soft drink consumption. So, what's in soft drinks? Well, in America, it's this stuff, right? High fructose corn syrup. Everybody's heard of it, right? It's been demonized something awful. So much so that the corn refiners industry has launched a mega-campaign to try to absolve high fructose\ncorn syrup of any problems, which we'll talk about in a moment. But the bottom line is, this is something we were never exposed to before 1975. And currently we are consuming 63 pounds per person per\nyear, every one of us, 63 pounds of high fructose corn syrup. - [Audience Member] That's America? - That's America, yes. Now, what is high fructose corn syrup? Well, you'll see in a minute. It's one glucose, one fructose, we'll talk about those at great length. One of the reasons we use\nhigh fructose corn syrup is because it's sweeter. So here's sucrose, this\nis cane or beet sugar, standard table sugar, you\nknow, the white stuff, and we give that an index\nin sweetness of 100. So here's high fructose corn syrup, it's actually sweeter, it's about 120. So, you should be able to use less, right? Wrong, we use just as\nmuch, in fact, we use more. So, here's lab fructose over\nhere, crystalline fructose. And they're starting to\nput crystalline fructose into some of the soft drinks. They're actually advertising\nit as a good thing. Phew. And that's got a sweetness of 173, so you should be able to\ncut that way back, right? They're not. Lactose, down here, milk\nsugar, it's not sweet at all. And glucose, I should\npoint out over here, 74. It's not particularly\nsweet, and we're gonna get to that at the end, and\nwhat goes on with glucose. But anyway, there's why\nwe use it, it's sweeter, it's also cheaper as I'll show you. So, here's high fructose corn syrup. One glucose, one fructose. Notice the glucose is a six membered ring, the fructose is a five membered ring. They are not the same. Believe me, they're not the same. That's what this whole talk is about is how their not the same. And here's sucrose, and they're just bound together by this ether linkage. We have this enzyme in\nour gut called sucrose, it kills that bond in two seconds flat, and you absorb it and, basically,\nhigh fructose corn syrup, sucrose, it's a non issue, it's a wash. They're the same. And they know that they're the same, the soft drink companies\nand the corn refiners. Because here are their missives. This comes from the Corn\nRefiners Association. Obesity research shows\nhigh fructose corn syrup metabolizes and impacts\nsatiety similar to sugar. Indeed it does, I agree. Decent meetings, academic\nmeetings around the country. Hunger and satiety profiles energy intakes following ingestion of soft drinks, bottom line, research supported by the American Beverage Institute and the Corn Refiner's Association. They are correct, there is absolutely no difference between high\nfructose corn syrup and sucrose. So much so that the Corn\nRefiner's Association, in attempt to capture market share, came out with this entire ad campaign. You probably saw it on the back page of the New York Times, it\nwas on TV, it's everywhere. \"My hairdresser says\nthat sugar's healthier \"than high fructose corn syrup. \"Wow, you get your hair done by a doctor?\" I didn't know I could cut hair. If you all wanna see all of them, there are a whole bunch of them. You can go to www.sweetsurprise.com and see how you're being hoodwinked. But indeed, this is true. High fructose corn syrup and\nsucrose are exactly the same. They're both equally bad. They're both dangerous,\nthey're both poison. Okay, I said it, poison. My charge before the end of tonight is to demonstrate fructose is a poison, and I will do it, and you will tell me if I was successful. None the less, here's\nCenter for the Science and Public Interest and the\nCorn Refiners Association. Everybody remember last\nyear, when Gavin Newsom floated his soda tax, last February? Governor Patterson of New\nYork has since floated one. And other people are\nstarting to talk about it. So, why are they saying this? Well, they're saying obesity's a problem, kids are drinking soda, let's tax it. So they're talking about soda\nlike it's empty calories. I'm here to tell you that it\ngoes way beyond empty calories. The reason why this is\na problem is because fructose is a poison, it's\nnot about the calories. It has nothing to do with the calories. It's a poison by itself,\nand I'm gonna show you that. Nonetheless, I just wanna read you this paragraph here in yellow. \"We respectfully urge that the proposal \"be revised as soon as possible to reflect \"the scientific evidence that demonstrates \"no material differences\nin the health effects \"of high fructose corn syrup and sugar.\" I agree. Here's the important sentence. \"The real issue is that\nexcessive consumption \"of any sugars may lead\nto health problems.\" I agree, that's exactly right. Not may, does, does. So, here's the secular trend in fructose consumption\nover the past 100 years. Before we had food processing, we used to get our fructose from\nfruits and vegetables, and if we did that today, we would consume about 15 grams per day of fructose. Not sugar, fructose. So sugar would be 30\ngrams, it'd be double. We're just talking about fructose, today. Prior to World War II,\nbefore it got rationed again, we were up to about 16\nto 24, about 20 grams. So, a small increase from the beginning of the century to World War II. Then, in 1977, just as\nhigh fructose corn syrup was hitting the market,\nwe had increased that, we had, basically, doubled\nup to 37 grams per day, or 8% of total caloric intake. By 1994 we were up to 55\ngrams of the stuff per day. Remember, if you wanna do\nsugar, then double the number. So, that's 10.2, so you\ncan see that more and more of our caloric intake, a higher percentage is being accounted for by\nsugar every single year. So, it's not just that we're eating more. We're eating more sugar. And for adolescents today,\nup to almost 75 grams, 12% of total caloric intake. 25% of the adolescents today consume at least 15% of their\ncalories from fructose alone. This is a disaster, an\nabsolute unmitigated disaster. The fat's going down,\nthe sugar's going up, and we're all getting sick. Now let me show you why. How'd this happen? Why'd it happen? So, this is where the politics comes in. This is the perfect storm, and it was created from\nthree political winds that swirled around all at the same time to create this perfect storm. So, the first political wind, everything bad that ever happened in this country started with one man. (audience laughs) And it's still being felt today. So, Richard Nixon, in his\nparanoia back in 1972, food prices were going up\nand down, and up and down. I'm gonna show you that on the next slide. And he was worried that this was actually gonna cost him the election. So, he admonished his\nSecretary of Agriculture, Earl Rusty Butz, I love that name, to basically take food\noff the political table, to make food a non-issue\nin presidential elections. Well, the only way to do\nthat was to make food cheap. So, he was out to find all methods to be able to decrease the price of food. Remember Nixon's war on poverty? We're suffering from it today. That's what this is. Second political wind, the advent of high fructose corn syrup. So, this was invented in\n1966 at Saga Medical School in Japan, by a guy named\nTakasaki, who's still alive. As far as I'm concerned, this stuff is Japan's revenge for World War II, except, of course, that they're suffering from it now, themselves. Like everything, it always\ncomes back to haunt you. And it was introduced to\nthe American Market in 1975. So, what do you think happened to the price of sugar when\nthis thing hit the market? Here's what happened. So, here's the US producer\nprice index of sugar going up and down, and up and down. This is not good. Stability is at 100%, if\nit stays nice and stable at 100%, that's what you\nwant if you're a politician. Up and down, here's where corn sweeteners entered the market, 1975, 1980. And you can see that since then the price of sugar has remained remarkably constant. And it did so, not just in the US, but also on the international stage. Here's the London price\ndoing the same thing. And when you look at\nthe difference in price between sugar and high\nfructose corn syrup, you can see that high\nfructose corn syrup's about half the price. So, in other words, it's cheap. So, high fructose corn syrup is evil. But it's not evil because\nit's metabolically evil. It's evil because it's economically evil. Because it's so cheap that it's found it's way into everything. It's found it's way into hamburger buns, pretzels, barbecue sauce, and\nketchup, almost everything. Somebody emailed me the other day and told me they went into\ntheir local grocery store and went through every\nsingle loaf of bread on the shelf, and out of 32 types of bread on the shelf, only one of them did not have high fructose corn syrup in it. So, we are being poisoned by this stuff, and it's been added surreptitiously to all of our food, every processed food. The question is why? Well, you'll see why in a minute. So, the corn refiners like to point out, \"Well, you know, it's\njust been a substitution. \"As the high fructose\ncorn syrup's gone up, :the sugar's gone down. \"You know, we're just\nreplacing, like gram for gram.\" Well, not exactly, because here's 73 pounds of sugar per year. This is from the Economic Research Service of the US Department of Agriculture. So disappearance data. 73 pounds, up to 95 pounds by 2000. And there's something\nmissing from this slide. Anybody wanna tell me what it is? What's missing? Juice, juice is missing. 'Cause juice is sucrose, right, sugar. And juice causes obesity. So this is a study done by Myles Faith, a prospective study in\ninner city Harlem toddlers. And the number of juice servings per day predicts the change in BMI score per month in these inner city Harlem toddlers. Now, where do these inner city Harlem toddlers get their juice? From what, from where, from whom? From WIC. Anybody heard of WIC? You know what WIC is? Women Infants Children, right? A government entitlement\nprogram set up under who? Nixon, to prevent failure to thrive. They did. This is the equal and opposite reaction. So, let's add juice in, here it is. So, most fructose items\nwhen you put it together, now we're up to 113 pounds on this graph, and I just heard from Brian Williams, of NBC News, after the\nmost recent study came out, that was in the Journal\nof Clinical Investigation, that we are actually up to\n141 pounds of sugar per year. Each of us. That's what we're up to. 141 pounds of sugar per year. Now, do you think that this might have some detrimental effects on you? Hasn't stopped you, has it? That's the point, it hasn't stopped you. That's why we need to talk about this. So, juice consumption increases the risk for Type 2 diabetes. So this is the relative risk ratio as juice intake goes up, and\nthis is in the Nurse's Study. Showing again, juice consumption, sucrose, obesity, diabetes. Okay, the third political\nstorm, that's swirling around to create this disaster,\nthis mega-typhoon, that thing that happened in 1982, the USDA, the American Hearth Association, the American Medical Association, all telling us we had to\nreduce our consumption of fat. Now, why did they tell us that? To stop what? To stop hear disease. Did we? No, we didn't, did we? In fact, it's worked the exact opposite. We've only created more. So, now how did this come to be? Why did they tell us to stop eating fat? Well, in the early 1970s we discovered something in our blood called LDL, low-density lipoproteins. You've heard of that, right? Is it good or bad? - [Audience Member] Bad. - Not so bad, we'll talk about it. In the mid 1970s we learned that dietary fat raised your LDL. So, if dietary fat is A, and LDL is B, we learned that A lead to B. Dietary fat definitely increases your LDL, no argument, it's true. And then, finally, in\nthe late 1970s we learned that LDL correlated with\ncardiovascular disease. So let's call cardiovascular disease C. So we learned that B lead to C. So, the thought process by some very smart nutritionists, et cetera, the USDA et cetera, said, \"Well if A leads to B, and B leads to C \"then A must lead to C,\ntherefore, no A, no C.\" This was the logic. Now, any logicians in the room? Anybody see any problems with that logic? Go ahead. (speaking away from microphone) - That's right, the premise is incorrect. And I'll tell you why\nthe premise is incorrect. Because this suggests that\nthis is all transitive. But, in fact, only the\ncontrapositive is transitive. So, it's not no A, no C, it's no C, no A. So, the logic isn't even right. There's faulty logic here. So, this doesn't work on any level. So, I'm gonna show you\nwhy this doesn't work. But, before I how you why it doesn't work, I'm gonna show you that this was a battle royal back in the 1970s. This was not a simple thing. There were people lined up\non both sides of this story. So, this, over here, is\na book, 1972 it came out, and it was called Pure White and Deadly. It's all about sugar. Written by a British physiologist, nutritionist, endocrinologist, by the name of John Yudkin. Now, I never knew John\nYudkin he's passed away. But, I read this book about a year ago. And without even knowing\nit, I was a Yudkin acolyte. I was a Yudkin disciple. Every single thing that this man said in 1972 is the God's honest truth. And if you wanna read a true\nprophecy, you find this book. It's not easy to find,\nbut you go find this book. And I'm telling you, every single thing this guy said has come to pass. It's astounding, I am in awe of this guy. But on the other side we\nhad this guy over here. His name was Ancel Keys. Anybody heard of him? So, Ancel Keys was a\nMinnesota epidemiologist, very interested in the cause\nof cardiovascular disease. And he performed the first multivariate regression analysis without computers. Now, anybody know what that means? Multivariate regression analysis? So, this is where you\ntake a whole lot of data, and normally you would just\nrun a few computer programs, but basically, the object is to try to figure out what causes what, and to try to factor out other things and determine what the contribution of various things all at once are to an outcome that you're looking for. So, he was interested in\ncardiovascular disease. So, what he did was he did this study, along with other people around the world, called the Seven Countries Study. Very famous, front page\nof Time Magazine in 1980. So, here's the data on\nthe Seven Country Study. So, we have the US, Canada, Australia, England and Wales, Italy, Japan. And here's percent calories\nfrom fat on the x axis, and here we have coronary\ndisease death rate on the y axis. And so you'd say, \"Oh, look at that.\" I mean, it's very obvious, isn't it. Sure, percent calories from fat correlates very nicely with\ncoronary disease, right? Except for one little problem. Anybody see it? Japan and Italy? So, how much sugar do they eat? Didn't I tell you the Japanese\ndiet eliminates fructose? They never even had it 'til we brought it to them after World War II. Italy, aside from gelato,\nI mean what else they got? They got a lot of pasta, there's a lot of glucose, but no fructose. There's no sugar in the Italian diet other than the occasional\nsweet, which they moderate. They're very careful about\nmoderating, and they cost a lot. But, here we got England,\nWales, Canada, Australia, US, you know, we are sugarholics, aren't we? We're also fataholics. So, in fact, the fat\nmigrated with the sugar. So, here's, this is from Keys's own work. Page 262, if you wanna pick\nup the 500 page volume. And I'm just gonna read you the one paragraph that talks about this. The fact that the incidence rate of coronary heart disease\nwas significantly correlated with the average percentage of calories from sucrose in the diet, is explained by the intercorrelation of\nsucrose with saturated fat. In other words, donuts. Where ever there was the\nfat, there was sucrose too. Because these guys here eat donuts. (audience laughs) Partial correlation analysis show that with saturated fat constant, there was no significant correlation between dietary sucrose and the incidence of coronary heart disease. Okay, when you do a multivariate\nlinear regression analysis, you have to do it both ways. You have to do holding fat constant showing the sucrose doesn't work, and then you have to hold sucrose constant and who that fat still works. You see that anywhere? He didn't do it, he didn't do it. He didn't do the thing that you need to do to do a multivariate\nlinear regression analysis. Now, this was done before computers. We can't check the work. He's dead, he died in 2004. So, we're left with a conundrum. Do we believe this? Do we believe this study, because we based 30 years of nutrition\neducation, and information, and policy in this country on this study. And, as far as I'm\nconcerned, it has a hole as big as the one in the USS Cole, all right, you got it? Everybody, am I debunking, yes, no? Let's keep going. Remember, I told you\nLDL may be not so bad? Well, here's why. Because there really isn't\none LDL, there are two. There are two LDLs. Here's one over here, it's called pattern A or large buoyant LDL. So, everybody knows that LDL correlates with cardiovascular\ndisease, and that's true. I'm not gonna argue that, that is true. But, it's not this one, pattern A LDL. These guys are so light,\nthey are buoyant, they float. So, they get carried\nthrough the bloodstream, and they don't even have a chance, because they're so big\nand they're so buoyant, they don't even get underneath the edge of the endothelial\ncells in the vasculature to start the plaque formation process. But, over here we have\nthis other guy, over here, called pattern B or small dense LDL. You see the difference? These guys are dense. These guys don't float. These guys are small, they get underneath the edge of the surface of the surface of the endothelial cells, and they start the plaque formation. And it's been shown by\nnumerous investigators now, the dense LDL is the bad guy. Okay, now, when we measure\nLDL in the bloodstream, when you do a lipid profile, you measure both of them together, because it's too hard\nto distinguish the two. So, when you get an LDL,\nyou're getting both LDLs. The neutral one and the bad one. Now, how can you tell whether your LDL is the neutral one or the bad one. What you do is you look at\nyour triglycerides level in association with it,\n'cause your triglycerides tell you which one it is. So here, here's pattern A over here, big large buoyant LDLs, and you'll notice that the triglycerides are\nlow, and your HDL is high. That's what you want, you\nwant a low triglyceride, high HDL, 'cause that's\nthe good cholesterol. You want high good cholesterol. Over here, you have pattern B. And here you have high\ntriglyceride, low HDL. That's the bad guy, that's\nthe guy you don't wanna be. 'Cause you're gonna die of a heart attack. No question about it. Triglyceride to HDL\nratio actually predicts cardiovascular disease way\nbetter than LDL ever did. Point is, when you measure\nLDL, you measure both. So, dietary fat raises your large buoyant. What do you think raises your small dense? Carbohydrate. Okay, so here's percent carbohydrate, and here's your pattern B going up. Everybody got it? So what did we do? What did we do in 1982? (speaking away from microphone) What did we do? We went on a high carb diet, which was supposed to be a low fat diet, right? So, here's the low fat craze. Took America and the world by storm. Because the content of low fat home cooked food, that\nyou cook by yourself, in your house, you can\ncontrol the content of fat. But when you process it,\nlow fat processed food, it tastes like cardboard. It tastes like (bleep). So the food companies knew\nthat, so what'd they do? They had to make it palatable? So, how do you make something palatable that has no fat in it? You add the, sugar. So, everybody remember Snackwells? Two grams of fat down, 13\ngrams of carbohydrate up, four of them being sugar,\nso that it was palatable. Well, we've just shown you that that's the worst thing you could do. And that's what we've done. And we're still doing it, today. So when you find a\nmistake, what do you do? You admit the mistake\nand you right the ship. We haven't admitted the mistake, and we haven't righted the ship. So, we've our food supply adulterated, contaminated, poisoned, tainted. On purpose, and we've\nallowed it, and we've let it, thought the addition of fructose for palatability, especially\nbecause of the decreased fat, and also as a ostensibly browning agent, which actually has it's own issues. Because why it browns so well with the sugar in it, actually is what's going on in your arteries. Because that's causing what we call protein glycation and cross linking, which is actually contribution\nto atherosclerosis. So it works on your steak on the grill, it works in your arteries the same way. And removal of fiber also. Now, why did we remove\nfiber from our diet? We, as human beings walking\nthe earth 50,000 years ago, used to consume 100 to 300\ngrams of fiber per day. We now consume 12. Why? What did we do? We took the fiber out. So, why'd we take the fiber out? It takes too long to cook, takes too long to eat, and shelf life. So, people ask me, \"What's\nthe definition of fast food.\" Fiberless food. I dare you, other than a salad, I dare you to go to any fast food restaurant and find anything on their menu that they actually have to cook, that has more than one\ngram of fiber in it. 'Cause there isn't any,\nand that's on purpose. Because they take the fiber out, 'cause that way they can freeze it, ship it around the world,\nand cook it up fast, and not only is is fast cooking, but it's fast eating, which also causes it's own satiety issues. Bottom line, we have a\ntyphoon on our hands. And then, finally, the last issue was the substitution of transfats, which are clearly a disaster, but those have been going down, because we know that those are a problem. So we've actually gotten\nrid of most transfats, not completely, but most. So this is it, this is what we've done over the last 30 years. Now, to the biochemistry. Now, how many of you here\nhave taken biochemistry? About 25%. I am going to show you a lot of reactions in excruciating detail. (audience laughs) If you've studied biochemistry, you will have an anaphylactic reaction. (audience laughs) If you haven't studied biochemistry, you will fall asleep. So, what I'm gonna suggest that you all do is just let me do my\nthing, to show you that, at least it works, and\njust count the arrows. Okay? You can do that, right? Can you count the arrows,\nit's not like counting sheep. Okay, you can count the\narrows, and just stick with me. Just let me do my thing, and let me show you why\nfructose is not glucose. 'Cause what the liver does to fructose is really unique, and you've gotta understand it to understand\neverything I've just told you. So, number one, fructose is seven times more likely than glucose to\ndo that browning reaction. The advanced glycation end-products. The thing that happens on your grill, happens in your arteries\nfor the same reason. You can actually see the color too, the color change too. Fructose does not suppress\nthe hunger hormone. There's a hormone that\ncomes form your stomach called ghrelin you've\nheard about, already. So, if you preload a\nkid with a can of soda, and then you let him loose\nat the fast food restaurant, do they eat more, or do they eat less? They eat more. They just took on 150\ncalories, yet they eat more. Reason? 'Cause fructose doesn't suppress the hunger hormone\nghrelin, so they eat more. Acute fructose ingestion\ndoes not stimulate insulin, because there's no receptor for fructose, no transport for fructose on the beta cell that makes insulin, so\nthe insulin doesn't go up. Well, if the insulin doesn't go up, then leptin doesn't go up, and if leptin doesn't go up, you're brain doesn't see that you ate something. Therefor, you eat more. And finally, I'm gonna show you liver hepatic fructose metabolism is completely different between fructose and glucose,\ncompletely different. And I'm going to show you,\nbefore the evening is out, that chronic fructose exposure alone, nothing else, causes this thing we call the metabolic syndrome. Everybody knows what the\nmetabolic syndrome is? So, this is the conglomerate of the following different phenomena, obesity, Type 2 diabetes, lipid problems, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Those all cluster together,\ncalled metabolic syndrome. I'm gonna show you how fructose\ndoes every one of those. I wanna show you the difference between glucose and fructose in a way that will be glaringly apparent. So, let's consume 120 calories in glucose. Two slices of white bread. What happens to that 120 calories? You eat the 120 calories, 96 or 80% of the total will be used by\nall the organs in the body. 80% off the table. Why? Because every cell in\nthe body can use glucose. Every bacteria can use glucose, every living thing on\nthe face of the earth can use glucose, because\nglucose is the energy of life. That's what we were supposed to eat. 24 of those calories, or\n20% will hit the liver. So let's watch what happens\nto those 24 calories. Here they go. So, the glucose comes in\nthrough this transporter called Glut2, out here, the glucose is gonna stimulate the\npancreas to make insulin, the insulin's gonna bind to it's receptor, and it's gonna take\nthis substrate over here called IRS-1, insulin\nreceptor substrate 1. That's not important\nright now, don't worry. And it's gonna tyrosine phosphorylate it. And it's going to be tyrosine IRS-1, which is now active, that's active. And it's gonna stimulate the second messenger here called AKT. Now what AKT does is, it\nstimulates this guy down here. SRABP1, sterol receptor\nbinding protein number 1. Don't worry about it. But this is the thing that, ultimately, gets fat mechanics going. So, you 'll see in a minute. So, one of the things that SRABP1 does, is it activates this enzyme\nhere called glucokinase, which takes glucose to\nglucose 6 phosphate. Now, glucose 6-phosphate\ncan't get out of the liver. The only way to get glucose 6-phosphate out of the liver is with hormones. Glucagon or epinephrine, that's\nthe way it can get it out. So now, the glucose is fixed in the cell, but it's only 24 calories worth, so it's not a big bolus of it. Now, the glucose 6-phosphate almost all of it, is gonna end up going over here to\nsomething called glycagen. Now, glycagen is the storage\nform of glucose in the liver. Because glycagen's easy\nto fish the glucose out with glucagon and epinephrine. So, my question to you, and granted, this is a physiology question, is how much glycogen can your liver store before it gets sick? The answer's any amount. It's unlimited. We have carb loaders who\nrun marathons, right? Does it hurt them at all? We have kids with a\ndisease where they can't get the glucose out of the glycagen, called glycagen storage disease type 1A, or von Gierke disease. They got livers down to\ntheir knees their so big. They're hypoglycemic like all get out 'cause they can't lift the\nglucose out of their liver. But, they don't go into liver failure. Because glycagen is a non-toxic storage form of glucose in the liver. So, the whole goal of glucose is to replete your glycagen. So, this is good, this\nis not bad, this is good. Now, a little of that glucose\nis gonna fall down here, it's gonna get metabolized down to this stuff here, called pyruvate. And the pyruvate is gonna enter your mitochondria, over here. Remember, your mitochondria are the parts of your cell that\nactually burn the energy. They're your little factories. They make the stuff that lets you live. Called ATP, ATP, adenosine triphosphate, that's the energy of life, right there. So, the pyruvate comes in, gets converted to something called acetyl-CoA, gets metabolized by this thing called the Krebs cycle, TCA\ncycle, and you throw off ATP and carbon dioxide\nwhich you breath off. So far, so good? Have I snowed anybody yet? You're with me? I snowed one guy back there. (audience laughs) I'm doin' my best, I swear to God, I'm doing my best. Anyway, so this stuff over here, this acetyl-CoA, gets\nburned off in the TCA cycle. Maybe you won't burn all of it off, and so, some of it may exit as citrate. And the citrate then\nleaves the mitochondria through a process known\nas the citrate shuttle. And then that citrate\ncan then be broken down by these three enzymes, which are all subservient into this SRABP1. This is ATP citrate lyase acetyl-CoA carboxylase fatty acid synthase. They're not important. The only thing to know is these three enzymes together turn sugar into fat. This is called denovo, meaning new, lipogenesis, fat making. This is denovo lipogenesis. So you take the citrate\nwhich came form the glucose, and you end up with\nsomething called acetyl-CoA, which then gets packaged\nwith this protein here, and you end up with something called VLDL, very low density lipoprotein. Now, anybody heard of that before? Is it good or bad? It's bad, that's bad. VLDL is bad because that's one of the things that causes heart disease. It's also a substrate for obesity. So, you don't wanna make much of this. But the point is, you\nstarted with 24 calories, maybe a half a calorie\nwill end up as VLDL. So, that little Japanese\nguy with the little hat, you know, working out in the field, eating rice for the next 90 years, can he die of a heart attack at age 90? Sure. But that's not so bad. If you make it to 90,\nyou're doing alright. Because that VLDL coming from glucose. Glucose made a little bitty VLDL. And that serves as a substrate\nfor adipose deposition into your fat cell, here triglyceride. In addition, because of the insulin went up in response to the glucose, your brain sees that signal. And it knows that that is supposed to shut off further eating. In other words, hey, I'm busy\nmetabolizing my breakfast. I don't need lunch. And so, you have a nice\nnegative feedback loop between glucose consumption, the liver, the pancreas, and the brain, to keep you in normal negative, yin\nyang energy balance. This is good, this is not dangerous. This is what's supposed to happen. So now, let's talk about\na different carbohydrate. Let's talk about my favorite\ncarbohydrate, maybe yours too. (crowd murmuring) Ethanol. Ethanol is a carbohydrate, isn't it? Here's the structure,\ncarbon hydrogen oxygen, it' a carbohydrate. But, we all know that\nethanol is a toxin, right? A poison, right. You can wrap your\nLamborghini around a tree, or you can fry your liver, your choice. Depends on how much you\ndrink and how often. Right? Okay. So, we know that ethanol\nis not good for you, except, of course, a\nlittle bit is good for you. So, we can talk about that\ntoo, later, if you want. But, let's talk about\nhow it's bad for you. So, here's acute ethanol exposure. CNS depression,\nvasodilatation, hypothermia, tachycardia, myocardial depression, pupillary responses,\nrespiratory depression, diuresis, hypoglycemia,\nloss of fine motor control, you all went to college. (audience laughs) Here's fructose, nothing. It doesn't do any of those. Because the brain doesn't\nmetabolize fructose. Alcohol gets metabolized in the brain, to cause all of those\nthings, but fructose doesn't. So, fructose is not an\nacute toxin, ethanol is. We control ethanol, don't we? We have something called the Bureau of Alcohol\nTobacco and Firearms. We have all sorts of\nthings, we tax ethanol. We do all sorts of things to\nlimit consumption of ethanol. The Nordic countries, all the\nliquor stores are state run in attempt to try to set the\nprice of ethanol high enough so as to discourage consumption\nfor public health reasons. We have 1500 years of alcohol\ncontrol policy in this world to draw on, in terms of\nhow to limit consumption. Got it? Because ethanol is a\ntoxin, and we know it. So, let's consume 120 calories in ethanol. Shot of Makers Mark. Anybody taste it? Yeah, good, okay. So, 24 calories right off the top. The stomach and the\nintestine have something called the first pass\neffect, so 10% off the top, and kidney, muscle, brain\nwill consume the other 10%. So there goes 20% or 24\ncalories right off the top. 96 calories of the 120\nare gonna hit the liver. Now, how many was it for glucose? It was 24. So, four times the substrate\nis gonna hit the liver, and there's the rub. This is a volume issue. We're gonna show you how. So, the ethanol comes\nin, passive diffusion, there's not receptor\nfor it, not transporter. First thing that happens is ethanol gets converted to this guy,\nover here, called acetaldehyde. Anybody know anything about aldehydes? Like formaldehyde? Right? Are aldehydes good for you or bad for you? They're bad, right? 'Cause what do they do? They can cause cancer, they cross link proteins is what they do. So, if you cross link enough\nproteins in your liver, what do you think happens to it? You get something called... Cirrhosis, right exactly. So this guy, over here, is bad. And it generates something\ncalled reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species\ndamage proteins in the liver. And the more alcohol you drink, the more of this stuff you get. So far, so good? So, this is one of the\nreasons why alcohol's bad. Now the acetaldehyde will come down here to something called acetate. The acetate will enter the mitochondria, just like the pyruvate did before. Will get converted to acetyl-CoA and participate in the TCA cycle, just like before, to generate energy. So that alcoholics don't\ndie form lack of energy, they got energy, it's\neverything else they don't have. They're gonna have a whole lot of citrate. Because they have 96 calories that have to get metabolized. How many calories made it to\nthe mitochondria with glucose? About half, right? Because most of it went to glycogen. So, we've got a big\ncitrate, so it's in big font to show you that we're\ntalking about big citrate now. And so, the big citrate\nis gonna get metabolized all the way to VLDL by the CRABP1. And so you're gonna get a lot of the LDL. And this is the dyslipodemia\nof alcoholism, right here. Everybody see that? So, the liver's gonna try to export this VLDL out so that it doesn't get sick, because when fat builds up in the liver, that's not good for it. Some of it's gonna exit\nas free fatty acids, and those free fatty acids,\nwill take up residence in the muscle, and you get something called muscle insulin resistance. So insulin resistance, that's a bad thing. That makes your muscles and\nyour liver now work so well. And can cause all sorts of\nother problems like diabetes. Some of the acetyl-CoA\nwon't even make it out, and will precipitate as a lipid droplet, so there's your alcoholic steatohepatitis. This acetyl-CoA, and this ethanol, and these reactive oxygen species can start this enzyme activated. It's called c-jun n-terminal kinase 1, or JNK1, and it really is JNK1 because it is the bridge between metabolism and inflammation. So, when you generate JNK1, you\ndo bad things to your liver, which I will show you when\nwe talk about fructose. So let's talk about fructose. Fructose is sweet, we like it a lot. We like it in everything,\nwe like it in our bread, we like it in our pretzels,\nwe like it everywhere we look. So, let's consume 120 calories in sucrose. A glass of orange juice. Everybody got it? So, two slices of white\nbread, a shot of makers mark, a glass of orange juice,\nall the same 120 calories. But, three different substrates. Let's see what happens to the fructose. So, number one, the glucose, remember, 'cause sucrose is half\nglucose half fructose, so 60 of the calories\nof the 120 are glucose. 12 are gonna make it into the liver, 48 out here for the rest of the body. The same 20/80 split we\nhad before with glucose. So far, so good. But all 60 calories of fructose are gonna be metabolized by the liver. Why? Because only the liver\ncan metabolize fructose. So, what do we call it, where when you take in a compound that's\nforeign to your body, and only the liver can metabolize it, and in the process,\ngenerates various problems? What do we call that? We call that a... Poison. So, let me show you how it's a poison. So, let's watch the fructose. So, the fructose comes in\nthrough this transporter, now. Before it was Glut2, now it's Glut5 No insulin, remember, 'cause fructose does not stimulate insulin. Fructose, then, gets metabolized\nby this guy, over here, called fructokinase, to form something called fructose 1-phosphate. In the process, ATP has to give up one phosphate to ADP 'cause the phosphate had to come from somewhere,\nso it comes from here. Now, before we had 24 calories that had to be phosphorylated. Now we have 72 calories that\nhave to be phosphorylated. So, we have three times the substrate, and there's the rub. It's a volume issue, for right now. So, we're gonna lose a lot\nof phosphate, aren't we? So there's a scavenger\nenzyme in your liver called AMP deaminase 1 to rescue the phosphates off the\nrest of the ATP molecule, and it takes ADP down to\nAMP, adenosine monophosphate, down to IMP, Inositol monophosphatase, and finally, to the\nwaste product uric acid. Anybody every heard of uric acid? What is it? It's a waste product. Goes out in your urine. 'Causes what disease? Gout, right. Also causes another disease\ncalled hypertension. Let me show you how. Because uric acid, turns out, blocks the enzyme in your blood vessels called endothelial nitric oxide synthase. And that's the enzyme that makes the stuff called nitric oxide, NO. And that is your endogenous\nblood pressure lowerer. That keeps your blood pressure low. So, when you can't make it,\nyour blood pressure goes up. So, this just shows that\nfructose consumption increases gout in adults. So, this is a study\nthat came out last year showing that fructose consumption increases the risk for gout, showing that uric acid's going up. And this is a study done\nby pediatric renal fellow, Stephanie Winn, just published in Journal of Pediatrics, it's not submitted any\nmore, it's long in press, showing that this is\nin the NHANES database in the adolescents, showing\nthat sugar sweetened beverages, as it goes up, your uric acid goes up. And, not only does your uric acid go up, but here's your sugar sweetened beverages, and here's your systolic\nblood pressure going up. And here's a study done by Dan Fige, at the University of Texas San Antonio, where he took obese\nadolescents with hypertension, and he gave them the drug Allopurinol. And Allopurinol is the drug\nthat you treat gout with, to lower the uric acid. And look what happened\nto the blood pressure. Systolic, diastolic, went down. Showing that, in fact, uric acid is an important part of hypertension. We have a hypertension\nepidemic in this country. Here it is. It's the sugar. Okay, so, so far we have\nhigh blood pressure. Let's keep going. The fructose will get metabolized down to pyruvate, the pyruvate will enter the mitochondria\njust like before, throwing off a lot of citrate. And here's a little trick that fructose does that glucose doesn't. 'Cause these to can reform this stuff over here called fructose\n1 6 bisphosphatase, which can then reform with glyceraldehyde to form this guy, over here,\ncalled xylulose-5-phosphate. And I get to\nxylulose-5-phosphate in a moment. But I wanna point out this asterisk. That's there to remind\nme to tell you something. That's there to remind me to tell you that this is why the\nsports drink companies put high fructose corn\nsyrup in the sports drinks. Because if you are glycogen depleted, in other words, if you just ran a marthon, and you have no glycogen\nleft in your liver because you burned it all, and you take in a sports drink with high\nfructose corn syrup, you can replete your glycogen faster than with glucose alone. That's true. So, for elite athletes, a\nhigh fructose corn syrup containing sports drink\nactually makes sense. And so, indeed, sports drinks have high fructose corn syrup. The question is who\ndrinking the sports drinks? Any elite athletes you know? Who's drinking the sports drinks? The kids, right? Why are they drinking it? Because it's cool, right? 'Cause it's cool and it tastes good. So, before we go on, I just wanna, now, digress for a moment. 1967, University of\nFlorida patents Gatorade. Everybody remember Gatorade? Okay, 1970, the Florida Gators win the NCAA Championship in football. Gatorade makes a big splash. Okay, big deal. Anybody ever taste the original Gatorade? Yeah? What'd it taste like? Tasted horrible. It tasted like something\nthat you might find coming out of you instead\nof going into you. (audience laughs) It tasted awful. 1992, Pepsi buys Gatorade, and they say, \"How are we gonna market this swill?\" So, what did they do? They added the high fructose corn syrup. So, now who drinks it? Fat kids, right? Not even skinny kids, fat kids drink it. Okay, so there's a problem here. Okay, and we're gonna\nshow you how that works. Okay, so xylulose-5-phosphate,\njust to show you, if you take a rat, and\nyou glycogen deplete him by making him run on an exercise wheel, and then you re-feed them with starch or with sucrose, the xylulose-5-phosphate goes way up with the sucrose. So you get more xylulose-5-phosphate through this pathway\nhere, going over here. So why do we care about\nxylulose-5-phosphate? Well, here's why. Because it stimulates this guy, over here, called PP2A, which then activates this transcription factor here, carbohydrate response\nelement binding protein, which then activates what three enzymes? New fat making right,\nthe novo lipogenesis. So here's the citrate,\nwe got lot's of that. And here we've got acetyl-CoA,\nwhich is the way into fat, which then gets packaged to the VLDL, and now you've got the dyslipidemia of obesity of fructose consumption, which has, been known for many years. So, here's normal medical students, if you can call them normal, taking in a glucose load. Notice, almost none of it ends up as fat. Taking in a fructose load,\nsame number of calories, 30% of it ends up as fat. So when you consume fructose, you're not consuming a\ncarbohydrate, you're consuming fat. So everybody talks about a high fat diet. Well, high sugar diet is a high fat diet. That's the point. That's exactly the point. This is a study where they gave acute administration of fructose, and you can see the triglycerides going up compared to the control. Serum triglyceride, right there. Here's normal medical students, again, six days of high fructose feeding. Triglycerides doubled, de novo lipogenesis went up five times higher,\nand here's free fatty acids, which then cause insulin\nresistance, doubled. Six days. So, here's the dyslipidemia\nof fructose consumption. We're not done. Some of the fat won't\nmake it out of the liver, just like with ethanol. And now you've got a lipid droplet, so now you've got this\nnonalcoholic steatohepatitis. So, this is work that we did in our clinic looking at sugar sweetened\nbeverage consumption against the liver enzyme marker ALT, alanine aminotransferase, which\ntells you about fatty liver. And sure enough, here's\nsugar sweetened beverages against ALT, and you can see a nice linear relationship in Caucasians. African Americans, it's\na different relationship, and that' a' whole 'nother\nstory all by itself. So, there's the lipid droplet of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Some of it will come\nout as free fatty acids and populate the muscle, will also tell the insulin to go up higher. Remember that JNK1? So, here's what JNK1 does. So, the acetyl-CoA and the\nfructose can all activate JNK1. And what JNK1 does is, remember when we used glucose, this IRS\nbecame tyrosine IRS-1 and that was good? Remember that? Well, JNK1, what it does, is it's serine phosphorylated IRS-1. And serine IRS-1 is inactive. So now, the insulin can't\neven do it's job in the liver. So, now you have liver\ninsulin resistance as well. That's gonna make the\npancreas work that much harder generating higher insulin levels, which raise your blood\npressure even further, cause further fat\nmaking, cause more energy to go into your fat cell. There's your obesity. And finally, our research has shown that the higher the insulin goes, the less well your brain\ncan see it's leptin. And so there you've got\ncontinued consumption because your brain thinks it's starving. And it's been shown in many different ways that fructose consumption changes the way your brain recognizes energy. All in a negative fashion, so that you, basically, think you're starving. Your brain gets the signal\nthat you're starving even though your fat cells are generating a signal that says, \"Hey,\nI'm full like all get out.\" So, this just shows you how it goes. So, the high insulin generates the obesity because this is that, remember the first law of thermodynamics,\nthe biochemical force generating the energy storage as the primary phenomenon, remember, if you're gonna store it,\nand you expect to burn it then you're gonna have to eat it. So, here's the store it. Normally, that would make leptin, and the leptin should feed back and turn everything off, but it doesn't, because the insulin gets in the way, and the high fat diet gets in the way. Also, the hyperinsulinemia\nstops the leptin from acting on that nucleus accumbens, and so you get an increased reward signal. So that continues your appetite, continues more fructose,\nmore carbohydrate, generating more insulin\nresistance than you can see. You generate a vicious\ncycle of consumption and disease, and no stopping. So, here we are,\nhypertension, inflammation, hepatic insulin resistance,\nhyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, muscle insulin resistance, obesity, and continued consumption. Looks like metabolic syndrome to me. So, here are the phenomena associated with chronic ethanol exposure. Hematologic disorders,\nelectrolyte abnormalities, hypertension, cardiac\ndilation, cardiomyopathy, dyslipidemia, pancreatitis, malnutrition, obesity, hepatic dysfunction, that's alcoholic steatohepatitis, fetal alcohol syndrome, and addiction. Here's fructose. Eight out of twelve. Why? 'Cause they do the same thing. 'Cause they metabolize the same way. Because they are the same. They come from the same place, right. How do you make ethanol? Naturally. Right, you ferment sugar. Hasn't changed, 'cause it\nhas all the same properties. Because it's basically\ntaken care of by the liver in exactly the same way,\nand for the same reason. Because sugar and ethanol are the same, every which way you turn. So, here's our clinic intervention. This is what we do in our clinic. It's as simple as you can imagine. We write this on the back of a matchbook. It's just as simple as you can make it. We have four things we teach the kids to do, and the parents. Get rid of every sugared\nliquid in the house, bar none. Only water and milk, there is no such thing as a good\nsugar beverage, period. Eat your carbohydrate with fiber. Why? Because fiber is good. Fiber is supposed to be\nan essential nutrient. And we can talk later, if you want, after the cameras turn off, as to why fiber is not\nan essential nutrient. Because the government\ndoesn't want it to be. 'Cause then they couldn't\nsell food abroad. Wait 20 minutes for second portions, to get that satiety signal. And finally, buy your screen time minute-for-minute with physical activity. That's the hardest one to do. So, if you play for half an hour, you can watch TV for half an hour. You wanna watch TV for an\nhour, play for an hour. That one's a hard one, but anyway. We follow our patients every three months. So, here's my question. Does it work? What do you think? Yeah, it works. So, this is BMI z-score\ntime from initial visit. It works. But, we were interested\nin what made it work, and made it didn't work, so we did a multivariate linear regression analysis. The thing that made it not work, sugared beverage consumption. The more sugar beverages the\npatient drank at baseline, the less well lifestyle\nintervention worked for all the reasons I just showed you. So, why is exercise important in obesity. Because it burns calories? Come on. 20 minutes of jogging's\none chocolate chip cookie. You can't do it.\n(audience laughs) Are you joking me? So, why is exercise important? I'll tell you why, here's why. Number one, it improves\nthat skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity because you're insulin actually works better at your muscle, which then brings your\ninsulin levels down. Which is good for you. Number two, it's your\nindigenous stress reducer. It's the single thing that\nactually stress reduces. And if you stress reduce, what do you think your appetite does? Goes down, because stress\nand obesity go hand in hand, for all sorts of reasons which are beyond the scope of this lecture today. But, we can talk about it in the question period, if you want. And then finally, remember\nthat de novo lipogenesis? Remember those three nasty enzymes? What if you burned the stuff\noff before you made the fat? That's what exercise does, 'cause it makes that TCA cycle run\nfaster, so you don't get the citrate leaving the mitochondria, so it doesn't get turned into fat, so it doesn't precipitate and cause all the problems you just saw. (speaking away from microphone) That's what they mean by\na higher metabolism, yes. But it has nothing to do\nwith burning of calories. That is the stupidest reason that I've every heard of for exercise. You gotta be joking me. You can't do it. I mean one Big Mac and you gotta mountain bike for ten hours. (audience laughs) Are you joking? So, why is fiber important in obesity? So, this is my motto in clinic. When God made the poison, he\npackaged it with the antidote. 'Cause fructose is a poison. I think I've, hopefully, shown you that. But, wherever there's fructose in nature, there's way more fiber. You ever see a piece of sugar cane? It's a stick, right? (audience laughs) You can't even chew the damn thing, right? You gotta suck the stuff out. (sucking) Like that, right? I mean, how many calories you think you're gonna get out of a piece of sugar cane? They actually did studies\non the sugar plantations back in the early 1900s. All of the workers were healthy and lived longer than the sugar executives who got the processed product. How 'bout that, wonder why. So, eat your carbohydrate with fiber, that's why we say that. That includes sugar,\nthat's why fruit's okay. Because number one, it limits how much fructose you're gonna take in, and number two, it gives\nyou an essential nutrient which you needed in the first place. And you get some\nmicronutrients along with it so that you actually, your\nliver works healthier. So, here's what fiber does. Number one, it reduces the rate of intestinal carbohydrate absorption. Now, sometimes that's bad. I'll tell you when that's bad. Now when that's bad? That's bad when you're\nat a formal function. 'Cause what happens if you reduce the rate of carbohydrate\nabsorption in your gut? The bacteria get to it. So, as far as I'm concerned, in life you've got two choices. It's either fat or fart. (audience laughs) It increases the speed of transit of the intestinal contents to the ilium, and that raises this hormone over here called PYY, which goes to your brain and tells you the meal's over. That's your satiety signal. So when you add fiber to your diet, you actually get your\nsatiety signal sooner, because the food moves through faster. And then, finally, it also inhibits the absorption of some free fatty acids all the way to the colon, and then those get chopped up into little\nitty bitty fragments called short chain fatty acids, and those actually suppress insulin, as apposed to long chain fatty acids which stimulate insulin. So there are a whole bunch\nof reasons why fiber is good. Anybody ever heard of\nthe Paleolithic Diet? Go home and read up on it on the internet. The Paleolithic Diet. Basically, if you east everything as it came out of the ground\nraw, with no cooking, you would cure diabetes on a dime. Takes about a week. Because you're getting that 100 to 300 grams of fiber I mentioned before. That's why, 'cause fiber is good for you. And the more, the better. - [Audience Member] Type 2. Type 2, right, Type 2, not Type 1. I stand corrected, Type 2. Now, for some fun. That's the end of the biochemistry. Phew, how'd I do? (audience applauds) I told you I'd get you through it. So, now comes the fun part. The racial innuendos, and\nall the political stuff. The fructosification of America, and, of course, the world. Ready? Another quiz. Can you name the seven foodstuffs at McDonald's that don't have high fructose corn syrup or sucrose? - [Audience Member] Mustard? - (laughs) No, mustard has it. (audience chatter) Oh, come on, come one, the big one. French fries, but they\nhave salt, starch, and fat. So, they're not so good either. Okay, what else? We'll get to coffee. Hash browns, for the same reason, salt starch and fat. What else, chicken\nMcNuggets, I was shocked. I was shocked. No sucrose or high fructose\ncorn syrup in chicken McNuggets. But, as the Circuit\nCourt Judge in New York called them, they are still\na McFrankenstein creation. (audience laughs) But, nonetheless, no sucrose,\nI was really shocked. Sausage. Oh, they're terrible,\nthey're just disastrous. But, I mean, there's\nnothing good in them at all, but there's not fructose. Sausage, Diet Coke, Coffee,\nif you don't add the sugar, and ice tea, if you don't add the sugar. By the way, the chicken McNuggets, we have a disclaimer, because no one eats the chicken McNuggets\nwithout a dipping sauce. And there's a whole bunch\nof high fructose corn syrup in the dipping sauce, right? Okay, good, all right. So, who's really drinking this? We talked about this before. Gatorade AM. So, this is an attempt by Pepsi to capture market share\non the juice market. Do you think there are any elite athletes who actually drink this stuff? You gotta be kidding me. Okay, this is for kids, right? So, this really blew my socks off. This was my daughter, when she was in second grade, two years ago, Miriam Lustig, brought these two cartons of milk home for me, and said, \"Dad, you're not gonna believe this.\" Second grade. So, here's the calories in Berkeley Farms 1% low fat milk, 130 calories,\n15 of them are sugars, 'cause it's lactose, which is okay. And here's Berkeley\nFarms 1% chocolate milk, 190 calories, 29 grams of sugar, all high fructose corn syrup. It's like a glass of milk plus a half a glass of orange juice. And that's what we're giving to our kids. And do you know what the nutrition department at the SFUSD says? \"Well, we have to get our\nkids to drink milk some how.\" Is that brilliant, or what? I don't know. Now, what about WIC. So, we talked about the 112 pounds of orange juice that the kid\ndown in Salinas was drinking. What bout WIC? Remember what we started with? We have an epidemic of\nobese six month olds. Remember? So, could this be the reason? So, here's a can of formula. 43.2% corn syrup solids, 10.3% sugar. It's a baby milkshake. Soda, Coca Cola, is 10.5% sucrose. Formula is 10.3% sucrose. Any difference? And there's a huge literature that's now coming of age that shows that the earlier you expose kids to sweet, the more they're gonna crave it later. Plus, there's a new literature that shows the more sugar the pregnant\nwoman drinks or eats during the pregnancy, the more that gets across the placenta, and actually causes what we call developmental programming, changing the kids adiposity\neven before the kid is born, and driving this whole\nepidemic even further. So, we'll close in a few minutes. But, I just wanna point\nout what's the difference. Here, we got a can of Coke. Here we got a can of beer. And I'm not picking on\nSchlitz, or anything. It's any beer you want, okay. So, 150 calories each, no difference in terms of total calories. Percent carbohydrate, so\n10.5% from sucrose here, except it's high fructose\ncorn syrup, but who cares. 3.6% alcohol, here's the breakdown. 75 fructose, 75 glucose for the Coke. 90 alcohol 60 maltose for the beer. Remember, the first pass GI metabolism takes 10% of the alcohol off the table. So, when you actually compute the number of calories hitting the liver, which remember was the big difference between glucose and fructose, remember? 72 versus 24 and started\nthe whole thing into motion as term of what happens that's bad. Bottom line, no difference. So, we have something called beer belly. Well, welcome to soda belly. 'Cause that's what\nAmerica's suffering from. No ifs ands or buts. That's what it is. Now, you wouldn't think twice about not giving your kid a Budweiser. But, you don't think twice about giving your kid a can of Coke. But, they're the same, in the same dosing, for the same reason, through the same mechanism. Fructose is ethanol without the buzz. Fructose is a carbohydrate. Yes, it is. But fructose is metabolized like a fat. And I've just shown you that 30% of any ingested fructose\nload ends up as fat. So when people talk about high\nfat diets doing bad things, no, what they're really talking about is high fructose diets, and that's what Ancel Keys was looking at. So, the corollary to that\nis, in America at least, and around the world too, a low fat diet isn't really a low fat diet. Because the fructose or\nsucrose doubles as fat, it's really a high fat diet. That's why our diets don't work. And fructose, just like ethanol, for the same reason,\nthrough the same mechanism, and in the same dosing, is also as toxin. Now, last, what can we do about it? Can we do anything about it? How 'bout the FDA? You think they can do something about it. After all, aren't they\nsupposed to regulate our food? Aren't they supposed to regulate what they can put in food? Weren't they supposed to regulate tobacco? Now they are, actually. So, you know, weird things. So, I wanna just show you what the tobacco company thinks of all this. This is actually from the UCSF Legacy Tobacco Documents Library that Stan Glantz runs right across the street. Stan's a good guy, like Stan a lot. And he showed me this. \"Under the regulations\ngoverning food additives,\" so this came from an Altria\nor Phillip Morris executive, \"it is required that additives be safe, \"defined as a reasonable certainty \"by competent scientists that no harm \"will result form the\nintended use of the additive.\" Now, does fructose meet that standard? Well, the FDA says that fructose, high fructose corn syrup,\nhas what's knows as GRAS, G R A S status, generally\nregarded as safe. Now, where'd that come from? No where. It came from no where. It came from the notion\nthat, \"Well, fructose \"is natural, it's in\nfruit, it must be okay.\" Well, tobacco's natural too. But it's not. Ethanol's natural, but it's not. A whole bunch of, you know, Jamaican ackee fruit's\nnatural, but it's not either. It kills you. Keeping on going. \"A food shall be deemed to be adulterated \"if it bears or contains any poisonous \"or deleterious substance which may \"render it injurious to health.\" Fructose fits that description, right? Uh-uh, but now with the prevention of chronic diseases, even though it's own regulations explicitly postulate the connection between such products and such diseases. In other words, the FDA will only regulate acute toxins, not a chronic toxin. Fructose is a chronic toxin. Acute fructose exposure\ndid nothing, remember. 'Cause the brain doesn't\nmetabolize fructose. The liver does. And the liver doesn't get\nsick after one fructose meal. It get's sick after 1000 fructose meals. But, that's how many we eat. So, the FDA isn't touching this. The USDA isn't touching this. Because if the USDA touched\nthis, what would that mean? That would mean an admission to the world that our food is a problem. So, what to you think that would do? There are three things in this country that we can still sell overseas. Weapons, entertainment, and food. Cars? (laughs) Computers? I don't thinks so. Can anybody think of anything else that another country wants of ours? What? Tobacco, right, tobacco. (laughs) All right, you get the picture. So, the USDA doesn't\nwanna know about this. 'Cause this is bad news. And so, who runs the food pyramid? The USDA. It's the fox in charge of the hen house. Because their job is to sell food. And who's eating it? We are. So, in summary, fructose, and I don't care what the vehicle is, it's irrelevant, sucrose or high fructose corn syrup, I don't care, fructose\nconsumption's increased in the past 30 years, coinciding\nwith the obesity epidemic. A calorie is not a calorie. And the dietitians in the country are actually perpetrating this on us. Because the more you think\na calorie's a calorie, the more you think, well than if you ate less and exercise more, it would work. It doesn't. All of the studies show it doesn't work. Here's why it doesn't work, because a calorie is not a calorie. Fructose is not glucose. We know a calorie is not a calorie. 'Cause there are good fats and bad fats. There's good protein and bad protein. Okay, there's good carbohydrate\nand bad carbohydrate. And glucose is good carbohydrate. Glucose is the energy of life. Fructose is poison. You are not what you eat. You are what you do with what you eat. And what you do with fructose is particularly egregious and dangerous. Hepatic fructose metabolism leads to all the manifestations of\nthe metabolic syndrome. Hypertension through\nthat uric acid pathway, de novo lipogenesis, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis\nthrough that DNL pathway, those three enzymes, the\nnew fat making pathway, inflammation through JNK1,\nhepatic insulin resistance because of the serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, obesity because\nof the VLDL transport to the adiposite, and leptin resistance promoting continuous consumption, basically starving your brain, making you think you need more. Fructose ingestion interferes\nwith obesity intervention, as we showed in our clinic. The more soft drinks, the less well diet and exercise actually worked. Fructose is a chronic hepatotoxin for the same reason that alcohol is. The only difference is alcohol is metabolized by the brain,\nso you get alcohol effects. Fructose is not metabolized by the brain so you don't get those effects. But everything else it does is the same. But the FDA can't and won't regulate it. It's up to us. I'm standing here today to recruit you. That's a famous saying here\nin San Francisco, right? \"I'm Harvey Milk, and\nI'm here to recruit you.\" I'm Robert Lustig, and\nI'm here to recruit you in the war against bad food. And this is what's bad. With that, I wanna thank my colleagues at the UCSF Department of Pediatrics in our Weight Assessment for\nTeen and Child Health Clinic, UCSF Department of\nEpidemiology and Biostatistics, and also Department of\nNutritional Sciences at UC Berkeley, in particular\nDoctor Jean-Marc Schwarz, who is a card carrying\nfructose biochemist, PhD biochemist, who vetted all of these pathways that I've shown you today, and looked at this and said,\n\"Oh my God, it is a toxin.\" He worked in the stuff for 15 years, and he didn't even realize it\nwas a toxin until he saw this. So, with that, I'll close. Thanks you.

be well [Music] peace [Music]", "Qvz8TQcGxBA": "[Laughter] so today's topic comes from our senior food editor Eclair and it could leave us in a sticky situation Tennessee law maker camp coffee was recently photographed drinking out of what appeared to be a Hershey's chocolate syrup bottle when questioned about the incident coffee explains who is not drinking syrup but water because he and his wife like to recycle everything he also explained that you're for the syrup bottle over a traditional fancy expensive water bottle because he's just gonna lose it anyway I have some questions first of all and this is the most important one will the water not taste like chocolate syrup and is there another repurposed bottle that's better to drink from so three things we're looking for how easy was for us to clean out the bottle is there any residual taste left from the product inside and how easy is it to actually drink from the bottle okay down the hatch cheers Cheers okay first off definitely you smell chocolate you can smell right away it doesn't taste so much like chocolate down hmm I definitely Ocalan on my lips the little cap thing is kind of annoying because it a little like rubs up against my you know cheat or whatever hmm I feel like a baby goat yeah and you're not getting I'm definitely getting with each step like a coating of chocolate syrup around my lip I'd say this was easy to clean okay honestly this was a five and again there's not gonna be syrup in there the second time I use this from this water bottle so for residual flavor I would give it a two or three I definitely really I know mine okay why are you I was it yeah mine doesn't smell like that okay yeah let's meet in the middle of Scala three yeah let's call it a three drinkability it's easy to drink out of I relatively easy I want to knock a point for this cap thing yeah let's go too far if you had no receptacle and you were very thirsty anywhere in the desert and all you had was an empty chocolate syrup bottle then I would say hack it works yeah in the circumstances only mustard here we go Cheers I got like three drops small bottle like you're gonna be running back to the fountain to refill this it's like every hour this is really a flask you could put like like whiskey right it doesn't have OB water there's actually no guarantee this is water size is a huge issue here the bottle itself not enough water the little nozzle sippy section not great maybe if you were like a small child it was child sized otherwise you don't get enough water in each set cleaning was kind of a mess actually mustard is obviously has a thicker consistency so I really had to get in there and had to rinse it multiple times over and over and over again not great to clean but would not recommend yeah I wanted to yeah it wasn't a total mess but residual flavor I didn't detect any - me neither I'm shocked that's like a five that's a five drinkability I have a one or two that let's let's give it a - water didn't come out of it into our mouths exactly if you squeeze and if you you know get your lips perfectly on that nozzle then you'll get one yeah but now hack or wax using our stranded Island scenario if I had to choose between the syrup bottle and this bottle I guess here every time yeah so whack on this one Mustard's wife I'm a little worried about this one because I think it's the only one that's oil-based yeah so I feel like cleaning and residual taste maybe we're a big issue here first off even before we do this has the widest opening of any of our bottles and no squeezing involved here either you know you can use those like a normal water bottle okay Cheers salad dressing oh I could taste all the herbs but only 30 calories per serving you know I will say cleaning it was very easy did you use soap I so what do you think salad dressing bottle hack all right I have to go whack on this because I don't know what my water did taste like salad dressing oh boy look at this ring can you see this on there's a ring of soy sauce here couldn't get up and also I think the soy sauce might be like the strongest flavor of anything and yeah then the nozzle for the soy sauce is made so you like shake it out so I don't know if it's gonna be so easy to to drink it in a gulp okay okay Cheers I got a lot of soy sauce now yes that's the only way to do it get anything out of it open mouth yeah like I'm just squeezing like burst you can't even do like a long stream honestly I didn't get as much taste as I did with the salad dressing oh yeah which is shocking because again there's literally I didn't clean enough soy sauce I we can visibly see the brown droplets of soy sauce a drinkability was tough though could it really squeeze it comfortably without like applying too much force the nozzle is not meant to to drip water into your mouth in any reasonable way honestly I was just getting a little droplets yeah through most of it drinkability I think this is the lowest we've had so far you can't drink this this is the worst one we've done don't do this no ketchup first of all these ketchup bottles are upside down which i think is probably not ideal for storing water ergonomically horrible there are drops of water yeah coming out I have to say that like there is a distinct orange tint in my wife very much I think you're gonna be drinking at least five to ten percent ketchup here let's go Cheers ketchup bottle let me know what you're ready there's water everywhere you can't suck the water out you have to your vows that is a jet stream so I believe that the ketchup bottle has like the clean like the clean release yeah so that you don't get like the crusty thing yes so when you try to suck on this flat nozzle you don't get anything no matter how hard you suck but then when you squeeze it a little bit it just like shoots it straight out in like a very narrow very forceful stream you know what it feels like you know what the eye doctor when you go through mitosis and it like shoots the puff oh yeah [Music] right down my throat I honestly don't ever want to drink anything ever again yeah I think we agree it's wack so we rang to these now from worst to best yes I kept a bottle easily the worst by far this should really this belongs like off camera I'm like right here these are the only two that like you could drink like I would suggest you could drink out of it you could yeah I don't know if I would suggest I wouldn't quite go that far but drinking out of an empty chocolate syrup bottle it is a hack it is officially a hack hats off to

Right away, I\nneed a good breakfast. - [Man] Right away, a big bite of toast. - [Man] For kids, we like a\nsquare meal for breakfast. - [Man] A wonderful new\nfruit in the box cereal (bell ringing) (upbeat music) - I mean, how did we get here? How did this\n(fluid moving) become breakfast in my country? And what is breakfast even all about? Some people say it's the most\nimportant meal of the day, and others say that\nit's totally worthless, and you don't even need to eat breakfast if you don't want to. - [Man] Two pancakes with\nhot syrup and butter. - I bet a lot of you\nwatching don't eat breakfast in the morning, and you knew who else doesn't\neat breakfast in the morning? This guy. - [Interviewer] what do\nyou eat for breakfast? - Nothing. - I grew up thinking that\nbreakfast had to be a certain way, (funky music) but then in my twenties, I started traveling and\nI learned that in fact, this version of breakfast\nis a very narrow, very American version of breakfast. Once I discovered\n(pan sizzling) non-American breakfast,\n(liquid pouring) I feel like my eyes were opened to a completely different approach to the first meal of the day. I want to show you some\nof those breakfasts, but first, let's talk about breakfast and how American breakfast got this way. - [Man] for about 22 cents, You get as much nutrition as\nthis bacon and egg breakfast when there's no time for\nyour regular breakfast. - Okay, before I jump\ninto all of my opinions about breakfast, let's talk about science\nfor a minute, like facts. (mouse clicking) does breakfast matter? Is it actually the most\nimportant meal of the day like I was told my whole life? - [Man] You can't be your best if you don't eat a good breakfast. - Turns out there's data\non this, lots of studies, but you don't need to read them all. In fact, don't read them all. Let me give you the 20-second version. It turns out the methods\nin a lot of these studies are really crummy. They weren't randomized controlled trials, like the gold standard for good science, and in a lot of cases, they didn't really study anything useful. They kind of hyper focus on breakfast as it pertains to weight. And in most of these studies, they don't even focus on what the person is eating for breakfast, they only focus on whether they\ndo or do not eat breakfast, regardless of what\nthey're actually eating. And to add to all of this, a lot of these studies are funded by corporations who have a vested interest in making breakfast seem\nnecessary and healthy. So yeah, there's a lot of science on this, but the science does not come\nto any useful conclusions, and is often times just poorly conducted. (screen snapping)\nWhat this means is that there's no real evidence that breakfast is the most\nimportant meal of the day, and there's nothing special\nor magic about breakfast. That's more of a marketing\nmyth than anything else. - [Man] Had any really good days lately? Like when the sun shines brighter, and people seem friendlier, and work goes faster, things like that? The really good days start out good with new Carnation Instant Breakfast. - Okay, wait, but there is\na little caveat in this. If you're an eight year\nold kid or a teenager, and you're in school, there actually is some useful evidence that says that eating\nbreakfast in the morning is good for your learning\nand brain development. So that's the caveat. There actually is evidence there. For the rest of us though, if you like breakfast in the morning, eat breakfast in the morning. If you're not into that, don't do it. Okay, that's it. Unless you're a kid, but I don't know how\nmany kids are watching. Okay, so that's the science on this. Turns out that I was a\nperson for many years who thought that I didn't like breakfast, that I didn't need to eat breakfast. Growing up in a small town in Oregon, I didn't have a ton of exposure to other cultures and other things, and so my version of breakfast was this. - [Man] There's a bowl of Corn\nflakes spooned from the dish. - [Man] And there was some bacon. - This is all I knew as breakfast food. When we would eat eggs\nand bacon for dinner, we were having breakfast for dinner. This food was inseparable from\nthe institution of breakfast. If you're not from the United States, let me just break down\nwhat American breakfast is and its story, where it came from. I'll split it out into two main categories of breakfast in United States. One, I called diner breakfast. It kind of looks like this, (groovy music) and the other, I will call cereal, which is everything from\nPop Tarts to Froot Loops. - Where are the Froot Loops? - I didn't bring any, help! - To granola bars, to\nCarnation Instant Breakfast. It's like the quick stuff\nthat's in our pantries that we can just consume before work. First, let's talk about diner breakfast. There's no better reference\nfor what diner breakfast is in the United States than\nthe official menu of IHOP, which is so inappropriately named as the International House of Pancakes. - Welcome to the International\nHouse of Pancakes. - At IHOP, this American institution, you can start your day with this, the Stuffed French Toast, which effectively looks\nlike my birthday cake. Or you can get really\ncultured and hop over to Italy for some Nutella crepes. Or how about the Belgian Waffle Combo, which isn't just a waffle, but also comes with bacon and eggs? Perhaps you're feeling savory, so how about this breakfast sampler, where you can eat a pig\nin three different ways, because who just wants to eat bacon when you could have all three? All of this accompanied by French fries. I mean, sorry, hash browns, but why settle for these meager options when you could go with\nthe Cinn-A-Stack Pancakes, which come layered with a\nluscious cinnamon roll filling and drizzled with rich cream cheese icing, and topped with, you\nguessed it, whipped cream. icing for breakfast. Now, here's the thing. This diner style American\nbreakfast is inspired by Europe. (bright music) American pancakes look\na lot like other sweet, flat unleavened breads that\nare eaten all over the world and especially in Europe, we just deemed necessary\nto fry it in butter and then put more butter on top, and then drizzle literal liquid sugar over top and eat it for breakfast. That was the only modification we made to this wonderful tradition\nof European pancakes. The idea of eating pork-based\ncured meats in the morning is also a European tradition. It comes from the traditional\nEnglish breakfast, which is delicious. We just decided to get rid\nof some elements from that, like the beans,\n(buzzer buzzing) and the tomatoes, and the mushrooms. Who needs those, anyway? - Where are the Froot Loops? - The American waffle\ncomes from the beautiful, delicious tradition of the\nBelgian or liege waffles, which are served in desert\nstores as desserts in Belgium. They're delicious. The modification we made was\nto eat them for breakfast, and then decide to take out the best part, which is the Pearl sugar,\n(buzzer buzzing) the crystallized sugar\nthat makes a Belgian waffle or liege waffle delicious. To summarize, this diner style\ntook European traditions, turned them into breakfast\nand modified them by making them lower\nquality, bigger portions, and usually slathering them\nwith cream and maple syrup. - [Man] All you can eat pancakes, this calls for all you can eat silverware. get IHOP's All You Can Eat Pancakes free when you buy any breakfast combo. - I mean, icing for breakfast? It just doesn't sound good. Okay, so that's the diner\nversion of American breakfast, a big, important category\nof what Americans like to eat for breakfast. The other category looks like this. (groovy music) This is the stuff that's in our pantries. This is the stuff we eat\nbefore we go to work. It's quick, it's what I\ngrew up eating as a child, let's call this the cereal category. This food came into our\nlives and became widespread because of one main\nforce: industrialization. - [Man] The factory whistle\nawakened people in the mornings and measured off their long days of toil. - With the birth of factories\nand the standardized workday, suddenly you had demand for a consistent, quick, convenient food in the morning to fuel you for the day. Paired with that, you\nalso now had technology to mass produce products\nthat would fit this demand. Perhaps the best symbol of this\nshift towards mass produced, easy, convenient breakfast\nfood is Corn Flakes? - [Man] Kellogg's Corn Flakes. - The Kellogg's corporation,\nwhich made Corn Flakes was a pioneer in making\nthis breakfast food popular. Not only because they were\nable to mass produce it and cheaply sell it, but also because they\nmarketed it in this way that made it feel like\nthe most important thing in the world. \u266a Kellogg's adds extra vitamins \u266a \u266a To make their Corn Flakes\nthe best it's ever been! \u266a (record scratching)\nBut there was a problem. Over time, people would\nlook at this lousy bowl of Corn Flakes and be like,\nwho wants to eat this? This is boring. But America had a solution. All we needed to do was\npump it full of sugar. - [Man] One big gulp of it. - Yum! - Gives me lots of energy-- - [Man] for this nutritious breakfast. (icing bursting)\n- [Man] This is how Pop Tarts have--\n- Whoa! - Geez. I mean, that's, that's pretty\naggressive right there. Wow. Yeah. That's how I feel after\nI eat a Pop Tart as well. Anyway, people started to believe that breakfast and\nespecially these commodities, which were quickly becoming\ndessert disguised as breakfast. - The ultimate fruit flavor. - Look! - Were the key to a healthy morning and a good start to the day. And soon, I was born into a world, a world where breakfast products and norms were cemented before me. A world where millions of Americans would wake up in the\nmorning and consume dessert disguised as breakfast. Your muffin is just a cupcake in disguise. That cup of yogurt might as\nwell be a scoop of ice cream. And then there's the mighty doughnut, the food that doesn't even\npretend to be breakfast. It's just literal dessert, and it's shamelessly just\nlike, hey, I'm dessert. Do you want to eat me for breakfast? And a lot of people are like, yeah. I mean, I kind of respect that. I'm kind of like, if\nyou're gonna be dessert, just represent yourself. I respect the donut. But wait, let me make one thing clear. My issues with this have\nnothing to do with nutrition, even sugar or calories or any of that. I actually have a big\nissue with our obsession with categorizing food by its numbers and its constituent parts. Not into that, I don't really care. My problem here is that\nI don't like this food. I just genuinely do not want to wake up and consume dessert for breakfast. If you do like this stuff for\nbreakfast, that's awesome. I've no issues with you and I'm not going to try to convince you to change that. - Cereal pancakes. - Yum. - [Boy] Cinnamon Toast\nCrunch, Lucky Charms and Cap'n Crunch. - Okay, so a little\nbit of time has passed, and a few things changed. Number one, I got a haircut, but number two, I think\nI'm cracking the code on how to change my breakfast experience. I spent the past few months thinking a lot about breakfast and I've\nstarted to introduce different breakfast cultures\ninto my morning routine that have really changed my world. (percussive music) I'm not gonna share all this with you now because this video would\nbe 30 minutes long, but I have been filming all of this, and it has been a really\ninteresting journey to invite different breakfast\ncultures into my world. If enough people are interested and you leave comments somewhere, I will share it and make a video about what breakfast looks\nlike for me these days. Spoiler alert, there's no icing. I still have my occasional\nbowl of Lucky Charms, which is a delicious cereal, and the occasional pancake with my kids. That's great stuff. I mean, I'm not above that food. It's just not what I want\nto eat every morning. So anyway, I'll share\nthat if you're interested. Lastly, I wanna tell you\nabout today's sponsor, which is Skillshare, which a place where I have\nlearned a lot of my video skills, but they also have cooking\ntutorials, I discovered. They have a course on\nthere about how to make the perfect grilled cheese sandwich, which by the way, is an amazing breakfast. And it's one of thousands\nthat Skillshare has of all different types of topics, whether it is animation and video, which is all the courses I've taken, or entrepreneurship, business, photography design, basically everything. Skillshare is incredibly cheap. And for you, it could be\ncompletely free for two months. You could have access to all\nof these tutorials for free if you go to the link in my description, click that link, it helps\nsupport this channel, but more importantly, it\nkicks off your journey of learning something new\nfor free for two months. That's like two months. That's like 60 days of\nzero money playing around with this really awesome\nresource on the internet. And then after that, it's\nless than 10 bucks a month if you do the annual subscription, which is just ridiculously\ncheap for what you're getting.

it's crazy i like what 2 am we have cameras at the house my mom was awake at 2am she's always awake around like 2 a.m and she heard noises but she didn't really like follow up on it she just heard noises and then the next day they like let's check the cameras why did we hear noises they checked the cameras and someone broke like someone was trying to break into one of our cars i felt bad for the guy because like you know pandemic and everything who knows like what's his situation i want to feed him my fist no i'm kidding when you catch someone during a situation like that you want to do something but you also don't because you don't know where the guy is coming from you don't know if he's affiliated with a gang they'll retaliate if you do something to them you know he broke the door handle the car's door handle the driver's side and it's a toyota and the cops said that a lot of these guys target toyotas because i think toyotas are easy to steal apparently that's what a cop said yep so that's that imagine you catch someone doing that like what like i know in canada you can't really do much to a person unless your life is in danger then maybe yeah you could do something about it but like honestly what would you do you can hurt him but will he come back and hurt you again you know like come back with his friends who knows where you live um thank you tacos el gordo for this delicious meal so i'm assuming this one's a moola i never know like i could never tell the difference i don't know what what unless i get the tacos i know the tacos what the tacos are but i just

guys in a bit stay safe be well catch you guys on to the next one [Music] peace [Music] you", "m4QyvPaZbUA": "[Music] all righty guys this is big sauces final walk around so now comes some I'm actually just gonna be taking all my personal belongings out of here so I will have time to wash it and make sure it's all detailed and big sauce is looking its best tomorrow right before I meet the guy that's buying it [Music] [Music] making sure the Jeep has been detailed inside now underneath etc Clinton tires up all my good stuff you know just my basic detail everything that I normally do it all stuff cleared out [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all righty so if you guys have not seen the original walk arounds there's a few of them out there that we've already done on this Jeep when I was on thirty-sevens so this this build is pretty much done other than you know the tie rods that complete the steering actually was working on that but now just how things have worked out it is time so as you guys know this is a 2013 it is a sport with an automatic transmission it has the the toe it had the tow package from the factory with three seven three gears but as you guys know it does have the 3.6 liter v6 the new engine and the Wrangler and that does very well so we're gonna start with the basics the tires are 40 by 1350 our 17 Pro Comp exocomp tires those do weigh about 90 pounds of tire which is equivalent to about a neato true upper 37 1250 r17 obviously you do pay for the lightweight and the Pro Comp tire just because the sidewall is a little bit thinner so a lot of people I have to had issues with those those are also wrapped around a TX slab powder-coated gecko green rings are powder coated gloss black [Music] so the suspension we have three and a half inch metal cloak coils the true dual rate this part right here unwinds when you flex and rappel there is a three quarter inch coil spacer on top of that you can't see and just to level it out bump stops we've got some hockey pucks one inch each and those are three probably gonna add another one just to help rubbing all this bracket right here full flex got some jks disconnects best in the market in our opinion like I was saying earlier we got the synergy flip kit one ton drag link we were also gonna do the tie rod to match same color and everything like that we do also have videos on all of this just like the trust right here full Evo trust it's got the bridges in here a lot of extra support so you know we got the upper lower sea gussets g2 ball joints knots energy those are actually g2 it did those recently [Music] Rock Crawler trek bar up and there you guys can see also with the trust kits there is a three inch raised bracket that was welded on beautifully done all up in there we have lots of information on the reasoning behind this chosen axle with XO chef's and everything like that and the way everything is upgraded in previous videos leave a comment if you guys want more information on that so continuing on suspension here you know we have the Fox 2.0 shocks as you just saw on the front end the state Walzer brake lines are brackets so the front ones will actually be have plenty of travel have enough length because in 2011 they made the brake lines longer so with the draw brackets in here there's a plenty of line plenty of long enough and then we got the tear flex brake line anchor kit to tow it all together so maybe going to control arms we have rock crawler X Factor control arms all eight all four in the front or in the rear [Music] so just like the front you know we have three and a half inch metal cloak dual rate coils with the correction wedges as well so that kind of helps give it a little bit extra lift I believe because it does sit pretty level even with the 40 inch to spare tire with a Mopar check bar bracket right here to raise that to help still stock track bar g2 diff cover we just ground that smooth ended up black still stop drive shafts front and rear those are still holding up front it's probably gonna be the first to go on that though so kind of giving you guys just pretty much the basics on everything and pretty much all the newer stuff that hasn't really been covered a lot of small stuff like Rubicon rails those have been trimmed when it's in the front a couple inches in the back of believe we were pinched seams have been cut as well as you guys can see you know we discussed this in the first walk around how that was cut and then recently we just did the rear you guys can get a pretty good idea how that was done just kind of followed the body curve pretty much all the way back to kind of where this starts to meet right here and then chop that off a little bit have not had any issues with rubbing since then we are also running one and a half inch spider tracks wheel spacers those are the best on the market and our opinion hold up really well you know what long as you properly torque them down with Loctite etc then obviously the factory mopar Tweel top so taking a look at the rear here we have a deviate our carrier it's a TC one model we did hack all of the bars off as you can see it needs to be very powder-coated it's all smoothed out [Music] so we also have no rear bumper on the rear just because we think it looks the cleanest with this parent setup with a spare tire and also saves on weight everything is powder coated gloss black so you can see the brackets everything like that poison spider the leech cover right there gloss black spider [Music] so for interior pretty much really clean and factory other than the rock card 4x4 sport caves powder coated gecko green as well if you guys are wondering about this tape up here it is to to cancel out the glare on a sunny day when you're driving [Music] got a few small things you know like these door entry guard stuff like that we did put in the leather wrap steering wheel and well we do have a video on installing that as well trim pieces for painting gloss black to match the paint's so come into the engine bay now we don't really have anything so you crazy nothing aftermarket pretty much trying to prolong the life of everything in here nice and factory only thing that is on the battery are the Bluetooth rock lights which those are pretty cool I tried to keep everything in here very clean as it was brand new so for the headlights we have truck light LED headlights [Music] also along the keys clear nope our original turn signal housings alrighty guys moving on to the front bumper so we have a poison spider bfh this is the original bfh is not the new one this is a frame shop bumper powder coated glass block obviously [Music] [Music] and for this bumper this also is a frame chopped bumper like we mentioned before we did explain the installation kind of on one of the original walk arounds you know you cut the frame two inches back drill the holes put it in it's pretty hard to mess up it's one of our favorite bumpers [Music] so unfortunately it is time to part ways with this Jeep because it is a very good time just because like the value of everything everything is fresh the the peak of the value is the greatest right now just because we have future plans or something else you guys stay tuned for that it's gonna be awesome but this is my primary I miss I really do miss my previous four-door model a lot and I really can't have both right now so this is a really unique build we learned a lot through the process you know just everything on all the videos and content that we have for you guys taking it offroad stuff like that you know testing the waters doing stuff that you're not really supposed to be doing like off-roading with a Dana xxx stuff like that really enjoyed building this Jeep over the past almost two years or however long it's been yeah guys this has been a really really fun project if you guys want more information about the jeep or have any questions of anything about it or you know just want to talk more about why we are getting rid of it etc you know you can message us on Facebook that would be a pretty good way for us to communicate and connect got this Jeep a little over a year ago completely stocked hundred percent stock you know everything was really clean underneath never been offroad to previous owners never really did anything with it it was just basically a daily driver also the doors had never been off I was the first one to take the doors off so that was really cool it was a really good platform and if you guys want to see more of this Jeep specifically there are a ton of pictures on my personal Instagram page at Sam Koli link will be in description so this G does have a four thousand miles I got it at seventy four thousand put about ten thousand miles on it nineteen model Silverados on the way [Music] you later dick sauce [Music]", "e1YpmgXHnz4": "guys i'm johnny scoville man i've got issues but i'm going to chase you right now i

Japanese person. In the United States, it\u2019s quite a different\nstory. The rate of obesity among adults in America\nis on average around 30% whereas the Japan obesity rate is only 3.5%. But what makes the weight of people in these\ntwo countries so different? \"Why Japanese people?\" At first, I was thinking about things like\u2026 Japanese people drink a lot of green tea and\nthey get a decent amount of fermented foods like kimuchi or nattou which is great for\nthe gut microbiome. But, in this video I want to focus on a very\nsimple yet key point about Japan. The food environment is drastically different\nfrom the US. As of 2017 there\u2019s over 243,000 Fast food\nestablishments in America. There\u2019s only 6,169 establishments in Japan,\nmeaning per person, there\u2019s about 15 times more fast food restaurants in America. \"Why macudonarudo?\" Then again, in Japan, fast food, fried food,\nchips, chocolate, candy, soda, and not so healthy things are still available wherever\nyou go. But there\u2019s a huge variety of equally convenient\nreasonably healthy food. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m the average busy person\nin the states who would like to be healthy but doesn\u2019t have time to cook at home. What\u2019s for breakfast? Most people\u2019s options are limited to things\nlike a McGriddle with Hashbrowns and coffee, or maybe an Egg and processed Cheese sandwich\nwith tater tots at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, or some pancakes at Denny\u2019s if you have more time. Surely some people have more healthy options,\nbut I\u2019m trying to think of what most people are going to have access to. So what\u2019s a quick breakfast in Japan? While there\u2019s more than 6000 fast food establishments\nin Japan, there\u2019s also 5000 \"rice bowl\" establishments. The big ones are Yoshinoya, Sukiya and Matsuya. And for 4 dollars at Sukiya, for breakfast\nyou can get Plain Rice, Miso Soup with Seaweed, an Egg, baked fish, and a small potato salad\ncomes with it. If I'm extra hungry maybe I'll add some kimchi,\nfermented soybeans and stewed beef for 4 more dollars. Or, you can put together a reasonably healthy\nmeal from a convenience store. At a Japanese convenience store I can get\na rice ball which is just rice, salmon and salt\u2026 a small salad, or a package of sushi,\nor a thing of fish with miso\u2026 Or some soup. I was pretty impressed with how little junk\nis in this: it\u2019s basically just vegetables, pork and fish broth. And, there\u2019s a bunch of different foods\nlike this - here\u2019s what I can get for under 10 dollars USD. Compare this to what\u2019s available in American\nconvenience stores - they\u2019re limited to fried foods sitting under heat lamps or foods\nloaded with trans fat, sugar, preservatives and unhealthy additives. If you\u2019re lucky you might be able to get\na package of plain nuts with nothing added. So the items in Japanese convenience stores\nare not top quality health foods, but they\u2019re not bad. This is big because practically everyone has\naccess to these places, convenience stores like these are everywhere. Japan has about 55,000 convenience stores\nmeaning there\u2019s about 10 times more convenience stores per square kilometer in Japan compared\nto America. For most, these places are in walking distance. I understand that of course there are healthy\nrestaurants here and there in America and you can make a really healthy meal with ingredients\nfrom the supermarket. But when it comes to cheap, convenient and\nquick food - it\u2019s almost always quite unhealthy. In Japan, for a quick lunch, I can go to burger\nking, or right next door I can get some sushi. I can get a Hamburger and some Popcorn at\n...Vandalism cafe (?), or I can go next door to Matsuya and get a bowl of spicy tofu soup\nwith a bit of beef, green onion and cabbage, some pork, a soft boiled egg, some mustard\nspinach, rice and there\u2019s free pickled ginger to go with it. And of course there are many healthier non-chain\nplaces that offer many different types of cuisine. And this variety is important. It\u2019s going to be much easier to stick to\nhealthier options if you aren\u2019t getting bored of having to eat the same things at\nthe same places over and over. Even if you\u2019re going out to drink with friends\nat dinner time, there\u2019s still a variety of good food choices. The standard place to drink at is an izakaya\n- at 10,000 establishments, there\u2019s almost twice as many izakayas as there are fast food\nplaces in Japan. Replacing fast food for alcohol is not a good\nstrategy, but let\u2019s see what one of the common izakaya chains have to offer in the\nway of food. Let me point out one more time that there\u2019s\nof course much better quality food than what you get at convenience stores, rice bowl chains\nor izakayas and this is not what most Japanese people eat on a daily basis. I\u2019m not really recommending these places\neither - Most Japanese people wouldn\u2019t think of these places as \u201chealthy\u201d. But, this isn\u2019t about optimal health. I just mean to point out that even someone\nwho puts minimal effort into being healthy can get some reasonable quality meals out\nof these very convenient places. By the way, what\u2019s everyone drinking with\nand between meals? In America, more often than not it\u2019s soda,\nconsidering a survey of 80 countries found that America comes in at rank #1 for soda\nconsumption at 170 liters purchased per person in 2011. Japan came in at rank #56 at 32 liters per\nperson. In Japan most places serve tea with your meal\nfor free and in general it\u2019s harder to purchase massive quantities of soda - there\u2019s no\ncomically large big gulps at seven eleven, I haven't seen these packs of soda here, and\nJapan has the smallest \u201clarge\u201d cup size at McDonald\u2019s - An American medium size\ndrink is bigger than a Japanese large. Another factor to thank for keeping people\u2019s\nsoda intake low is again: variety. What\u2019s interesting is despite Japan drinking\n5 times less soda than America, soda is available in vending machines everywhere in Japan. There\u2019s 5.52 million vending machines, meaning\nthere is a vending machine for every 23 people in Japan - that\u2019s the highest vending machine\nper capita on the planet. So what\u2019s in these vending machines? Why don\u2019t we take a look at this vending\nmachine I came across on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere in Hakone. Among other things, They have black coffee,\nsix different types of unsweetened tea and water. A typical american vending machine offers\n13 varieties of drink, the only non-sweet one being water. So convenience and variety - simple, but it\nmakes a difference. It\u2019s easier to pick the healthy choices\nwhen they are just as easy and convenient as the unhealthier choices. Now this is by no means the full story on\nJapan and health, but I think these are two key factors. I\u2019ll be doing another video on some of the\nmany other things that contribute to health in Japan, so if there\u2019s a particular point\nyou want to hear discussed leave a comment below.", "fjqxr3aE6PQ": "Luke here cats carp calm and I'm catching cleaning and cooking eels door [Music] American eel are an amazing fish they begin their lives out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean where they hatch and then swim about 6,000 kilometers to the east coast of North America where they migrate into freshwater up into the streams and rivers along the east coast they spend most their lives in shallow streams and rivers way back up in the and the most wooded remote parts of the river they burrow into the bottom of the the river and they live there for about 10 to 25 years then they migrate

silver cat the medium powered rod and I've got a bunch of these size four number four eagleclaw hook so I'm going to put them on a high-low rig with three ounces of lead in little pieces of cut shad here see if we can't hook up [Music] [Music] now consistently catching eels is hard using traps is one of the best ways to do it but that's not legal here in Virginia without a commercial fishing license you can catch them on worms chicken-liver minnows a lot of different things but it's hard to consistently target eels I tend to find them mostly in the fall when they are congregating and heading out in their migration but one of the best ways to target eels is when I'm catfishing I'll be out fishing for a catfish with big six on a taut circles hooks and chunks of fresh shad and the Eels love that stuff but their mouths are too small to get hooked on one of these big six OTT a taut hooks so if you're sitting you're catfishing and you watch and you're losing a lot of bait you're getting a lot of strikes that just don't hook up oftentimes it seals if you're on the East Coast of one of these rivers it's often going to be eel so what I'll do is I'll keep a high/low rig and some number four hooks some number hook six hooks handy and then once I started getting eel bites I'll pull up my catfish rod and then throw out those smaller hooks and then pick up an eel or two well I've been getting a lot of bites little bites on this rod but nothing's hook it up usually that means that something small is messing with your bait and let's take a look at our bait it's got a few bite marks in it but nothing too crazy I'm gonna switch out my eel rod and throw my eel rod out there and see if we hook up with Evers biting on it look at that Tommy cut a largemouth bass [Applause] [Music] [Music] slippery like oh he is is difficult hold on my thumb yep didn't hurt too bad though carefully let's put him in the live well those eels are so hard to get off the hook they tend to kind of swallow it and then holding them well they're slippery as an eel frankly and they just twist and twist but good pair of pliers helps oh really deals are one of my favorite fish to eat yes sure how about you Nathan you gonna eat deal if you are not a connoisseur of fine fresh eel like I am you may still want to use eel as bait they make fabulous catfish bait and fabulous striper bait small baby eels are great striped bass bait chunks of big eel we're great for blue catfish and channel catfish as well well they're so slick there's like nothing to grab on to what did you name the yeah yeah we'll take a picture before we eat them okay if your catfishing and you're seeing bites out of your bait like this that's often a sign that you've got eels catfish won't take chunks out of your bait they'll crush it and rough it up but they won't take bites out of it and this whole section right here has been bit off wigglers Darlie just spin and spin and spin and spin the two wheels yeah he already did it is he swallowed it Wow [Music] all right let me show you something cool about eels they have these tiny little gills just tiny little things right in front of their pectoral fin look at that and they do have teeth and they're a little sharper than a catfish is but not too bad eels also only have three fins they have this real long tail fin and they have the two PEC tail fins and that's it well I love broiled eel but my wife is not a huge seafood fan and Tommy's been naming all the eels so I don't know how much eel we're gonna be eaten here so I've got two nice sized eels we're gonna go home and prepare and clean and cook these fish it's gonna be awesome [Music] you're getting all wet buddy there are guys come on you guys are ducks my boys can't go an entire trip without getting wet and mom wonders why you guys always come home so wet or eaten yield tonight a couple interesting things about eels is they are extremely Hardy they can live a very long time in an unrated live well I brought him home in my life well and then just dumped him in this cooler full of well water and they did just fine I think these eels could have lasted a day or two like this so I left him in the cooler and went out to the store and picked up some supplies so I got some munagi sausage a Japanese sauce for making unagi Doane and some pickled daikon and these are a couple ingredients here for one of my favorite dishes a Japanese dish called who know you don't 31 and a half inches long tough skin oh wow holy mackerel I don't want to make eelskin wallets that stuff that stop this tough area one of the things that's surprising about these eels is how much meat there is on them you know this is all the guts and there's the head everything else is edible there's very little bones in here there's I mean this is a lot of meat this is a big fish [Music] okay ugliest eel fillet ever Chuck that's an ugly fillet but that is a beautiful piece of meat and that's so white well that is a demonstration of some pretty crappy knife work right there but let's starting to getting the hang of it a lot of meat despite my my lack of skill there's a lot of meat off of those those eels okay I'm gonna show you how to make Nagi dome which is a Japanese dish which is basically broiled eel on rice get a couple five six inch chunks of Flay you put it in a grilling basket and then you scour the meat with a knife to just kind of cut it allow it to cook more evenly and baste it thoroughly in this unagi sauce I got at the store and just want to cover everything very generously and you can even baste it a couple times while you're cooking then you get yourself a nice charcoal fire going just throw in some hardwood charcoal and a little little redneck starter fluid there once you've got a bed of coals you want it so that you can hold your hand over the fire for about the count of three that's the temperature you want and then just lay that frying basket on there and it'll sit for about four or five minutes max and then you just flip it and you can even baste it a couple times in there and just make sure it's nice and generously moistened with unagi sauce oh that's gorgeous who just starting to blacken on the edges once everything's cooked up you want to cut the eel fillets into thin little strips and then you're going to cut up some very finely cut cabbage and slice up some pickled daikon and assemble it all in the bowl now one thing about this recipe that I did wrong is I left the skin on the eel and the Japanese traditional Japanese recipe you leave the skin on but their ills are much much smaller and their skin is very thin with these eels the skin is really thick and it's a little too chewy so if I had to do this over again but take the skins off when I was playing the fish well there you go but now you don't now the Japanese would have made this so much prettier and so much better but I'm not Japanese so I'm just some dirty Alaskan who appreciates Japanese food so I don't do it the dish justice but man it smells delicious they were good friends but they are tasty friend so this eel is really good but there's a couple things I did wrong first off these are much larger yields than the ones in Japan so the skin is much thicker and tougher and so if you're gonna make food that you don't or cook eel with American eels take the skin off because I end up having to spit off all the skins because I like the Japanese yields you can't eat them and the meat is is firmer then the Eels you get in Japan but it has less of a muddy flavor to it it's a very clean tasting white meat so this is really good if you didn't want to make without you don't with eels I try smoking them or even just play in it it's it's really good it tastes probably closest to snakehead is probably the closest compare I've had I don't like it it's a very good meat thanks for watching we hope you guys enjoyed this video if you'd like to see more great videos from the catfish and carp YouTube channel don't forget to give me a ball minute on that island it with a snow castle go on Neal one need to master it by 30 semester tower there", "7wW8oJVSVDQ": "[Music] or welcome back another video another challenge video today and that is going to be the cent verse no cent challenge this was actually suggested in the first slab sauce first G sauce challenge in the comments section by the way if you have a suggestion for a challenge video of any kind doesn't even need to be a cent or no cent or have anything to do with these if you have a challenge video suggestion posted in the comments section below okay so the challenge was and cent versus no sent no I think I did I did one video of this last year maybe two so this time I'm actually going to be using a three inch Charlie Brewer crappie slider and this is the the minnow style swim bait and then I'm going to be going to be using the slab sauce so here's how it's gonna work I have two of the exact same baits right here these paddle tail minnows I'm going to be tying them on to a 1/16 ounce jig head one is going to have no scent the other is going to be loaded up with slab sauce I'm only gonna do one at one rod at a time though so this is going to be like a ten minute challenge the same way I did the slab sauce first G sauce first ten minutes I'm going to go with no scent apps at all second ten minutes I'm going to go with slab sauce and we'll find out the winner all right let's get to it start it off with the no scent on this Charlie Brewer crappie slider one sixteenth ounce of jighead Oh got a buoy marked on some brush piles these fish are kind of they're kind of all over the parade place right now so let's get ten minutes on the clock this is no scent and we'll start in three two one start fishing or get tangled around the rod tip either way there is a fish right off the bat no scent number one it's just all about the number of catches that's all that counts today number of fish just like the slab sauce first G sauce challenge man key crop it crappie I need a crappie call on the boat there's a fish who I don't know if that's a crop oh so I hooked him funny you got hooked funny still got him in the mouth he just got wrapped see still got him in the mouth so it still counts number two no scent jeez they're inhaling these baits they must be hungry today what we got here oh we have four minutes and for 30 36 4 seconds 34 seconds hope there's one fish number three fish number three on the nose scent right now two minutes left we're at the two-minute mark three fish in the boat looking for number four there's number four number four on the nose scent where we got four time here 48 seconds left 48 seconds for fish let's get this guy off and get one more cast in I give it a fair shake here say there's fish right below the boat and that's game I had one right here but oh well I didn't I'd he didn't have it on he just bit it as you can see he bit the tail and pulled it down a little bit all right four fish for the no-scent let's put the slab sauce on and put ten minutes on the clock all right here we go let's load this crappie slider up with some slab sauce two squirts should do the trick for fish to beat that's what we got a beat right now for fish this is it's two o'clock in the afternoon so virtually a midday bite that's the that's the whole point of these sent challenges I think I don't think these challenges would be too fair if I did it early in the morning or late at night and then when you have a real feeding frenzy when these fish are really enticed to bite okay that's their normal feeding patterns but definitely show the difference between you there no center Center which sense are better for which time of day oh I just went over a big brush pile okay ten minutes on the clock good starting in three two one go oh right there's one number one in the boat for the slab sauce there he is oh oh just a weird angle number two on the slab sauce um check we're not even halfway through here about six six minutes 17 seconds left something like that yeah there's a fish number three for the sauce number three for the sauce I'll do a chime time check in just a second here once I get this fish off what are we go for time here just over halfway oh there's another one well they tied it you tied it if I can get this guy in the boat tie ball game folks tied it up grab your number four for the sauce one more for the win there it is there's number five number five for the sauce well we got a winner but we still got time left on the clock got 207 207 left on the clock plenty of time to catch a couple more not with cast like that though that was a terrible cast key is to let it sink down to that there deep water right now they're 15 to 18 feet he's just kind of let that bait sink down I was doing that for the no-scent one it's just tough right now there's a fish hmm maybe maybe a good one a little bit better it's number six board the slab sauce all right that took a lot longer to get that hook off than I thought I've got a minute minute 13 minute 13 left 6 so far let's even get seven just take so long to get it down to that depth maybe I should be using a heavier jig maybe the next challenge I will be using a heavier jig go to a 1/8 ounce jig inside of a 1/16 there's one there's one number 7 Oh number 7 for the sauce clear winner time check 34 seconds left wow that's that's not gonna work at all that was that was awful now what do we got for a time check 22 seconds left thanks to me that was a user error I'm pretty sure that was user error I'm pretty sure I gotta get this real off as rod this is a jig reel the bales weight the Bale seat is way too close to the rod tip and my finger hits it every time all these other right reels I have here they're they're casting they're meant to be casted and the real seed act the actual Bale sits about at least a half inch further if not more oh I don't even know why I have it on this rod I really don't hope seven seconds it's gonna have to happen right now six five four three oh there's a fish we get them in the boat I don't know if we count them doesn't matter really seven to four or eight to four clear winner slab sauce got it done today alright so there we go slab sauce clear winner seven to four if you want to take a look at if you want to check out these Charlie Brewer crappie sliders little swim baits I'll post a link in the description of the video and if you want to check out the slab sauce from crabby com I'll

everyone welcome back to amazonia and we're here for our final session of our online learning sessions so each week we've been learning about tropical rainforests and we've more so probably looked at south america because we focus on the amazon being amazonia and we've gone through the layers of the rainforest met various animals talked about the nighttime animals and also talked about the threats to the rainforest so with this being our last session we thought we would have just a really interactive session meeting some of the creatures that we've not come across yet so in amazonia we do have a few animals that maybe aren't from the rainforest and from south america as well and are just really good for interacting with and showing people closely even usually when there's not a pandemic having people hold them and experience that themselves as well so you'll see i've got some rather large insects in my hand so the first creature that i thought i'd bring to meet you today are some madagascan hissing cockroaches now one was just hissing on my hand there as well i don't know if you can pick that up it's hissing a little bit and i'll explain why they why they do that in a sec but first of all every week we've been looking at the world map and pinning on the animals that we've been meeting quite closely and seeing where they're from where they would live in the wild so being called madagascar hissing cockroaches hopefully gives you a clue as to where their natural habitat is and it is over here on the continent of africa we've got this island here this is madagascar now a lot of you i'm sure have seen uh the animated film madagascar and so it is based on this island it is a real place and it's full of lots of rainforest now these cockroaches they are from madagascar and also in their name is the word hissing and so like i say you may be able to hear it hiss and the reason it does that is just to sound a little bit scary now they're not scary at all they're not dangerous and they can't suddenly attack me or bite me or anything so the best thing they can do in the wild is to look after themselves is either camouflage hide really well run fast if possible and also maybe pretend to be scary so they're making this hissing noise like a s a very short hissing noise makes them sound like a scary snake so if other animals were near to them came across them and heard that noise hopefully they're going to keep those other animals away because the cockroaches are going to be quite a popular dinner to most things that like to eat insects so that's why they make the scary noise and they've also got fairly scary looking legs so being insects they've got six legs and if you can see closely they've got quite spiky looking legs so this makes them look a little bit more vicious a bit more dangerous now sitting on me now or however i hold them they can't hurt me with those legs it's just a look so they sound scary and they look scary but they're not really they're just pretending to look after themselves so in madagascar where these cockroaches live they are actually like a little recycler of the rainforest so we're all told and hopefully encouraged to recycle things all the time well naturally in the rainforest lots of animals will recycle particularly those that live down near the near or on the forest floor so the cockroaches their diet is pretty much anything they will feast on any organic matter so anything that they can get their little mouth parts into if i try and show you now little mouse parts just at the base of its head the head's this triangular section at the front and tiny little mouth parts at the base of that so we feed ours lots of fruits and veg and they've also got leaves in their enclosure to mimic the forest floor as well so on the forest floor they will eat any sort of old leaf litter that's dropped there fallen fruits um leaves they'll eat anything they come across even things like animal poo so they'll eat very strange things things that we wouldn't want to to eat in our bodies things we wouldn't get nutrition from but they are able to eat any organic matter so once they've eaten that when it comes out the other end as their poo that then goes back into the rainforest soil and helps fertilize for the plants and the trees to take up as nutrients so a great little helper to the rainforest um as what they eat goes in and then as it comes out as a fertilizer cockroaches in general as well are one animal that really can survive all sorts of things they're thought to be able to survive nuclear bombs survive so many days without their head attached to their body really crazy some myths some facts but basically they are very very resilient to a lot of things so even if they were we talked last week about um habitat loss and deforestation um if these creatures did lose the trees the areas that they're living in they would quite happily move to the next section or even move to sorts of towns and villages and still survive and do really well there so it is thought that cockroaches there are thousands and thousands of species of cockroaches um it is thought that they will outlive humans on the earth just because they are so resilient to so many things so let's find on the map where the hissing cockroach comes from we had a look earlier over here the island in madagascar so let's pop the picture onto the map fill that map up a little bit more so the cockroach is home of madagascar in africa so we're gonna pop the cockroach away now and we're gonna meet another creature and tell you all about it i'm gonna bring out one of our reptiles next so in a sec we will be meeting gordon who is our little leopard gecko so here i've got gordon who is one of our smaller reptiles in amazonia gordon is a little leopard gecko so this is him fully grown so you can see on my hand the size of him he's not very big and gordon is not a rainforest creature so this session like i said is just a fun interactive session meeting some creatures that we've not mentioned in the video so far so gordon actually comes from quite a different part of the world he would be found in india pakistan afghanistan in this region of the world and he's from a much drier and hot environment so more deserty areas he would be found in now if you have a think about where he's found in the desert and have a look at his colorings he is a really really good color for living in these parts of the world because he's got this nice yellowy sandy colour with the dark brown mottled effect from head to toe or head to tail i should say so this is a really good camouflage for him he's able to hide well in the sand and if there's any soil leaves logs etc and another adaptation he's got for living in the desert is his tail if i just turn him around a little bit here see if we can see his tail so his tail here is quite long for the size of him now his tail is really really special because inside that tail it is full of fat now in the desert animals that live there often struggle to find food and water so if that's the case and he wants kind of an extra sauce available extra nutrients available for him so if he can't find the food and the water that he needs his body can transform that fat into energy uses it as energy for the rest of his body so it keeps him going much longer and it's very similar as to what a camel would do with its hump or humps so camel's humps are full of fat as well and it means that the large animal can turn that fat into energy for itself give its nutrient give itself some more nutrients until it can find lots of food and water again now gordon his diet is mainly lots of little insects and worms so here in amazonia he gets wax worms little meal worms he gets crickets and we give him a variety just to spice things up at dinner time for him and he'll catch him on his little tongue and gulp them down as a piece of food as one whole piece now we've mentioned in our videos about some of the animals shedding their skin and gordon is no exception to that so about every four to six weeks he will wriggle out of his old skin and and he will pull it off a bit like a onesie looks like he's wearing a onesie when he does it so it will just start to peel off as as quite a whole piece off his body and once it's off he will actually eat his shedded skin it's really good and nutritious for him whereas other animals like snakes and the spiders and insects that shed their skin they don't eat theirs but the leopard gecko he will eat his shedded skin afterwards it's very good for him now if you have a look at his eyes his eyes on a close-up you'll see they're very much like little crocodile eyes um he'll do he actually does something quite funny with his eyes to keep them clean and remember he's from desert regions so it might if it gets windy and the storms he might be susceptible to get sand in his eyes if he needs to clean his eyes he actually licks them clean so he can reach his eyeballs with his fairly long tongue and clean his eyes we sometimes see him do that just if any dust has got in the way and and got on his eyeballs there so i hope you've enjoyed meeting gordon a little bit closer now we have got a little picture of gordon here so we're gonna pop this on the map let me just pop him back over there so he comes from this region pakistan afghanistan india around here so let's pop him in that area on the world and next we're going to be meeting another reptile slightly longer this one is going to be milkshake the milk snake so we'll go and meet her next so here we bring you our last animal of this session and here we have milkshake the milk snake you see she's a really beautiful coloured snake nice and bright with this orangey red marking and she would come from slightly above the amazon rainforest you might find of canada central america mexico sort of region and down into south america just a slight bit so she's not truly a rainforest snake um she would be found in forested areas but not really the true hot tropical rainforests we've been learning about so milk snake being a snake is a reptile and same as gordon the leopard gecko we met and reptiles they they're quite a unique group of animals and one thing that is special about them is you might have heard the term animals that are cold blooded um we're mammals we belong to the group of mammals being humans and we're warm-blooded which basically means our bodies regulate our own body heat so if you're really really cold and chilly um your body will start shivering to maintain that same temperature or if you're really really hot our bodies will sweat which also maintains the temperature but reptiles like milkshake here they can't do that a snake doesn't shiver a snake doesn't pant like a dog or or sweat any heat out like we can that instead they are cold blooded which means they can't regulate their body heat so to warm up they've got to find a nice warm spot maybe in the wild they'll go and bask in some sunshine here in amazonia they'll have heat lamps or heat mats to keep sections of their enclosure nice and warm and if they need to cool down they'll move away from those warm areas so we give them the option here if they want to warm up or cool down and likewise in the wild the reptiles would move around to a new environment as to what they want to do if they want to heat themselves up or cool themselves down so as i mentioned the milk snake has got really colourful a really colourful pattern down its body it's actually a very similar colour pattern to a snake called the coral snake now the difference is the coral snake is very very dangerous it's highly venomous you wouldn't get me just handling it like i am doing with milkshake and the difference in the pattern though is just two colours um how where the two colours match so here where it's the the red and the black together on a coral snake it's the red and the whitish yellow color that are together so the color is pretty much it's the same colored snake but in a different order so especially as the milk snake moves fast it would be very hard to know whether it was a milk snake or a coral snake so we call that mimicry when animals mimic other animals to keep themselves safe which is what milkshake is doing now pretending that she actually looks like a coral snake so in the areas that she would live she would find hopefully lots and lots of small birds and rodents to feast on that's what her diet is she is a carnivore so a meat eater and here in amazonia we feed her once a week on one or two small mice so snakes don't eat lots and lots of food every day now throughout our sessions we've met monkeys birds bats kinkajous those are animals like ourselves tend to have two three sometimes extra meals to that a day every single day but animals like the snakes they can conserve their energy and they don't need to eat constantly throughout each day so once a week once a meal one meal a week is sufficient for milkshake now you may notice she's sticking her tongue out quite a lot this is completely normal so snakes will stick their tongue out to basically kind of taste the air they use it a bit like a nose so when she sticks her tongue out you might be able to see it's a forked tongue it's got two ends and this means that the snake is able to pick up smells on the left side and the right side and when the tongue goes back into the mouth it goes then to a special organ the snake's got something called a jacobson's organ and the smells the tastes it's taken in go to this organ and then go to travel to the brain and tell the brain exactly what the snake is smelling so it's a really specialized organ and that is why she's sticking her tongue out frequently just wondering what's going on around her and trying to smell things out now about every two months at the moment milkshake will shed her skin so milkshake is an adult snake um but snakes will continue to shed their skin their entire life so they might get to their maximum size but they will still shed their skin just to keep nice and healthy especially to get if they've maybe damaged their skin anywhere or also just to get rid of any parasites that they might have on their bodies so it just helps like refresh their top layer of skin and keeps them on good form now throughout our sessions at amazonia sometimes i've touched on whether an animal has bones or not and you might be looking at milkshake thinking no she's just a large colorful worm well she is not being a snake she is a vertebrate so that's like us she has lots and lots of bones in fact she's got many more bones than we do as humans and if i show you now so you can get a better idea sit this here this is a replica of a snake skeleton so here it's it's not all intact now it's fairly old and been been looked at and poked out a little bit so hopefully this gives you an idea of what a snake skeleton is like so with milkshake as with any snake um she has got this long spine that goes all the way down her body from head to tail um her head she's got a skull look just like we do as well the spine all the way down and then all these tiny very thin little bones are all her ribs so she's got hundreds and hundreds of ribs and in between the ribs are all her muscles so she is a legless animal but very very agile and very good at moving around due to her flexible skeleton and all these muscles in between so if you do ever handle a snake maybe you'll visit us in the future at amazonia and be able to meet our creatures closer some of our snakes we do allow the visitors to handle under normal circumstances so if you do handle it we always say just relax your hands let her slither through like she's slithering through my fingers here because you don't want to squeeze her you don't want to restrict her body because you've got a danger then of actually squashing the ribs and damage bruising them even breaking them and just like with ourselves if we break a rib there's there's not really a remedy to it you've just got to rest and let those bones repair themselves so it can be very painful to the snake as to any animal if it broke its ribs so it although they are quite sturdy animals we've still got to be fairly delicate with them especially when handling them now in our last video we did meet eva royal python and i talked a little bit about them shedding their skin and so here i'm going to bring out just to show you again we've got a huge tub of loads of shedded snakeskin here now with the snakes as i mentioned last week they they don't wiggle out of their skins and leave it behind the colour like they actually are so when milkshake sheds her skin it will come off a slightly darker patches where she's got these black markings but generally it is always this sort of whitish creamy color and the shredded skin is very very thin and delicate it breaks very easily now if the temperature humidity and everything is right for the snake and they're they're they're a healthy snake they should usually shed their skin in one long piece um occasionally we have to maybe bathe the snake get it off the end of the tail for them if it's stuck on um or maybe off the eyes now if you can see closely snakes don't have any eyelids so they can't blink they can't shut their eyes very hard enough they're awake or not or just resting um so when she sheds her skin it comes off the eyes as well so on our pieces here in fact here is a piece you can see closely um you can see the eye caps we call them so just where the skin has come off the eyes which is good it means the skins come off correctly if not again we have to ease it off their eyes very important particularly that it comes off their eyes and off the tip of their tail but it must come off their entire body ready for them then to shed again in another two to three months now i was mentioning that milkshake mimics what we call a coral snake the coral snakes are very dangerous they're highly venomous milkshake isn't venomous at all she is a constrictor so that means that she would when catching prey so she caught a mouse for example she would bite onto the mouse to catch it and at the same time very quickly wrap her body around the mouse's body and squeeze so it's like strangling the animal so she'll strangle the mouse until it's dead or near enough and then she can kind of slow her go to it and just swallow it whole down through her mouth down through her body and she will swallow it every item of prey that a snake eats they will always swallow it whole again using all their muscles to push it down through their body so you'll see usually a lump moving down as she pushes it down through her body until it gets to a stomach to be digested so there we have milkshake i hope you've enjoyed meeting milkshake a little bit more hopefully it won't be too long so we can have visitors back and hopefully visitors meeting some creatures closely like this as well so we're going to find milkshakes picture just here and we're going to pop that onto the map so as i said at the beginning the milk snake would be found canada central america quite widespread through this region up here so if we proper down sort of central centrally mexico area there we go so that brings me to the end of our final online session i do hope you've all enjoyed tuning in every week i hope you've enjoyed watching the animals much closer and hopefully learning some really fun facts about them um we have got activity sheets on for today's lesson as well uh just as we have done different ones each week for you now since it has been a very difficult year um for amazonia as as most of the world most companies and businesses and if you would like to support us that would be fantastic and we've actually kind of revamped our animal adoption packs recently so if you are interested in it can be an animal you've maybe met a bit closer learnt a bit more about during these sessions or any animal that you can see on our website you are able to adopt for 12 months for 20 pounds and you'll receive an adoption pack full of facts and information also some tickets to come and visit us at amazonia so please if you are interested in that and please either drop us an email drop us a facebook message and we'll be happy to process that for you and that money does go directly to help the animals here in amazonia so it just leaves me to say thanks for watching um hope you have enjoyed all these sessions and we really hope we can open our doors to you again and see you soon bye from everyone here [Music] you", "OVu82RiLFyU": "oh the pain the pain oh stop the pain hey guys it's Ken from KBT productions TV welcome back to another kendama crude review just for you I am in the awesome sunny town of Bradford Ontario Canada at 7-eleven because over 4,100 people click the like button

like Pepsi fire and so this will be interesting let's go inside and fill er up we are back in the car ladies and gentlemen check that out Wow 7-eleven it's crazy I looked it up before I filled it up and it's 100 ounces a frozen Slurpee fire Pepsi fire I don't know why I want to say fire first but I do so 100 ounces is six point two five points for all you  beer drinkers out there at point 7/8 of a gallon so it's over three quarters of a gallon and it's almost three liters two point nine five liters of pure frozen Slurpee it comes with a straw it comes with a cap for your straw every seventh one you buy you get a free one I'm not sure how they keep track of that I believe that you have to get a card or something but every and he says there are guys that have these and they come by every day I don't know how much it cost to fill maybe four bucks or something it is 1468 again it's on sale my oh my happy birthday Canada all right so we have a straw we can try the straw you also have this other tab on the other side for pouring purposes if you want to share it which I said which i really suggest you do all right guys you asked for it thank you very much for the over 4100 thumbs up how many thumbs up can we get just for doing this video for you hit that thumbs up if you want to support this channel thank you very much here we go I'm not gonna time it I'm just gonna try and drink of as much as I possibly can oh boy brain freeze Oh Oh God it is pure sugary syrup oh my gosh oh I want to take this little thingy off now gonna take the lid off so I can at least visually see how well I'm doing or badly I'm doing it is so syrupy oh my goodness it definitely has like a bit of a carbonation feel to it texture so it feels like I'm drinking pop but it's way more syrupy than Pepsi fire but it has that cinnamon taste taste like I'm drinking big red gum I almost didn't add this to the list because I didn't want it drink it but I knew you guys would pick it oh I already got a brain freeze I'm not sure guys I think this is going to be a huge fail [Music] some people say putting your thumb up against the roof of your mouth doesn't work for me the pain still there by the time you remember to do that the pain is already subsiding and that's why it works oh boy I stalled a bit hoping that this wouldn't melt but it's such a well insulated mug you can get this tray on Amazon by the way and it helps when you're drinking a seven pound Slurpee come on I should have hit the timer but I don't want to waste too much of your guy's time too late I can see it taking all day to drink that they just shut up and drink it cinnamon death I'd rather do the ghost pepper challenge again my stomach is in pain my mouth is not liking it oh gosh the cinnamon it's like burning the back of my throat the pain the pain drink war why why did I do this I thought it was gonna be a good idea like every time I sip it oh my gosh pain from the cold pain from the cinnamon I'm getting a gut rot I really want to give it a good go I almost want to go buy a water to water it down a little bit and melt it because it's like super sweet thick painful to drink wait [Music] alright guys I am bailing I apologize oh my god that is disgusting the taste is awful it's way too cold it's freezing my brain out the cinnamon is disgusting my gosh I am totally failing failing bad my Oh mine let me know in the comments below if you've bought one of these and if you actually finished it and did you actually like just drink it to finish it or did you try to drink it as foster care I'm not sure that's a cinnamon or what alright ladies and gentlemen that was a fail once again I apologize for that on my rating scale I'm gonna give that a would not recommend especially the fire the Pepsi fire it is awful it is disgusting don't do it I could see maybe a lemonade and I could see like feeling it like maybe almost to the top and then filling the rest up of water so you can drink it because it was just so so cold I know that's what a slurp is supposed to be but I'm 51 years old and I don't want to drink anymore Slurpees not that kind anyway excuse me that's all bye that was double bad alright

comments unless I see more topics in the comments section I don't have problem filming them at all so if you have a comment or if you have a question about anything post in the comment section and if I see enough of them I'll make another video on that topic okay by the way this is a flopping krabi channel i'm davis i welcome back if you're enjoying this series if you're new the bottom right corner of the screen there's a red subscribe button be sure to click the bell that bells going to notify every time I post a video in this series and in the upcoming video 30 day video challenge series coming in the month of September so the today's topic I would actually want to answer some questions in the comment section here I wrote them down but today's main topic is finding the brush piles how to mark those brush piles and then kind of how to set up on them to vertically jig them so the first the first kind of question oops in the comments section related to why not use fish ID fish ID on your sonar unit so I'm gonna go here see if I can find it I don't even yeah here we go so fish is it fish idea long I've never even used it on this unit to be honest with you we'll see if it works so the main reason I told this person not to turn on their fish ID now I fish ID alarm might be different than fish ID and basically what it is it'll actually show a picture of like a goldfish it'll look like one of those goldfish crackers or it might be a different color than gold but that's what it look like and the problem with that it your unit assumes that anything that has a hard ping so when the unit sends down sonar and it hits something with a hard ping it assumes that's a fish if it's suspended off the bottom and the reason that's not good is if you cut the corner on let's say a brush pile if there's a branch sticking out and your unit sends down that ping from your sonar unit it could read that as a fish when in reality is not it it has to make a lot of assumptions when you have that oh here we go fish ID bingo fish ID is on okay I've never used it on this unit so I know what fish ID is I've seen it on other units but I have no idea if it's working or not I mean I think I mean clearly there's fish there's definitely fish down there on these brush piles I don't know either way it makes a lot of assumptions then I don't think will help you out in the long run okay so if you're using 2d sonar just leave that fish ID off don't use the regular shirt oh it's called chirp sonar these newer models are chirp sonar just use that type of sonar okay so let's let's get into chirp sonar somebody asks a question if down imaging was chirp sonar chirp sonar ch IRP is I don't know how long ago came into into play chirp sonar is just almost a real-time was as close as possible to real-time sonar as these 2d units have ever been okay cuz a lot of times these 2d units if you bought them let's say ten years ago always showed was historical data they didn't have this scope on the right or yeah this real-time kind of signature on the right here this is real time data that that ping is getting sent down from the sonar units the lake bottom it's sending a signal back and it's reading it okay that's a real time or it's as close as possible to real time so open water fishing wasn't really the biggest push with trying to get this to be really fast response it was actually ice fishing a lot of ice fishing units now have this type of screen okay even though you're just sitting below a hole and it's paying back and forth the same stuff because it's real time or very virtually close to real time you can actually see your jig bouncing up and down before that most icing fishing units were just a flasher unit something that kind of looked like this let's see if I can yeah something that looked like this is just a flashy unit went around like that so to answer this person's question chirp so now relates to 2d it's a faster ping speed than the older models okay it's it's virtually real-time oh so another person asked that they weren't getting a good resolution with their down imaging and or give their side imaging and it might be because your transducer isn't level in the water okay a lot of times and a mine is slightly tilted down like by a couple millimeters and we reason that that's the case is your transducer will actually get pinned between two two little plastic washers I guess and they got teeth cut into them and I just it's either it's gonna say two millimeters up like this or two million meters down it's not going to sit flat I just can't quite get it it's just the way it got mounted in so I'm fine with it I'm comfortable reading my my screen but if you're having trouble with resolution and you're adjusting your sensitivity and your contrast and all that stuff and you're still not seeing any fish or the stuff looks distorted it's probably you got to level out your transducer it could be canted one way or the other or tilt it up and down how do i mark brush piles first of all you're going to need one of these preferably two of these I had tool with these I cannot find the other one in the boat so we're just gonna use one today first we gotta go find some brush piles and there's a bunch of fish in open water God dang it all right we're gonna hurt you this video up because I want to go fishing look at all those fish look at them all stacked up everywhere this is crazy doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo okay so how do you mark your brush piles all right so you're gonna you be using your you can use a split screen if you wanted to make sure you find them okay but you definitely need to dicen our because this 2d sona is gonna be as close to real time as possible now I'm gonna freeze this screen here so this is a brush pile let's say I want to fish it if I went over it the first time and I want to go back over it again as soon as I start to see a little bit of you know brush or the some pixels come in that's when I dropped my first buoy okay that's gonna throw the first buoy out I go over it I see all the brush and as soon as I see it stop right there I guess I'd be going over this way soon as I see it stop I throw my second buoy I know how big the brush pile is you don't want to throw the buoy in the middle of the brush pile for two reasons one there's a chance you can get the anchor stuck and you lose your buoy if it's a windy if it's a calm day that won't happen but if it's a windy day there's a possible it's the buoy kind of drifts and it gets tangled second reason a lot of times we're like right here these fish are suspended right above that brush pile so that's actually where you're gonna want to fish and when you mark your buoy or you throw your buoys out on one side or the other of that brush pile you can set your boat up so that you're not actually drifting over that brush that brush pile if you just have one buoy like this it's a little harder you got to know which direction you were going when you threw the buoy out to know which direction the brush pile is so if I'm going this way and I throw the buoy out right away when I first start to see brush and I circle back around I got to stay on that side of the buoy so I'm not drifting over the brush pile and potentially scaring all these fish away so I'm actually gonna vertical jig a little bit I'm gonna show you here real quick oh the other question was why not use down imaging sonar for this and do you need to have a split screen down imaging sonar just like side imaging sonar is historical data I don't know the exact time as far as leg time behind 2d sonar I'm sure you can figure it out I'm gonna guess it's maybe you know a second second and a half something like that but obviously if you depends how fast you're going you know if you're going three miles an hour second and a half that can mean Oh while we're really getting into math here I don't know that could be 10 feet of water 30 feet of water I don't know you can if you're smart enough you can figure the math out but oh my goodness there's a fish we'll get that I got to turn my fish ID off forgot I had that on it looks like a walleye to it actually gave a picture of a walleye huh but I'm gonna guess it was probably like four or five crappie tied together it wasn't that actual walleye anyway what was I talking about oh yeah the leg time so the reason you want to use a 2-d cellmark sonar when you throw in the buoy out it's going to give you almost a real-time image the down imaging it's a real tough to throw a buoy out and try to guess you know how far I drifted over compared to where that word showed up on my screen so that's why you want to use your 2d sonar paired with either side imaging or down imaging but I'm gonna go back over find a brush pile throw it out I'm gonna vertically jig a little bit it's not gonna be a full vertical jig tutorial I'm gonna get my buoy ready here as soon as I start to see brush pile right there I'm gonna throw it out okay so that's gonna be the front edge of this brush pile and I just went over I don't think there's any fish on it but there might be some down there all right so that's the back edge or it would be the front edge as I went over it so I'm gonna circle back around all right so I'm gonna circle back around to my buoy here I'm gonna set up luckily I got the wind pushing me that way away from the brush pile I'm gonna set up and cast into the brush pile or vertically jig into the brush pile okay so let's let's get set up here all right you there's my there's my buoy I'm gonna stay on I'm gonna stay on this side of it luckily I got the wind right in my face that brush pile is just on the other side it looked like there's some fish kind of inside that brush pile I could tell from my mic down imaging sonar and this is kind of this is actually a perfect setup I got wind in my face I don't really have to work the whole the trolling motor to stay away from the brush pilots I actually have to work the trolling motor to stay into the brush pile which is really nice okay here we go bring it back over to these brush piles or this brush pile I'm just gonna kind of flick it out over the top of the brush pile and bring it back over the top of it I don't know we'll see if we can actually get a fish the ones that are suspended above the brush pile are gonna be the most active for sure ones inside the brush pile sometimes are the biggest but they can be a little tough to give them to bite so now that I know that's actually the front of my brush pile I'm gonna actually try to cast over the top of it and then on both sides to see if these act these crappie are actually suspended off maybe not suspended but there might be two three feet above the bottom just off the sides of the brush pile and they might hit something if I'm lucky well unfortunately didn't catch a fish on here I don't know we got a weird weather and pattern coming in right now but that is how you set up on brush piles how to find them with the 2d preferably if you have down imaging your side imaging there are great tools to find brush piles all

welcome back to 340 live uh today we are talking about nutrition and supplements as always i am 340 paddler also known as chris litki i have seven finishes uh in the 340 and i'm joined by a panel of very well qualified people to speak to nutrition and supplementation first of all we have ashborn ozzy larson known for his ultra running he's done a lot of that before he came into ultra paddling he's got finishes in the 340 and 2018 and 2020. uh then we have the man who could probably replace me because he is a better radio voice than i could ever hope for yes we have the 2019 winner of the 340 or half of the 2019 winning team from uh the 340 jeremy vore coming to us from the u.p of michigan it actually exists i thought it was like wyoming italian for nothing actually exists here it's sort of a space holder but apparently i was wrong and finally we have the man the myth the legend and we have brian hopkins um so uh brian finished the first 340. he took second place uh we won't talk about the fact that he was 20 hours behind west but but he has about eight finishes including in mix tandem man solo tandem and other groups and he is joined by alma who is a uh i'm gonna mess this up a registered dietitian that's right so i has a lot of qualifications when it comes to nutrition so welcome panel uh then just a reminder of how this works we do have the q a section which is open it is available on zoom you can type in your questions i will see them as we're running through things if there's a question very similar to what we're talking about i will bring it up otherwise we will deal with them towards the end uh you can also use the chat feature and if you're on youtube you can use the chat and uh our man in the background steve schneider the happiest man in missouri will help move those things over for us otherwise again we are dealing with nutrition and supplementation something that we deal with on a regular basis on the 340. and before we jump into sort of how it works and what's in the food bag i just want to say one of the best things you can do is put together your food bags ahead of time not this far ahead of time this is not a real food bag uh put a name on it your name if you're self-supported and leaving it by a flag but also for your ground crew the checkpoint where they need to grab it so all they have to think about is where am i what bag am i grabbing and handing to them so sort of organization that will help you out moving along but let's start at the beginning uh ozzy what is in your food bag uh in my food bag is um it's mostly for taste i am one of those that uses a powdered sports drink for pretty much all my race but in my food bag for for a different taste as i go down the river is gummy worms cheese sets a little bit of beef jerky and dried fruit and and that's pretty much it for every stop and what else are you consuming during the race so i i go with the sports drink that is in my bladder that gives me pretty much all the calorie and all the other nutrition that i need i switched that out i got about six liters with me and switch those out on every stop that i go to okay and jeremy what was your plan what was your food bag uh our food bag was a little different uh because of the temperatures that we were dealing with the very cold temperatures so we we did put a little bit more uh in our food bag from a fat and protein perspective than we typically would but like aussie i drink most of my calories i use either cytomax or tailwind as my primary hydration source and obviously that also has electrolytes and some carbs in it but then i also do a lot of uh liquid supplementation so i drink perpetuum uh for some fats and some longer term uh fuel sources and i do the same with insurer i mix in some insurer like a little old man that needs to drink my meal replacement so i use ensure quite a bit and then just because i enjoy having a little bit of something solid once in a while i usually throw in a protein bar or a clif bar or something that is more for boredom and interest to make me feel like i'm actually eating a meal but that is my primary primary food bag right there and i know that you had mentioned soups we don't normally eat soups we just did in that case because it was cold and it was a good way to stay warm all right and uh brian what's your food bag look like mine's changed over time and and the reason i mentioned that is that um my expectations of how i do in the race has changed over time and that might be useful to some people so now i'm much more like these folks and this is a lot to do with alma helping me as well so in other words a lot of calories coming from liquids etc but prior to that when i was doing the 340 and i wasn't trying to hit the podium um i tried a lot of kind of sports type cliff bars and i found that that kind of stuff gets old really fast and so tried to mix in some other foods as well so i guess i'm not giving you a clear answer i think a lot of it depends on what your goals are in the race if you're trying to be on the podium the kind of diet they describe is is what we've evolved to but if your expectations are to just finish it that's a different um you can do things differently and i'll throw this out to you guys if if i'm a first-year paddler coming in what sort of things would i want to do do i want to try and use you know a liquid product throughout do i want real food what are your thoughts for that first year paddler i'm i'm going to give you a non-answer uh my my non-answer is do whatever you've trained for so figure it out way before don't come into the race and think that you can drop in some type of uh you know new nutrition plan the day before it's whatever you've been doing for the past six months because just like we train our muscles and we train our energy delivery systems and we train our cardiovascular system we've got to train our you know our gut and our nutrition system as well so whatever you've trained on is what i would do i think a very key important fundamental is true for anyone who's going to be doing this race and that is understanding the physiology a very simple physiology of what is happening when we are um racing down the river and you are racing whether you want to finish in 70 hours or in sub 30s if that's going to be possible in the next year or so you never know so anyway um your gut uh the blood going to your gut gets shunted when you exercise it's a normal response when you exercise let alone actually just going for a walk so the the blood is shunted from the gut uh to the muscles to supply oxygen and much needed energy and that is what the body needs the muscles are saying i'm exercising here i need some water i need some fuel so the blood is shunted away from the gut about almost as much as 80 percent so that is so important understand that because that means the hamburgers the pizza they're going to be waiting for you at the finish line if you eat that throughout the race you're going to have some gut distress you're going to have some nausea some vomiting some floating uh some some big problems so what you're gonna be hearing already is that you need to drink your calories so pick a drink now the drink has already been uh the science is already there it's a lot of these sports drinks and i'm just gonna mention some the very popular gatorade which started the whole sports nutrition is still very valid yes it's hit the mainstream but to be honest with you that that's just their marketing technique that means they're a rich company but it's still a valid source so gatorade and i'm going to recommend gatorade endurance status and powder and you can find that in the walmarts out there it um so gatorade endurance um hammer heat um accelerate uh tailwind is very popular now so those are from six to eight percent carbohydrate meaning there's six grams to eight grams carbohydrate in a hundred meals so and the science has already figured it out for you so it's a matter of taste what you wanna try so i would say start simple something that you're accessible to you already started or your friends says i really like it you should try it word of mouth doesn't hurt and experience doesn't hurt either so try that out and as the the point was made very well by jeremy start now don't start later it starts now because he is true to say that you are not only training your muscles but you're also training your gut and it takes really a short time for the gut to adapt about three to five days on your short training days and i'm gonna say as little as two two long training days to uh get your gut used to um your diet and you brought up an interesting point i think everyone here has some experience with it uh let's talk about some of that uh flavor uh what you call flavor exhaustion or flavor uh brian you you know what i'm getting at yeah so flavor fatigue and i think i really want to talk to before we get done talking about that one talk about what ozzie does strategically to avoid it but i'll kind of tell you what it is so it's a real simple concept if you're you're getting so sore and worn out during the race that you're essentially getting the flu that's what your body thinks i'm getting sick and it begins to take whatever you're eating and drinking and and associate that with that's making me sick you need to stop that and i had this happen to the point where it almost took me out of the second race i did because um i was using gatorade and um and gatorade has its own issues it's a little too much sugars and we you know that's one of the things we could get into later but the point i'm trying to make is that after about 10 hours just the taste of it just like even putting the valve in my mouth i would involuntarily wretch and i i couldn't touch it i couldn't have any more of it and if my i had to at that time i i had to get water from um as a replacement and then that brings a whole series of issues of like you're not getting calories from your anymore and you have salt issues if you're on plain water so really what i'm saying is be really careful about this idea that you think you can eat the whole thing something the whole time you may have to switch gears and um you know ozzy from his ultra running because it's even more intense in ultra running he has strategies to try to avoid this you want to talk about that yeah so my food bags are just for that purpose so when i come in from the ultra running community it was that was a trick that i learned that every station aid station um is to pick a different food whatever it is banana pb j crustable and just eat some of that but i i was doing the liquid diet as well but just to make to mess with your body that it doesn't associate just drinking with pain and that kept me going and i that's why that's what my food banks are in the 340s just to trick my brain to go yeah we can still drink this it's going to be okay and it's worked for me well so far probably the last uh you know five six years when it comes to running but also in kayaking i just do that now because i that's what i used to do in the past so trick in your body is essential in that sense one tip that i would recommend when it comes to flavor fatigue yes uh think about 300 340 miles just never ending so with that your drink gets pretty uh mundane my recommendation for you is to pick two at least two different flavors of your sports strength and save your favorite flavor for the end something for you to look forward to and if you have three flavors that's even better you can do phase one phase two phase three and simple turns the first hundred miles is your least favorite the next uh 100 miles after that is your second favorite and you're going to finish with your favorite drink and that's going to mentally help you change it up you need every spark that any trick of the trade to keep you going especially at the very end all right and at night it is it takes discipline at night to eat and drink um i at least for me i've never had a 340 where when when i went into the night time i actually enjoy the nights i'm not miserable they're my favorite part of the race but i just stopped eating and drinking it just just doesn't happen and i have to remind myself in fact almost even gone so far as to have a timer um to remind us when we have to eat and drink and uh no it's a good point having a timer because yeah you're not really hungry on the race or i don't know how many of you guys actually get hungry and go hey you know what i really could use right now uh so if you're hungry rest of you guys use timers ozzy yeah if you're hungry you're too late i do the same thing i have a timer on it goes off about every 15 minutes it's my key to not only know where i'm at but also take a sip or two of my uh nutrition stuff and and keep going okay get jeremy in there sorry oh no worries uh we did the same thing um drink every 15 minutes and eat something uh or or add something additional like a perpetual or an insurer at the top and the bottom of the hour and our goal my goal personally is to put about 300 to 350 calories into my stomach every hour it's about what i shoot for you bring up two things i want to touch on first of all ensure i know it's been a lifesaver for me a number of times out there uh how many of you guys have used ensure in the past brian alma jared i've played with it but it just doesn't sit with me so i just stopped and and i should say that the way that i take my perpetuum is just like i can ensure i actually use ensure bottles and a couple of scoops of perpetual go into that bottle fill it up just to the bottom of the neck shake it up and it's uh you know it's basically taking like a shake i'm not taking perpetuum in a really diluted form i'm taking it in a much more um concentrated form so to understand you would take basically what would be one hour's worth of perpetuum in a bottle real quick as opposed to sucking on it multiple times through the hour i wouldn't say so i'm not taking a full 300 and some calories of just perpetual in one shot i'm trying to get 300 and some calories in over the course of the whole hour so it might be if i'm taking perpetuum at the bottom of the hour it might be 100 calories 125 calories that's one but yeah i'm mixing it thick like a shake in a small bottle you know in a small insure bottle so it's two or three swallows um and we even uh you know in some races we didn't do this in the mr 340 but in some races where things are happening a lot faster we even put corks in instead of putting a cap on so that you can do it one-handed pull it up yank the cork off drink it throw it in the boat keep paddling um so just one or two swallows is all you want so yeah you're touching on it excellent question now is how much that's what i was about to get into that's going to be very individualized but i there's a general rule there is a cap to how much even an elite athlete can take in there we're finding that's about 60 grams you can push the envelope even more so there's some tricks there caffeine is one uh the fructose in the sports drink is another one but not everyone can take it so hey there's the challenge but anyway okay for for our for our people out there that wants to know okay how much do i take okay um there's a couple general rules that we'll give you is from 25 grams we find out for say the woman the smaller person usually is the woman to 60 grams in an hour so if just to keep it simple let's just say that's gatorade that's about 16 to 32 ounces in an hour when you are trying when you're starting out you're gonna find that's a big gap so it's very individualized okay so here's the second trick is and i call it the silver lining of our race so what's in silver lining we are going to be very intimate with our urine [Laughter] oh my goodness so oh yeah so you don't want to pee in the vote i guess you could and some racers do uh especially if you're really cutting on time okay there's a topic we don't want to deal too much with but anyway you're going to collect your p and you're going to pour it out every so often right you um take advantage of that because you want you the color of your urine to indicate to tell you that you're drinking about the right amount and that you want to see a light yellow color to your urine okay if it's clister crystal clear like water hyponatremia scary no don't go there okay hopefully your support crew will tell you you know you're having those kind of conversations uh let me tell you uh food safety and kosher uh courtesy things go out the door on this race okay there's no washing your hand you're gonna talk about intimate stuff like that are you you know so am i having diarrhea that kind of stuff so but the color of your urine is very important to very dark almost amber then you're not drinking enough so again you're training now you're testing your beverage and you're also seeing how much you're drinking so the very first times you're out there for the new people out race you know getting to train so get a feel for it don't stress out you know go ahead and drink to thirst and then just keep the tabs after your run after your run then um see how much you drink pay attention to how much you you filled your bladder and how much you uh drink keep notes and pay attention to your your and it's you're going to get to a very good place and uh that's an excellent point and jeremy brought up something too uh how many calories can we actually take in in an hour as as a racer i mean what are we aiming for i think jeremy you said three hundred and fifty or so i shoot 300 to 350 but that's based on a lot of uh personal experimentation and figuring that out as almost talked about earlier you know blood is removed from our our digestive tract we can't process as much as we normally would we're sweating a lot our blood plasma's down um so just physiologically we can't process a meal every hour the way that we could if we were you know just hanging out in our in our living room so for me 300 to 350 is ideal um i know people that can't process more than a couple hundred i know some people that think they can process a lot more than that i don't know how much is actually uh you know making it into their bloodstream but um for me 300 to 350 but that's certainly not what's going to be right for everybody and ozzy i have the same thing i i used in the last year's 340 i used about just over 300 calories an hour as i'm going down the river so that's my plan is to replace that every hour so i um you know taking the calories throughout the hour about 300 calories an hour all day all night oops sorry no you're okay anyway so for for going back to that 25 grams to 60 grams an hour so i one thing to a little nutrition for uh one gram of carbohydrate is four calories so it's going to be for between 100 to um to 300 to 20 calories so 100 to 300 calories just what what you're hearing but again that's a huge difference that's a big difference so again you're going to have to feel for it um so yeah that's a great point you know one thing that alma pointed out to me when i started getting serious about my time she went through some of the physiology with me and and your calorie intake and everything that we're touching on but i really want to emphasize something that for me was a um it caused a shift in my mentality and i kind of coming back to this idea that you have to be disciplined she pointed out that you are actually expending more calories and energy than you can possibly take in it's not possible to to um you're losing the fight the entire race in terms of your caloric intake and so if you for me by realizing that i'm already losing a battle then to not eat for three hours at night just because i wasn't in the mood is not acceptable i have to keep the calories coming in because i by the time i get into day two you know i'm already starting to switch to fat burning and you know for me i have a lot of that so that that's a great plan for me but my point i'm trying to make is you're behind the curve the whole time so you have to eat and you have to eat the whole time not just when you feel like it the base best case scenarios when it comes to these endurance rates is that um 70 if you couldn't meet 70 percent by gosh you're going to do fantastic but it can be anywhere from 50 to 70 for many of us you know i would be yeah so it's um that's just what the research shows and it's easier for people who bike and say people like ourselves the kayak because the big mechanics is that it's in our favor we're not running and uh jogging our stomachs i'm sure that's something that aussie can attest to that's this particular challenge that runners have to face with that mechanical jarring adds some physical trauma to trying to get keep food down and but we are an advantage with kayaking yet even with that 70 percent is what the research says is the base best case scenario into meeting your calorie needs yeah don't don't run after eating a burrito it's not recommended all right but i found out too that um and through my uh through my training um it the better shape that i'm in cardiovascular shape the less calories i use per hour down the river which means that that gap the downhill slide that that brian's talking about becomes shorter and smaller so if i have a good cardiovascular system trained up for the race i'm much i'm much better off and nutrition wise throughout the race i you know brian had mentioned how important it was to eat during those three hours at night when you don't want to um i think that when you're doing something that's this long when you're doing something that is stretching into the 24 32 40 50 60 70 80 hours a lot of it's really about making sure that things don't go wrong you know you you have a plan everything's not going to go perfectly but you've got to make sure that you don't have any crux moments that really go wrong and for me the nutrition is a big part of that if i fall off the nutrition i'm in serious trouble and especially on the and i know we'll talk about this a little later but on the hydration side if you fall off the hydration cliff or you fall off the nutrition cliff that is probably going to be the end of your race and so um chris can share our nutrition plan um with you guys i gave it to him uh also before before this webinar um but we have a checklist so like when i when i take a new food drop i'm giving my empty food drop you know everything i've eaten all the wrappers all the empty containers they're all in a bag that i hand back to my ground crew and they're checking in everything i've eaten to make sure that i'm staying at my calorie target and just like ozzy and alma and brian said you know i've got some variety in my bag when they hand me a bag it's more calories than i need or i think i'm going to need between this drop and the next drop so there is some variety in there so i won't have eaten everything i hope if i've eaten everything something's gone wrong but i hope i haven't eaten everything they're still checking what i have eaten to make sure that i'm on target because if i'm not i need to know either if it's if it's really critical they'll call me or tell me by radio but you know at the very least let me know at the next drop so it's it really is crucial to stay on plan in terms of the calories in even if you're shifting what you're eating that's okay but you've got to make sure that your calories coming in so much about go absolutely can i mention we've mentioned ensure and um there's two distinctions that we need to make to the public right now um what the gatorade the tailwind um cytomax your sports drink that's going to carry for most of the race that's rich in carbohydrates uh and tailwind is 100 carbohydrates so some people love it it works for them um so um anyway no excuse me all those drinks all those drinks are 100 carbohydrate and they have electrolytes as well what we talked about when we mention ensure and there's other drinks like sports drinks like spis and uh perpetuum okay that is what we call a fluid meal replacement in this case that was created specifically for these kind of races that are multi-day by golly you're gonna and need more calories from let's add some fat here let's add some protein because we're breaking down protein at the very end of this thing so so these companies have basically made these meal replacements and some very wise racers said you know what what's insured if that's already in the market let's use it so that's what you call savvy racer so um so ensure what we're what we're you're hearing people do on this panel is that their sports drinks their carbohydrate sports drinks it carries them for the majority of the race but to make up the difference they'll gulp in some insurer or some spits uh although some racers can actually train to do most of the beverages from these meal replacements from what i hear the the body is very adaptable the stomach's very adaptable you just gotta train for it um but i i would say start out with uh the uh liquid carbohydrate sport drinks you know i want to add something here that i've i've never done a 340 where at some point in time the nutrition became um was it was more problematic you know i i i got severe nausea or i you know something it doesn't matter about the examples but you also probably ought to have yours your support crew have some options not by options i don't mean a bag of pringles i mean there needs to be some things that you could switch gears to and also what would you what would you eat if you were recovering from the flu you know so be liquids and maybe a broth and and some crackers well the broth is problematic but i've gotten through severe bouts of nausea but i hit a checkpoint and i thought i was gonna be in trouble and i just limped along with some crackers and just kind of try not overloading my stomach and trying to get hydration going again exactly what jeremy talked about probably started having trouble with my hydration and i came back and so by the time i got to the next checkpoint i was in the game again so there is this i think you have to kind of some of that stuff you're just gonna have to do it in your in your in your pre-training to determine what can you eat what if you eat a can of camel soup does it give you massive indigestion and are you an unhappy camper you can have to try it out ahead of time all right and uh you bring up a couple of good points or we've been kind of touching on them one of the most common reasons that people drop out on day one especially first year paddlers on day one is nausea stomach issues so how do you think we can avoid these let's start with jeremy on this one uh i'll i'll sound a little like a in fact all of us might sound like a little bit of a broken record here but i think at least in in my experience the majority of my nausea issues come back to hydration if i've gone off my hydration and i'm getting dehydrated i have more trouble processing food and processing those calories that are in my gut and i end up not feeling well and you know my stomach goes south my stomach my stomach turns on me but if i can stay hydrated i typically don't have nausea issues and the really insidious part of that is that it's you know if you miss a meal or two it's fairly easy to recoup those calories and you know start taking calories back in your if you bonk you can take a group packet or something and you'll recover fairly quickly but if you've really gone off your hydration and your stomach's turned and you're dehydrated that's something that can take a day or two to really bring back into balance and that's the end of your race it's all over so um so for me when you say stomach's turning south and feeling nausea it typically is in my own personal experience a hydration issue whether that is what's happening to racers literally on the first day like before they've hit the first checkpoint i don't know um i'm not a great person to answer that but hydration and nausea are are really closely tied for me all right uh ozzy or the hopkins yep i've got the same thing i don't i have not experienced much nausea in the past uh because i try to train as a race and i've experienced those in the in the past so then i kind of like oh here's what i got to do different but it's it's back to hydration just like jeremy says it's if you start drinking if you stop taking calories you'll get there eventually okay and uh brian so yeah um i have created a and chris you've already listed it i think on for the listeners but i created a handout uh actually the week before the race there's some best practices in the morning of when the jitters hit you uh how to get the stomach ready for the actual event it's a very exciting time you work really hard for it and believe me everybody's nervous so uh but nervousness means uh your stomach doesn't want anything but you gotta eat and there's a way to do it so um yeah i mean there's a lot of things that can cause nausea uh um i basically load up in my carbohydrates like a runner would the night before i have a just a good old spaghetti spaghetti and meat sauce uh meal and keep it simple no vegetables low in fiber uh and i'm hydra i'm hydrating the whole week uh probably taking more calories than i plan to on a normal week because what i'm wanting to do i'm saturating my body with fluids wherever i can get it if it means drinking my sports drink that first face sports drink do it um um water with lemon you know caffeine tea to a point um but anyway and then carbohydrates too simple to to rice pasta um [Music] mashed potatoes easy on the gravy you know cereals bananas uh you are trying to carbohydrate load and also be liberal with your sodium that whole week before too uh unless you are on doctor's advice to watch your sodium but you're gonna sweat out a lot of sodium here so um that is all listed in the hand that i provide that morning up is also very important so uh you can eat up to four hours before the event you might be up anyway but no later than an hour before the race i have something for some of us this is where ensure comes in perfectly okay drink your fluid uh you know for me it's just what works for me is uh oatmeal it works for me you know uh and i put the my whey protein to it and then um so up up from the time do i wake up to the time of the race i am hydrating i'm trying to get 16 ounces of fluid down so i'm trying to super hydrate and yeah it's going to take an extra trip to the bathroom but hey you in the bathroom you're going to be intimate for the whole time okay so you might as well start that relationship so um yeah and um so and then 15 minutes before the race i'm also still drinking um and that you're gonna keep your body keep by the time your your your uh the the bell rings so and you're off so um the thing about the jitters how to deal with the jitters so light as i mentioned just low fiber foods uh easy to digest carbohydrate foods um yeah a protein that you can handle that sounds good to you but um um caffeine in the morning for it may add the extra jitters but you're someone who needs the caffeine see again it's very individualized so uh if you got the if you tend to have loose stools i would stay away from caffeine and consider imodium okay if if the nerves really hit you and some of us do have problems with uh loose stools that morning off so think about uh ammonium just to after you've gone to the bathroom you've given yourself the time to empty and then um so that will help you out so kathy's gonna be essential later in the race and we can talk about that later but hopefully i've covered those things uh to help you it's a simple diet as i've said just carbohydrates fluids um not much don't donate don't go too crazy but don't forget your breakfast either yeah don't eat a high fiber meal in the middle of the race that's probably not going to be helpful so uh since as all of us said we're we're going to have to be comfortable with bodily functions uh i'll just quickly say that uh you know she was talking about what she eats beforehand and what she eats in the morning um i actually tailor all of that and try to go off solid foods you know i'll have an early dinner the night before an event and then go off of solid foods and begin some liquid diet and meal replacements because i want my gut to be empty uh you know i i would prefer during that race to not need to visit a restroom for a bowel movement and uh and i i i'll share that i was successful during our race and you know that's a big thing you know we our goal was to never get out of the boat and we we certainly had accommodations to take care of that in the boat while we're on the river but it's a whole lot easier if you don't have to um and so so we start making those accommodations early caffeine does as i'm dropping a pen sorry caffeine does uh you know help me along in my morning rituals uh so i don't take caffeine the morning of the race and in fact uh we actually wean off caffeine um steve and i both wean off caffeine for the month before the race to maximize the effect of caffeine if we need it during the race um so just a couple of small points there that i thought of as i was talking yeah i do the same thing try to get the liquid diet at least the day before uh to have the empty stomach so you know my gut is used to it and but leading up like almost leaning up that week i i eat everything that is good for you um and try to load up as much as i can so the body is ready and and i should jump back in here and say that what i'm talking about is somebody who is trying to beat their best time they're pushing for the podium they want to be at the front of the pack if you're so i kind of view it as there's the the podium racer and there's more of an expedition oriented approach to it where you are going to stop you're going to get some sleep cycles on land you're going to stop and use the bathroom outland all of that is perfectly okay and the examples that i'm giving are not in that more expedition oriented venue i'm talking about like you wanna every second counts and you literally are never gonna get out of the boat and you're gonna keep moving constant forward progress you know do everything in the current that you can do in the current because that's a free moving walkway uh if if you're listening to us talk and you're like i don't know if i want to do this now my god they're they're trying to figure out how not to go to the bathroom for 60 hours this is insane uh you definitely don't have to follow this advice because this is something you know the details we're talking about are the really nitpicky every second counts details um so i just want to make sure that we're not turning people off of the mr340 by saying we take a modium and then we never go to the bathroom and and to be totally fair my day before the event monday at 11 o'clock i am standing outside uh what used to be oklahoma joe's whatever they call it now and i get my big old two choices of meat and you know texas toast and baked beans and the whole nine yards and that's the big meal beforehand and why because it's tasty i don't care it's the one time i get really good barbecue i'm from wisconsin we don't barbecue things we kill them but we can't cook them well so cover them in cheese yeah yes you want something good put it in a casing call it a brat there you go um so yeah there there's a wide spectrum of things you can do and speaking of uncomfortable topics one of the other things that comes up on a regular basis in terms of nutrition is of course the other end stories of diarrhea or gi upset during the race any ideas about that how we can solve it how you can deal with it uh we can start with the hopkins yeah i mean i i i imodium is your friend you should definitely bring imodium with you on the race but i'm always a little nervous about it just like i'm a little nervous about taking ibuprofen and some other drugs that that can be problematic and especially you know things like imodium that's it's altering your body's normal process so the last thing i think somebody would want to do is they feel like they might have loose stools or they're kind of having a little bit of an issue and they just start hammering imodium the whole race for all i know and i'm not a medical professional that could be for over the course of 50 hours that might be a really bad idea so some of these things have their place as you try to recover from about of of you know in this case we're talking about diarrhea and imodium is definitely helpful but i would say that if you aren't getting it under control between that checkpoint and the next then you probably got a more complicated issue on your hands and and i don't have a beautiful answer for that certainly you want to uh stop the caffeine if you drink it and you got diarrhea because caffeine is a stimulant stimulating your vagus nerve which you know tells your gut what to do and gets it excited so you don't want that because it's already excited so stop the caffeine if you're having loose stools uh if you are looking forward to fruit or you have fruit in your bag that might not be a good idea while you're having uh these loose stools um so um yeah it's just slow down but whatever you do don't stop drinking your fluids drink your fluids especially your sports drink and hopefully you have something salty that you can also down your leucine electrolytes so um you know crackers if you can nibble on those and it does mean slow down slow down and try to get try to pull through and see if it's going to get give it a little bit of time i will i will give one piece of advice that's i think it's not about nutrition it's not about any kind of physiology issue but if everything's going wrong you can't stop dry heaving i had a partner who this happened to um he just couldn't stop dry heaving but he eventually got back in the boat and we were the second boat into saint charles that year and we we took 15 minutes of just sitting on shore get the paddle out of your hand just relax maybe lay back a little bit disconnect your brain from this intensity of this moment you're in and just try to center yourself again and it and it worked and i had done it for myself too where you kind of okay i'm ready to go don't have your support team load your boat and say i'm done just sit down and relax try and maybe even stop talking to a lot of people and just try to get there's there's a there's an emotional element to some of this and and that's what really what i'm trying to say is uh you know don't get so worried about your nutrition that you make your nutrition even worse and uh ozzy i'm familiar with enough stories from ultra running what are your recommendations since i've i've heard about trees and bushes being horribly abused during ultra runs here's some of that um i have luckily avoided all that i very particularly my training i don't i try not to take any new foods today before the the week before the day off so that i don't run into any of those issues um very plain in my in my diet the week before and during so so i try to avoid that so luckily so far i've seen some examples and heard some examples in the bushes but i i've luckily have avoided that all right and one other one other nutrition issue comes up all the time uh acid reflux and heartburn i know for me night two it's horrible uh so what do you guys do for it uh let's start with uh jeremy uh i i am extremely fortunate that i don't have too many issues with it but as ozzie just said i think part of that is that i spend so much of my training you know this weekend i had a training session this morning it was three hours i have one tomorrow that's five hours and i'm training my food you know a huge part of the reason i do those longer sessions is to train my nutrition so i've found what works for me and actually in the in the past couple of years the only indigestion-y acid refluxy thing i had was in the mr 340 when i did something that i'd never done before someone handed me a red bull and i said all right whatever they said this is great and i said fine and i drank half of it that was disgusting and i threw it away and about 20 minutes later man i had the most rotten stomach and it was acidy and it burned and i just went back to my normal food and everything turned out okay but for all of my always train and never try something different i did you know this guy at a ramp said here have a red bull and i was like okay fine off we went and it was a horrible idea um so i would say the best thing you can do is practice ahead of time and don't don't deviate and try something new yep same thing as jeremy as i i i try nothing new i just do the same thing over and over train your body to on these long runs just train and with the the nutrition that works for you if you try something new and if your body takes it bring it on but uh yeah i have not had those issues either true with the caffeine too um caffeine is actually a good performance enhancer and we're finding that um it can really help you stay alert it's the alertness pain toleration refocus hey change maybe this isn't so bad i was suffering but you know what it's beautiful outside so it changed your mental capacity so uh definitely valid and it doesn't diurese like what was a concern before so yeah a lot of athletes use caffeine but here's the caveat so it has to be in the in the shape of form that you're used to so um you know uh if you if you get given something like a red bull for instance and you're not used to it so um if you're a coffee drinker then stick with coffee if you're a tea drinker that's me uh that's my way of getting my caffeine so um you can't overdo it though and i'd be interested to hear what jeremy and aussie have to say about that but it really plays a role when you're really especially the first night and you're finding uh it's a it's a night um it's a a night cap it's definitely and it does have a five-hour half-life so you know once you take your caffeine uh you may be nursing it a little bit but you don't have to feel like you it's to your tolerance level so there's a lot of individualization to that too what about you what's your experience what's your caffeine well my uh i i like caffeine a lot i taper off at least a week ahead and have nothing day one or night one night two i need it it's when i last last race i could not see the river at all in front of me because of hallucinations but when i had caffeine it went away for a little bit i got energized and i i had certain animals where i took caffeine just to get me through the hallucinations and not being able to see the river and got me to sunrise and then everything just came back so that's how i use caffeine to my advantage at that point um for me uh i wean off a little bit before that i try to go into the race basically being non-dependent on caffeine because i'm very dependent on caffeine in my daily life i drink a couple of cups of coffee a day i do use some of my meal replacers with caffeine in them there's a perpetuum that's called cafe latte and it's got it's a cafe latte flavor and it's got a bit of caffeine in it and so as i go into the evening um i switch my perpetuum to that style of perpetual but beyond that i try not to take you know there's that's a very low amount of caffeine in that i should say that that's a low amount of caffeine in that particular supplement um as i get tired in the night i i actually use chewing gum chewing gum is wicked good for me um to stop myself from falling asleep if i'm getting tired a couple of sticks of chewing gum go in and it's amazing how that can can really keep me going but if i get to the point where i feel like i need caffeine like i need specifically to resolve an issue with attention and and energy levels i need caffeine i actually use small caffeine tablets so that i can very carefully observe how much i'm taking and i can make sure that i don't go over what i should go you know what i should take so that's another thing i train it ahead of time i practice it i do night training um and during that night training i'll practice with the caffeine tablets when i need them but that's a way that i can make sure that i'm controlling exactly what i'm getting and i know exactly what's gone in so that i don't accidentally take too much speaking of which how many of you have actually taken too much caffeine on the race and run into problems i'm the only one good so i i i haven't so i'm a caffeine addict and i've been for a long time the the concept of tapering a month beforehand just frightens me kind of like a heroin addict being cut off so um but during the race i'm frustrated because most of the gels out there and i do we do do gels and we do them for not just the calories but they also are a really good way to kind of dose your uh salts because you kind of know what you're getting in there and uh but there's this trend where all of the gels have caffeine in them i found especially the last time we did the 340 when i was getting essentially a quarter cup or half a cup of coffee every time i take one of those gels i think it was detrimental i think by the end of the day i was just i could feel that it was too much caffeine and i just kind of wish there was some other way to to begin and i i know this year i'm going to work really hard to find non-caffeinated gel-like equivalents probably perpetuum um because i i didn't have the problems that you talked about chris where you're hallucinating but i could just feel that it was counterproductive to what i was doing and for those of you that missed the conversation earlier my first year in the 340 i was taking no doze tablets plus i had five hour energy and some other things and i pushed off of herman at 10 o'clock at night thinking oh this'll be fine pop in a few uh no does go on my way turns out caffeine can actually make hallucinations worse um and i hit four wing dykes in burger bend i'm not even sure how i do that now that i look back at a map but i was convinced they went all the way across the river and it was a horrible experience uh and i'm a pretty lightweight person when it comes to caffeine one five hour energy is fantastic for me at the end of the race as long as i finish in four and a half hours if i'm six hours out i'm toast it's not good talk to scott reeves he saw me through that experience once and i was convinced that his pedal boat had toddlers running around it because i couldn't figure out what his legs were doing it it's a tricky situation so i'm going to ask does anyone use anything as a as a supplement that isn't caffeine to keep them up at night that they want to talk about uh herbal energy pills or any of that chewing gum and singing yeah i'm with jeremy on that one music helps a lot insane for me it's music i actually sacrificed a little bit of weight in the boat and the good news is now the technology is pretty remarkable so you we've got bluetooth speakers that will run for 12 hours that are waterproof that are actually very light and so we would use music as a reward cycle so we when we were really feeling down it was like okay get the tunes going and uh it was a it was a miracle worker for us in terms of trying to pep up so um i mean that probably might work for any everybody else but for for both of us it it was it's an important factor in the in the race for us and ryan were those your own tunes or did force you to listen to something else no we actually our favorite music during the race that anybody cares is uh was kind of modern brazilian pop so that was it's always upbeat music and we really like that but anyway it doesn't matter i just want to make a point before we move on to from caffeine so there seems to be you know dietitians we're into numbers um so 90 to 180 milligrams of caffeine uh in an hour it seems to be majority of tall majority people can tolerate optimal be 200 milligrams so do read the labels it um it that's hopefully caught that it's important to start learning a little bit about reading labels if not already so yeah to see how much those uh energy drinks provide there's very strong i think then i read six cups of coffee equivalents up it's been a while i haven't read those but anyway so you know it's probably going to be more than that so yeah it's pretty strong stuff but if you are if you're one of the few that can take it you know but we all have a threshold and jitterness like chris mentioned that'll happen to you so again from 90 to 180 milligrams seems to be optimal and chris you said you had said what other supplements you know do we use specifically for the night and and getting through uh you know those those doldrums but in my mind you know supplements uh i shy away from supplements because they all do something to our bodies you know there there is some chemical and biophysical result of taking a supplement and unless i know exactly what that is unless i have a need for it unless there is some shortcoming or deficit that i'm trying to make up for i tend to not look to the supplement as being some magic pill that's going to increase my performance if if i have a specific deficit if i am short on sodium or i could use that caffeine because i'm really crashing and i've practiced with it and i know what it's going to do then i might you know be tempted to and i might you know decide to use a supplement in some form but otherwise i'm pretty leery of of messing with the physiology that's that's just naturally occurring because there are always consequences there's no free ride there's no magic pill so i get really nervous about people starting to pile on the supplements i see people with these baggies of pills they look like drug dealers i'm going to go race i'm going to do my workout and you're like oh this is terrifying i have no idea what's in that bag so i tend to shy away from them so what about the hammer anti-fatigue or the ubiquitous electrolyte pills etc do any of you guys use those or do you just go with sort of what's in the bottle uh you know your liquid liquid diet my in my case the diet the liquid diet and what i have in my nutrition bag is planned out you know i know how much i sweat i know how hard i work i know how many calories i burn and so what's in that bag should cover me um i do carry some electrolyte tablets just in case things really go south and i've made a big mistake and i'm becoming hyponatremic and i need electrolytes i carry some as an emergency stash but otherwise um no you're not popping an electrolyte pill or two every hour nope i want to talk about that idea exactly what jeremy said which is really important and i i i almost would say i want to plant a flag in the sand on this everybody who does this race needs to have um electrolyte pills in the boat and a little bit of an understanding about the idea of what it means when you um don't keep your salts up and we even had a situation where alma um just because of a shift in and her interest um and and what she was eating um and drinking more than than probably she should have and we were looking she was looking at her urine and realized that one she wasn't feeling so good starting to get a headache but she saw that her urine was crystal clear and that's when we dug out the electrolyte pills and gave them to her and within 45 minutes she circled back on the whole where she was going if we didn't have those in the boat it might have been problematic so um there's you know the salt thing is is important it's almost except not a separate subject but you could talk about that for an hour in terms of what you how important it is yeah so uh a caution about what we're talking about so hammer um what enduro lights what are they called and like yeah one um so um some people hate those they find it very difficult uh to digest so try them out again during a long run you want to seek the heat you know missouri heat it's coming we hope um so definitely take advantage of the humidity don't shy away from it in fact that's going to be your training ground so that's when you're you can test drive these kind of things um so there's also the news nuns n w ends and those come in different flavors you can actually pop that into your drink uh one tablet and 16 ounces that will help i will tell you though a lot of people feel a lot more comfortable with just drinking uh their their sodium from food and that's pickle juice becomes super popular i would advise that you actually drain the the pickle juice from the pickle jar the real pickle jar versus the commercially made the commercially made is made oh it's nasty it's got dyes in it and preservatives it tastes terrible so you're wasting your money but if you get the real um real deal three ounces of those is about 900 milligrams it's a big shot of sodium so you don't need any more than that and sip chase it with water uh for sure and it's not one of those that you're going to be popping all the time probably one would do it see how you feel um you know uh and go from there so um yeah so elmar are you supplementing um electrolytes consistently through the race um or are you relying mostly on your food intake and you're supplementing when the need arises correct okay correct however great question i feel that the way things went last year you know you're so exhausted i don't know about you guys but eating at the last what 70 miles is like barf i don't want anything nothing nothing you know and you have to push you have to push the beverages so hopefully the idea of saving your best flavored sports drink at the very end but i'm now wondering so we're going to test it out um certainly when you're so exhausted it's the sodium that i think you're so depleted i bet you if you take a shot of you know test your blood you're going to be hypo neutronic anyway you know and uh to just a safer level but um but um i would test out some sodium at the very end some pickle juice at the end to help uh improve my appetite you know a lot some of that's going to depend on what kind of 340 we see too because i don't want to sound like the grouchy old man here but um he's a grouchy old man yeah but it seems like we've had the the date of the 340 shift into cooler temperate zones for quite a while now we have not had a july 98 degree intense wall of heat 340 in a while and obviously in a situation like that then you're sweating and your fluids and your salts become really really important you cannot trivialize it and i want to kind of circle back on something here and go back to a little bit of nutrition a little bit of supplementation i've got a question that i want to deal with first from an audience member uh katie says i have daily meds that i have to take regardless of what they are needed for does anyone else have this how do you deal with it i think in a practical sense how do you take it at the right time does the added exertion and energy day over day have an effect on their effectiveness i'm going to say first of all that's a tricky question bring your doctor into it but leaving that aside what do you do if you have a medication to deal with and i'll start with uh alma since you seemed the most qualified here to deal with that well i don't know about that but i have to admit dang it this healthy lifestyle that i do and eating right and exercising on time and i couldn't beat hypertension so i've started just this past two months with hypertension medicine so what i'm going to do is just take it in the morning like i usually do uh i do have we do have carry pills you know yeah mechanic mechanically we we use a small dry box and uh and then please if you if these are really important meds you need to bring them another another small dry box because sometimes you things happen i've had one uh i've had one time that i got water into this into what were that the pills and things that they're mostly salt tabs et cetera but yeah i mean i don't have an answer from a medical standpoint but mechanicalistically they make these little small drive i mean uh water type boxes and that's probably the way you're going to want to go with that so yeah it is a medical question do follow up but i do intend to take my blood pressure medicine during the race um the good thing when it comes to blood pressure exercise is a natural relaxant of the blood vessels so you got to put let the blood vessels expand when you're exercising so it's a natural lowering of your blood pressure but throughout the race as you continue on i would i would uh wager that maybe the blood pressure goes up so i say definitely stay on your medicine but it is a medical question good question anyone else ozzy or jeremy talk to your doctor oh yeah um on the same vein what about people with special needs in terms of people who might be diabetic gluten free etc any recommendations for them when it comes to nutrition on the race because of course this is going to be a very stressful event i'm thinking more diabetic than gluten-free saying that's very stressful but uh how do you handle that i've i've got one i've got i've got a piece of advice uh tom brady has a coach tiger woods has a coach i've got a coach you know i'm not putting myself in their category by the way but people that are really at the top of their game hire professionals to help them work through their performance issues and their performance opportunities i would say especially if you're dealing with something like that but even if you're not there are a lot of really great ultra endurance coaches and nutritionists out there who specialize in helping people like all of us make plans and put together the best thing for their own situation they can tell you how to train and how to prepare and how to test things i would say if you're dealing if you have the added challenge of something like uh you know diabetes or some other dietary requirement you're vegan or what have you um it's worth really in the end with a small amount of money to hire a professional coach or um you know advisor to help you out ozzy anything to add to that i would second that become knowledgeable get a coach get good sources and then train with it train and train with it i married a coach so i was about to make a mention of having a regular dietitian with us yeah with gluten i think the person is going to be savvy if we have any folks that are sensitive to gluten they're going to be savvy enough to most of these sports drinks it's going to be uh gluten-free but the problem comes is they are are they manufactured with a and where there's a potential for cross-contamination so i would inquire with each company and to make sure uh that's my advice so the beauty is this you bring your own food and you have your own food handed to you so it's not like you're uh you're traveling where you're having a hard time finding food that meets your diet um you know obviously that i guess that would mean it's not the time to go up and get a hamburger from the boy scouts who are grilling if you think you have to you know avoid things so i'm not saying the issue isn't real but you're already kind of self-contained you have brought what you need for that issue and just make sure you know how to keep it dry and make sure you know how to handle it and do it in a boat which is so you gotta practice that stuff and i'm thinking in terms of diabetic and potential needing for shots you need to practice it in the boat um and and see if you can make sure you got a clean system going on and in in terms of specialized diets my wife is actually vegan and so are my sons um perpetuum has a hammer has a vegan version of perpetual um i know they make it in strawberry flavor i'm not sure what other flavors it might be in but regardless i think if if what you're dealing with is a dietary thing you know being diabetic to the point where you're taking shots is a little bit different but if if what you're dealing with is a special dietary need if you're if you're working at the level of detail that we've been talking about throughout this webinar um it's more an issue of finding the options that are out there and then training with them but uh you know we're being extremely specific with what we put in our body what types of things we use you know there there aren't any surprises for us and i think you would just apply that same logic um within the confines of your you know your dietary restriction okay and i want to uh bring up another issue jeremy you kind of touched on it before you said uh maybe it was before maybe it was last night when we met uh but you talked about training low and i you know i want to get into that idea of nutrition for training so do you want to talk about that and what you mean yeah absolutely um so there is there's this vogue thing where people talk about putting themselves into ketosis and teaching their bodies to burn fat um and i i don't subscribe to a you know full fat low carbohydrate put your body into ketosis uh diet in general um what i was mentioning last night was actually in response to that um and saying that i don't i don't follow that sometimes i do train low which means i wanna i wanna feel what my body is like when i have low muscle glycogen so oftentimes i'll do a double i'll do a workout in the morning and then i'll you know fast on carbohydrates through the day and do a second workout in the evening or i'll do a workout first thing in the morning without having a breakfast so that i have low muscle glycogen and i can experience that i can give my body the chance to burn a higher percentage of fats we are never burning purely fats or purely carbs it's always a mix of the two but so training low is something that you can integrate into your training methodology hopefully with the guidance of a coach or somebody who really understands what they're doing and so you do it as a specific and very intentional part of your training methodology i wouldn't say that it's a key component of what i do and i would definitely say that i'm relying on carbohydrates to get me from kaw point to st charles i am not relying on fats i'm not eating you know big wads of peanut butter um i'm not operating in ketosis um the the fast clean efficient energy is carbohydrates not fats and so that is where i'm you know where i'm trying to operate um and i believe there's a lot of science behind that um and you know alma can speak more clearly to that but that's uh so so yes to answer your question training low i do train low i do train when i have low muscle glycogen um i do it a couple of times a week generally on a long a long exercise and i'll start taking carbohydrates an hour or two into that training low so that uh my body has a chance to replenish them while i'm you know in the process of being physical and so i don't i don't generally have like a whole five-hour workout that's training though i'll train low for the first few hours and then begin my nutrition plan so and now ozzy you had different ideas about it and i just want to give you a bit of a forum to put your ideas out there no i think uh i don't know if i got lost in translation yesterday i practiced i trained low on carbohydrate just like jeremy says not maybe i misunderstood uh what we're talking about yesterday but that that kind of gets you into that more into that burning fat how does your body react to burning fat how do you slow down because you do and how does that feel how can i get out of it how's my mood so i do practice that just for that reason so when i and i do it paddling so i will go down the river obviously with people and i i will not have carbs or anything as much as i can ahead of time and i go down the river uh as much as i can and i'm like oh this is how it feels how do i get out of it and try to get out of it in the boat while i pan so that's an excellent idea sort of putting yourself into that position that you're going to see yourself in the race please don't try this with electrolytes necessarily but put yourself in the position and then try to get yourself out of it yeah trying to see how it works so that you don't it's it's another i like to control my environment right so i like i like not to be surprised so this is one way i wouldn't be surprised i'm not this is how it feels now this is where i'm heading did i forget to drink did i forget to eat maybe i should take some of these things to get out of it and alma you uh i'm sure you have something to add to this um yeah the concept of training low carbohydrate to me that's 40 carbohydrate roughly 30 protein 30 fat and that's something i've been doing for years because i started out in bodybuilding and from there i mean that was all about physique and it's a calorie deficit and i have had a wonderful revelation something that we talked about that sealed the deal that now that i've been training high carbohydrates so 60 65 percent carbohydrate i feel fantastic my metabolism is higher i'm actually like losing a little bit of weight or keeping my weight even at a level that i was fighting for before because i just revved up my metabolism so my body is primed to really love the carbohydrates and i've increased all the thermogenesis of burning burning energy so i just have after years of being low i now love going back to being high [Laughter] now is that because you went you know and keeping it high so huh i went because you went low and then you went high or is it just because you're higher carb because i'm a higher carb i'm now my metabolism is higher i am my i'm more energized in my workouts it's the way to go uh when it comes to these long endurance type of events so um and i think what uh you know to me what's happening is with jeremy and ozzy is like you can tell the best athletes are the ones that are well read and they're always researching they're always looking and you have to respect that so i i give them kudos and i see it all the time so and i think what's happening too they're not really mentioning it but they're trimming their bodies they're keeping their bodies lean by changing their their their carbohydrates up and down keeping it guessing so that that is actually a trick of bodybuilders as well their bodybuilders are the prime when it comes to changing their metabolism to try to stay as lean as they can so it's a practice that i think came from the bodybuilding world it's not entirely new i've been doing it for so many years i'm so happy i'm eating my carbs i'm a happy girl just to make sure that you get carbs yeah i went to you know really dark stouts and kind of moved away from porters you know so how do the ipas work for you on the river though do you find that thank you hops will make you lose i'm telling you right but just just to make sure that i was clear on what i was meaning by training low i'm not changing my diet my diet is still a carb-based diet i just happen to start a training session when i'm in a fasted state after either fasting overnight or you know doing a workout to burn muscle glycogen and then doing a second workout later in the day without having to replenish that so um i'm certainly not looking at like a you know a keto diet or anything like that i'm eating a normal diet for a an endurance athlete that is carb-based is it intermittent fasting like you stop eating i look fine uh it would be you know i have dinner and then i don't eat again and i wake up in the morning and i go for a run or i go for a paddle um so it's not it's it's not even more than a typical fast it's just you know when you have slightly low muscle glycogen does that make sense elmo okay okay so so it really isn't you know i don't i don't do any keto-based diet or low-carb diet it's a regular diet and i just happen to try to do some training when i'm in a low glycogen state as a result of normal fasting all right just i think just to be clear because we've been talking about fat burning it's that just to be clear about what the bottom line if i may what's happening here is that um we we need to make sure that um keep low-fat diets are i mean excuse me high-fat diets and ketosis is not the way to train for these at all 100 agreed yeah yeah all right and i want to bring up a question uh about self-supported nutrition now we've talked about liquid diets and all of that and of course carrying enough liquid with you is going to be quite difficult so uh what would you recommend you know if someone's self-supported they don't have a ground crew out there how can they some of that i can't talk about that from from uh so there's water now available the very first 340 i literally had to carry what i thought was going to be enough fluids and it turned out there was some tricks around that later in the race but couldn't count on it now there's water pretty much available and i'd hate to say that somebody was counting on every checkpoint having water but you typically can get water even if you're self-supported so you could carry ziploc bags with your uh carbohydrate-rich powder formula easily for the whole race and you just dump it into the water and resupply your container um your hydration container however it is so i guess my point is is is if you're you unless you're you know you you have the water is the main issue in terms of weight and excess bulk in your boat nowadays with the 340 i don't think that's a problem you can get water so then you just have to plan on how do i deal with drink mix etc and that's pretty straight and and cleaning the bottles since some of those drink mixes go off yeah we have a story about that i'll keep it i don't want to we had a situation where our container wasn't cleaned out correctly and it fermented and um one we couldn't drink it because it was it was disgusting two we were probably dealing with flavor fatigue at that point in time but it put a panic moment for us and we actually i had to pull over at cooper's just to get water because what was in our hydration flask we were not going to drink that so you know we knew that we couldn't stop drinking so we had to pull over and just scramble to get some some a replacement at that time so you know you you were yeah i don't think you were kidding but it's actually a really big deal you can't some level of food prep hygiene is really important here especially on the drink containers no i was i was serious because i know some of the drinks like infinite and uh spizz and some of those that contain milk proteins and different proteins go off and they start tasting sour and i couldn't imagine putting a dirty bottle you know refilling the same dirty bottle and not ending up with some real problems uh jeremy anything yeah i was just going to say on in in terms of uh how particular you are with your nutrition plan and and in this case i mentioned earlier uh it's really about making sure things don't go wrong uh you know a long-term race like this is about making sure things don't go wrong so i actually bring my own water um i bring gallon jugs i have these uh you know lexan gallon jugs and i bring my well water from home and that is what my ground cruiser uses to make my drinks and to make in myanmar 340 my soup because i know that water is is good and i don't have any issues with it and it doesn't bother me whereas i've you know i i went to fresno my wife and i moved to fresno for a little while and we were both sick for the first six months we lived in fresno and couldn't figure out why and it was the tap water and we got filters and we were okay i don't want to risk having bomb water from you know some public boat launch that some guy you know used the hose to rinse out his rv septic tank or something so i bring my own water um that might be a little a little too persnickety but i'm that particular same thing i'll bring gallon jugs of water and i'm so we are ready so we don't have to run out of water or not find it or like you say it's you find strange water yeah just eliminating all the possibilities of getting going wrong is really where it's at i think in my head i think jeremy your idea of the uh what was it perpetuum in the small bottle it's you know single serve sort of thing with the cork might be a great suggestion if you're self-supported thinking along those lines yeah yeah and in this case uh you know we had our ground crew put the the scoop was already in there i prepped all the bottles and had the scoop of perpetuum but they just filled them up to a mark of tape that i had on the neck and then they'd cap it and hand it off and i'd shake it before i you know i took it and then drink it but you could also leave it dry you know if you know you're gonna have long stretches between um you know between water stops or whatever between drops you could just leave it dry and add water in the boat absolutely and i've got something similar here this is my own mix if you add spis and instant coffee it still tastes horrible but i call it spazz and i just throw it in these old uh single-serve milk containers and then the idea is throw it into a water bottle while you're out there and then flip out water bottles uh with the ground crew so they can clean them out and get done but that's that's another possibility but the cork is a nice idea because then my hands don't have to function i can use my teeth right and i've only broken one of those during the race so i don't think it can happen twice one tooth yeah uh at lexington under the bridge i broke a a tooth in half uh one of my wisdom teeth on a cliff's bar so i still can't eat bars during the race and i spit into the water and i was sitting there texting my ground crew going i need scope i need listerine at every checkpoint so i can rinse it out and not die of some crazy infection actually go to the dentist before going to the 340. little jv weld in there you're all set you know speaking of like what you might take in and die in those uh we are probably ought to talk about people who wonder if they can filter the water out of the river and the water in the river is not the missouri river is no less no more polluted than any other body or water that you would point to in fact like the ozarks has worse water quality numbers than most of the missouri but the sediment load is intense and so um you just can't do it there's no filter that's going to work um and the only way expedition paddlers do it is they put in a bucket let all the sediments come out and then pull off the top phase but anyway just just wanted to cover that because every every year there's at least the question and there has been um some uh failed attempts to filter the river water you can't do it it won't work it's too much sediment yeah and uh as we're getting towards the end here what i want to do is give everyone about a minute uh to cover anything that they haven't covered that they think is important uh let's start with ozzy uh well what comes to mind is in my food bag in my gallon food bag is each individual food in a small ziploc bag so i can pull that out and i don't have to touch it i literally eat like a horse out of a bag so i don't have to touch it so i don't contaminate it with any missouri bacteria as i go again to avoid getting sick getting anything funky but um train with what you're gonna race with and do it often and and don't don't skimp on that keep it simple i want to just touch on something as he said real quick if river water touches the food as a rule don't eat the food um there's just too much risk even a clean body of water has protozoa has all sorts of things in there that could be problematic so keep that in mind uh jeremy i'm sorry go ahead well i was just gonna because it's a perfect segue to that jeremy and then i'm done my only tip is that exactly what you guys are talking about when you drop something in the bottom of the boat if you've never done this race before you need to look up the word bilgewater and begin to understand how disgusting the bottom of the boat is going to be so you do need to figure out some little tray that you can kind of or some system that you can keep your food where it's not falling in the bottom of the boat because if it does then you're never you yeah just yeah wait you do the race you'll know exactly what i'm talking about so sorry jeremy no no the the water in the bottom of my boat is far dirtier than any missouri river water could ever be absolutely um no i i agree with what i think uh brian and alma are going to say i agree with what ozzie just said um it's all about practicing ahead of time it's all about knowing before you get there what works for you and what doesn't and the only way to do that is to train well in advance remember that just the way you train every other system in your body to be able to paddle 340 miles you've got to train your gut you've got a train for the nutrition you've got to prepare for the foods and you don't want there to be any unknowns because it's about making sure that things don't go wrong and the way to do that is to practice and i'll throw in one more plug for finding a great coach or a great nutritionist who can help you because there are people that make their livings their whole lives are based around this we have one of them on this call and they're available to help us and it's you know we would hire someone to help us learn to ski or we'd hire someone to you know help us learn to skydive or whatever we might as well take the time if we're invested in a race like this you know hire somebody to help you figure this stuff out too and i'm gonna i i will get to uh the hopkins in a second a question just popped up from peter um how do you balance weight loss versus training nutrition he's at 195 5 foot 10. planning to do stand-up paddleboard he's trying to get down to 165 or 170 by race time uh alma i think that's right up your alley sure actually take advantage that um you are uh gonna be training for this race because a lot of people need that physical activity to help with the uh get to your goal so that and um i would say it doesn't hurt especially the early part of the season to uh you know have a lower calorie diet but i don't mean like crazy um yeah you can restrict your calories and um i'll be happy to work with you if you need some help um so um but it's possible and a lot of people actually uh just lose weight just because of this event uh and if nothing else just think about how many calories you've burned by the end of the race it's kicks you off to a new level transformation you're ready you started it and you're moving on to bigger better things after this and so um so it takes planning and you know i'm happy to help you if that's what you need all right and then uh hopkins is hopkins uh do you have anything to add uh yeah i think you've heard it's especially if this is your first race so you probably heard a lot of tips a lot of great advice so um uh you if you are needing a uh a resource uh the notes that uh jeremy provided of actual sample what he ate will help you and also uh my three page uh simplified in a snap uh guidelines for training for this race will help you and for those of you who actually need more and you're interested because you want to be just as competitive as these people on the panel so this is a wonderful uh source endurance supports nutrition um by registered dietitian suzanne everly um gerard everly that is and i do cite that in my handout so i think she's now on her third edition this is the second edition so you can find that on amazon it's a shipped to you in a matter of days so there's a little bit of everything for everybody all right uh fantastic thank you panel uh for the hard work for getting together on a beautiful saturday afternoon uh i will be posting this on the 340 paddler uh youtube channel i will include a link to alma's handout i will include jeremy's uh diet plan or jeremy's uh nutrition for the race thank you i i will include a link to that and uh that should take care of it the next session will actually be on a monday to avoid training problems so our next session will be on uh primarily health but we may also deal with some hydration on monday april 19th at 6 30 pm uh i don't have the panelists laid out yet but we will have that sorted out very shortly here if you happen to be a doctor or nurse in the 340 let me know because it would be fantastic tom sleeva i'm looking at you even though you aren't looking back because you're probably at work um otherwise thank you for joining us and as always keep your paddle in the water", "6zRRn6RqKkY": "[Music] hi what's up guys colder months fish start to really slow down and this is what I really like to start using cents on my baits especially those finesse baits that we're gonna be using so much during these cold seasons so without putting a cent on the bait does is a three different things first it masks the sense that you run into you know when you're filling up your boat you spill gasoline all over yourself oil from the oil things I just you know little sunscreen you know who knows what you're scratching I know you keep scratching you but you know who you are anyway so that's the first things that masks our terrible sense but the second thing is it creates a bait trail so this thing has a bunch of scent on it and I'm hopping along the bottom these fish they're not very active this time of year a lot of times they'll track that bait they'll look at it'll nose down on it and that little scent trail they'll smell and taste that and they'll be more likely to bite it and then that brings us to our third advantage of using sense is when they do bite it it is proven that they will hold on to something that is naturally scented longer than something that is not scented so you have more time you know what cold as well and we take a little bit more time to actually react and set that hook and you're gonna get a little bit more time when you actually have those sense when I'm spraying on anything there's there's different stuff there's bus bang spray that it's very easy to apply and then there's these kind of gels that stay on very well except for they also stay on your hands very well and they it's disgusting so I always make sure carry a towel around one last thing is I always try to match my scent for what I'm trying to mimic so for instance this would be a crawdad I was trying to mimic so I would use a crawdad scent likewise when I'm trying to mimic those dying radmann with those little drop shot dates and stuff I'm gonna spray out some kind of shadowing on it anyway guys hopefully this helps if you would like to see any tips leave a comment in the comment section of what you would like to see me do it on anyway I'm Travis lucky tackle box [Music]", "QRtGYgYZVGQ": "what's going on party people welcome back to the channel today we're taking a look at a brand spankin new pre-built desktop PC that just launched today if you're watching this video on the day of upload it retails for $3500 and it's aimed at serious content creators but it can also game and stream and do pretty much anything else under the Sun I don't even know what it looks like it's still in its box all pristine I haven't seen any pictures of it so we're gonna unbox it together today and take a closer look at it to find out if it's actually worth the hefty price tag without further ado ladies and gentlemen I'm excited to introduce to you [Music] the NZXT creator PC it's a little slow can we start that intro over alright we're gonna talk in unbox here it might be a little hairy at times but just bear with me so for starters if you order one of these suckers before 11 a.m. Pacific Standard Time it will ship out the very same day and if you opt for overnight shipping it'll actually get to your place the next day so pretty much unless there's like a Micro Center near your place or another store where you can buy all the PC parts you need this is probably one of the fastest ways you could get a system of this caliber up and running in your house the other nice thing is that NZXT is completely waived the $99 BLD fee that they usually tack on with their existing BLD systems so you're only paying for the parts themselves you're not paying a company to build the system for you NZXT is only making money on these things by bundling their hardware into the systems instead of tacking on an additional fee for the customer for example the h 510 elite is the chassis that ships with this system now this comes in black or white you get to choose on checkout looks like they've sent us the white version alright give me a second here all right by the way guys this video is not sponsored in any way I don't even keep this unit there they're taking it back after I'm done with the video so I am NOT obligated to say anything nice about this system if I don't want to in fact I should probably probably say something negative right now just to prove my point like look at this look at this packaging this is I hate this shade of gray stupid now you guys probably want to know what the specs are so I'm just gonna go ahead and rattle it off really quick and then we'll talk about it more in detail when we get it out of the box we've got a 9900 kay that's a core I 9 processor from Intel their current flagship coffee like CPU 64 gigs of DDR 4 I'm not sure what speed it's probably 3200 I would assume we have a Z 390 motherboard and an RT X xx atti Windows 10 Pro 64-bit included all right the lovely H 510 elite in the flesh let's go ahead and pop the side panel off I really dig the one thumb screw coolest design insta pack packaging ensures a safe delivery in and out here oh hello there come on buddy whoa that's actually pretty slick yeah this is probably one of the nicer looking BLD pre belts that I've seen it looks like we do have a Kraken a Kraken X I'm gonna say that's an X 62 that's a 280 baby as basically very nice top-performing liquid a oh they're courtesy of NZXT this is NZXT motherboard as well this is the n7z 390 it's a very stylish board NZXT did a fantastic job of branding it because at its core it's an ECS board that's the board maker I've actually never worked with this board personally the only NZXT board I've ever gotten hands-on time with was the Z 270 model and I remember the BIOS on that board not being the greatest it was a little bit clunky it wasn't super intuitive and it was even unstable at times so I can't speak to this board but I will say if you're planning on buying this system do a little research on this board to make sure that the BIOS is now a little updated it's a bit more refined especially if you plan to dive into the BIOS and tweak settings and things like that let's pop out one of these memory modules take a closer look at these t4 stems from teen group these are their delta r sticks i believe yes delta r okay they're actually 3,000 speed which is perfectly fine for intel test latency isn't the greatest at 16 18 and 38 but I'm sure it's not super detrimental or anything last thing I'll point out here is that these are 16 gigabyte stick so again 64 gigs of DDR 4 in total before we actually continue I kind of want to plug this guy in power it on just so we can see what it looks like all booted while we're talking about it might be a bit more visually interesting Hey look it turned on it turned on out of the box it's already better than a Walmart PC RGB lighting oh so beautiful well let's talk about the GPU shall we because I can't ignore this beast anymore this is the asus rog Strix r-tx 2080 TI i believe this is the OC gaming model we've got 11 gigs of VRAM onboard and it's just an absolutely beautiful card extremely cool extremely quiet and ridiculously powerful I mean this thing's basically a gamers wet dream it's like name your resolution and frame rate and it'll pretty much do it unless you're talking 4k 144 Hertz then you might need two of them but mostly everything under that this thing will chew right through and we've got the fastest gaming CPU on the market right now along with the fastest gaming centric GPU so this thing can definitely tear up some frames now something you probably already saw this guy lurking in the background just above the GPU we have a one terabyte WD black SN 750 nvme PCIe gen3 because we don't have gen for support on Z 390 of course m2 SSD it's got that really nice-looking heatsink on it extremely fast up to 3500 megabytes per second read we also have a mechanical drive there's a four terabyte WD blue that's hiding underneath this power supply shroud but it's only 5400 rpm I don't know why they didn't opt for 7200 at the very least so that that kind of bugs me it should have been 7200 from the get-go but all in all you do have five terabytes of storage on board now a little side note here while five terabytes of internal storage is plenty for most users a lot of content creators need to take their footage on-the-go or transfer files between systems on a regular basis so NZXT has thought of that and they're allowing customers to add this on to their purchase at checkout this is a WD black p10 mechanical hard drive comes in two four and eight terabyte capacities and it has a rugged looking metal enclosure that serves as a passive heatsink so your drive doesn't get too hot sorry for the tangent they just sent it over with the system so I figured I would mention it really quick you can't really see the power supply too well but we are getting an EVGA 750 watt g3 very reliable unit 80 plus gold modular design it does have black cables so no ketchup and mustard which is a huge plus having said that can we start adding sleeved extensions to these builds that cost several thousand dollars I know it's probably a little nitpick thing but I think it's important I think it's important that when someone spends thirty five hundred dollars on a system that it looks like it could be on the CES show floor and no build on the CES show floor that's actually there to look pretty or impressed has stock power supply cables so I just feel for the money I mean you can get a kit for roughly thirty bucks and that little bit just goes such a long way in terms of aesthetics and making the customer really feel like they got a premium product just one man's opinion apart from that we have a pair of very lovely a or to RGB fans these are 140 millimeters it'd look really nice through the tempered glass front panel and we also have two 120 millimeter fans at the rear and top of the case exhausting hot air so it looks like there's a really good airflow path coming through here at first glance I have no reason to suspect that anything in the system would overheat or thermal throttle in any way it looks like there's plenty of airflow and CFM going through the chassis but as they say trust but verify all right I've been running doom at 4k for 15 minutes now just enough to get the GPU completely heat soak both our CPU and video card are running completely stock and you can see right here at around we're getting around 1800 s sometimes topping 1900 megahertz on the GPU core clock and at that speed we're seeing roughly just under 70 degrees Celsius so very cool nothing to be alarmed their CPU isn't being fully utilized right now but we're still getting around 50 degrees C which is fantastic as you might expect frame rate is looking really strong as well now I've got a cos real bench that's been running for roughly five minutes just to give you guys a quick snapshot of CPU temperatures real bench is like a suite of mini tests that just kind of work in the background it does all kinds of things encoding image editing and so forth and it taxes your CPU anywhere from one to a hundred percent you can see it's doing some stuff in the background right now but we have already done a couple tests where the CPU was at 100% utilization and at that point the hottest we got was 78 C which is still very much within t.j.maxx that's perfectly fine operating temperatures obviously things are subject to change if you're gonna try to try your hand at overclocking but the way things are looking right now I would say this thing could definitely handle say a five gigahertz overclock on all cores if you wanted to squeeze even more performance out of this thing now for the price the system is obviously not for everyone but at the same time not everyone needs a ninety nine hundred K 64 gigs of ram in an RT X xx atti this is really reserved for a special type of serious content creator who doesn't want their creative vision to be hindered by a technical bottleneck and in that sense I think NZXT is put together a pretty good rig that does exactly that like I pointed out this thing isn't perfect right it's got a couple of shortcomings like a 5400 rpm Drive a motherboard that I'm not 100% sure about and some aesthetic touches that could have easily been thrown in now if you're not a content creator but you're still considering buying this thing for gaming don't do not buy this for gaming you don't need 64 gigs of memory for gaming you also probably don't need a 4 terabyte drive and a one terabyte SSD I mean maybe you need those things but chances are you can build a system that's better tailored for your needs that's gonna save you some money because as its configured now the system is way overkill for a gaming rig if your needs veer more on the professional spectrum and you've got the coin to spend this is definitely a solid option if you are looking for a prebuilt something that already comes preassembled you don't have to worry picking out the parts and you're interested in having one company to go to should anything go wrong you just kind of want a one and done solution I would say the system is worth your consideration I don't know you guys let me know what you think about this thing especially you content creators out there does this tick all the boxes for you for what you need in terms of performance features budget and all that stuff let me know down below I'm very curious to hear your thoughts on it but thank you so much

whole lot of boat traffic hope you had a good 4th of July I didn't film any videos over the fourth weekend I just took a break I did go fishing but I didn't I didn't film any it was nice to just relax for a little bit but now we're back we're back and you might recognize this Lake I did the couple different videos on it it's find the how to find crappie both post spawn and then just on a new lake and I kind of wanted to do how to locate crappie for the summer because it's just I'm just patterning these crappie as they move from their spawning grounds right right over here post spawn they were kind of right off this point and it might still be in there but I'm guessing they moved out to deeper water so we're gonna try to find them out there and today we're fishing with live minnows those guys right there got a bunch of them live minnows and slip bobbers let's go okay we're rolling all right well I found a I moved out from where I was catching a post ball and I was catching him 12 12 13 feet on this lake during post pond season which was about that's almost a month ago now since I've been on this lake it's early July right now they're definitely in their summer mode I mean 16 feet of water here right there bunch of deep weed lines throughout this entire Bay and we're gonna fish with minnows today I got a I picked something up because I got tired of you know I'll show you in a second but it's pretty cool new this new minnow strainer I got so easy to grab minnows now but oh I'll use a big fan or to show you that in a little bit here let's catch them fist first and this is the same setup I had as my how to tie a slip bobber part two I'm gonna hook the minnows through the back I already voted one crappie to be perfectly honest with you and they're suspended up the water column gonna run over my buoy but I do have to move the bobber I can't just let it sit it's pretty pretty calm today and it's very hot so he's supposed to get up to like 90 degrees today I think I shouldn't complain though I've I've been talking to guys fishing down in Florida Alabama Texas and they said it's absolutely miserable down there so I should not complain about 90 degrees when I know some of you efficient in like 120 than whatever but let's talk about how to locate these summer crappie that's what this video is I wanted to do for this video anyway I'll throw some maps up and stuff for you guys to look at but basically this is the same this is the same exact spot that I did be how to locate post spawn crappie and how to find crappie on a new Lake and all I did is I started to where I was fighting on post bond which is right out here just to the other side of this dock and that's about 1213 feet of water and I just kind of trolled around kept pushing out to deeper water and with deeper water weed lines until I saw some marks this is actually tore we're getting towards the point of that percentage triangle here the the point would probably be I don't know if you guys can see this this little diving barge right here the point will probably be right about there because then it drops into that 25 25 plus I think almost 30 feet of water just outside that where there's diving barges and these these crappie are gonna move either right where I am now where I've been catching them but if there's bass let's start moving in here they're gonna push out to the middle of this Bay the middle of this Bay is probably about 20 feet deep I think and they'll just push out there and suspend for safety but right now there's apparently no pressure because this is where I've been catching them or I caught two already of course now that I'm rolling with the camera I'm probably not gonna catch anything isn't that how it always goes well I got my stolen so I had to hook this guy back up winds starting to pick up a little bit that's good I needed a little bit of wind it's harder than heck right now there is a fish there we go finally what's a good crappie - that's a good fish yes that's a really good crappie I'm thinking that's a 12 no stay on here stay on here buddy he's barely hooked yes that is a nice crappie boom this guy he's just shy of 13 that is a slab forgot to turn you on but 13 13 inch slab live minnows boom that last one was a good crappie 13 inch crappie wowit's that might be the biggest I caught so far this year that was a slab right there hopefully there's a big school of them down there that would be fun to catch good old live minnows and bobbers I got the bobber set about I don't know eight feet down maybe seven feet and there that guy was actually shallower than I thought he was probably in 10 feet of water which seems strange but water temps 70 76 right now I don't know I thought they'd be deeper the other two I caught were deeper I did have to move it though there's there's just barely enough wind to kind of make this bobber wobble like it's supposed to but I'm thinking today I'm tied on a like a stick bobber smaller profile that way I could tell for negative bites cuz that one's actually a negative bite the bot this bomber actually kind of rose up higher in the water oh my god I got a fish huh yep wow this is such a soft bite he's not a big one he's probably nine and a half bigger than the ones I was catching on that how did I slip over that Lake I don't know that Lake went to crap real quick there's a bunch of 8-inch fish on that Lake this is probably I'm gonna get some 9 I should get the bump for it out so you guys can see but he's a he's about a nine and a half nine and a half inch fish I'm gonna throw him back though I'm gonna water all right so just do that 9 inch crappie back I pulled out the bump board so you guys can actually see measuring I'll remesh earth at big one for you some so you guys know it's 13 13 inches but I wanted to talk about cuz I know this questions probably gonna come up on the percentage triangle especially probably this video when I showed the percentage triangle think of the in the finding property on a new lake which is actually this lake that I'm on right now I I I kind of showed where the crappie were gonna be in that that middle part of that triangle but I think I said in that video or it was in the post pond video don't pass up brush piles you know deeper weeds that may be outside of that this is actually a pretty good example this this entire Bay goes down to about 20 feet and then comes back up but there's deeper weeds throughout this entire Bay and if the water tends to get really really warm and let's say they get above 80 degrees for for us in the north for us in the northern states 80 degree water that's it's pretty warm for our fish they're gonna push out into deeper water and that's gonna be outside of this percentage triangle so I guess you kind of got to be smart about it in how you use this it's a great way to I guess locate that first pool of fish but obviously conditions can change sometimes and on the other end of this lake there's some brush piles and there they put these brush piles kind of like on a Midlake hump so it's I think it's like thirty to five to forty feet all around this this little hump and the hump comes up to about I want to say it's like 15 to 20 feet and so they drop some man-made brush piles down they're not just for crappie but for walleye and and muskie either some muskie there's pretty good muskie in this lake but it's not even close to where you'd think I guess this percentage triangle would tell you there fish there would be fish there so when in the summertime like this don't pass up any brush piles because I'm gonna I'm gonna actually go through a different video and there's been some reviewer requests of what do crappie look like on sonar that's gonna be one video what do how to find brush piles that's gonna be a separate video but that that how to find brush piles video sometimes they these man-made ones they don't put them exactly where crappie would naturally locate it in terms of you know going through pre spawn spawn post spawn summer months you know sometimes they just put them where they're convenient on the lake to get to so don't pass them a brush pile if if there's weed beds or something close that could hold fish come on crappie where are you there he is oh no he took it alright one more fish on these live minnows it's getting a little late in the day I'll show you that 13 inch fish and then I'll kind of wrap up talking through locating these summer crappie oh there he is got him that time got him that time whatever it is it's a good fish it's a decent-sized crappie I'm gonna guess it might be an 11 inch er stay on buddy I need you to stay on oh yes there we go that's a good one to end it on right there I got I pulled the board out just for you guys well see here - nose oh he's he's just on the 11:00 mark well that's a nice 11 inch fish - to finish out this live meadow to finish out this live minnow how to locate summer crappie all right I'm gonna show you the the minnow carrier that I just bought that's awesome in one second all right don't mind the sweat on the hat it's just really warm out so I wanted to show you this this new minnow carrier that I bought this is so much easier to put minnows in the boat I'm sure some of you already have one of these but I saw a video of John feelin for those you don't know he's professional fisherman but he also does a lot of stuff with Lindy tackle and he was actually spawn fish crappie fishing for spawning crappie and he was waiting in the water he had this strainer let's get it out right here all right so this is the strainer he had and I picked it up off of Amazon I'll put a link in the description below if you guys want to check it out but it's so lightweight I just throw it over the side and one pick up and all the water drains out I used to just use this which is a little heavier duty but in the summer time I see a lot of you crop a lot of guys throw their minnows in the cooler that they have with them obviously because especially down south temps get really warm and even if you have the minnows over the side of the boat the surface temp of the lake water is just it's too warm to keep them alive so throw them in the cooler if you fill the cooler up or fill one side eight cooler up with ice-cold water ice cubes and some water this is great for it just throw it over the side and then the other thing is when I pick it up all the water drains out and I can easily take the it's hard to do it one-handed but it's dunkers open like that and you can pick your minnows out all right so I apologize for the wind it's wind is starting to pick up all the sudden which whatever so that is that's a 13 inch crappie right there that's a nice fish it's a best fish I got all year so far this lake that I'm on right now apparently has some really nice fish like this so to talk a little bit about finding these summer crop I'm gonna put him back in the Live Well so to talk a little bit about locating these just kind of recap what you should be taking away from this video locating these summer crappie these crappie are gonna be in that middle part of the percentage triangle and also pushed off the edge of that triangle so if there's high pressure of let's say fisherman or predator fish these crappie you're going to suspend a deeper water this is a perfect example so over my left shoulders actually where I was catching them at 12 to 15 feet the first four first fish I caught was about 17 feet a couple others were a little bit shallower there's some thick weeds in there I'm thinking they just they were there for safety and there's not a lot of bass pressuring them I didn't even catch a single bass in here so that's probably why they're a little shallower than where I thought they'd be but the next time I come out here middle July most likely they're gonna be pushed off over my right shoulder in that deeper 20-plus feet of water also because I know a lot of you guys ask about brush piles if you find brush piles that don't make sense of like they're not in that percentage triangle don't pass them up okay fish want cover both for safety and to find food brush piles I mean you got insect larvae growing off of them bait fish come in to feed off that insect larvae and then obviously crappie throw the feed off the bait fish early spring months they feed off the insect larvae as well that's why a lot of guys use grub tails so I hope you learned a little bit about how to locate summer crappie I'll probably be doing a couple of videos on different types of lakes I know there's some lakes that I fish that have bridges on them larger marina stockpiling stuff like that but this is a natural lake it's got deeper weed lines this wind was not here 15 minutes ago but now it's here because I got to film an outro I hope the audio is not too bad I'm talking to talk loud enough so it's over it but I got a feeling it might be bad well unfortunately the the audio because of the wind was was a little too bad for the outro so I hope you enjoyed the video also let me know what you thought about the the coloration of the video obviously this is a different different color frame let me know what you thought about that too much not enough I don't know I just tried something new let me know in the comment section below what you thought of that also so the reason I don't know I have a windshield for the microphone ok I just I need to say that because a lot of you put comments in one of the other videos saying hey just get a windshield I have one I have one of those dead cat ones a big furry not just the little foam ones I mean it's a big furry one and I don't know if it just went back I don't know what happened I ordered a different one it's coming in I might just get the external mic we're like clips on to your to your belts and then records it through bluetooth or something I don't know I don't know what I'm gonna do so I appreciate you kind of sitting through that the the wind I know it was kind of bad it happens sometimes if you like these live bait videos and you want to see more live bait fishing give me a thumbs up more thumbs up I

here with another inventive fishing gear review in this review I'll be taking a look at Eirik baits voodoo shrimp now we got an introductory look at the new models of the Voodoo shrimp last year at ICAST with Ken Chaumont president of Egret baits and we've been fishing with them ever since these are some rugged lures with great action great color and real longevity like other lures in the Egret bait line the Voodoo shrimp is made with an incredibly tough thermoplastic elastomer or a TPE plastic basically this is the same stuff that tennis shoes are made out of so it's really durable and really tough the lures resist tearing making them strenuous not only for bigger to theour fish like Gator trout but also resistant to tearing during short bites or when smaller fish like pen fish or puffer fish grab hold of the tail the voodoo shrimp comes in four models the 3.2 five inch original a larger four inch model a new baby Vudu that's just 2 inches long and the new voodoo rattler which has a kangaroo like pouch and the belly of the lure that holds a small plastic rattle to create a shrimp like popping sound the rattle can also be removed if you don't want all that racket Egret baits also recommends stuffing the pouch with sense like procureur voodoo shrimp sauce the lures come in various color options the Rattler has 14 color selections the baby Vudu has 11 including some really excellent glow colors the original 3.25 inch has 26 color options including a new glow series and the original 4 inch version comes in 8 colors but eager plans to expand this palette so like I said we've been fishing voodoo shrimp quite a bit in the last 9 months and have found them to be incredibly effective inshore baits we've had luck with so many different species ranging from mangrove snapper to snook and of course reds and trout and as a matter of testament to the prowess of this Lou this past January the invented fishing team went on Safari to Hawaii to chase the big bones of Oahu while natural baits like crabs and live shrimp certainly proved to be the most effective baits we use the voodoo shrimp was the only artificial lure we were able to get a bone fish to hit in Hawaii the traveli liked them a lot too look I'm gonna be honest about it I've spent a lot of time researching and fishing with artificial shrimp and you can check out my article in the February 2016 issue of saltwater sportsman for some of my insights about artificial shrimp now in the last few years we've seen what amounts to a revolution in artificial shrimp designs with realistic 3d shrimp and innovations like TP plastics and there's some amazing artificial shrimp lures out there now making it difficult to choose from the menagerie that's available but when it comes down to it they're really only a small number of these that offer anglers effective reliable baits and there's no doubt in my mind that the Voodoo shrimp should be counted among the absolute best artificial shrimp available I consider the Voodoo shrimp part of my first string lineup in tournaments they're dependable potent baits that catch fish they're lifelike design and balanced weighting systems make them enticing for just about any inshore species so in short I really recommend you get your hands on the Voodoo shrimp these are great lures to have I hope you found this review to be useful be sure to

the parent of two alumni uh class of 09 and 11 i forget they're uh been out of college so long they are wonderful bantams as well um and i have for the last 11 years chaired the women's leadership network we started this council rather we started this group as a way to engage alumni with undergraduates and help support their journey and to help support the journey of our alumni and we've grown the group from about 40 people to uh over 700 and if any of you are anyone on this call is interested in joining our group um melissa bronzina reagan is who you should contact and she's going to put her information in the chat um so that you could just reach out to her um the um you know we are an amazing network of women and we zoom has been a silver lining for us because we've been able to reach more people i mean lee is coming from coming to us from denver um we've had women reach out to us as a result of all these zoom offerings that have never attended an event because they live in a remote place not near hartford so this has really been a lot of fun we wanted to tell you that we have two two dates on the calendar coming up right now tuesday march 23rd um we have an event called women's rights across the our globe our alumni at work and there's two women one from saudi arabia i believe and one from mali who are going to be talking about the work that they do and on monday april 26 we're going to have an event called words of wisdom women in leadership and it's a discussion across three generations about the role of leadership in the roles of women and it features one of our members well three of our members but terry roos who is a class of 74 i believe so um she's an amazing woman and it's worth tuning in if you can um tonight i want to introduce lee um we're in the same class together she is an accomplished cookbook author chef public speaker tv personality um and dear friend um her i mean her her bio is so long it's like hard for me to even i couldn't possibly get through it in the amount of time but let's just start that she's start her first dinner party was when she was 16. um and her first cookbook a well-seasoned kitchen she wrote with her mother and her second cookbook which is called fresh taste she published in in 2015. she is uh won so many awards i can barely list them but um what i wanted to really tell you what i know about lee is that the statue of limitations has has classed on this so that i can talk about it uh it could be called hibachi gate in 1978 that would be when cynthia and lee decided they would barter cooking in someone's room that had a cooking facility of course a lot of us lived in dorms with you know it was a big barter deal to have a refrigerator um this is back in the dark ages um and perhaps the hibachi might have been heated up on a wooden uh fire escape i don't know who makes fire escapes that are wood and perhaps the hibachi did burn through said fire escape and they had to come up with another way to cook the steak but anyway she and cynthia loved cooking and lee made it into an incredible career so with that i'm going to turn it over to lee and let's enjoy the evening i'm not going to have my cocktail until afterwards but i can't wait all right well thanks trish thanks and and welcome all my fellow trinity alums to my denver kitchen it's great fun to have you here this evening because that's what i'm all about is making cooking and entertaining easy elegant and fun and you can tell by trish's story i do like fun i'm sure cynthia will probably be putting comments um into the chat she's here this evening for those of you who aren't in the class of 80 and didn't don't know me or cynthia we were put together as freshmen at trinity randomly i was from denver she was from montreal and we're still best friends today so she was my my co-chef when we were starting to want to do dinner parties and things when we were in college as trish said i really started entertaining even in high school i loved having dinner parties i grew up in a household with a mother who was a consummate cooking hostess there were always dinner parties in our house growing up once a week or more and now what i like to do is share all those fabulous things that i learned from my mom and and other chefs and people along the way with you so you can feel comfortable and fun entertaining in your home and i know that's been something that's been very difficult for us but for all of us in the past year but things are getting a little bit better we're going into the summer we're going to be able to start getting together at least with social distance gatherings and one of my favorite things to serve at any cocktail party but especially one during these type of events where you have to stay social distance are these one and two bite appetizers nobody's reaching into a shared chip bowl nobody's having to use the same spreader to put a cheese bread or something on a cracker everybody gets their own little pieces to eat they're also great even when we come out of this hopefully by late summer or the fall they're also really fun to serve in your at your cocktail party because people don't have to put their drink down again to go dip or to spread they can just grab these right off of a plate and eat them they're really delicious and they're really fun so i'm looking forward to sharing the recipes with you as well as some of my tips and techniques and things that i've kind of learned along the way to help you again with that easy component in your kitchen so um if you again i think trish might have said but i can't remember if you have any questions go ahead and put them into the chat everything will go into the chat you can make comments if you can't see anything clearly put it in there what trish is going to do is field all those questions if something needs to really be answered immediately or it's like you can't see something she'll let me know otherwise there's going to be a break for a minute or two between each recipe when i kind of clear out the stuff from one recipe and bring in the ingredients for the end the dish and the and the cookware whatever i need for the next one and then that's when i really have the opportunity to answer a lot of questions i might so if i'm running around my kitchen i can still chat with you it's not a problem um i wanted to introduce to everybody my husband robert who is my assistant and sous chef this evening he will be helping me um he's going to help a little he's the bartender in the household so he's going to help for sure with the drink and then with a few other things so you might see him um bopping in and out we also have two dogs so if you start to hear them he will he he will go and take care of them to make sure they don't disrupt the class so let's get cooking i don't want to go over any more introduction i'll talk a little bit more in detail as we go through but let's start first with the cocktail and there is both a cocktail as you can see in your packets grab your recipe packet pages two and three of the full packet have both the cocktail and then the next page is the mocktail version so if you want to have something that you can also serve that's non-alcoholic the beauty of this is the other than the alcohol part that you substitute with ginger beer the rest of the recipe is the same so it's really easy to kind of make it so you can kind of go both ways depending on who you're having over to your house or what you feel like drinking so um i really love this recipe it's got a really wonderful blend and combination of flavors it's got bourbon in it i'm i'm kind of partial to jack daniels my mother grew up in kentucky bourbon was her drink a little bit more than mine i'm more of a vodka girl but she really loved bourbon and she really loved jack so that's kind of my primary selection for the bourbon you can i do get some questions um about this because there are several people who say oh i'm not really a bourbon person you can make this with rye which is a little bit less sweet so kind of a little bit milder you could also make it with rum you can make it with vodka i have not tried it with gin but it probably would work with that as well it's a really flexible recipe and the main ingredients in it are lemon ginger rosemary um the bourbon that's you know those those are really the primary flavors in this and they really are very flexible flavors and they'll work with any of those liquors so if you're if you're making it along get out your ingredients if you haven't done that already get your glasses ready sometimes somebody asked the question thank you very much for doing that i like to serve it in old-fashioned glasses you won't can't see this because i put the icing already but there is a trinity uh logo on here these are my trinity glasses and now just so you know if you see me looking down over here at this computer this is where i control my camera angles and this handy dandy little thing right here happens to be my iphone that's going to give you a little bit more of a close-up shot so we're going to go like this and so you can see here as well as there so hopefully you'll be able to see everything so if you look at the recipe and you saw in your instructions that um your make-ahead homework was to make a rosemary simple syrup which i already have in here that's simply just honey and water and rosemary cooked together until the honey dissolves and blends in really nicely with the water i usually kind of cook it also till i can kind of smell the rosemary a little bit then you just take that off the heat cover it and just let it steep to really get that rosemary flavor infused through the cocktail and so the rosemary syrup is now in the shaker with the ice and i'm going to add some fresh lemon juice the bourbon and the canton ginger liqueur which is where the ginger flavor comes from and the canton bottle is really you can find it if for those of you that haven't gotten it yet it looks like this it's a very unique shape bottle this is the brand of ginger liqueur i like there's two i only know of the two from france i'm not sure if anybody else is making it this is my preferred one in my sense the one that seems to be more readily available so that's in there and then we're going to put in some bitters if this part all up until here is exactly the same for the mocktail and the cocktail now you can just put in your bitters now if you're making the mocktail i'm using lemon bitters here by the way uh you can also make this with orange bitters which are a little bit easier to find however okay sorry he's got to go take the dog out i had a feeling that might happen but um the orange bitters and most angostera made bitters um have alcohol in them i mean you're only putting in a few drops but there is alcohol so you need to decide if you want to use it these lemon bitters that i found from fee brothers i'll show you up close if i can figure out where to put it um that i found on amazon does not have alcohol so just fyi on that we had a question yes it is a shaker or just a glass with ice you can do a glass with ice but you've got to figure out how you're going to cover it and shake it and i really you don't have to shake this up you could just put it in a glass and stir it the reason i like to really shake it up is because the ice helps crush the rosemary even more and gets even more of the rosemary flavor sorry i was looking at the wrong place it gets even more the rosemary flavor into the drink and so i just think it adds a little bit more but if oops if you don't have the shaker you don't then you can stir it you could um use a muddler actually um you know one of those flat things like you used to make a mojito where you met that you use or you're making a mint julep and use a muddler to mash the mint you could do that so once you shake all that up together then you pour it over ice into your glasses and this kind of a strainer um is what we out robert always uses when he makes his famous martinis which are on my website but and i like to use it for this recipe just because if you the rosemary is still in there and the majority of the rosemary leaves are not going to go into your drink you might get one or two and that's okay but if you try and strain it through the strainer here i find the rosemary gets it blocked up so it kind of doesn't work so well so anyway and then i just like to garnish it with a little sprig of rosemary and a slice of lemon so let me just give it a taste oh yeah that's really good really good and it's really good as a mocktail too instead of the bourbon and the ginger i came up with this thing to use ginger beer i tried it with soda water and i tried it with um tonic water and i tried it with ginger ale and this is the ticket it this it's just amazing it's what a mocktail to me should be which is that it's full of flavor so you don't want to gulp it you want to sip it just like a cocktail and i particularly like this q brand i believe i put that in your packets because their mixers are designed to be mixers so the ginger beer is not really designed to be consumed on its own it's consumed to be in a drink and i just think it works really really well in this okay so why don't you put your questions into the chat and trish can pass those on to me and then i am going to clean this up oh i know one thing i wanted to mention because i get a lot of questions about utens uh sort of kitchen utensils this is what i like to use to juice my lemons and limes and even my oranges one of those because the littler ones fit in here the bigger ones fit in here and you can really get all of the juice out so i wanted to mention that um i just want you to know that doug bennett said that if you don't know what if you don't have a shaker you might not have gone to trinity that would be that silly me why would i think that in the 80s and remember the drinking age was younger so of course we had flasks and shakers that's true we're getting wonderful feedback everyone's really been enjoying the mocktail and i know for one um i really like a good mocktail and um i'm really excited to have one um so i think that you know that that's just kind of just to give you the feedback and i thought i want that we should mention that at the end of this you're going to um give some links to some of this cooking equipment that you use so that people can find it where they find it besides amazon yes well the links all go to amazon but um it's on the last page of the packet and i can go over that at the end i can tell you some other places where i think you can buy those i usually just put the amazon links in since people are coming from all over the country um it's kind of hard but there are some chains that i can talk to you about where you can get some of this stuff okay other um other questions for now uh for now uh no no other questions just um okay great um well actually one other thing is just we everyone attending would like trinity to send them a pair of trinity uh classes aren't they cute i love those glasses i know the last time i went back i'm not sure they had them in that shape but they're a really nice size and a really great glass so hopefully they still have them in the bookstore so anyway now we are going to go on to the mushroom pate recipe and i love this recipe cynthia's going to come up again because i created this recipe a few years ago when cynthia was coming to from boston where she lived then to denver actually to visit her two sons who live here the old of the older of which is my godson but they were she she and her husband tom were coming in and i was having everybody over for dinner and i wanted a new fun appetizer and i had a bunch of mushrooms in my refrigerator and so i ended up creating this recipe and i really i really wanted to introduce it tonight because it's a basic pate that yes in you know postcovid times you can serve it as a dip with with crackers but during you know doing social distancing i'm really trying to stay away from using spreaders as i mentioned earlier and so this recipe really adapts perfectly to work on toasted bread sort of like a toast crostini and i actually kind of got the inspiration for that idea because when i was talking to trish and to melissa about doing this cooking demo they said well you know it's women's history month and i went oh that's interesting well you know let's kind of bring that in and obviously there's a lot of famous women chefs over the years julia child and all the ones everybody knows but one of the ones that's always really resonated with me is alice waters because all those things that we now think are so important in our cooking fresh ingredients local ingredients organic and you know non-processed alice was doing all of that way before anybody else she was really a pioneer but how that ties back to this recipe is when she first opened chapenice one of the most popular appetizers was a mushroom crostini so which happens to be a favorite recipe of mine as well it's different than my pate but it's a really delicious recipe i honestly don't know if it's in her cookbook or not because my chai penis cookbook is in storage but if you want that recipe just let me know you know you can contact me directly on every page of your packet on the bottom is my website and my email address so if you want that recipe email me and i'll send it to you i found it online on a food blogger site so i can send you the link but anyway let's go on to the mushroom recipe um i'm just going to turn this on and i'm going to ask my trusty assistant to come here and get that going for me i'm waiting to have mine until we're done so anyway let's just quickly talk about mushrooms okay so this recipe i like to use cremini mushrooms cremini mushrooms are also known as baby portabellas or baby bellows can you see that best probably if i just leave it there and um and they are they look very similar to a white mushroom basically the spectrum of mushrooms goes from white and then the next step up is the these brown ones the baby bellas or the criminy and cremini i guess that's how you say it and then the the next step up would be a full portobello mushroom the the big ones and so the flavor goes from mild to strongest sort of less earthy to the most earthy so these are kind of in the middle which is why i like them they have a little bit more flavor a little bit more earthiness into the recipe they're probably my favorite mushroom to cook with so and you usually can find them pretty regularly now if i get a lot of questions about how you clean mushrooms and i've gotten into arguments with chefs over the professional uh restaurant chefs over this because a restaurant chef you know there's all this discussion or maybe i don't know if you guys follow a lot of food blogs but there's a lot of discussion about whether or not you wash mushrooms because they're very absorbent and oh it's like oh if you wash them they're going to absorb water and then you know you're going to have a hard time cooking it's not really true if you wash them right before you excuse me right before you cook them then you can certainly rinse them and they're not going to have time to absorb water my personal feeling is i don't feel like i get them very clean when i just run them in put them in a strainer and run them under water so what i like to do is take paper towel and run damp you know get it wet bring it out and then take that and then just very quickly wipe around the heads of the mushrooms and i know it looks a little tedious but it goes really fast and that i mean that's how much time that's all it takes and then if some of the skin is loose you can take it off but i just really find you get that grit out of there i also don't particularly like to use the the stems if you do want to and it's your choice if you do want to use them i really recommend cutting off the end because that can be rubbery but i just sometimes find the stems are chewy so i pull them out and then oh i forgot to show you let me put that one back together again that's one of the ways you can tell if a portobello mushroom is fresh because um you don't want to see the i'm sorry a cremini or a baby bella is fresh you don't want to see those little um dark feathery things that are in there with a full portobello that's not that they're it's different part of its growth cycle but with these you really don't want to see that so that's one of the ways to see if they're fresh so i just pop up the stems and then for you know and then just start chopping it i for this one because i'm going to put them on the crostini i'm going to chop them a little bit finer than just in half and sliced as the standard recipe calls for i'm probably going to cut them into thirds and then just quickly chop them up and then you know remember as you know with mushrooms they're going to shrink up so but i think that's going to be a pretty good size so give me a second now i am going to get the right camera on and then i'm going to move my close-up back over here and take you over to the cooktop here i'm just going to leave you on that camera because all you'd be doing is looking at my back so anyway i have already started this recipe i melted the butter and then put in the chopped garlic and the mushrooms and i've cooked it down as you can see the liquid is pretty much all out of this i did that ahead so now i'm going to go ahead and put in the dry sherry when you cook with sherry i like to use cherry you know a nice cherry but you don't need to go for really expensive stuff but don't go for the super cheap stuff either because it is it you're putting it in to add flavor so you want it to add some nice flavor and really use dry sherry so then now what i'm going to do put in the sherry and the green onions and now i'm just going to stir this around the sherry's just going to layer in some flavor in here a little bit more into the mushrooms the butter started that i'm always a big one in my cooking about layering flavors you saw that a little bit in the cocktail with the rosemary that went right into the simple syrup so instead of just adding rosemary in as a garnish to maybe add some flavor if you really cook it into the syrup it really layers in that flavor really nicely and you get more of that flavor and same you know sherry just goes really really well with mushrooms if you're trying to stay away from alcohol you could probably do this with chicken broth or frankly probably just skip this step if you wanted to but um one question was what is the brand and size of the pan that you're using oh everybody always wants to know that it is um it's all clad limited which is actually a line of all clad that i don't believe they make anymore but they do have all clad limited too and it's a stainless steel saute pan when you see it if you see it it's kind of darker on the outside and then shiny on the inside i'm sure you could probably find it you know this exact pan on ebay but my guess is all cloud still has something similar in one of the other like the limited to line or one of the other ones so now i put in some chopped fresh thyme and now i'm putting in the cream cheese i've cubed up the cream cheese just because it's um a little bit easier to get it to melt and blend in that way and i'm just mixing that in it just adds a nice sort of creaminess to it a little bit slight tang the thyme just brings in a little herbiness it's just a really wonderful flavor of stuff that goes great with mushroom one of the things for the crostini i like to have i'll show you in a minute when we get over to plate this i like crostini that are small and for this recipe i like making them with a baguette and sometimes baguettes can be you know two to three inches or more you know really more like three or four inches which is i just don't like them that big and so i found i mean i know like people like trish in new york who has you know limitless resources can find the right size baguette anywhere in denver and then i spend we spend the majority of our time at our house up in the mountains it's not so easy and so there's a brand available in the kroger grocery stores called la brea bakery and the baguettes come in there and they're small i'll show you i love the size okay so now while i'm finishing um another question what's the heat set in there are you doing this over low medium high like it was on medium until i added the cream cheese and then i turned it down to low and then uh once that cream cheese is completely melted i'm gonna turn the heat off um i put in this a little bit of cayenne and now i'm gonna start adding some lemon juice i get questions sometimes between like well how many tablespoons are in a lemon and um you know it's hard to answer because you know lemons can be this big or they can be this big but the standard rule of thumb in sort of the recipe world is one average lemon equals three tablespoons because that can vary so significantly by lemon size i always recommend starting little like this has got a whole lemon worth of juice in it i put in half and so i always recommend i'm going to turn that off now because the cheese is melted i always recommend putting it in and tasting it and then seeing what you think so at this point now i'm also going to quickly put in some salt and pepper um lee one question came up um are any other ideas uh that you could make this recipe with other than mushrooms oh wow that's an interesting question um let me see with the cream cheese and the sherry and the lemon you know it might be good with crab if you're a a seafood eater or maybe some cooked shrimp um that might be a possibility i don't know i haven't tried it okay so then i just put in some toasted pecans and mixing it together one thing i wanted to mention about the lemon and then i'm going to taste it i'm big on tasting taste taste taste okay perfect i already put in too much lemon if you put in too much lemon don't reach for the sugar before you reach for the sugar reach for the salt and very slowly add more salt um i'm not a chemist maybe somebody else on the call or on the on the zoom is but it's a chemical relationship and so if you get something too tart just add more sugar i mean don't add sugar add more salt you know sometimes if you're making a tomato sauce and you have some really acidic tomatoes and there's almost like a tartness to the sauce and you feel like wow i should add some sugar to this add salt first you'll be amazed just do it slowly so you don't get it too salty at the same time and it works every time um so here are my crostini let's see let's do it this way here are my little crostini i need to get a clean spoon and see how little they are i mean i just love the size of these little labreas they're they're really a two bite and no more than that um little crostini and then to finish this recipe off all you do okay first of all what i really recommend what i like to do is to take this mushroom pate and you know put it like in a in a tupperware or a bowl and cover it and refrigerate it and really let the flavors blend because the you need to really let it sit for a couple hours let that time get infused in there let that sherry get infused in the lemon and really let everything mellow together in a beautiful way and and and let the flavors rest and then i take it out and you just simply put it on the little crostinis like this sorry i'm trying to figure out where the best place is to show you there you go that's a little more um like that and then if you want you can add some time here i don't know what i did with it you can just take some time leaves and you know the best way to really get thyme leaves off quickly the leaves grow up this way take it with it with the leaves going up and then you just pull your fingers down and then you can just scatter some of those on the top you know if you want to put some a bigger piece on there you can even put a twig on there it just makes it really nice and they're super yummy super delicious okay um any other questions about the the mushroom recipe before we go on oh no they want to know the name of the dogs oh karina and tina they're oh they're both looking at me now they're legato romagnolos which are the italian water dogs also known as the truffle hunting dogs in italy so and they're very cute you might get to see them before the end of the evening okay i now am going to move on to the shrimp recipe this shrimp these are called what i call shrimp curry bites this is a new recipe that i created just for my march classes so it's thoroughly one quick question back to them sure um what temperature do you serve them at i serve them at room temperature um i really think works the best okay i love this recipe it um i've been was work i've been working on this recipe for a really really long time and just couldn't really get it right and finally about a month ago i figured out the right combination of flavors and i was quite excited okay let me see let me get you guys far enough away so sorry that was probably making me dizzy all right so one of the things i want to talk about in this recipe before we get going is about shrimp this recipe calls for 12 ounces of cooked shelled deveined shrimp if like me you live in the middle of the country so you're going to be buying your shrimp frozen you need to keep in mind that frozen shrimp weighs more frozen cooked shrimp sorry weighs more than thad cooked shrimp because it ends up with a lot of water in it and so when you thaw it that water goes away when i was setting up for this recipe for tonight i bought a pound of shrimp frozen cooked shelled thawed it and then dried it out and it weighed 13.7 ounces not 16. so excuse me i just realized i need to grab the shrimp i forgot to do that one question on this recipe is um can the shrimp be made without curry yes definitely cool definitely um you know you could probably yeah i mean i'm not even sure i would add something else but yeah you could if you're not if you're not a curry fan um you definitely could so and then i'll speak on the subject of the the shrimp as well once i thought my favorite way to thaw the shrimp is in a colander under kind of tepid running water it doesn't take very long to thaw that way or you can put it in your refrigerator in a colander like on a tray so the water drains off as it thaws but i like to you can see here in the big camera i think put the shrimp on a double layer of paper towel on a pan and just let it let it drain and dry that way and then i'll take another paper towel and pat the top and just let it sit there while i make the rest of the recipe so that it really gets nice and dry because you don't want this to get watery you know and if it sits for any length of time as you know if you've ever made a shrimp sort of a appetizer recipe without getting enough water out it can it can get watery so we don't want that so in the cuisinart what type of curry powder do you use that was another question i um you know it's a good question because there's a lot of different kinds of of curry out there you know because as you know curry is a blend i there's a local spice store in denver called savory spice where i really like to go and and buy my curry and i just try different ones but what i also wanted to show you that i got for making the recipe tonight was this one because i found it at um whole foods and i've seen it at a number of different whole foods you know i go my robert and i travel around the country and do cooking demonstrations on and i do cooking demonstrations on tv and do book signings and stuff so i'm buying ingredients all over the country and i've been able to find this frontier co-op in whole foods in a number of different cities and i happen to think it's a very good blend so it's it's a good one um oh the other thing with curry too good to keep in mind like you'll notice in here um i'm pretty far down in the jar so this has been open for a little bit longer so i might need a little bit more you always need to keep in mind with any of your jarred spices that once you open it when you first open it it's going to be the most fresh the most flavorful the most pungent and then the the longer it sits in there that flavor is going to start to decline so i always tell people to kind of think about that when you're measuring in spices if you just open the jar you might want to start with a little bit less and taste it conversely if you're at the bottom definitely start with what the recipe calls for and see if you don't need to add a little bit more so what's in the cuisinart in here is the cream cheese which i cubed up and put in here with the butter and the mayonnaise and that's already been blended up just to get us a little bit of a head start and so what i'm going to put in next you don't need to mix these ahead i just did this as a time saver but there's the garlic powder and the curry powder in here and if you are a non-garlic lover or you have friends that can eat garlic or don't like garlic you can certainly leave out the powder and throw some chopped fresh salads in here or if they're vampires my husband says but um and so you can just throw some chopped shallots in or just leave it out all together but shallots would go nicely in this too and then in here i have the worcestershire sauce the lemon juice the tabasco what am i forgetting dijon mustard i'm gonna pour all that in there and i'm gonna turn this on add some cranks i'm gonna need to scrape it down a little bit get this going this recipe is one as well that you could serve as a as a dip post covered if you want but again i love it in the bites um you're going to see in a minute that i just like to serve it in those little um um phyllo mini phyllo tart tartlets i guess they're called or tarts that you can buy just in a box in the freezer section at your grocery store if you are doing a recipe that you want to use those tarts for and you're in um it's not all completely mixing together you can probably see that down in there but i'm just going to stir it together because it's it's a little bit by hand because the liquids kind of getting stuck in the middle but one thing if you're going to be doing a recipe with these the little tartlets around the holidays um i would suggest buying them in advance and throwing them in your freezer because i've gotten stuck before where the grocery store runs out so now i put some chopped green onion in there some chopped cilantro if you're not a cilantro person cilantro tastes like soap to you i i don't know if you all know this or not but that's actually genetic you have a certain gene and if you have that gene cilantro tastes like soap so if you have that gene or one of your family members does or a friend does just use parsley uh chopped fresh italian parsley would be just as good in this i'm just gonna i do go ahead and chop the onion and the cilantro ahead of time for this because i found if you don't if you put it in in big hunks by the time the cuisinart is done chopping it you've really kind of over mixed a little bit the rest of the ingredients so i don't like to do that okay so now we're going to take this out just scrape that off um just while you're cooking a couple questions okay where do you get those beaker measuring containers oh these i got uh i didn't put a link in for these they're made by oxo oxo you can get them on amazon i've also seen them at bed bath and beyond but anywhere that they sell that oxo brand you should be able to find them they're my favorite i really love them so i'm going to scrape this out i'm not going to worry too much about getting every single bit out because i'm going to chop the shrimp in here next and then it's all going together in the end i just find that if you try to put the shrimp in here and chop it with everything else everything else just gets over processed so it's better just to do that and just to take that part out and then quickly do the shrimp my husband's asking a question i don't know if you can hear him i purposely didn't give him a mic if cilantro tastes like soap to you how do you know it's so tasty he wants to know he said if so if cilantro tastes like soap to you how do you know what soap tastes like well if you're the generation of me and my classmates it would be if you said something bad as a child you've got to sit with a bar of soap in your mouth but anyway so i have i'm putting the shrimp in here i find that i think medium is the perfect size shrimp for this recipe because it's small enough to chop up quickly but not so much so small that you end up with the shrimp puree because you don't want it too too pureed you want it just you know you still want some hunks of shrimp in there so i just take it oops here we go kind of moving there you go just do this just take some pulses this is going to be really yummy if you live in an area where you actually get to buy um shrimp fresh there's just those of us in this part of the world but they're doing a really good job with the frozen so anyway it's chopped so just so you can really kind of see the consistency in there okay and then honey you can take the cuisinart out of the way thank you i'll bring this over here [Music] and then dump the shrimp that's now sort of picked up any of the sauce that i left in the cuisinart and then you just stir it all together and then you put it in those little filo cups and then if you want you can garnish it with more chopped cilantro or parsley more chopped onion sometimes i find it just almost doesn't even really need a garnish because it's got all these really pretty green uh flecks through it and it's sort of that pretty you know kind of goldeny yellowy slightly grainy curry color with the flecks from the onion and the cilantro already and you've got the little pink pieces of shrimp showing through so it's really pretty so you just stir all that me while you're stirring yep um if someone lives in the denver area and you know wants to find about cooking classes or demonstrations you're doing what's the best way to find you on my website or and or follow me excuse me follow me on social media my brand name i didn't mention that earlier my bad is a well-seasoned kitchen so you'll see again in your packet on every page is my website but there's an event tab in there but i will always also post stuff on facebook for sure and sometimes on instagram if i can figure out how to do that but always on on facebook so here are the little phyllo tartlets i did just um cook these off per the rest of the box instructions so you put them in a i don't know i think it's like a 350 degree oven or something for like four or five minutes just so they get crispy and kind of sometimes get this little tinge of color on them and then you take this oh you salt and pepper it too which um i didn't do but that's okay i'll do it later and then i just take a spoon and kind of fill them in there like that and then like i said if you want you could use some green onion or i just happen to have some chopped cilantro here and then you can just you know sprinkle the little leaves on the top give it a little pop on the plate like that and then serve them and again you can make the shrimp ahead i would recommend again probably making it ahead letting it sit for an hour or two let those flavors really get all nicely blended together i don't know if i mentioned this with the mushroom but usually after i've let something sit i'm you know i do this if you have one of my cookbooks or look at the recipes on my site you'll see me talking about letting things sit a lot because letting those flavors blend i think is really important but then one after you've let it sit you should taste it again and just make sure you know maybe with this one does it need a little more curry powder does it need a little more salt does it need something else and then you can um and then you can adjust it before you serve it and i would serve these also at room temperature i like the mushroom croustats okay so we have one more thing how are we doing on time oh we're not doing too bad okay um and the next one is really actually pretty quick hey lee i was able to put your um your website on uh oh wait bonnie put in i wanted the instagram account so i'm just putting trying to put these things in the chat so i am i'm seasoned kitchen on everything pinterest facebook instagram youtube i might be but it's a little bit trickier to get there because some little girl in taiwan decided she wanted it i don't know why because i own that on every other tick tock i own it on everything except it's i think you have to put something else in there on but anyway if you go to youtube and put in a well-seasoned kitchen or put in lee roper season kitchen you'll go to my page okay the last recipe that we're making is called prosciutto fig and goat cheese tarts this recipe is in my second cookbook fresh tastes it is super easy it is as you can tell with all these recipes because something that's always been pretty important to me is being able to make stuff ahead and all these recipes you can make ahead and this one you have to make ahead because you really need to freeze them before you bake them if you don't actually let's turn this around if you don't um they're gonna blow up out of their little tins so i'll tell you about that in a second okay so prosciutto fig and goat cheese tarts there is this is um a riff on a recipe that's in my first cookbook a well seasoned kitchen called cheddar chutney tarts in terms of that it's the same technique which is your what we're going to do is just take purchased puff pastry you get a sheet out you thought you know it's important to work with puff pastry when it's cool so you thought as i'm sure you know from the box at room temperature 35 40 minutes it should be thawed you're ready to go but if it starts to get too warm while you're working with it or you left it out too long you're going to want to put it back in the refrigerator and chill it up again a little bit because if it gets too warm it gets really stretchy and difficult to work with and you're not going to be happy with the results so that's my tip on puff pastry so this mat i'm using is you have a link to this on the last page in your packet and it's called do easy doe easy and you can get this on amazon here it is there's that's what it looks like see this is how we roll no fuss in a flowery mask because you don't need to use flour with this mat and it comes with these really cool guides so like if you're rolling out cookies and pastry you can put the guides down and then if you need to be one-eighth of an inch thick or a quarter of an inch thick you don't need to worry so it's really cool and then on this side there's guides for the size of your you know how far you want if you want to do 14 inch round 12 inch 9 inch it's all here there's a ruler around the outside so it really makes things easy and i really it's it's and and it doesn't stick actually when you're i'm not going to do it now and i'll show you in a minute but you can actually fold this over and roll here if you're doing pie dough i find it dust still needs a little bit of flour the other thing that i really like and it was so funny when i did one of my first cooking classes and somebody's like what's that thing on your rolling pin well i was raised in a household with a mother who had this on a rolling pin so i just thought everybody did it's like a sleeve and it fits over your rolling pin and again you need minimal flour to keep it from sticking comes off goes in the washing machine i usually have two if i'm doing any gluten-free cooking i'm going to use one i only use it for that even though i wash it and then i have a second one for doing the rest of my cooking so if i've got my gluten-free friends coming over i can be safe for them so and we didn't talk about that earlier by the way remind me i'll come back to gluten free because you can easily do gluten-free versions of the other two recipes this one's a little bit harder but anyway i've already pre-rolled this out um i'd have shrunk a little i had it oh no it's still the right size and um and so you roll it out and then you cut into two inch squares so you can kind of just get your guide up there what i usually do is kind of put it up there and then come down here go over around two inches connect the dots you can get a ruler to help you too and just put a ruler down and then you just cut this into two inch squares just like that that one might be a little bit small some of these might be and if you end up you know you find oh it's not you know maybe cut it a little small you can just pull them like this and get them apart and then what you're going to do is take a mini muffin tin a little bit take a mini i've already done some of these up here but i'll show you down here you take a mini muffin tin you put your little square in there and then you can push it down gently with your fingers like that or you can put it in and then use this which is called a mini pastry tamper and you have a link for this too the pampered chef brand is the one i bought about i don't know 20 years ago 25 years ago and i this is it and i still use it and you can get this exact one on amazon but there's a lot of them that look like this and they're really great to have for when you're putting things in mini muffin tins for a recipe for some mushroom croustats where you do you cut out rounds of bread and the bread is a lot harder to get in there with your hands you can just really push it down with this and get it to stay in there so once you put the little pastries in there then you take a fork you poke it once or twice in the bottom then you're going to take some fig spread this is just the stand this standard dum damasha fig spread that you can get any any major grocery store that i've been in they have it in the deli and there's different brands and different kinds you can play around with it and substitute different things but i really am i really like this particular brand and then you're just going to put a little bit in each one it's the exact measurement remember teaspoon half a teaspoon i don't remember what i put in there and then you're gonna sprinkle some chopped prosciutto you can just get any prosciutto i'm partial to italian getting the italian ones i i find for this recipe though if i go to the deli counter in my grocery store and buy it there i can control how thick they cut it because prosciutto tends to be shaved really thin if you buy it pre-cut which makes it harder to chop so if you go to the deli counter then you can buy slices a little bit thicker and it's a little bit easier to chop up for this recipe i also trim off some of the real fatty ends so somebody doesn't end up with a big hunk of fat and then what i'm doing is putting some goat cheese in here some goat cheese crumbles sprinkling it in i just bought these as crumbles one thing i want to point out to you this is this vermont brand when you're buying crunch like feta cheese blue cheese goat cheese crumbles if you're buying pre-shredded cheese please please please check the ingredients there this does not have it because i bought it but sometimes often there's an ingredient called cellulose cellulose is ground cardboard so obviously the fda has allowed it in small doses but if you eat a lot of cheese and a lot of stuff that's pre-shredded and pre-crumbled just you're eating a lot of ground cardboard which can't really be good for you so i recommend staying away from it and it's just a quick scan of the ingredients you you with goat cheese crumbles and feta i've always been able to find ones parmesan cheese is the same i've always been able to find them that don't have the cellulose in them it's harder with grated cheese you might have to grate your own cheese if you eat as much cheese as i do and stay away from that but with the crumbles parmesan romano it's not a problem so anyway once you get these all filled then you freeze this until they're frozen solid and then what i do is usually then just um pop them out of the little thing and put them in a ziploc baggie frozen back in my freezer and then they're ready to go you can make them up to two months before your party excuse me and they're ready to go you take them back out of the baggie put them back in the tins and bake them when they're frozen and i mean they can throw a little while the oven's preheating but you don't want to thaw them too much because if you cook these when they're not frozen the insides can kind of blow up you know that the pastry puffs too much and it sort of blows everything out and it kind of runs all over the pan it makes a mess doesn't look very pretty and so speaking of looking pretty when they are okay let me see now i have to get back to my zoom i'm just going to share my screen okay that's what they look like when they're cooked so they're just really pretty they're you know they're they're a little puffy they've got some wonderful flavors going on between the you know just between the prosciutto and the and the cheese the tang of the cheese and the the sweetness of the fig and it just really blends together and it's really um super fun uh super fun flavors and super fun to serve and looks pretty on the plate all those things that were important to my mom and are important to me too okay um trish are there questions before i go on the last few things just some comments oh mainly because the comments are we love all the fun facts you know you know me personally i love the cilantro fact because my husband hates it and i really love to know one average lemon is about three tablespoons because i'm too lazy to squeeze it into the to the spoon i'm a guesstimator i'm a home cook guesstimator and yeah and i love knowing that fact good good i'm glad you're welcome so on page eight oh here let me get rid of this i don't you don't need two screens now i'm just gonna be talking unless you ask me a question i need to show you one other one question that came up is um any other tips for drinks to go along with these appetizers you know i was thinking about this on my website is my family's um and well really my adaptation of my mother's family's mint julep recipe which is um you'll see a lot of similarity it has a simple syrup that i that's the difference my mom's family recipe what i added in is i put a mint infused simple syrup in there to make into it but that would also go in this my husband's manhattan recipe which is i think on the website it's in my cookbook fresh taste i'm pretty sure i put it on the website and his martini recipe which is on the website would go really well with these um i think a rum most rum drinks would go too i think would really blend well with these recipes so on page eight of your packet are some other ideas for one and two bite appetizers i'm going to share my screen again this um and these are just some things that you can quickly do for you know one and two bite or social distance i really should say they're not necessarily one and two but ideas for serving orders appetizers and you can see them in the picture one is you just take a little small plastic or glass these little ones that you see in the photo are plastic they come from party city but you can get little glass ones i've seen a ton of them at bed bath and just put you know fill it half three quarters full with your favorite veggie dip recipe or ranch dressing ranch dip something and then just put spears of fresh vegetables in there you can do like in the picture that's red pepper and celery and carrot and you can do a little piece of asparagus whatever you want another one up here on the top is a dessert one so if you want to put out something sweet same idea but just put like that's a parfait of um pound cake and a strawberry salsa you can do chocolate mousse in there you can do shot glasses with your you know favorite soups in them i've done both hot and cold works the best kind of with pureed or quasi-pureed soups so and then if you want to serve a dip you really want to serve like a dip that goes with crackers just put together little individual plates if you're doing a smaller social distance gathering you know maybe you're going to have four friends over have a small plate for each one or if you're having four couples do like a shared plate for each couple i find a charger plate is the perfect size for sort of a shared couple thing especially if you're doing like a cheese and prosciutto plate so there's a lot of ways that you can do this and really keep it so that people are safe and comfortable on the page nine of your packet i promised in the description for the class that i would talk to you about um how to make menus work for appetizers how much food to plan for how you know how many portions all of that and it's it's not an exact science but i explain it all on this page with some of my other tips so how you put together a menu so like how what i was thinking about when i was putting these three hors d'oeuvres together and this applies also most of what's on here would also apply if you're doing a dinner party menu and then the last page is where you have links to the different places to buy the various uh products that i talked about the only one i didn't talk about was the garlic press which i'll just quickly um mention let me stop sharing my screen so you can see um i like this i like these ones and there are several different brands i think i link to one because they're really easy to use and easy to clean see how that comes completely apart so when you do the press put the garlic in there and then you push it but then it just flips out so it's super easy to clean and i did a link to one of the brands there are there's a page on my website that link that has all of my favorite kitchen tools on it actually i'm going to put those oxo beakers on there because i realized i don't think they're on there but you can go on there and get all of these as well every like i said everything links to amazon just because nationally that's the easiest way to do it bed bath and beyond is a really good resource for a lot of these things so is surla table or william sonoma either online or in the stores but any of those major chains would also be a good place to go and then just on the bottom of that page i put links to where you can buy my cookbooks so if you're interested um amazon barnes and noble usually have always have both indiebound.org is a site that promotes all the independent bookstores around the country so you can go in there those books i have no idea who this is all handled through my distributor so i have no idea whoever has inventory but any of these links should take you to somebody who could order the book if they don't have it the only one i check regularly honestly is amazon and they usually always have both books so anyway that is the end of my presentation i'm sorry only 10 minutes over that wasn't too bad so anyway what other questions do you have wait it's mainly like everyone's saying how much they enjoyed it that they love a couple of people are already fans they own your cookbooks oh oh yeah and um they said it was educational and a lot of fun and i want to thank you on behalf of the women's leadership council and trinity for um agreeing to give your time to do this wonderful event what how great and and inspirational and we can't thank you enough um i want to say to every other participants that you're going to receive an email tomorrow with a post event survey this is um important uh for the college and metrics you know so if you wouldn't mind filling it out and giving us a positive rating we'd appreciate it um and we're putting some stuff in the chat about um uh the women's leadership council facebook page and a hopefully instagram page and we hope that you can you'll look on social media to find out about our upcoming events and we hope that you'll come to more of our events and um just everyone's just you know on cloud nine thank you so much lee i can't thank you enough i mean again thanks thanks i'm

i've got fresh burger if you guys are new to the channel if you guys don't know fresh burger it's my family's business we only serve burgers and fries very simple menu so let me show you guys what i've got i've got a double burger comes with lettuce tomato cheese sauce onions and pickles i've also got a second double burger but dressed only with caramelized onions cheese and sauce i've also got fries i added cajun on it we don't normally add cajun on it i've also got a canadian poutine i trained um back and um yeah just back no arms no nothing just back and cardio so this is my post workout meal so i'm just gonna go so hard on this i hope you guys do enjoy this video if you guys do enjoy it drop a like subscribe if you're new and let's get all this food in my belly dye pepsi the fries are fresh cut and extremely crispy and soft on the inside let's start with the only cheese only caramelized onions and sauce look at that nice crust caramelized onions are well caramelized mmm it's so soft i'm reacting to this like i've never had it before ugh the caramel's onions are really nicely sweetened really nice that doesn't i don't think that made sense it's sweet but the saltiness from the burger our menu is super simple we only have one burger one burger four different sizes that's how simple our menu is we don't have chicken burgers we don't have uh vegan burgers i was hungry i still am so there's the poutine that cheese pull you guys of that poutine you're probably asking about martin what is a poutine a poutine is a canadian staple it's not like a main dish it's like a side so like you get a burger and you have a poutine on the side instead of fries and a poutine consists of cheese curds gravy and fries that's it um it's like a cheese stuck on my chin hmm surprisingly this is my first time having poutine since i'm back crazy you know why i haven't had poutine because i want to wait to film this so i could have like a very like kind of like a live reaction because i haven't had any humble months hmm so my reaction would have been like oh yes okay that's the oops lettuce like overpowering burger so that's the this is our regular burger so if you were to order a burger from fresh burger this is what it'll look like except without the onions and pickles you could add onions and pickles upon request but this is generally what it looks like red onions red onions on a burger oh i needed that so bad i've been eating pretty fast and uh that diet pepsi oh i was gonna say diet coke we use diet pepsi because we have a deal with diet pepsi so all the burgers come in either four ounce patties or six ounce patties you could double them so like eight ounce and twelve ounces so we started this business like seven years ago uh my dad and i did it together from the beginning we grinded it out until the business started to pick up the business are doing well because we're the only ones in the area so our original location is in richmond hill ontario if you guys don't know richmond hill it's like a suburbs of toronto like the outskirts of toronto that's the main store flagship store uh we don't own it anymore we sold it as a franchise but we have two stores right now that my family owns and they're both in mississauga all of the other stores are all franchised we franchised it out hmm this is our fresh burger sauce we make it and we created it it's pretty much your standard looking sauce that you see at every burger place especially the color everybody puts the same condiments in these sauces so that's why they all look the same hmm i messed up i didn't bring enough napkins mmm i love poutine wow i needed that i needed that drake so bad so sometimes i'll even add cajun to this it's amazing cajun on fries it's pretty fire so i get a lot of comments asking why do i eat the fries last every single time i'm just so used to eating the main dish first so like if the main dish is a burger i'm used to eating the burger first because when i was younger i was always told to eat the main thing first and then you eat the fries so if you're having burgers and fries i was always told to always eat the burger first because if you eat the fries you could potentially get fuller quicker and then you won't be able to eat the main thing not now obviously like i'll eat everything like there's no there's no limit now so so let me know in the comments if you guys would eat a poutine um surprising sauce um this diet pepsi is absolutely saving me right now and i worked out today so i i smashed my back i mean like workout i smashed my back like i didn't like hurt or anything so it was such a nice workout whoa i also get three minutes of cardio no jogging just incline steady speed oh i'm not super full which is crazy before i used to film with bongs i would eat two doubles and a poutine and be extremely full like i was done like i was extremely done now i had two doubles fries and a poutine and i could probably eat another double it's crazy what mukbangs do to you crazy i like eating so i'm not complaining but i hope you guys enjoy this fresh burger video um drop by if you guys are ever in town and we'll catch you guys on to the next one stay safe be well and we'll see you guys in a bit peace", "Gc570QjRxz8": "[Music] [Music] [Music] so set the lotion I would take this small step and chug the route 44 ocean water sonic you are strong okay [Music] Oh [Music] brain freeze chest freeze back freeze oh that's fine it Shuggie these slushies until next time chug in the world one bottle at a time that day it's chug this back", "dFeZva7kLIA": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] okay hey guys um so today i'm gonna be trying out this is this this is a try out i'm gonna do a little chicken fajitas and i'm gonna try this sauce died chili sauce so i'm gonna make this then of course add my seasonings oh i do i just just got this seasoning then onion powder okay so i'm gonna cut the chicken i think i'm gonna make them into like dices so i'm gonna cut them out into like squares so i'm gonna do that yeah okay so i'm gonna show you what i got like the preparation you know how you prep your mouth okay look chicken green peppers red pepper onions and i already put the olive oil in i'm gonna get this on come on okay all righty then let's try this one so we're gonna use this one extent all right yo it i don't know all right ladies so i'm gonna get the oil hot okay i'm gonna let it warm up a little bit so my family's gonna apply put it up high wow that's getting hot i'm gonna put my stuff back put it back we need the seasoning it's popping already all right i think i'm a pass with this the samsung just understand this this is going to be the base and then the onion and then this is onions are hard but i think i'm going to switch it to garlic at heart since this is onion i'm going to twist the garlic because this is onion too so i used to switch and let me use garlic garlic okay i'm gonna put my chicken in front oh i'm gonna do this all right bear with me bury me okay you know what oh what the all the water all right let me turn the fire down because the fire is up high i try to get quick now i'm gonna put the chicken in but i want y'all to i'm gonna do this okay all right i'm gonna just i'm gonna just show you after the phone now i'm gonna i'm gonna throw away another time but i'm gonna put the chicken in so the chicken's in now and i'm gonna put my seasoning in the seasoning is not in yet i must do that right now also got this ready [Music] some seasoning not too much because there's not a lot of chicken so you do not have to put a lot of seasoning because it's not a lot of chicken common sense garlic and harv not the onion i switched out to the garlic because this is onion what but that's last so that's going to be like a fancy okay i'm trying to get a spoon but this is how it's looking so far okay you know flashlight now i just need to find a spoon looking for this like i said it's not a lot of chicken so [Music] i did not put a lot of seasoning in it okay and then this is kind of like the seasoning so you don't need don't need to even put them all right so now i'm gonna put the green pepper onions red pepper yum yum yum let me show y'all now so now it's time to put that in now because i don't like when this gets too cut because when it gets too cooked for a long time it's like mad soggy like mad salty and i like i still like the the taste of this so i'm about to put i it i could show you about i don't know how i'm gonna figure it out i'm gonna figure it out and i love green peppers and all that stuff so even if i put a little bit more of the green pepper onions red pepper i'm gonna still eat it oh this is definitely not a good turned up high so it could get that that brian's face oh my gosh all right so in the meantime put this stuff back i got ah i had got a little bit more seasoning i got this one yeah i know about this one onions i want to try this one cajun seasoning and then i had got i told you about the adobo adobo adobo i just got that and it was one more that i got and i got this one yeah so those are the little quick quick pick-up seasons i got plus the fruit and veggie clean i'm gonna start using it but yeah now this is getting to where it needs to be i'll show y'all okay we're gonna put an egg in here hmm i really think i think yo my phone's gonna get all slippery let me write this off i think i'm gonna put an egg in it a boil egg and i'm not gonna get the i'm not gonna put the yolk in here i think i'm gonna just put the what's the white part called a lot of lighting better now but but yeah i think i'm gonna boil a i'll avoid the egg okay almost done i got my eggs i thought i was gonna make boiled eggs and then not cook the yolk with this i must have put it in there and then i'm gonna show y'all that's different okay and then with the sauce i'm curious to see how this one tastes okay and when chinese people make chicken fried eggs or chicken fried rice they fry the eggs so don't make it seem like oh you care it's a little different to it but i think everything is where i want it to be i know the chicken's done because that chicken is already like kind of pre-cooked um yeah it's already pre-cut oh my god so now this okay we're gonna see all right i'm gonna show y'all why i didn't use all of it now i'm about to kind of this is gonna be okay come on camera okay i'm gonna turn the burner up because this the burner got to be up well okay okay okay okay okay now i just gotta cook i'm turning up turned the burner up all right we don't need no more of this in the fridge oh i'm not even going to use this in no time soon i'm just putting the visuals um so this out it's it's season it's it's getting lit now i'm gonna say that it's getting lit now so when i say it's being lit now that means it's is already made because i'm not making rice that's the macaroni and i'm gonna make some rice with this so let me get the pot again oh let me show y'all come on switch the camera yeah yeah next time we can do a little shrimp a different seasoning different sauce all that you know can i like everything so i'm making rice with it i always make a um rice with a lot of my food i love life i otherwise i'm not gonna make that", "OplTVZWhBgM": "well ladies and gentlemen thank you and welcome back to 340 live uh today we are talking about nutrition and supplements as always i am 340 paddler also known as chris lidke i have seven finishes uh in the 340 and i'm joined by a panel of very well qualified people to speak to nutrition and supplementation first of all we have ashborn ozzy larson known for his ultra running he's done a lot of that before he came into ultra paddling he's got finishes in the 340 and 2018 and 2020. uh then we have the man who could probably replace me because he has a better radio voice than i could ever hope for yes we have the 2019 winner of the 340 or half of the 2019 winning team from uh the 340 jeremy vore coming to us from the u.p of michigan it actually exists i thought it was like wyoming italian for nothing actually exists here it's sort of a space holder but apparently i was wrong and finally we have the man the myth the legend and we have brian hopkins um so uh brian finished the first 340. he took second place uh we won't talk about the fact that he was 20 hours behind west but [Laughter] but he has about eight finishes including in mix tandem man solo tandem and other groups and he is joined by alma who is a uh i'm gonna mess this up a registered dietitian that's right so i has a lot of qualifications when it comes to nutrition so welcome panel uh then just a reminder of how this works we do have the q a section which is open it is available on zoom you can type in your questions i will see them as we're running through things if there's a question very similar to what we're talking about i will bring it up otherwise we will deal with them towards the end uh you can also use the chat feature and if you're on youtube you can use the chat and uh our man in the background steve schneider the happiest man in missouri will help uh move those things over for us otherwise again we are dealing with nutrition and supplementation something that we deal with on a regular basis on the 340. and before we jump into sort of how it works and what's in the food bag i just want to say one of the best things you can do is put together your food bags ahead of time not this far ahead of time this is not a real food bag put a name on it your name if you're self-supported and leaving it by a flag but also for your ground crew the checkpoint where they need to grab it so all they have to think about is where am i what bag am i grabbing and handing to them so sort of organization that'll help you out moving along but let's start at the beginning uh ozzy what is in your food bag in my food bag is is mostly for taste i am one of those that uses a powdered sports drink for pretty much all my race but in my food bag for for a different taste as i go down the river is um gummy worms cheese sets a little bit of beef jerky and dried fruit and and that's pretty much it for every stop and what else are you consuming during the race so i i go with the sports drink that is in my bladder that gives me pretty much all the calorie and all the other nutrition that i need i switched that out i got about six liters with me and switch those out on every stop that i go to okay and jeremy what was your plan what was your food bag uh our food bag was a little different uh because of the temperatures that we were dealing with the very cold temperatures so we we did put a little bit more uh in our food bag from a fat and protein perspective than we typically would but like aussie i drink most of my calories i use either cytomax or tailwind as my primary hydration source and obviously that also has electrolytes and some carbs in it but then i also do a lot of liquid supplementation so i drink perpetuum for some fats and some longer term fuel sources and i do the same with insurer i mix in some insurer like a little old man that needs to drink my meal replacement so i use ensure quite a bit and then just because i enjoy having a little bit of something solid once in a while i usually throw in a protein bar or a cliff bar or something that is more for boredom and interest to make me feel like i'm actually eating a meal but that is my primary primary food bag right there and i know that you had mentioned soups we don't normally eat soups we just did in that case because it was cold and it was a good way to stay warm all right and brian what's your food bag look like mine's changed over time and and the reason i mention that is that um my expectations of how i do in the race has changed over time and that might be useful to some people so now i'm much more like these folks and this is a lot to do with alma helping me as well so in other words a lot of calories coming from liquids etc but prior to that when i was doing the 340 and i wasn't trying to hit the podium um i tried a lot of kind of sports type cliff bars and i found that that kind of stuff gets old really fast and so tried to mix in some other foods as well so i guess i'm not giving you a clear answer i think a lot of it depends on what your goals are in the race if you're trying to be on the podium the kind of diet they describe is is what we've evolved to but if your expectations are to just finish it that's a different um you can do things differently and i'll throw this out to you guys if if i'm a first year paddler coming in what sort of things would i want to do do i want to try and use you know a liquid product throughout do i want real food what are your thoughts for that first year paddler i'm going to give you a non-answer uh my my non-answer is do whatever you've trained for so figure it out way before don't come into the race and think that you can drop in some type of uh you know new nutrition plan the day before it's whatever you've been doing for the past six months because just like we train our muscles and we train our energy delivery systems and we train our cardiovascular system we've got to train our you know our gut and our nutrition system as well so whatever you've trained on is what i would do i think a very key important fundamental is true for anyone who's going to be doing this race and that is understanding the physiology a very simple physiology of what is happening when we are racing down the river and you are racing whether you want to finish in 70 hours or in uh sub 30s if that's going to be possible in the next year or so you never know so anyway um your gut uh the blood going to your gut gets shunted when you exercise it's a normal response when you exercise let alone actually just going for a walk question so the blood is shunted from the gut uh to the muscles to supply oxygen and uh much needed energy and that is what the body needs the muscles are saying i'm exercising here i need some water i need some fuel so the blood is shunted away from the gut about almost as much as 80 percent so that is so important understand that because that means the hamburgers the pizza they're going to be waiting for you at the finish line if you eat that throughout the race you're going to have some gut distress you're going to have some nausea some vomiting some bloating some some big problems so what you're going to be hearing already is that you need to drink your calories so pick a drink now the drink has already been uh the science is already there it's a lot of these sports drinks and i'm just gonna mention some the very popular gatorade which started the whole sports nutrition it's still very valid yes it's hit the mainstream but to be honest with you that that's just their marketing technique that means they're a rich company but it's still a valid source so gatorade and i'm going to recommend gatorade endurance status and powder and you can find that in uh the walmarts out there it um so gatorade endurance um hammerheed um accelerate uh tailwind is very popular now so those are from six to eight percent carbohydrate meaning there's six grams to eight grams carbohydrate in a hundred meals so um the science has already figured it out for you so it's a matter of taste what you wanna try so i would say start simple something that you're accessible to you already started or your friends says i really like it you should try it word of mouth doesn't hurt and experience doesn't hurt either so try that out and as the the point was made very well by jeremy start now don't start later it starts now because he is true to say that you are not only training your muscles but you're also training your gut and it takes really a short time for the gut to adapt about three to five days on your short training days and i'm gonna say as little as two two long training days to uh get your gut used to um your diet and you brought up an interesting point i think everyone here has some experience with it uh let's talk about some of that uh flavor uh what you call flavor exhaustion or flavor uh brian you you know what i'm getting at yeah so flavor fatigue and i think i really want to talk to before we get done talking about that one talk about what aussie does strategically to avoid it but kind of tell you what it is so it's a real simple concept if you're you're getting so sore and worn out during the race that you're essentially getting the flu that's what your body thinks i'm getting sick and it begins to take whatever you're eating and drinking and and associate that with that's making me sick you need to stop that and i had this happen to the point where it almost took me out of the second race i did because um i was using gatorade and um and gatorade has its own issues it's a little too much sugars and we you know that's one of the things we could get into later but the point i'm trying to make is that after about 10 hours just the taste of it just like even putting the valve in my mouth i would involuntarily wretch and i i couldn't touch it i couldn't have any more of it and if my i had to at that time i i had to get water from um as a replacement and then that brings a whole series of issues of like you're not getting calories from your anymore and you have salt issues if you're on plain water so really what i'm saying is be really careful about this idea that you think you can eat the whole thing something the whole time you may have to switch gears and um you know ozzy from his ultra running because it's even more intense in ultra running he has strategies to try to avoid this you want to talk about that yeah so my food bags are just for that purpose so when i come in from the ultra running community it was that was a trick that i learned that every station aid station is to pick a different food whatever it is banana pb j crustable and just eat some of that but i was doing the liquid diet as well but just to make to mess with your body that it doesn't associate just drinking with pain and that kept me going and i that's why that's what my food bags are in the 340s just to trick my brain to go yeah we can still drink this it's gonna be okay and it's worked for me well so far probably the last uh you know five six years when it comes to running but also in kayaking i just do that now because i that's what i used to do in the past so trick in your body is essential in that sense one tip that i would recommend when it comes to flavor fatigue yes uh think about 300 340 miles just never ending so with that your drink gets pretty uh mundane my recommendation for you is to pick two at least two different flavors of your sports strength and save your favorite flavor for the end something for you to look forward to and if you have three flavors that's even better you can do face one face two phase three in simple turns the first hundred miles is your least favorite the next uh 100 miles after that is your second favorite and you're going to finish with your favorite drink and that's going to mentally help you change it up you need every spark that any trick of the trade to keep you going especially at the very end all right and at night it is it takes discipline at night to eat and drink um i at least for me i've never had a 340 where when when i went into the night time i actually enjoy the nights i'm not miserable they're my favorite part of the race but i just stopped eating and drinking it just just doesn't happen and i have to remind myself in fact almost even gone so far as to uh have a timer um to remind us when we have to eat and drink and uh no it's a good point having a timer because yeah you're not really hungry on the race or i don't know how many of you guys actually get hungry and go hey you know what i really could use right now uh so if you're hungry most of you guys use timers ozzy yeah if you're hungry you're too late um i do the same thing i have a timer on it goes off about every 15 minutes it's my key to not only know where i'm at but also take a sip or two of my uh nutrition stuff and and keep going okay so jeremy in there sorry oh no worries uh we did the same thing um drink every 15 minutes and eat something uh or or add something additional like a perpetual or an insurer at the top and the bottom of the hour and our goal my goal personally is to put about 300 to 350 calories into my stomach every hour it's about what i shoot for you bring up two things i want to touch on first of all ensure um i know it's been a lifesaver for me a number of times out there uh how many of you guys have used ensure in the past brian alma jared i've played with it but it just doesn't sit with me so i just stopped and and i should say that the way that i take my perpetuum is just like i can ensure i actually use ensure bottles and a couple of scoops of perpetual and go into that bottle fill it up just to the bottom of the neck shake it up and it's uh you know it's basically taking like a shake i'm not taking perpetuum in a really diluted form i'm taking it in a much more um concentrated form so to understand you would take basically what would be one hour's worth of perpetuum in a bottle real quick as opposed to sucking on it multiple times through the hour i wouldn't say so i'm not taking a full 300 and some calories of just perpetual in one shot i'm trying to get 300 and some calories in over the course of the whole hour so it might be if i'm taking perpetuum at the bottom of the hour it might be 100 calories 125 calories that's one but yeah i'm mixing it thick like a shake in a small bottle you know in a small insure bottle so it's two or three swallows and we even you know in some races we didn't do this in the mr 340 but in some races where things are happening a lot faster we even put corks in instead of putting a cap on so that you can do it one-handed pull it up yank the cork off drink it throw it in the boat keep paddling um so just one or two swallows is all you want so yeah you're touching on it excellent question now is how much that's what i was about to get into that's going to be very individualized but i there's a general rule there is a cap to how much even an elite athlete can take in there we're finding that's about 60 grams you can push the envelope even more so there's some tricks there caffeine is one the fructose in the sports drink is another one but not everyone can take it so hey there's the challenge but anyway okay for for our for our people out there that wants to know okay how much do i take okay um there's a couple general rules that we'll give you is from 25 grams we find out for say the woman the smaller person usually it's the woman to 60 grams in an hour so if just to keep it simple let's just say that's gatorade that's about 16 to 32 ounces in an hour when you are trying when you're starting out you're gonna find that's a big gap so it's very individualized okay so here's the second trick is and i call it the silver lining of our race so what's in silver lining we are going to be very intimate with our urine [Laughter] oh my goodness so uh yeah so you don't want to pee in the boat i guess you could and some racers do uh especially if you're really cutting on time okay there's a topic we don't want to deal too much with but anyway you're going to collect your pe you're going to pour it out every so often right you take advantage of that because you want you the color of your urine to indicate to tell you that you're drinking about the right amount and that you want to see a light yellow color to your urine okay if it's clister crystal clear like water hyponatremia scary no don't go there okay hopefully your support crew will tell you you know you're having those kind of conversations uh let me tell you uh food safety and kosher uh courtesy things go out the door on this race okay there's no washing your hand you're gonna talk about intimate stuff like that are you you know so am i having diarrhea that kind of stuff so but the color of your urine is very important to very dark almost amber then you're not drinking enough so again you're training now you're testing your beverage and you're also seeing how much you're drinking so the very first times you're out there for the new people out race you know getting to train so get a feel for it don't stress out you know go ahead and drink to thirst and then just keep the tabs after your run after your run then um see how much you drink pay attention to how much you you filled your bladder and how much you uh drink keep notes and pay attention to your urine it's you're gonna get to a very good place and uh that's an excellent point and jeremy brought up something too uh how many calories can we actually take in in an hour as as a racer i mean what are we aiming for i think jeremy you said three hundred and fifty or so i shoot 300 to 350 but that's based on a lot of uh personal experimentation and figuring that out as elmo talked about earlier you know blood is removed from our our digestive tract we can't process as much as we normally would we're sweating a lot our blood plasma's down um so just physiologically we can't process a meal every hour the way that we could if we were you know just hanging out in our in our living room so for me 300 to 350 is ideal i know people that can't process more than a couple hundred i know some people that think they can process a lot more than that i don't know how much is actually uh you know making it into their bloodstream but um for me 300 to 350 but that's certainly not what's going to be right for everybody and ozzy i have the same thing i i used in the last year's 340 i used about just over 300 calories an hour as i'm going on the river so that's my plan is to replace that every hour so i um you know taking the calories throughout the hour about 300 calories an hour all day or night oops sorry no you're okay anyway so for for going back to that 25 grams to uh 60 grams an hour so i one thing to a little nutrition for one gram of carbohydrate is four calories so it's going to be for between 100 to um to 300 to 220 calories so 100 to 300 calories just what what you're hearing but again that's a huge difference that's a big difference so again you're gonna have to feel for it um so yeah that's a great point you know one thing that alma pointed out to me when i started getting serious about my time she went through some of the physiology with me and and your calorie intake and everything that we're touching on but i really want to emphasize something that for me was a um it caused a shift in my mentality and i kind of coming back to this idea that you have to be disciplined she pointed out that you are actually expending more calories and and energy than you can possibly take in it's not possible to to um you're losing the fight the entire race in terms of your caloric intake and so if you for me by realizing that i'm already losing a battle then to not eat for three hours at night just because i wasn't in the mood is not acceptable i have to keep the calories coming in because i by the time i get into day two you know i'm already starting to switch to fat burning and you know for me i have a lot of that so that that's a great plan for me but my point i'm trying to make is you're behind the curve the whole time so you have to eat and you have to eat the whole time not just when you feel like it the base best case scenarios when it comes to these endurance rates is that um 70 if you can meet 70 percent by gosh you're gonna do fantastic but it can be anywhere from 50 to 70 percent for many of us you know i would be yeah so it's um that's just what the research shows and it's easier for people who bike and say people like ourselves to kayak because the big mechanics instead is in our favor we're not running and uh jogging our stomachs i'm sure that's something that aussie can attest to that's this particular challenge that runners have to face with that mechanical jarring adds some physical trauma to trying to get keep food down and but we are an advantage with kayaking yet even with that 70 percent is what the research says is the base best case scenario into meeting your calorie needs yeah don't don't run after eating a burrito it's not recommended right but i found out too that um and through my uh through my training um it the better shape that i'm in that i'm in cardiovascular shape the less calories i use per hour down the river which means that that gap the downhill slide that that brian's talking about becomes shorter and smaller so if i have a good cardiovascular system trained up for the race i'm much i'm much better off and nutrition-wise throughout the race i you know brian had mentioned how important it was to eat during those three hours at night when you don't want to um i think that when you're doing something that's this long when you're doing something that is stretching into the 24 32 40 50 60 70 80 hours a lot of it's really about making sure that things don't go wrong you know you you have a plan everything's not going to go perfectly but you've got to make sure that you don't have any crux moments that really go wrong and for me the nutrition is a big part of that if i fall off the nutrition i'm in serious trouble and especially on the and i know we'll talk about this a little later but on the hydration side if you fall off the hydration cliff or you fall off the nutrition cliff that is probably going to be the end of your race and so chris can share our nutrition plan um with you guys i i gave it to him uh also before before this webinar um but we have a checklist so like when i when i take a new food drop i'm giving my empty food drop you know everything i've eaten all the wrappers all the empty containers they're all in a bag that i hand back to my ground crew and they're checking in everything i've eaten to make sure that i'm staying at my calorie target and just like ozzy and alma and brian said you know i've got some variety in my bag when they hand me a bag it's more calories than i need or i think i'm going to need between this drop and the next drop so there is some variety in there so i won't have eaten everything i hope if i've eaten everything something's gone wrong but i hope i haven't eaten everything they're still checking what i have eaten to make sure that i'm on target because if i'm not i need to know either if it's if it's really critical they'll call me or tell me by radio but um you know at the very least let me know at the next drop so it's it really is crucial to stay on plan in terms of the calories in even if you're shifting what you're eating that's okay but you've got to make sure that your calories coming in so much about it can i mention we've mentioned ensure and um there's two distinctions that we need to make to the public right now um what the gatorade the tailwind um cytomax your sports drink that's going to carry for most of the race that's rich in carbohydrates uh and tailwind is 100 carbohydrates so some people love it it works for them um so um [Music] anyway no excuse me all those drinks all those drinks are 100 carbohydrate and they have electrolytes as well what we talked about when we mention ensure and there's other drinks like sports drinks like spits and uh perpetuum okay that is what we call a fluid meal replacement in this case that was created specifically for these kind of races that are multi-day by golly you're gonna and need more calories from let's add some fat here let's add some protein because we're breaking down protein at the very end of this thing so so these companies have basically made these meal replacements and some very wise racer said you know what what's insured if that's already in the market let's use it so that's what you call savvy racer so um so ensure what we're what we're you're hearing people do on this panel is that their sports drinks their carbohydrate sports drinks it carries them for the majority of the race but to make up the difference they'll gulp in some insurer or some spits although some racers can actually train to do most of the beverages from these meal replacements from what i hear the the body's very adaptable the stomach's very adaptable you just gotta train for it um but i i would say start out with uh the uh liquid carbohydrate sport drinks you know i want to add something here that i've i've never done a 340 where at some point in time the nutrition became um was it was more problematic you know i i i got severe nausea or i you know something it doesn't matter about the examples but you also probably ought to have your your support crew have some options not by options i don't mean a bag of pringles i mean there needs to be some things that you could switch gears to and also what would you what would you eat if you were recovering from the flu you know so it'd be liquids and maybe a broth and and some crackers well the broth is problematic but i've gotten through severe bouts of nausea but i hit a checkpoint and i thought i was going to be in trouble and i just limped along with some crackers and just kind of try not overloading my stomach and trying to get hydration going again exactly what jeremy talked about probably started having trouble with my hydration and i came back and so by the time i got to the next checkpoint i was playing the game again so there is this i think you have to kind of some of that stuff you're just going to have to do it in your in your in your pre-training to determine what can you eat what if you eat a can of campbell's soup does it give you massive indigestion and are you an unhappy camper you can have to try it out ahead of time all right and you bring up a couple of good points or we've been kind of touching on them one of the most common reasons that people drop out on day one especially first year paddlers on day one is nausea stomach issues so how do you think we can avoid these let's start with jeremy on this one uh i'll i'll sound a little like a in fact all of us might sound like a little bit of a broken record here but i think at least in in my experience the majority of my nausea issues come back to hydration if i've gone off my hydration and i'm getting dehydrated i have more trouble processing food and processing those calories that are in my gut and i end up not feeling well and you know my stomach goes south my stomach my stomach turns on me but if i can stay hydrated i typically don't have nausea issues and the the really insidious part of that is that it's you know if you miss a meal or two it's fairly easy to recoup those calories and you know start taking calories back in if you bonk you can take a goo packet or something and you'll recover fairly quickly but if you've really gone off your hydration and your stomach's turned and you're dehydrated that's something that can take a day or two to really bring back into balance and that's the end of your race it's all over so um so for me when you say stomach's turning south and feeling nausea it typically is in in my own personal experience a hydration issue whether that is what's happening to racers literally on the first day like before they've hit the first checkpoint i i don't know um i'm not a great person to answer that but hydration and nausea are are really closely tied for me all right uh ozzie or the hopkins yep i've got the same thing i don't i have not experienced much nausea in the past uh because i try to train as a race and i've experienced those in the in the past so then i kind of like oh here's what i got to do different but it's it's back to hydration just like jeremy says it's if you start drinking if you stop taking calories you'll get there eventually okay and uh brian so yeah um i have created a and chris you've already listed it i think on for the listeners but i created a handout uh actually the week before the race there's some best practices in the morning of when the jitters hit you uh how to get the stomach ready for the actual event it's a very exciting time you work really hard for it and believe me everybody's nervous so uh but nervousness means uh your stomach doesn't want anything but you gotta eat and there's the way to do it so um yeah i mean there's a lot of things that can cause nausea uh um um i basically load up in my carbohydrates like a runner would the night before i have a just a good old spaghetti spaghetti and meat sauce uh meal and keep it simple no vegetables low in fiber uh and i'm hydra i'm hydrating the whole week uh probably taking more calories than i plan to on a normal week because what i'm wanting to do i'm saturating my body with fluids wherever i can get it if it means drinking my sports drink that first face sports drink do it um water with lemon you know caffeine tea to a point um but anyway and then carbohydrates too simple to to rice pasta um mashed potatoes easy on the gravy you know cereals bananas uh you are trying to carbohydrate load and also be liberal with your sodium that whole week before too uh unless you are on doctor's advice to watch your sodium but you're gonna sweat out a lot of sodium here so um that is all listed in the hand that i provide that morning up is also very important so uh you can eat up to four hours before the event you might be up anyway but no later than an hour before the race i have something for some of us this is where ensure comes in perfectly okay drink your fluid uh you know for me it's just what works for me is uh oatmeal it works for me you know uh and i put the my whey protein to it and then um so up up from the time do i wake up to the time of the race i am hydrating i'm trying to get 16 ounces of fluid down so i'm trying to super hydrate and yeah it's going to take an extra trip to the bathroom but hey you in the bathroom you're going to be intimate for the whole time so you might as well start that relationship so um yeah and um so and then 15 minutes before the race i'm also still drinking um and that you're going to keep your body keep by the time your your your uh the the bell rings so and you're off so um the thing about the jitters how to deal with the jitters so light as i mentioned just low fiber foods uh easy to digest carbohydrate foods um yeah a protein that you can handle that sounds good to you but um caffeine in the morning for it may add the extra jitters but you're someone who needs the caffeine see again it's very individualized so uh if you got the if you tend to have loose stools i would stay away from caffeine and consider imodium okay if if the nerves really hit you and some of us do have problems with uh loose stools that morning off so think about uh ammonium just to after you've gone to the bathroom you've given yourself the time to empty and then um so that will help you out so kathy's gonna be essential later in the race and we can talk about that later but hopefully i've covered those things uh to help you it's a simple diet as i've said just carbohydrates fluids um not much don't donate don't go too crazy but don't forget your breakfast either yeah don't eat a high fiber meal in the middle of the race that's probably not going to be helpful so uh since as all of us said we're we're going to have to be comfortable with bodily functions i'll just quickly say that uh you know she was talking about what she eats beforehand and what she eats in the morning um i actually tailor all of that and try to go off solid foods you know i'll have an early dinner the night before um an event and then go off of solid foods and begin some liquid diet and meal replacements because i want my gut to be empty uh you know i i would prefer during that race to not need to visit a restroom for a bowel movement and uh and i i i'll share that i was successful during our race and you know that's a big thing you know we our goal was to never get out of the boat and we we certainly had accommodations to take care of that in the boat while we're on the river um but it's a whole lot easier if you don't have to um and so so we start making those accommodations early uh caffeine does oops as i'm dropping a pen sorry caffeine does uh you know help me along in my morning rituals uh so i don't take caffeine the morning of the race and in fact uh we actually wean off caffeine um steve and i both wean off caffeine for the month before the race to maximize the effect of caffeine if we need it during the race um so just a couple of small points there that i thought of as almost talking yeah i do the same thing i try to get the liquid diet at least the day before uh to have the empty stomach so you know my gut is used to it and but leading up like almost leaning up that week i eat everything that is good for you um and try to load up as much as i can so the body is ready and and i should jump back in here and say that what i'm talking about is somebody who is trying to beat their best time they're pushing for the podium they want to be at the front of the pack if you're so i kind of view it as there's the the the podium racer and there's more of an expedition-oriented approach to it where you are going to stop you're going to get some sleep cycles on land you're going to stop and use the bathroom on land all of that is perfectly okay and the examples that i'm giving are not in that more expedition oriented venue i'm talking about like you want to every second counts and you literally are never going to get out of the boat and you're going to keep moving constant forward progress you know do everything in the current that you can do in the current because that's a free moving walkway uh if if you're listening to us talk and you're like i don't know if i want to do this now my god they're they're trying to figure out how not to go to the bathroom for 60 hours this is insane uh you definitely don't have to follow this advice because this is something you know the details we're talking about are the really nitpicky every second counts details um so i just want to make sure that we're not turning people off of the mr340 by saying we take a modium and then we never go to the bathroom and and to be totally fair my day before the event monday at 11 o'clock i am standing outside uh what used to be oklahoma joe's whatever they call it now and i get my big old two choices of meat and you know texas toast and baked beans and the whole nine yards and that's the big meal beforehand and why because it's tasty i don't care it's the one time i get really good barbecue i'm from wisconsin we don't barbecue things we kill them but we can't cook them well so government cheese yeah yes you want something good put it in a casing call it a brat there you go um so yeah there there's a wide spectrum of things you can do and speaking of uncomfortable topics one of the other things that comes up on a regular basis in terms of nutrition is of course the other end stories of diarrhea or gi upset during the race any ideas about that how we can solve it how you can deal with it uh we can start with the hopkins yeah i mean i i imodium is your friend you should definitely bring imodium with you on the race but i'm always a little nervous about it just like i'm a little nervous about taking ibuprofen and some other drugs that that can be problematic and especially you know things like imodium that's it's altering your body's normal process so the last thing i think somebody would want to do is they feel like they might have loose stools or they're kind of having a little bit of an issue and they just start hammering imodium the whole race for all i know and i'm not a medical professional that could be for over the course of 50 hours that might be a really bad idea so some of these things have their places you try to recover from about of of you know in this case we're talking about diarrhea and imodium is definitely helpful but i would say that if you aren't getting it under control between that checkpoint and the next then you probably got a more complicated issue on your hands and and i don't have a beautiful answer for that certainly you want to uh stop the caffeine if you drink it and you got diarrhea because caffeine is a stimulant stimulating your vagus nerve which you know tells your gut what to do and gets it excited so you don't want that because it's already excited so stop the caffeine if you're having loose stools uh if you are looking forward to fruit or you have fruit in your bag that might not be a good idea while you're having uh these loose stools um so um yeah it's just slow down but whatever you do don't stop drinking your fluids drink your fluids especially your sports drink and hopefully you have something salty that you can also down your leucine electrolytes so um you know crackers if you can nibble on those and it does mean slow down slow down and uh try to get try to pull through and see if it's gonna get give it a little bit of time i will i will give one piece of advice that's i think it's not about nutrition and it's not about any kind of physiology issue but if everything's going wrong you can't stop dry heaving i had a partner who this happened to um he just couldn't stop dry heaving but he eventually got back in the boat and we were the second boat into saint charles that year and we we took 15 minutes of just sitting on shore get the paddle out of your hand just relax maybe lay back a little bit disconnect your brain from this intensity of this moment you're in and just try to center yourself again and it and it worked and i had done it for myself too where you kind of okay i'm ready to go don't have your support team load your boat and say i'm done just sit down and relax try and maybe even stop talking to a lot of people and just try to get there's there's a there's an emotional element to some of this and and that's really what i'm trying to say is uh you know don't get so worried about your nutrition that you make your nutrition even worse and uh ozzy i'm familiar with enough stories from ultra running uh what are your recommendations since i've i've heard about trees and bushes being horribly abused during ultra runs here's some of that um i have luckily avoided all that i very particular in my training i don't i try not to take any new foods today before the the week before the day off so that i don't run into any of those issues i'm very plain in my in my diet the week before and during so so i try to avoid that so luckily so far i've seen some examples and heard some examples in the bushes but i've luckily have avoided that all right and one other one other nutrition issue comes up all the time uh acid reflux and heartburn i know for me night two it's horrible so what do you guys do for it uh let's start with uh jeremy uh i i am extremely fortunate that i don't have too many issues with it but as ozzie just said i think part of that is that i spend so much of my training you know this weekend i had a training session this morning it was three hours i have one tomorrow that's five hours and i'm training my food you know a huge part of the reason i do those longer sessions is to train my nutrition so i've found what works for me um and actually in the in the past couple of years the only indigestion-y acid refluxy thing i had was in the mr340 when i did something that i'd never done before uh someone handed me a red bull and i said all right whatever they said this is great and i said fine and i drank half of it that was disgusting and i threw it away and about 20 minutes later man i had the most rotten stomach and it was acidy and it burned and i just went back to my normal food and everything turned out okay but for all of my always train and never try something different i did you know this guy at a ramp said here have a red bull and i was like okay fine off we went and it was a horrible idea um so i would say the best thing you can do is practice ahead of time and don't don't deviate and try something new yep same thing as jeremy as i i i try nothing new i just do the same thing over and over train your body to on these long runs just train and with the the nutrition that works for you if you try something new and if your body takes it bring it on but uh yeah i have not had those issues either true with the caffeine too um caffeine is actually a good performance enhancer and we're finding that um it can really help you stay alert it's the alertness pain toleration refocus hey change maybe this isn't so bad i was suffering but you know what it's beautiful outside so it changed your mental capacity so uh definitely valid and it doesn't diurese like what was a concern before so yeah a lot of athletes use caffeine but here's the caveat so it has to be in the in the shape of form that you're used to so um you know uh if you if you get given something like a red bull for instance and you're not used to it so um if you're a coffee drinker then stick with coffee if you're a tea drinker that's me uh that's my way of getting my caffeine so um you can't overdo it though and i'd be interested to hear what jeremy and ozzy have to say about that but it really plays a role when you're really especially the first night and you're finding and it's a it's a night um it's a a night cap it's definitely and it does have a five half-life so you know once you take your caffeine uh you may be nursing it a little bit but you don't have to feel like you it's to your tolerance levels so there's a lot of individualization to that too what about you what's your experience what's your caffeine well my uh i like caffeine a lot i taper off at least a week ahead and have nothing day one or night one night two i need it it's when i s last last race i could not see the river at all in front of me uh because of hallucinations but when i had caffeine it went away for a little bit i got energized and i i had certain animals where i took caffeine just to get me through the hallucinations and not being able to see the river and got me to sunrise and then everything just came back so that's how i use caffeine to my advantage at that point for me i wean off a little bit before that i try to go into the race basically being non-dependent on caffeine um because i'm very dependent on caffeine in my daily life i drink a couple of cups coffee a day um i do use some of my meal replacers with caffeine in them there's a perpetuum that's called caffe latte and it's got it's a cafe latte flavor and it's got a bit of caffeine in it and so as i go into the evening i switch my perpetuum to that style of perpetual um but beyond that i try not to take you know there's that's a very low amount of caffeine in that i should say that that's a low amount of caffeine in that particular supplement as i get tired in the night i actually use chewing gum chewing gum is wicked good for me um to stop myself from falling asleep if i'm getting tired a couple of sticks of chewing gum go in and it's amazing how that can can really keep me going but if i get to the point where i feel like i need caffeine like i need specifically to resolve an issue with attention and and energy levels i need caffeine i actually use small caffeine tablets so that i can very carefully observe how much i'm taking and i can make sure that i don't go over what i should go you know what i should take so that's another thing i train it ahead of time i practice it i do night training and during that night training i'll practice with the caffeine tablets when i need them but that's a way that i can make sure that i'm controlling exactly what i'm getting and i know exactly what's gone in so that i don't accidentally take too much speaking of which how many of you have actually taken too much caffeine on the race and run into problems i'm the only one good so i i i haven't so i'm a caffeine addict and i've been for a long time the the concept of tapering a month beforehand just frightens me kind of like a heroin addict being cut off so um but during the race i'm frustrated because most of the gels out there and i do we do do gels and we do them for not just the calories but they also are really good way to kind of dose your salts because you kind of know what you're getting in in there and uh but there's this trend where all of the gels have caffeine in them i found especially the last time we did the 340 when i was getting essentially a quarter cup or half a cup of coffee every time i hit one of those gels i think it was detrimental i think by the end of the day i was just i could feel that it was too much caffeine and i just kind of wish there was some other way to to be get and i i know this year i'm going to work really hard to find non-caffeinated gel like equivalents probably perpetuum um because i i didn't have the problems that you talked about chris where you're hallucinating but i could just feel that it was counterproductive to what i was doing and for those of you that missed uh the conversation earlier my first year in the 340 i was taking no doze tablets plus i had five hour energy and some other things and i pushed off of hermann at 10 o'clock at night thinking oh this will be fine pop in a few uh no does go on my way turns out caffeine can actually make hallucinations worse um and i hit four wing dikes in burger bend i'm not even sure how i do that now that i look back at a map but i was convinced they went all the way across the river and it was a horrible experience uh and i'm a pretty lightweight person when it comes to caffeine one five hour energy uh is fantastic for me at the end of the race as long as i finish in four and a half hours if i'm six hours out i'm toast um it's not good talk to scott reeves he saw me through that experience once and i was convinced that his pedal boat had toddlers running around it because i couldn't figure out what his legs were doing it it's a tricky situation so i'm going to ask does anyone use anything as a as a supplement that isn't caffeine to keep them up at night that they want to talk about uh herbal energy pills or any of that chewing gum and singing yeah i'm with jeremy on that one music helps a lot insane for me it's music i actually sacrificed a little bit of weight in the boat and the good news is now the technology is pretty remarkable so you we've got bluetooth speakers that'll run for 12 hours they're waterproof that are actually very light and so we would use music as a reward cycle so we when we were really feeling down it was like okay get the tunes going and uh it was a it was a miracle worker for us in terms of trying to pep up so um i mean that probably might work for any everybody else but for for both of us it it was it's an important factor in the in the race for us and ryan were those your own tunes or did force you to listen to something else no we actually our favorite music during the race that anybody cares is uh was kind of modern brazilian pop so that was it's always upbeat music and we really like that but anyway it doesn't matter i just want to make a point before we move on to uh from caffeine so there seems to be you know dietitians we're into numbers um so 90 to 180 milligrams of caffeine uh in an hour it seems to be majority of tall majority people can tolerate optimally 200 milligrams so do read the labels it um it has hopefully caught that it's important to start learning a little bit about reading labels if not already so yeah to see how much those uh energy drinks provide there's very strong i think then i read six cups of coffee equivalents up it's been a while i haven't read those but anyway so you know it's probably going to be more than that so yeah it's pretty strong stuff but if you are if you're one of the few that can take it you know but we all have a threshold and jitterness like chris mentioned that'll happen to you so again from 90 to 180 milligrams seems to be optimal and chris you said you had said what other supplements you know do we use specifically for the night and and getting through uh you know those those doldrums but in my mind you know supplements uh i shy away from supplements because they all do something to our bodies you know there is some chemical and biophysical result of taking a supplement and unless i know exactly what that is unless i have a need for it unless there is some shortcoming or deficit that i'm trying to make up for i tend to not look to the supplement as being some magic pill that's going to increase my performance if if i have a specific deficit if i am short on sodium or i could use that caffeine because i'm really crashing and i've practiced with it and i know what it's going to do then i might you know be tempted to and i might you know decide to use a supplement in some form but otherwise i'm pretty leery of of messing with the physiology that's that's just naturally occurring um because there are always consequences there's no free ride there's no magic pill um so i get really nervous about people starting to pile on the supplements i see people with these baggies of pills they look like drug dealers i'm gonna go race i'm gonna do my workout and you're like oh this is terrifying i have no idea what's in that bag so i tend to shy away from them so what about the hammer anti-fatigue or the ubiquitous electrolyte pills etc do any of you guys use those or do you just go with sort of what's in the bottle uh you know your liquid liquid diet my in my case the diet the liquid diet and what i have in my nutrition bag is planned out you know i know how much i sweat i know how hard i work i know how many calories i burn and so what's in that bag should cover me i do carry some electrolyte tablets just in case things really go south and i've made a big mistake and i'm becoming hyponatremic and i need electrolytes i carry some as an emergency stash but otherwise um no you're not popping an electrolyte pill or two every hour i want to talk about that idea exactly what jeremy said which is really important and i i i almost would say i want to plant a flag in the sand on this everybody who does this race needs to have um electrolyte pills in the boat and a little bit of an understanding about the idea of what it means when you um don't keep your salts up and we even had a situation where alma um just because of a shift in and her interest um and and and what she was eating um and drinking more than than probably she should have and we were looking she was looking at her urine and realized that one she wasn't feeling so good starting to get a headache but she saw that her urine was crystal clear and that's when we dug out the electrolyte pills and gave them to her and within 45 minutes she circled back on the whole where she was going if we didn't have those in the boat it might have been problematic so um there's you know the salt thing is is important it's almost a sep not a separate subject but you could talk about that for an hour in terms of what you how important it is yeah so uh a caution about what we're talking about so hammer um what enduro lights what are they called and they're like yeah one um so um some people hate those they find it very difficult uh to to digest so try them out again during a long run you want to seek the heat you know missouri heat it's coming we hope um so definitely take advantage of the humidity don't shy away from it in fact that's gonna be your training ground so that's when you're uh you can test drive these kind of things um so there's also the news nuns and wns and those come in different flavors you can actually pop that into your drink uh one tablet and sixteen ounces that will help i will tell you though a lot of people feel a lot more comfortable with just drinking uh their their sodium from food and that's pickle juice becomes super popular i would advise that you actually drain the pickle juice from the pickle jar the real pickle jar versus the commercially made the commercially made is made oh it's nasty it's got dyes in it and preservatives it tastes terrible so you're wasting your money but if you get the real um real deal three ounces of those is about 900 milligrams it's a big shot of sodium so you don't need any more than that and sip chase it with water uh for sure and it's not one of those that you're going to be popping all the time probably one would do it see how you feel um you know uh and go from there so um yeah so elmar are you supplementing um electrolytes consistently through the race um or are you relying mostly on your food intake and you're supplementing when the need arises correct okay correct however great question i feel that the way things went last year you know you're so exhausted i don't know about you guys but eating at the last what 70 miles is like barf i don't want anything nothing nothing you know and you have to push you have to push the beverages so hopefully the idea of saving your best flavor to sports drink at the very end but i'm now wondering so we're going to test it out um certainly when you're so exhausted it's the sodium that i think you're so depleted i bet you if you take a shot of you know test your blood you're going to be hypo neutronic anyway you know and uh to just a safer level but um but um i would test out some sodium at the very end some pickle juice at the end to help uh improve my appetite you know a lot some of that's going to depend on what kind of 340 we see too because um i don't want to sound like a grouchy old man here but um he's a grouchy old man yeah but it seems like we've had the the date of the 340 shift into cooler temperate zones for quite a while now we have not had a july 98 degree intense wall of heat 340 in a while and obviously in a situation like that then you're sweating and your fluids and your salts become really really important um you cannot trivialize it and i want to uh kind of circle back on something here and go back to a little bit of nutrition a little bit of supplementation i've got a question that i want to deal with first from a audience member uh katie says i have daily meds that i have to take regardless of what they're needed for does anyone else have this how do you deal with it i think in a practical sense how do you take it at the right time does the added exertion and energy day over day have an effect on their effectiveness i'm going to say first of all that's a tricky question bring your doctor into it but leaving that aside what do you do if you have a medication to deal with and i'll start with uh alma since you seem the most qualified here to deal with that well i don't know about that but i have to admit dang it this healthy lifestyle that i do and eating right and exercising on time and i couldn't beat hypertension so i've started just this past two months with hypertension medicine so what i'm gonna do is just take it in the morning like i usually do uh i do have we do have carry pills you know yeah mechanic mechanically we we use a small dry box and uh and then please if you if these are really important meds you need to bring them another another small dry box because sometimes things happen i've had one i've had one time that i got water into this kind of what were that the pills and things that they're mostly salt tabs etc but yeah i mean i don't have an answer from a medical standpoint but mechanicalistically they make these little small dry i mean uh water type boxes and that's probably the way you're going to want to go with that so yeah it is a medical question do follow up but i do intend to take my blood pressure medicine during the race um the good thing when it comes to blood pressure exercise is the natural relaxant of the blood vessels so you got to put let the blood vessels expand when you're exercising so it's a natural lowering of your blood pressure but throughout the race as you continue on i would i would uh wager that maybe the blood pressure goes up so i say definitely stay on your medicine but it is a medical question good question anyone else ozzie or jeremy talk to your doctor oh yeah um on the same vein what about people with special needs in terms of people who might be diabetic gluten free etc any recommendations for them when it comes to nutrition on the race because of course this is going to be a very stressful event i'm thinking more diabetic than gluten-free saying that's very stressful but uh how do you handle that i've i've got one i've got i've got a piece of advice uh tom brady has a coach tiger woods has a coach i've got a coach you know i'm not putting myself in their category by the way but people that are really at the top of their game hire professionals to help them work through their performance issues and their performance opportunities i would say especially if you're dealing with something like that but even if you're not there are a lot of really great ultra endurance coaches and nutritionists out there who specialize in helping people like all of us make plans and put together the best thing for their own situation they can tell you how to train and how to prepare and how to test things i would say if you're dealing if you have the added challenge of something like uh you know diabetes or some other dietary requirement you're vegan or what have you it's worth really in the end with a small amount of money to hire a professional coach or um you know advisor to help you out ozzy anything to add to that i would second that become knowledgeable get a coach get good sources and then train with it train and train with it i married a coach so i was about to make a mention of having a dietitian with us yeah with gluten i think the person is going to be savvy if we have any folks that are sensitive to gluten they're going to be savvy enough to most of these sports drinks it's going to be gluten-free but the problem comes is they are are they manufactured with a and uh and where there's a potential for cross-contamination so i would inquire with each company and to make sure uh that's my advice so the beauty is this you bring your own food and you have your own food handed to you so it's not like you're uh you're traveling where you're having a hard time finding food that meets your diet you know obviously that i guess that would mean it's not the time to go up and get a hamburger from the boy scouts who are grilling if you think you have to you know avoid things so i'm not saying the issue isn't real but you're already kind of self-contained you have brought what you need for that issue and just make sure you know how to keep it dry and make sure you know how to handle it and do it in a boat which is so you gotta practice that stuff and i'm thinking in terms of diabetic and potential needing for shots you need to practice it in the boat um and and see if you can make sure you got a clean system going on and then in terms of specialized diets uh my wife is actually vegan and so are my sons um perpetuum has a hammer has a vegan version of perpetuum i know they make it in strawberry flavor i'm not sure what other flavors it might be in but regardless i think if if what you're dealing with is a dietary thing you know being diabetic the point where you're taking shots is a little bit different but if what you're dealing with is a special dietary need if you're if you're working at the level of detail that we've been talking about throughout this webinar um it's more an issue of finding the options that are out there and then training with them but uh you know we're being extremely specific with what we put in our body what types of things we use you know there there aren't any surprises for us i think you would just apply that same logic um within the confines of your you know your dietary restriction okay and i want to uh bring up another issue jeremy you kind of touched on it before you say uh maybe it was before maybe it was last night when we met uh but you talked about training low and i you know i want to get into that idea of nutrition for training so do you want to talk about that and what you mean yeah absolutely um so there is there's this vogue thing where people talk about putting themselves into ketosis and teaching their bodies to burn fat um and i i don't subscribe to a you know full fat low carbohydrate put your body into ketosis uh diet in general what i was mentioning last night was actually in response to that and saying that i don't i don't follow that sometimes i do train low which means i wanna i wanna feel what my body is like when i have low muscle glycogen so often times i'll do a double i'll do a workout in the morning and then i'll you know fast on carbohydrates through the day and do a second workout in the evening or i'll do a workout first thing in the morning without having a breakfast so that i have low muscle glycogen and i can experience that i can give my body the chance to burn a higher percentage of fats we are never burning purely fats or purely carbs it's always a mix of the two but so training low is something that you can integrate into your training methodology hopefully with the guidance of a coach or somebody who really understands what they're doing and so you do it as a specific and very intentional part of your training methodology um i wouldn't say that it's a key component of what i do and i would definitely say that i'm relying on carbohydrates to get me from call point to st charles i am not relying on fats i'm not eating you know big wads of peanut butter i'm not operating in ketosis the the fast clean efficient energy is carbohydrates not fats and so that is where i'm you know where i'm trying to operate um and i believe there's a lot of science behind that um and you know alma can speak more clearly to that but that's uh so so yes to answer your question training low i do train low i do train when i have low muscle glycogen i do it a couple of times a week generally on a long a long exercise and i'll start taking carbohydrates an hour or two into that training low so that my body has the chance to replenish them while i'm you know in the process of being physical and so i don't i don't generally have like a whole five hour workout that's training though i'll train low for the first few hours and then begin my nutrition plan so and now ozzy you had different ideas about it and i just want to give you a bit of a forum to put your ideas out there no i think uh i don't know if i got lost in the translation yesterday i practiced i trained low on carbohydrate just like jeremy says not maybe i misunderstood what we were talking about yesterday but that that kind of gets you into that more into that burning fat how does your body react to burning fat how do you slow down because you do and how does that feel how can i get out of it how's my mood so i do practice that just for that reason so when i and i do it paddling so i will go down the river obviously with people and i i will not have carbs or anything as much as i can ahead of time and i go down the river uh at a as much as i can and i'm like oh this is how it feels how do i get out of it and try to get out of it in the boat while i can so that's an excellent idea sort of putting yourself into that position that you're going to see yourself in the race please don't try this with electrolytes necessarily but um put yourself in the position and then try to get yourself out of it yeah trying to see how it works so that you don't it's it's another i like to control my environment right so i like i like not to be surprised so this is one way i wouldn't be surprised this is how it feels now this is where i'm heading did i forget to drink did i forget to eat maybe i should take some of these things to get out of it and alma you uh i'm sure you have something to add to this um yeah the concept of training low carbohydrate to me that's 40 carbohydrate roughly 30 protein 30 fat and that's something i've been doing for years because i started out in bodybuilding and from there i mean that was all about physique and it's a calorie deficit and i have had a wonderful revelation something that we talked about that sealed the deal that now that i've been training high carbohydrates so 60 65 percent carbohydrate i feel fantastic my metabolism is higher i'm actually like losing a little bit of weight or keeping my weight even at a level that i was fighting for before because i just revved up my metabolism so my body is primed to really love the carbohydrates and i've increased all the thermogenesis of burning burning energy so i just have after years of being low i now love going back to being high now is that because you went you know because you went low and then you went high or is it just because you're higher carb because i'm a higher carb i'm now my metabolism is higher i am my i'm more energized in my workouts it's the way to go uh when it comes to these long endurance type of events so um and i think what uh you know to me what's happening is with jeremy and ozzy is like you can tell the best athletes are the ones that are well read and they're always researching they're always looking and you have to respect that so i i give them kudos and i see it all the time so and i think what's happening too they're not really mentioning it but they're trimming their bodies they're keeping their bodies lean by changing their their their carbohydrates up and down keeping it guessing so that that is actually a trick of bodybuilders as well their bodybuilders are the prime when it comes to changing their metabolism to try to stay as lean as they can so it's a practice that i think came from the bodybuilding world it's not entirely new uh i've been doing it for so many years i'm so happy i'm eating my carbs i'm a happy girl just to make sure that you get carbs yeah i went to you know really dark stouts and kind of moved away from porters you know so that's where it's at how do the ipas work for you on the river though do you find that that gives you reflections hops will make you lose yeah but just just to make sure that uh i was clear on what i was meaning by training low i'm not changing my diet my diet is still a carb-based diet i just happen to start a training session when i'm in a fasted state after either fasting overnight or you know doing a workout to burn muscle glycogen and then doing a second workout later in the day without having to replenish that so um i'm certainly not looking at like a you know a keto diet or anything like that i'm eating a normal diet for a an endurance athlete that is carb-based intermittent fasting like you stopped eating at what time uh it would be you know i have dinner and then i don't eat again and i wake up in the morning and i go for a run or i go for a paddle um so it's not it's it's not even more than a typical fast it's just you know when you have slightly low muscle glycogen does that make sense elmo okay okay so so it really isn't you know i don't i don't do any keto-based diet or low-carb diet it's it's a regular diet and i just happen to try to do some training when i'm in a low glycogen state as a result of normal fasting just i think just to be clear because we've been talking about fat burning it's that just to be clear about what the bottom line if i may what's happening here is that um we we need to make sure that um keep low-fat diets are i mean excuse me high-fat diets and ketosis is not the way to train for these at all 100 agreed yeah yeah all right and i want to bring up a question uh about self-supported nutrition now we've talked about liquid diets and all of that and of course carrying enough liquid with you is going to be quite difficult so uh what would you recommend you know if someone's self-supported they don't have a ground crew out there how can they some of that i can talk about that from from uh so there's water now available the very first 340 i literally had to carry what i thought was going to be enough fluids and it turned out there was some tricks around that later in the race but couldn't count on it now there's water pretty much available now i'd hate to say that somebody was counting on every checkpoint having water but you typically can get water even if you're self-supported so you could carry ziploc bags with your uh carbohydrate-rich powder formula easily for the whole race and you just dump it into the water and resupply your container your hydration container however it is so i guess my point is is is if you're you unless you're you know you you have the water is the main issue in terms of weight and excess bulk in your boat nowadays with the 340 i don't think that's a problem you can get water so then you just have to plan on how do i deal with eat drink mix etc and that's pretty straight and and cleaning the bottles and some of those drink mixes go off yeah we have a story about that i'll keep it i don't want to the we had a situation where our container wasn't cleaned out correctly and it fermented and um one we couldn't drink it because it was it was disgusting two we were probably dealing with flavor fatigue at that point in time but it put a panic moment for us and we actually had to pull over cooper's just to get water because what was in our hydration flask we were not gonna drink that so you know we knew that we couldn't stop drinking so we had to pull over and just scramble to get some some a replacement at that time so you know you you were yeah i don't think you were kidding but it's actually a really big deal you can't some level of food prep hygiene is really important here especially on the drink containers no i was i was serious because i know some of the drinks like infinite and spizz and some of those that contain milk proteins and different proteins go off and they start tasting sour and i couldn't imagine putting a dirty bottle you know refilling the same dirty bottle and not ending up with some real problems uh jeremy anything yeah i was just gonna say on in in terms of uh how particular you are with your nutrition plan and and in this case i mentioned earlier uh it's really about making sure things don't go wrong uh you know a long-term race like this is about making sure things don't go wrong so i actually bring my own water i bring gallon jugs i have these uh you know lexan gallon jugs and i bring my well water from home and that is what my ground crew uses to make my drinks and to make in the mr 340 my soup because i know that water is is good and i don't have any issues with it and it doesn't bother me whereas i've you know i i went to fresno my wife and i moved to fresno for a little while we were both sick for the first six months we lived in fresno and couldn't figure out why and it was the tap water and we got filters and we were okay i don't want to risk having bum water from you know some public boat launch that some guy you know used the hose to rinse out his rv septic tank or something so i bring my own water um that might be a little a little too persnickety but i'm that particular same thing i'll bring gallon jugs of water and um so we are ready so we don't have to run out of water or not find it or like you say it's you find strange water yeah just eliminating all the possibilities of getting going wrong is really where it's at i think in my head i think jeremy your idea of the uh what was it perpetuum in the small bottle it's you know single serve sort of thing with the cork might be a great suggestion if you're self-supported thinking along those lines yeah yeah and in this case uh you know we had our ground crew put the the scoop was already in there i prepped all the bottles and had the scoop of perpetual but they just filled them up to a mark of tape that i had on the neck and then they'd cap it and hand it off and i'd shake it before i you know i took it and then drink it but you could also leave it dry you know if you know you're going to have long stretches between [Music] you know between water stops or whatever between drops you could just leave it dry and add water in the boat absolutely and i've got something similar here this is my own mix if you add spis and instant coffee it still tastes horrible but i call it spazz and uh i just throw it in these old single serve milk containers and then the idea is throw it into a water bottle while you're out there and then flip out water bottles uh with the ground crew so they can clean them out and get it done but that's that's another possibility but the cork is a nice idea because then my hands don't have to function i can use my teeth right and i've only broken one of those during the race so i don't think it can happen twice one tooth yeah uh at lexington under the bridge i broke a a tooth in half uh one of my wisdom teeth on a cliff's bar so i still can't eat bars during the race and i spit into the water and i was sitting there texting my ground crew going i need scope i need listerine at every checkpoint so i can rinse it out and not die of some crazy infection actually is go to the dentist before going to the 340. little jv weld in there you're all set you know speaking of like what you might take in and die in those um we are probably ought to talk about people who wonder if they can filter the water out of the river um and the water in the river is not the missouri river is no less no more polluted than any other body or water that you would point to in fact like the ozarks has worse water quality numbers than most of the missouri but the sediment load is intense and so um you just can't do it there's no filter that's going to work and the only way expedition paddlers do it is they put in a bucket let all the sediment come out and then pull off the the top phase but anyway just just wanted to cover that because every every year there's at least the question and there has been um some uh failed attempts to filter the river water you can't do it it won't work it's too much sediment yeah and uh as we're getting towards the end here what i want to do is give everyone about a minute uh to cover anything that they haven't covered that they think is important let's start with ozzie what comes to mind is in my food bag in my gallon food bag is each individual food in a small ziploc bag so i can pull that out and i don't have to touch it i literally eat like a horse out of a bag so i don't have to touch it so i don't contaminate it with any missouri bacteria as i go again to avoid getting sick getting anything funky but um train with what you're gonna race with and do it often and and don't don't skimp on that keep it simple i want to just touch on something as he said real quick if river water touches the food as a rule don't eat the food there's just too much risk even a clean body of water has protozoa has all sorts of things in there that could be problematic so keep that in mind uh jeremy oh i'm sorry go ahead well i was just getting it because it's a perfect segue to that jeremy and then i'm done my only tip is that exactly what you guys are talking about when you drop something in the bottom of the boat if you've never done this race before you need to look up the word bilgewater and begin to understand how disgusting the bottom of the boat is going to be so you do need to figure out some little tray that you can kind of or some system that you can keep your food where it's not falling in the bottom of the boat because if it does then you're never you yeah just yeah wait you do the race so you'll know exactly what i'm talking about so sorry jeremy no no the the water in the bottom of my boat is far dirtier than any missouri river water could ever be absolutely um no i i agree with what i think uh brian and alma are going to say i agree with what ozzie just said um it's all about practicing ahead of time it's all about knowing before you get there what works for you and what doesn't and the only way to do that is to train well in advance remember that just the way you train every other system in your body to be able to paddle 340 miles you've got to train your gut you've got a train for the nutrition you've got to prepare for the foods and you don't want there to be any unknowns because it's about making sure that things don't go wrong and the way to do that is to practice and i'll throw in one more plug for finding a great coach or a great nutritionist who can help you because there are people that make their livings their whole lives are based around this we have one of them on this call and they're available to help us um and it's you know we would hire someone to help us learn to ski or we'd hire someone to you know help us learn to skydive or whatever we might as well take the time if we're invested in a race like this you know hire somebody to help you figure this stuff out too and i'm gonna i i will get to uh the hopkins and second a question just popped up from peter how do you balance weight loss versus training nutrition he's at 195 5 foot 10 planning to do stand-up paddle board he's trying to get down to 165 or 170 by race time uh alma i think that's right up your alley sure actually take advantage that um you are uh going to be training for this race because a lot of people need that physical activity to help with the uh get to your goal so that and um i would say it doesn't hurt especially the early part of the season to you know have a lower calorie diet but i don't mean like crazy um yeah you can restrict your calories and um i'll be happy to work with you if you need some help um so um but it's possible and a lot of people actually uh just lose weight just because of this event and if nothing else just think about how many calories you burn by the end of the race it's kicks you off to a new level transformation you're ready you started it and you're moving on to bigger better things after this and so um so it takes planning and you know i'm happy to help you if that's what you need all right and then uh hopkins is hopkins uh do you have anything to add uh yeah i think you've heard it's especially if this is your first race so you probably heard a lot of tips a lot of great advice so um uh you if you are needing a uh a resource uh the notes that uh jeremy provided of actual sample what he ate will help you and also uh my three page uh simplified in a snap uh guidelines for training for this race will help you and for those of you who actually need more and you're interested because you want to be just as competitive as these people on the panel so this is a wonderful uh source endurance supports nutrition by registered dietitian suzanne eberly um gerard everly that is and i do cite that in my handout so i think she's now on her third edition this is the second edition so you can find that on amazon it's uh shipped to you in a matter of days so there's a little bit of everything for everybody all right uh fantastic thank you panel uh for the hard work for getting together on a beautiful saturday afternoon uh i will be posting this on the 340 paddler uh youtube channel i will include a link to alma's handout i will include jeremy's uh diet plan or jeremy's uh nutrition for the race thank you i i will include a link to that and that should take care of it the next session will actually be on a monday to avoid training problems so our next session will be on uh primarily health but we may also deal with some hydration on monday april 19th at 6 30 pm uh i don't have the panelists laid out yet but we will have that sorted out very shortly here if you happen to be a doctor or nurse in the 340 let me know because it would be fantastic tom sleeva i'm looking at you even though you aren't looking back because you're probably at work um otherwise thank you for joining us and as always keep your paddle in the water",

he's been on Rachael Ray he's been all over the world okay my man game drops yo what's good something softer the Badlands chunks community much love much respect every last one y'all out there this has been something that has been asked for on my channel individuals hit me up you know on Instagram like what you do on YouTube is amazing and I know everybody out there can agree with me you don't send the way you polish the food off the way you blaze those jugs like a champion that's champion status I appreciate you and you know that in the stuff that you do man I mean it's a totally totally awesome man totally awesome it aside man you bout to get that million you know which all got a dual-band man's trust community I'm sure what you gotta do this man is cruising the fast way to a million now I'm not too far from a million myself you know you know what Badlands I think what we need to do if we can get both of our communities come together and bring us bolster that million so silly I think we need to do like a a meet and greet in New York by getting us here we're gonna give back by doing a mean green New York okay okay okay okay we go we're gonna fill out a date you know saying wait um I'll definitely be at you know Nathan's on the floor but you live you want you know saying you want to see me eat one see me rhyme you know I'm saying I'll be heading out stuff you know 12:00 noon yes PS gonna be taped in but you know you know you can see on the SP alive that's nice and all but there's nothing like seeing you know the big man in the flesh you know rocking the Rimes neat and all-you-can-eat you know saying so come on now July 4th get there early like man o'clock getting a spray zone Coney Island Nathan's surfing still well okay I will be there we got some black water okay okay have you ever seen black water I mean we can read it on a bun the thing it says that it's a blend of fulvic trace minerals hydration and electrolytes but this is not full coloring y'all you know saying and I'm about to teach my man James you know how we do it after this you gonna be chosen the world okay you know it's like you know before you do the job right is you got you know exhales you know so you can like deflate the lungs and get you know your stomach's prime to accept the liquid right and then you just take it all in you know it's just as simple as that right when you when you drink with you know when you drink it right try to like you know don't don't put your whole mouth around the bottles or like leave like a little space for air to come back so that you know the liquid to travel down faster and so so basically let's just just do it just on the top then with that okay all right so I met here right right right but not yet you know you know just big up to all you know name-drop subscribers the Badlands subscribers all right we salute you and we thank you all right I'll take a deep breath there you go no you do exhale like the movie you go dang bro alright let's get a level on that then these are oh geez an ice copilot so when you know it's ice cold it's very hard to do crazy this is champion status after chug this is why he does lead us straight professional amateur you know I'm just a dude passing by checking it out like let me get some of the hands in oh you know who are you on your way to do do you think man I'm gonna let you guys know the black water experience I'm this is my part I break things down if I get some of that flavor damn what's the difference between regular water and the black water experience you do not necessarily even taste the difference it's a level of Chris penis as he double chuckling is he opening at W he's over here double chuckling he just wanna be small on me it's it's a level of crispness upon the palate right when you hit that black water is this no bad aftertaste nothing funky or anything like that because sometimes when we mess around like Nestle water for every different reason have a little funky tinge blue aftertaste this right here it's clean I think this is clean right it's like it came from a mountain you know say so like like you know like droplets coming underneath some mountain simple somewhere and San Paulo Brazil somewhere and you know just somebody just have like a compass you know watching each droplet come and each droplet is gold and putting it into a cup and here you go black water black water on next level that's blk enjoy the darks are love you guys to see that right there you got to enjoy the dark side that's what we're doing right now you know I'm saying two brothers up over here to fool Titans in the game levels of the food Titan ship I do the fast food reviews the best of the worst right a little restaurant reviews and this man over here just straight beast moves it yep beasts more if you're looking for peaceful that's why you're on this channel watching beastmode up over here I just chucked the world one by one time that's what is the most liquids a youth consumed in a single Chuck Georgia say like talking to you Linda I would say there is a chance a challenge called the water man chug and where I chopped 4.5 liters of water that's like a gallon and a half there was a guy who did it overseas right and I you know I can leave the link in the description but I was so fascinated by how this guys did it you know saying he chokes three large bottles of poem of spring water I was like I kind of tried that Wow so that was pretty tough you know you know the alcohol scene I've choked up four four four forces of Old English I would have to say you know I mean but I can chug a lot more I think I'm gonna step it up you know for the for the fans you know I'm gonna show them what two gallons of liquid looks like girl what you know you just got to stay tuned for that it's gonna watch there if y'all need that your lives right now you hit this video with a thumbs up right now hit or thumbs up and then in the comments just don't put massive that's gonna let badlands know that every last warning that's what you want to see next okay I shall hey real quick let you guys know we're gonna put a link also if you want to see badlands you'll learn about the hometown food review game versus polishing off massive amounts of foam that's gonna be doing it but I'm a teaching the way he taught me how to get my chest even though I hit the crazy fail I finished it just took like longer bringing him over to that food critic side of life on my channel up over there so slide up over there next and once your main man Badlands chugs get busy in the food game some proper yep so uh okay you gotta help we've still got about a whole bunch to polish off though but we'll finish this afterwards all right we will be watching our food down with blackboard so so damn hey man pleasures all mine bro pleasures all mine yeah we got so choked to write game drops okay like subscribe hit that Bell you know saying game drops official man ten years in the YouTube game doing his thing okay all day okay oh my come on man go to his channel and subscribe okay you will not be disappointed this guy is legendary and the food you know the food game so

come out here and get crazy in the food games oh yeah sit back relax be comfortable you know what's about to go down yes more more eating more chugging you know just a smorgasbord chugging the world one part at a time that each other's back", "w_BBk0QgS4s": "and this is Luke's times with salsa wrong we're gonna be talking about the gulp again had some great questions come in after last week's video about just saving money on gulps and the question was relating to non gold products and you know can we put do A's or other lures in this gold juice in these Gulf containers and have it work better have the scent carry off onto these other products and this is true whether it's DOA or zoom or Charlie's or Z man's you know have a whole tub of soft Lex's I've definitely gone overboard on buying here but but I've tried it I've tried it for many years and there's really a rule doesn't make that much of a difference on those other those other brands and I'll explain to you why so so globe whether using these containers or would I recommend it last week and just these waterproof containers you can you can definitely put the the other baits in there it's not gonna hurt them I've only seen one case where it actually hurt the betta it was a zoom product it actually I think I left it in there too long I was prying there for a couple months but it actually kind of like hardened up and kind of explained it was it was it totally it kind of messed up the bait so so now I don't mix it and the reason why it's not that helpful is because this gulp liquid is is really designed for the materials that gulp is made out of and that's a unique material so it's a water-based solution compared to these others right like the DOA that I showed earlier or the zooms or or most soft plastics they're oil-based an easy way to know you know if it works or not is if you can leave it out in the Sun right if you can leave that you can leave these out on this hook all day long and it's not gonna shrivel up whereas a gold product alright if you leave a shrimp on a jig head and leave it on the Sun all day it's gonna shrivel up and harden up and the reason is because again it's it's a it's a liquid based formula so as that liquid goes away it totally shrivels up and ruins the bait so that's why they're so effective in this juice is because this juice that has the good scent it is actually throughout the entire bait so it's not just like coated on the outside which is what would happen if you dipped one of these in there right because that liquid is not going to go inside of the oil-based it is but it will get absorbed by the gulp and again that's why this this solution you don't have to to really recharge it as I guess the term you really don't have to because again that liquid that scent is all the way throughout the entire base so as long as it stays it stays wet it'll still be distributing some of that some of that scent out in the water so long story short I would not recommend you know putting your other baits in here it's not going to do that much of a difference gulp did recently come out with this gulp alive and this this appears to be designed to actually spray onto the exterior of baits like this so I haven't yet test this out I'll be curious to know your thoughts on if you've use this or not I'm gonna start doing some more tests on on scents coming up soon I did one on procure and so procure is another one that you can you can use you on these on any type of soft plastic it's again it's on the exterior it does stick for a while so I'll test I'll test this out and test it against the procure and for that procure test I'll put a link down below but I'll be really curious to get your thoughts on if you use this sin or not and if you have any good ideas for for testing in you please let me know I'll be I'll be trying on some plastics as well as price and plugs in and if you have if you have a different experience when putting you know non gulp products in this gulp juice if you found that it works really well and you know please do let me know as well so far I haven't really seen a big noticeable difference and again I believe the reason why is because this liquid does not get absorbed by these others so it might last for a little bit but it won't last nearly as long as the actual gulp material and it also won't last as long as like procurer would actually does have a pretty good ability to stick onto a lure for a long time well that's it for now hopefully that made sense and again if you have any questions at all please leave a comment down below this is a very important topic Sint definitely does matter all right it doesn't matter all the time but sometimes on those days when when the fish are a little bit more

hello today I'm gonna make the McDonald's Big Mac sauce at home and compare it to the original to see it's the recipe that I saw on a YouTube video by McDonald's Canada executive chef Dan Kudrow is as good as the original so let's get started all you need to make the recipe is 1/2 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons French dressing 4 teaspoon sweet pickle relish 1 tablespoon finely minced white onion 1 TSP of white vinegar 1 teaspoon sugar 1/8 teaspoon salt a dash of paprika garlic powder and onion powder ok this is what the ingredients look like all combined so I'll start stirring these up doesn't that look delicious ok now for the taste test it's actually really good I think the original Big Mac sauce has a tiny bit more kick so I might want to add some more ingredients and I'll play around with the different measurements but it's pretty close I could probably eat that whole bowl it's that good so definitely you should try to make it home and put on your next burger all right thanks for

mates who have your back when it comes to all things food from cooking battles to gadget reviews and cookbook challenges to a midweek meal packs app crack your eggs fake we uncover the tools that'll help us all cook and eat smarter join our community where everything we do starts with you hello and welcome to another fridge camp today our three normals mike barry and jamie we're gonna go head to head in a brand new game that we're gonna call the ultimate poker face challenge you're gonna take in turns to spend three minutes enjoying different delicious dishes that our in-house food team have knocked up the catch each one has a fiery hot sauce within it and we've put them in order of pungency on the scoville scale from kind of tingly to unbearable so in other words if you fail at the first one you're screwed for the whole game if it helps the scoring process is completely subjective i will award a point to the best poker face in each round how are we defining poker face uh for clarity a poker face is successfully hiding your emotions behind an impassive and unrevealing expression round number one jamie you're up first [Music] i'm looking forward to this i put hot sauce on most foods if at any point you can't manage you want to tap out you've got the dairy board there it's your recovery space but you won't get a point okay lift the clutch on number one we're gonna start with hot wings okay jay your poker face challenge starts now so to give you some idea we've got sriracha hot sauce on this so we're starting very mediocre very popular hot sauce one of my faves originally thai also popular in vietnam and all across the us what you're tasting what you're thinking it's a really nice sweet wing really lovely sticky sweet sauce absolutely zero spice good poker face so far because there's not even any beads of sweat but we know what sriracha does it's heavy on sugar acid in the form of vinegar and salt so it is an incredible seasoning that everyone loves but it's also got that kick of chili the chili comes from typically jalapeno so it's actually not that high but these are sun ripened chilies so you're looking at a scoville scale of about three thousand to be honest it's about three so the fact you're getting on your lips doesn't bother you at all i'll put this in my eye here you go now barry you're also a fan of scratch i know this what do you love putting it on eggs good answer i'm not a massive fan of heat but this is just the right amount for me these wings have been confed and then deep fat fried so you get the crispy skin and the succulent chicken meat i could do hotter i think then sriracha look at me go look at you go are you ready yes in that case your poker face challenge starts now mike how you feeling they are outstanding absolutely delicious that disappeared quickly yeah i love my chicken wings i'll have the recipe for this and you don't feel like a little bit of sour cream or yogurt or milk is going to help no if you've got any like buffalo sauce last 10 seconds i'm not even seeing any eye watering that's it your three minutes are up there isn't even a tingle in my mouth i wasn't faking it could handle more i don't think there were many if any tells on each of you i'm actually going to give you all the points good we'll pass the pokeface challenge it'll be devastating if that wasn't the case ah round two just so you know with the scoville scale it um it scales quite quickly quite exponentially lift the cloche oh yes spicy tuna sushi roll oh amazing i'm so excited and it's all bound with mayonnaise and in the mayonnaise some of this all natural zombie apocalypse sauce as you might imagine we're starting to get this hot sauces that have what bold branding sorry we're going from sriracha to zombie apocalypse i told you things scale quickly this is going up to half a million so we've jumped a bit a bit okay jay your poker face challenge begins now generous on the tuner generous on the portion i don't know if anybody else can see this like glistening on the uh the upper cheek underneath the eye there's some subtleties here that show me that that's quite spicy so i'm definitely feeling something it looks it on my tongue and in my cheeks is probably where i'm feeding man jamie is the one who likes spice we're lemon and her boys okay barry your poker face challenge starts now so this sauce contains ghost peppers and habaneros with a mix of spiced vegetables vinegar and oil to create almost sweet yet terrifyingly hot sauce it burns like a blow torch yet those discerning taste buds will notice the flavors of cooked habanero so it is a cooked chilli sauce as opposed to the raw heat look at this yeah it is spicy but very manageable pass it on barry's out you can still taste the tuna which is a very delicate meat through that spice i can feel a sweat coming on but it's a comfortable sweat right mike next up your three minutes starts now i'm looking for a shake a shake yeah he's definitely a shaker yeah there's some warmth there if you're ever looking to try and balance out the heat of chili one of the things that's quite good is starch sushi rice bread mashed potatoes because what they do is they coat the tongue with starch and prevent the capsicum which is the powerful element from binding to those pain receptors so i wonder if the starch is helping you here where would you put it on a scale of one to ten in comfortableness zero being comfortable ten being very uncomfortable that puts me at about an eight already i in that case you have a very good poker face i felt an initial hit of what i would describe as violent spice but what's quite nice is the violence of it has remained consistent he's doing an amazing job because it's not an attempt and if if you're if you're pretending the truth and you think it's 8 out of 10. i'm i might be okay here i'll tell you what he's still smiling i i really like that you're dumb you look good three two one now tell the truth i was 100 honest so yeah i go for like a a six you know what i've got a funny feeling mike might be a crier later on his eyes are watering already what's interesting is the ghost chili the one in this was originally the world's hottest guinness world record since then more have been cultivated to be even hotter that's interesting to know then mike you've got five seconds and then will you reach for dairy or are you happy i'm going to power on through time up now you can tell us what you really feel i found that spicy i think jamie had a bit of eye widening i think mike had a bit of voice quivering i think barry gets the point in round two did not see that one coming i'm gonna need that point ironically this is slightly lower on the scoville scale but we'll talk about why it comes third in a minute lift the clutch what is that popcorn oh decent spicy buttered popcorn amazing oh no what's the catch your poker face challenge starts now as you start to eat i'm going to talk about this one this is blair's sudden death source this comes in their infamous coffin shaped box with skull key ring if any point you need the dairy you can tap out as it happens this is slightly lower on the shu or the scoville heat unit scale uh we're looking at about 150 000 so about a third of what you just had however this is raw habanero heat and there's kind of nothing to offset it unlike the starch of the sushi rice this is just there i'd like to hear from jamie how are you doing i'm doing good the butter is delicious the hot sauce that was an involuntary inhaler breath no i'm just thinking because the hot sauce is definitely stronger in terms of taste but also in terms of power slight moisture in the eyes some would say tears now don't forget any point you can reach for the dairy if you need the recovery and we are saying once your three minutes is up dairy is fine it's just three minutes you need to keep poke face you've got it mate don't cry i'm not crying you're two minutes in other ingredients in this beyond the red habanero we've got clover honey key lime juice siberian ginseng are you getting any of those subtleties no if i'm honest no oh that's a proper tear there um which is involuntary the poker face is actually quite good yeah mate you're doing a great job but you the rest your body isn't your eyes let you down i'm being let down last 20 seconds i think it's pretty good he's still going back for more he's gonna finish the portion time up how do you feel jay oh that's quite hot you can reach for dairy if you need a savior now the burps are going to come i can feel the hiccups anything that wasn't physiological you didn't give anything away no come take a seat next up is that some more milk barry your three minutes start now he's avoiding the lips that is very smart word of warning on the box it says caution this product contains the hottest known ingredients on the planet please use with extreme caution you're not giving much away you look confused more than in pain i'm not the heat guy but apparently today i am what all capsicum does is it's a fat or oil based substance that latches itself onto your pain receptors which is why your brain senses heat there is no technical heat it is just the sensation of believing in heat because it's latched onto pain receptors how's that pain for you barry oh i can see a twinkle of it oh no it's coming isn't it it definitely gets warmer well you're two minutes in you've got such sad eyes smiling please tears of happiness oh okay what was that now blairs also say that this sauce will melt your face off no no no you keep saying no that's not very poker face-y imagine you've got pocket aces imagine you've got pocket aces what you're thinking is he gonna tap out oh you got 30 seconds to survive come on no you can do this hold on hold on hold on oh no did you survive it ben how do you think barry's poker face is right now you were so cocky in the first minute please don't wipe your eyes put your times up i thought i had that you did for the first time to a point and then i felt my face and my eyes go it's a real grower and then i looked at the mouth i had left and panicked and then everyone starts laughing i can't feel my tongue now in fact that's getting worse so the problem is the capsicum is probably still bound to your tongue the good thing about milk is the proteins in the milk will also bind and will kind of knock the capsule off which is why milk and dairy and yogurt is better than water damn [Music] cheers cheers enjoy mike [Laughter] mike same as before your three minutes start now i am just so happy to be here mind over mata i feel very happy ben i just love eating popcorn with my friends it's really good if there's a theme tune in your mind might right now what would it be i've kind of got the happy days theme tune in sunday monday happy days tuesday wednesday i feel like i'm still in the barry taylor stages of thinking that this is going to be okay are you getting into the nuance of clover honey key lime juice siberian ginseng oh ben if you hadn't have listed those things i would have told you those ingredients because they stand out so much that would be my breath [Laughter] well done mike this popcorn is absolutely delicious and you're not feeling the need to reach for the milk no i'm having too much of a good time then i'm having such a great time how long left still got a minute left oh that's fantastic news so far the best poker face i've seen he isn't giving off involuntary tears he's so happy to be here i am happy yeah also dead inside i have eaten all of this wonderfully delicious popcorn and you still have 30 seconds remaining you can reach for the uh yogurt or milk if you want no i don't want it because it would take away this wonderful flavor that i'm getting right now [Music] oh i'm having such fun oh this is wonderful isn't it last 15 seconds involuntary fart over here functions last 10 seconds like and subscribe if you're enjoying this pain please do and your time is up well done you can now have some daring that was amazing well done mate not even a sweat on the brow i'm enjoying his tigers fantastic i might have to steal that well do you know what there is no doubt that mike you won round three that was a very good poker face thank you you joined barry in the lead round four hello mike here again sorry we've just paused the video to ask you to subscribe and hit the bell you won't regret it promise and it really does make a difference so thank you back to the video i think you might enjoy this one ben on our food team his tasting notes this nearly finished me off in what way see how much you enjoy i'm looking forward to it already oh bloody mary you have a bloody mary complete with da bomb chili sauce your three minute poker face challenge begins now oh that was a big old goal the thing with pain receptors is the ice cold water content confuses your brain because it tells your brain for a minute the fire's been put out and then when it dissipates the pain's still there it tricks your brain and it gets even worse because your brain goes oh no i thought it was out but it's definitely not it's such a honest thing you you could never tell a lie very cause your face gives it all away no i i've never been a good liar but i am enjoying this are you enjoying that because are you enjoying it because we've muddled it with cucumber a little bit of lemon you've got the tomato juice mix vodka finished with aleppo pepper around the rim [Laughter] one minute in the cucumber it's really refreshing i don't know if i've ever appreciated cucumber so much how refreshing cucumber is it's bringing you to tears it's so good what happened to the singing i'm singing my head you don't need it jay it comes with a warning this sauce is extremely hot keep out of reach of children and consume one drop at a time with extreme caution that's probably understandable it's fine just describe the sensations that are going on in your mouth obviously without giving anything away one word burning oh really yeah well you can't tell mate you're doing a great job 15 seconds remaining in your poker face challenge he's talking a good talk his face is giving it away it's not voluntary giving it away i'm fine i'm fine honestly your face looks like it's his peak you've now leveled out you think too yeah you made it fine one challenge over and i'm falling apart a little bit can i take this milk oh he did very well jamie just went for a walk and that doesn't bode well and he locked himself into the bathroom i'm glad he muted his microphone [Music] i don't like bloody mary come on baz you've got this mate all i can learn from this is the most impressive round so far was michael hodgestown just be happy monday tuesday happy days that's it barry your three minutes starts now come on come on the straw is there so you don't get on your lips oh oh yummy oh so tomato i wish it wasn't tomato the company started with hot habanero peppers and blended them with smoky chipotle peppers and natural pepper extract to create a sauce go with the ice yeah that's good to create a sauce that has been lab tested at only 135 thousand six hundred and this confuses us because on the scoville so he's gone he's tempted tapped out how long what's that um ah 47 seconds would you like ice cream yogurt is also good because it will cling to your tongue how silly how very fitting let's rewind to a minute ago sunday monday happy birthday tuesday wednesday i would like to have my ice cream ready for me please how you feeling mike i just watched that whole episode unfold and now it's my turn how do you think i feel you're already in the lead so you could step down now tap out throughout and that would leave jamie to win this round no way i'm happily gonna stroll into the win your three-minute poker face challenge starts now i can't watch i can't watch this i'm having a lovely time there's some warmth straight away that has positively come on far quicker than any of the others but i love it it's delicious oh it grows i'm gonna have some more would you say it's beyond insanity mike hmm it's beyond insanity how much of a wonderful time i'm having right this second ben i'm loving it i'm gonna go back for some real it's so backwards it's actually easier to drink more than it is to try and talk i'm gonna eat this cucumber the shakes have started i need to lie down again i can't do this i'm feeling the pain watching i just go lie down it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows oh sometimes i get a good feeling you are two minutes into your three minutes of poker face and i think you're having a lovely time i am so impressed 30 seconds still remaining you can grab for the dairy if you want i don't want it because it would mask this delicious flavor you're having such a lovely time yeah three two one grab the dairy so on some sites the de bomb sources are claimed to be 1.5 million on the scoville scale but we know for a fact in a bloody mary it is one of the hottest hottest things we've ever tried that is by far the hottest thing that we've had today if i was playing poker i think i'd want to play opposite that positivity mike takes the point for the poker face challenge which gives him the overall win do you feel like a winner mike no it wasn't

like how I would drink from it put my well it is upright Trek upright the holes are there yeah that's just the drinking though and I drink it I drink it like this upright and I put my straw how does it work I mean I read the rules online and that's what a dead tie I made something that was completely following the rules correct why would you charge this for two I mean we followed the rules we didn't break any rules which rule are we breaking then a break right a breaks like this and then yeah why would this be afraid that's up right why would that be a first that's how you do it so Bradley or this is an upgrade because my drinking holes right here how am I gonna drink it like this is going to still up right like that well no no I want to drink it afraid how it follows the rules perfectly how is this afraid it'll spill out I mean I'm following all three guys's rules really not how I take this like you don't drink it like this right no I do drink you're like do you think that like that's all we have this way yeah how am I gonna if I drink it like this if you're claiming this is upright and I drink it upright yeah isn't it gonna spill out of here well I mean I came I drove down to this one already yeah but I'm not breaking the rules I mean I'm not gonna like what rule in my vending no I mean this is the only way could be considered a fret it has the little legs right here so I could fit up right that is a this is a break right so in a bottle stand upright ready so it's not about gallon bottle doing a lot right the big five gallon water bottle came up where it stands upright but after this is I have a picture of someone that's not going to do anything what they what they need to do is just follow the rules as it says right here correct I mean if I was breaking a rule I would go home say you know what I did something wrong it's the first one I came to try somewhere else I mean I'd rather not because I'd already drove down to here I don't want to waste my gas and so there's one stray bomb I mean why can't I do it here though cuz I told you what you told me this is up right but according to you if I have it up right like this it's going to spill up greater and I rot the foot up all the way well it's bring your own compass test fill up your cup ride around Philadelphia right like this I'd have to turn it up great to fill it up that's fine this is a breakfast is the drinking from the bottles and all the sizes are in containers have you ever stopped every tool you know should you guys choose the manager man Wow there's not more me to go for him so she told us that we could pay for two refills three dollars it going up right by me nor following the rules I alright guys so these 7-eleven people are not being nice we're going to go to another tow so we just went to the 7-eleven on Somerset Lakewood here in Bellflower California they told us that our bottle which perfectly fits the description in the rules is not considered it's not conceptive oh because it's not upright but if I he wants me to consider it as a whole length which would which would it make sense because then if I drink it the whole length so it's still out of the drinking hole that we created right here so we're going to go try another one [Music] [Music] it's yeah yeah Oh [Music] all right destroy me Oh all right so this kind guys say yes so we're
