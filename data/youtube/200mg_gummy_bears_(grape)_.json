gonna do it but I just don't know about posting it on YouTube so we're thinking in one week I'm gonna do it on snapchat so if you add my snapchat now one week from today on Thursday's video I'll pop it right here that's like my real name and the reason for that is because snapchat we know will not delete it Steve's tired of doing these liquor slams and then they just get deleted right away yeah so snapchat we know [ __ ] people jerk off and girls finger themselves on that and [ __ ] so we know talking about that later you guys got one week add them up yeah double-barrel serach today we have 45 hundred milligrams of THC with the aftermath pretty [ __ ] it's enough that you know if an elephant wanted a good stone that's probably not even the dosage they use they probably toned it down a little bit coming soon we're gonna be dropping a bunch of new merch and for the first time ever Steve will do it merch these are in order for you guys to like me for me I got staying real so I'm gonna stay real [ __ ] the you know for my challenges I gotta get stoned I gotta get drunk it's just how it goes so you're gonna see it you know so let's [ __ ] get it do it these are sour patch kids each one contains 350 milligrams so to put a bunch of the ball how are you alive yeah a little bloodshot I'm already one deep one whole package deep these smell like straight weed yeah it's gotta be an even time one two three four that's eleven oh that's twelve eleven times 350 that's about twenty five hundred twelve times three is three six wow you're a [ __ ] shitty Asian alright let's let's run it so this is called the stony patch meatball I guess just come up with that yeah this is Paul the one done it's a little bit more than the brownies just [ __ ] it's more than five well mmm are you one deep so 13 Bach she did get into [ __ ] to put a [ __ ] elephant on full-blast socks the phone for like 30 seconds okay so our Eddie ate one full packet of gummies because right when we wake up in the morning we work out and yes we've been doing for the past two hours make sense yes dude this nice side [Music] later maybe share your note now I'm good again up close and this is [ __ ] [Music] young billing pouch 13 total 4550 if you guys didn't see already I did a 4000 milligram brownie challenge if you haven't seen that the links in the description go check that out this is five hundred fifty milligrams more than the bomb video from up in it here that was a lot pre-workout if you guys wonder why I like to smoke so much and get high all the time it's because I love to work out stoned it's a lot of fun for me I work out hard when I'm stoned so so basically I'm working out like all day like every day I feel like now ever since this YouTube things because I have to stay the healthiest man alive and can't get fat and at the same time he's 30 patties with 30 slices of cheese and still look like you know [ __ ] like 9 oh you look like drunk thank you so we're gonna wait

Discovery Museum of San Jose and if you are watching us live right now go ahead and put your name in the comments say hello I'm moderating at the same time and I would love to give you a greeting back and just see what scientists are out there so this week we have been doing a whole bunch of different activities and reading books that have to do with water so of course we're going to go ahead and bring that into science as well and I thought you know this is a great time to do the monster bear experiment and to talk about osmosis because that has to do with water so no reason to be scared we say monster bear because of perhaps how this experiment is going to turn out but no Bears will be harmed in this experiment so let's go ahead and talk about our different materials that we're gonna need then we'll go ahead and set up do our experiment we'll come back and we'll talk about how the experiment went and what osmosis is and what that has to do with what we're doing okay so you see laid out here all the different things that we're going to need for this experiment except for one thing I'll tell you that in just a second so going through these really quickly you're going to need some salt it doesn't really matter what kind I have some iodine salt but you really don't need that so just regular table salt works fine you're going to need some water so I have my spigot here you'll also need some sugar just regular sugar that you cook with three different containers and I have glass ones so if you've got glasses I've got ramekins just something smaller make sure that these are ones that can be put in the microwave safely so nothing metal you will also need a tablespoon we're going to do a little bit of measurement today going to need just a regular spoon and this is for stirring and then last but certainly not least I shouldn't say last second to last you're going to need some gummy bears now I got ones that are all the same color that way we can see maybe what changes throughout this experiment so just like some other experiments we've done one of the hardest parts of this one is not to eat your experiment so these are for experiments not for eating and then the one thing that you don't actually see here which is behind the camera is a microwave so you're going to need one of those as well alright so now that we have all of our materials including the one that's going in the camera looks good and set up our experiment so I got kind of a jumpstart on this experiment I went ahead and filled my lil ramekins with about a cup of water so you can see that there is kind of up to the line and I filled all three of them with the same amount of water so that's how we're going to start and then two of these were actually going to change so one is going to stay just water and then these other two we're going to change with the salt and the sugar so let's go ahead and get to that part of the experiment and then we will do our experiment hope you're feeling brave there bears let's go [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you [Music] all right my fellow scientists we have saved our bears from all the different polls that they had been swimming in all evening and I kept their labels so we know what exactly they were all swimming in at the time you'll also notice that I left an original bear so we know what they look like before the experiment so osmosis let's talk about that what is that well that is when you have something like water move from one material through what's called a membrane to another area or material so let's think about this you could have an area that's got a lot of stuff in it then you have that membrane or like a door that you would walk through then the other side maybe doesn't have a whole lot of stuff in there well when that door is open those two sides want to even each other out so they're gonna come together and they're gonna mix until they have something that's closer to if not even on both sides well that's what happened to the bear that's water that has been moving through that membrane or that door so for example we have the bear that was in water well I said that was water moving right we noticed we actually dropped the bear in the water and then we went ahead and watched it grow watched it absorb water well why did it absorb water why did osmosis happen there well inside the bear there is a little bit of water but there's a lot of sugar and there's gelatin well the water when it comes in contact with that bear it wants to get into that bear because there's not a whole lot of water there again what's even itself out so the bear starts to expand as I start soaking up that water just like a sponge would now this is after you know a few hours think about what would happen if we left it in there for days wouldn't even still be there would it get to a certain size and then start breaking up maybe something you want to try at home okay so what about sugar water because I said there's sugar in bear but I also just said there's sugar in the water well there's more sugar in the bear so the water is still gonna want to go into that bear and so you're gonna get that bear get a little bit bigger what about the salt because there's no sugar in there well salt is actually smaller than sugar so when we dissolve that salt we actually had more salt in the water then there was sugar in the batter so again the waters gonna think there's more room outside and it's gonna start leaving the bear on the salt side so other ways you can see house Moses happening you've ever been in a pool for way too long when it was your fingers it kind of puffy and wrinkly right that's osmosis the waters evening things out you're actually absorbing that water crazy right or if you have dried fruit you then put it into a glass of water what he thinks gonna happen that fruit is going to absorb and osmosis is going to happen so it's going to get bigger water she's gonna enter into that piece of fruit you could also try this with dry vegetables if you have them so that is how osmosis could work with bears so again I hope you enjoyed this will go ahead and put a hashtag down below if you want to show us your bears if you use other gummy animals or if you use different liquids you could try that as well and see which way things travel always interesting to see so thank you for tuning in we very much appreciate our time and hopefully you did as well and we will see you next time as science is everywhere bye guys thank you for

the easy way this is the easy way there's so many ways on the internet I just this is what three ingredients four ingredients actually if you include the water okay so you are going to need Knox gelatin I'm gonna bring you up just so it's not crooked you will need Knox gelatin okay or brand name gelatin don't go I've tried to go the cheap route and just by no-name gelatin I'm telling you folks I don't know what these name brands stop having them but there is an extra ingredient or something that allows this to work so you will need Knox gelatin only two packets okay so I have my two packets of Knox gelatin you will also need half a cup of kind of oil which is kind of this oil or coconut oil infused with cannabis so this is kind of coconut oil a measuring cup because you need half a cup of hot water and whatever brand of jello you want to use today I am using grape okay so it's gonna get a little shaky I'm sorry so do not turn on your stove yet what you do first is put your dry ingredients in first so you're gonna add your jello I'm opening it up oh god I broke a nail okay so just put your jello in whatever flavor and use name-brand jell-o do not use no-name jello its I'm not sponsored by them or anything but it does make a difference folks okay you can try it doing in a cheaper way but I'm telling you it's not gonna work they won't set right though they'll separate that Kenoi 'el will separate from the jello and you'll get a two-tone candy gummy bear and it looks terrible and it tastes terrible so we put our gelatin in again you're doing the dry ingredients first grape jelly smells good my garbage aside and then you're gonna want to mix this really well so that you don't see the white crystals anywhere on top you can even do it this way just shake it about it works it either way of stirring it or just shifting it in the pot pan and I'm using a nonstick pot it's very important that you use a nonstick pot as well so I am going to add my half of cup of hot water I did boil it already and now it's okay to turn on the stove because you're putting in your water I have mine at medium art whoops terribly sorry about that just mix it around you're gonna want to make sure that the there's no clumps in here and all the grit is gone you don't want to feel great at the bottom of the pan you want to make sure it's smooth much like how you would make it when you make you jello so we're just going to stir this around for a little bit for a few minutes just to make sure everything's separated and something fell on my burner sorry so what you also need while that is it'll boil a little bit it's just on four but what you also need are molds okay and what I have here and you'll see it over on the other side once this mixture is ready and you will need one of these little plunger things but if you where did I buy these I think I bought these at bulk barn I think I bought them at bulk barn and when you buy them you get three of these trays which have 50 divots each they're little gummy bears 50 divots each so you get 150 total in three trays and you get two or three of these little plungers to suck up the stuff and the mixture and put it in here so you're not burning yourself or using a spoon or anything like that okay and because there's always overflow it makes more than 150 I have my other trusty Molde here with the emoji faces on them so yeah I mean it's pretty basic it only takes a few minutes what takes the longest in my opinion is having them solidify in the fridge so I think this is pretty well mixed yeah it's mixed so just because I'm going to rush it but don't rush it because of a mixture might not work out as well it's actually starting to bubble so I chose great because I find that you taste the can of oil I know it doesn't bother some people but I like to taste the sweetness and the sugar and stuff so I guess you could put it less than half a cup in there you could put a quarter cup in here depending on your tolerance but my tolerance is quite high I eat a fair bit of edibles and I do consume it by smoking it so throughout the day and so I use a half a cup of the can oil so it's pretty good right now I think I'm just going to add the can of oil okay so we're gonna add it slowly just make sure that it gets mixed in there's a lot of stirring involved in this it's just I mean I've watched different people do it online and I know some people just leave it be but I don't I prefer to keep stirring it because I find the more you're stirring it the more it's going to stay mixed together I find it separates a lot sometimes so just be careful of that be cautious and be aware because if they don't mix well when they're solidifying they separate and it gives you a two tone candy I don't like that I find the butter it just or the kind of oil separates from the gelatin and I don't know why that is so I prefer to do it mixing it a lot stir stir stir came and add the rest of it you know just see the gelatine ah oh no glad I noticed that it's a little hair there so you want to mix this once all the butter or the can oil sorry I keep saying butter and used to make it with butter instead of the coconut oil but it's just it's not butter it's coconut oil so I'm sorry if I keep saying butter I don't mean butter I mean it's kind of oil kind of as coconut oil so now it's starting to heat better and it's gonna boil up as you can see which is good you do want that but stir as it does that so you're gonna want to stir it for about five minutes you might have to turn your stove down like I'm going to do cuz I find that's bubbling too much I'm actually gonna lift it up off the stove and move you up I'm sorry my phone's getting a little hot I'm gonna move you over here okay you can still see hahaha sit in the bunk pot they're just silly to do that so yeah I'm oh five minutes four to five minutes you're going to want to keep stirring it as it's sitting on the stove on medium four or five degrees depending on how your stove how hot your stove gets but it's pretty well mixed even the stuff on the side is mixed into the pot I'm gonna lift it up just so I can see how well it's mixed and then it's all mixed and looking well together excuse me I'm sorry about that so I hope you guys enjoy this video I can't believe I've never showed you guys how to make gummies before but this is homemade gummies they're not gonna taste exactly like and the textures not going to be exactly like this way the way I'm showing you I mean they still taste gummy obviously because of the gelatin and this is the easy cheap way to make yourself some gummies you can use whatever mold you like but I prefer to use the little gummy bear molds and the emoji molds okay I'm gonna shut the heat or actually no I'm gonna keep the heat on low because the mixture kind of cools itself down when you're dispersing it into the mold so having it a heat source is a good thing because it helps keep it hot or warm depending on what temperature you're gonna keep it set at when you're putting it into the mold it's important not to have it too higher you're just gonna burn the mixture and it's not gonna work at all so I've got it on low because I'm going to get ready to put it into the molds and I move the pot back and forth but since I'm filming it I'm gonna put you in another spot yes so that looks really good it's mixed really well I don't see a lot of the remnants of the the cano around the rim which is nice that means I've been stirring enough and there it's gone off the spoon or the mixing spatula okay I'm gonna move you over here you're gonna see my broken picture on the floor I can't believe that happened to fell right off the wall and boom down to the ground it went and it smashed okay it's kind of crooked you guys are gonna be having crooked necks trying to watch this oops well I'm sorry for all the movement I'm just trying to get it so that I can film it set it like that then okay here we go you have our little little miniature turkey basters [Laughter] okay here we go so just take some up obviously you guys know how these little things work where are we start on this end okay and sometimes I noticed because it's so hot it'll squirt back out I'd yeah it's kind of hard to see that but just be careful this stuff is really hot so you just put it in squeeze it into your molds kind of at medium to fast pace because this whoops this stuff cools fairly quickly I notice when I'm doing them but you will get if you're using this small gummy bear molds about a hundred and fifty plus gummies yeah so you can once they are solidified I've noticed some people on the internet use sugar powder I can't remember confection powder sugar to sprinkle on them because they are a little oily from the kind of oil that's mixed with them but I don't do that I just keep them in the fridge and then if I want some because obviously the touched her when they're in the fridge constantly is a little harder than if you left them at room temperature once they are all solidified and ready to be eat so you just continue ba-ba-ba-ba-ba get them all in there squeezing as you go so yeah I just I couldn't believe I was looking through my videos going yeah indeed I've never shown anyone how to make the gummy bear so this is how you do it this is my way of doing it this is and I find the texture fine you just got to make sure that you're also doing this stirring it around because it does separate and putting it back on the stove is a nice idea to keep the temperature hot whoops making a bit of a mess but I mean I'm sure instead of using cannabis oil to make these like some type of edible or treat for the kids leave out the kind of oil obviously oops no there we go was a little raised up there we gotta have them even so they harden properly and they're all ready to go at the same time you know what I mean so I find this fun to do this I mean I love to bake especially when they're edibles we're almost done here folks I'm actually gonna put this back on the stove for a second be right back just noticed it was starting separate you don't want that to happen okay all right she didn't had the stove on hot so I might take a little longer for you guys if you have it on medium or low so obviously we're gonna get more than 150 there's 25 in each of those gummy bear sheets so we're just gonna fill these up now obviously the emoji the pink sheet that I'm doing right now is going to take longer to harden because they're deeper bigger so I won't be showing you those but I'm hoping that these little ones if I put them in the freezer will solidify really well and I'll be able to show you them in the video no guarantees because my phone's been really wacky lately and when I pause it it shuts off on my phone sometimes so we're getting to the very last of it and it will the last few gummies will be very mediciney because of the butter that stays behind that's really what I'm soaking up here I can just see the difference so I'm just gonna pour it in there okay okay so I am going to cheat and put them in the freezer alrighty and hopefully hey that looks see that that looks like the Mickey Mouse symbol you see that a little dollop right there two ears all righty so that's what we do so far so good okay got a bit of the counter in there that one was never used so I'm gonna put these in the freezer hopefully when I pause it it won't mess up but if it does I'm sorry and I'll show them to you in another short video so we're gonna pause it and put them in the freezer for about ten minutes okay see you soon folks and if not love and Huggies and I'll show you the finished product in another video if that's what happens okay so that's how you make gummy bears folks it's pretty simple it's pretty basic and it's really easy and quick it's quick nothing to it the longest it takes in my opinion is to solidify them in the fridge which is usually about 15 20 minutes but we're gonna cheat and use the freezer okay lemon honey see you soon right alrighty so it only took five minutes but here are some this is what they look like whoops it's just what they look like gonna eat one so yeah so there you go folks oh my gosh where's the camera here we go ha ha sorry so yeah they look like rug dummies they just taste a little different you know what I mean so there it is I'm actually gonna have a couple more and put them back in the fridge but there they are dummies ready to be eaten folks lovin Huggies stay true stay unique and enjoy I hope you enjoyed the video folks and I hope you give it a try and if you do please let me know how it turned out ok bye", "o9c3-FqnrVI": "what up YouTube it's me Rashad a couple of my subscribers they hit me up in the comments and never fight how do you make gummy worms and kool-aid I'm about to show you how the technique that I use to make Magnum worms just so I can understand how I make them come on let me show you out so in order to make you good mornings with kool-aid you're gonna need it a couple things you're gonna need some sandwich bags you eat this this this one right here just thing of kool-aid this container DV something works alright yeah I've been eating on this thing I know so it ain't gonna be a full amount but it usually makes about 23 bags when you bag them up and put a pin in there first things first is you want to wash your hands so before that wash your hands before you touch any air anything all right I'm a working man as well so you get another plastic bag and you you do it like this I'm gonna put ten in the bag that's how I do it alright that's four that's ten in the bag that quick alright then let me show you how I put the kool-aid in it you just get a scoop like this right you see it's kool-aid in here you get a scoop I don't have to be a full scoop and you never put a fluid after much and you go like that in this watch I have a link in the description if you want to find out about this watch it's a cool watch you get from Amazon well yeah that's all you put up again that's all you put up in there and then you rub it around like that and you go like this it's I get all the air out so you don't want it to pop and you don't you want to save as much space in your bag as possible alright so now that's cool when you put it aside if you're making a bunch of these what I did was I put 10 in the bag right I built up the whole bag 10 10 10 10 10 that's all artists anyone who's going out of here alright that's right all those dimmer ones were going I'll get the scoops and up I'll get the scoops like this and I'll pour them in the bags and then I'll tie them up like I said I'll put them all in the bag right I'll shake it up and I'll tie it up get the air out and inside the trip you gonna need some of these little kool-aid packets to make the great time you could experiment with other flavors but I've tried it a couple of times with other flavors and nothing that comes close to the great time alright like I tried orange and didn't taste right but you can try an experiment you pour the regular kool-aid in there right you see how much is in there it's only that much because I'm not gonna pour it on me good I'm not gonna make that me all right and then you pour this one in there and see how it looks pouring it in there but you don't want to pour too much of this kind in here because it's real potent like it's real sour and then you mix it like this right it doesn't have to get real purple but if it you don't want it to be too pink or it's not going to taste that great if that's a freakin word this is great it's not a word okay it's not going to taste very much like grape it is trooper this is to paint compared to that pink one that's purple when you see it that's the paint regular and that's the one mix and I'll just make a city anymore just because okay these are the normal gummy worms with kool-aid and hair are the great ones but more pinkish and grape ones look more purplish now when you leave them in your bag overnight it precipitates they like it'll be moisture in the bag but that's normal all right that's how you make them work the kool-aid I'm done subscribe the light fighters I got more videos coming out random videos technology videos this me blah blah too long this channel just show you how to do stuff you want to know how to do something in the comments come out over shot talk to y'all later see you on my next video another", "1PTvRxfVKKE": "[Music] hi guys and welcome back to my channel so today he is gonna be a voiceover because I'm calm at feeling my hair today so right now you see me porn in very blue gelatin that I got from Kerrville you can use any jello this is what I had in my pantry so you're gonna go ahead and pour it into your pot you can also pop this in the microwave and just pour it on a cup if you're in a rush so right now just pour it in and that cuz I'm going to get two packets of gelatin and pouring in my pie also if you're putting is microwave you can do it the same way you can just use a measuring cup or a regular cup so right now I'm just pouring in my packets of gelatin you can use 3 if you want to be more firm next I'm adding a cup of water and HR that painting so you can add more and sages make sure you add another packet of gelatin so it could be firm and not you know mushy negative you're gonna do is you're gonna turn your stove on to medium heat and basically you're gonna store every store ha you're gonna stir everything together until you know all the clumps from the gelatin and the jello is mixed and melted together so right now you just see me stirring it around and so it's nuts together you can also you know put this in the microwave I keep stressing the microwave because I used to salt on that dish out you could just put it in the measuring cup in a microwave for like 2 minutes and you're done but make sure you watch it because if you don't watch it it's gonna bubble up and you're gonna have jello everywhere so yeah right now you just see me stirring it together and you can see everything is starting to melt like how I like it so next I'm going to add a teaspoon of Hennessy right now I'm just stirring it together you know how you make noodles and like it's not coming to a boil but it's not cold anymore that's where you wanna you know start stirring it a little bit more and putting that extra shot at Hanasi in there because sometimes when you're cooking it it can I guess burn out if you want to use I'm Anna use noodles but I'm black Gardens there I'm talking about so right now I'm stirring it and about to put it in my measuring cup this helps me pour it in and not spill it everywhere got my stove looks so dirty but I don't care you're probably like why are you mentioning your stove but YouTube trolls be on it and I just want to let you I know I had cooked a whole meal for me and my fiance and it kind of got messed up it messed up the whole kitchen but it's okay I'm gonna clean up after this video so right now you just see me pouring in the gelatin and after you pour it in you're gonna let it cool for ten minutes you're gonna see me motion in ten minutes and the reason why are you gonna let it cool for ten minutes so it won't spill when you put in the frigerator after it cooled down place in the fridge for ten more so after you take it out the fridge it's gonna be easy to pop out so this way it looks like it's all pretty and whatnot so right now I'm just popping out all about a little blue hearts you know that's a gang all that you know oh no I'd be saying I'm on voiceover done by me so right now like I said I'm just placing it on my plate to make it look pretty excuse that blue stain I made a drink like three weeks ago and I cannot get it out if you guys have any tips on how to get like food coloring off of your tables and shelves and stuff please let me know so right now you just see me showing off my little beautiful creation and next I'm going to add some sugar on top or you can add some citric acid that's what I used to add sorry now I'm just adding sugar to make it look pretty and there you have it some infuse gummies thank you guys for watching make sure you like subscribe to my channel bye", "ifjcIiolSS8": "[Music] what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to be making cannabis gummy bears so let's get into it [Music] so the first thing you want to do is measure out your cannabis i'm going to be using seven grams of cannabis to make my gummy bears [Music] all right guys i got my seven grams of cannabis so now i'm going to put this in a mason jar and the carpet all right guys so now i'm going to decarb our cannabis for about 40 minutes and the oven temperature that i'm going to be using is 240. [Music] so all right guys so while your cannabis is the carving measure out your coconut oil so for this recipe we're going to be using a quarter cup of coconut oil i'm going to be using coconut mct oil to make my gummy bears so even though we're going to be using a quarter cup of coconut oil i'm going to measure out a half a cup of coconut oil because we're going to lose some of that coconut oil during the infusing process so just keep that in mind all right guys my cannabis is now the carb so now i'm going to add our coconut oil to the mason jar now i'm going to add a teaspoon of lecithin to my mason jar all right guys so now we're going to do is put this in a pot and let it simmer for about two hours add your pot to the stove [Music] add your mason jar now let it simmer for about two hours all right guys so i've been over two hours so now we're going to filter out our cannabis [Music] all right guys my cannabis coconut oil is now done so now let's start working on the cannabis gummies so before we start working on our gummies i'm going to spray my gummy molds with this non-stick cookie spray all right guys so now what i'm going to do is put my pipe on the stove and now we're going to turn the temperature on low [Music] so now i'm going to add in my water i'm going to be using 2 3 cups of water [Music] guys what i actually recommend you to do is turn your stove on like medium heat just so it can speed up the heating process and then once my water get kind of hot i'm going to reduce the temperature back down to two and then add in my cannabis oil and then all of the other ingredients so um so that's what i'm gonna do all right guys so i let my temperature stay on medium heat for about two minutes and now i can see the water is starting to boil a little bit so now what i'm gonna do is reduce the temperature back down to low [Music] all right so now we're going to do is add the candle oil [Music] now i'm just going to mix it together now another thing too guys usually water and oil wouldn't mix but that's why i added the lecithin to my can of oil so if you already have kind of oil made and it's not made with lecithin at this point i would add a teaspoon of lecithin so just keep that about all right guys so we're going to keep the temperature on low and i'm just going to let the water and the wall incorporate together all right guys my mist is fully incorporated so now we're going to add the unflavored [Music] gelatin [Music] and just mix it together so i'm just going to mix for about 2-3 minutes i want to make sure everything is incorporated all right guys so now we're going to do is add in our pack of [Music] jello [Music] all right guys so now we're going to do is add our mix to the mold all right guys so once you finish filling your modes put your bows in the freezer for a few hours [Music] all right guys so been about four hours so now we're going to remove the gummy bears from the mood so now what i'm trying to do is just remove some of the extra gummies from the gummy bears if that make any sense so so this right here i'm going to strip that from the gummy bears just to make it look a little bit better [Music] there we go [Music] all right guys my cannabis gummy bears is now done to my left is the medium-sized gummy bears and to my right is the small size gummy bears i personally like the medium size better but what i'm going to do is leave the link for both sides in the description below but um thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace [Music] you", "nzz5J9B1GC8": "hey hey hey good-looking I'm so glad that you came to my kitchen today just sit there and see what we all have cooking well grab ahold and I swing right back to my kitchen and let's get cookin good-lookin today we're gonna take a walk on the wild side and work at a center make our salsa some CBD gummy bears so be sure to follow me and let's get cookin good-lookin did someone say CBD coming bears uh-huh well I sure did follow me and I'm gonna show you just how it's done let's get started good-looking so what you're gonna be needing for your CBD gummy bears is a half a cup of water now I have a half a cup of water here I have myself a container right here and I'm just gonna sit there and dump my half cup of water into my container now let's go on with the rest of the ingredients you're gonna need 1 tablespoon of the Knox gelatin so let's go ahead I'm gonna open this up always always always measure out okay it's not quite a tablespoon so we're gonna have to sit there and get another packet and so I had take that tablespoon of the NOx gelatin and we're gonna sit there and let it soften and bloom for at least a minute or so okay the NOx gelatin has softened and now let's go on with the recipe now you're gonna have to choose a flavor that you're gonna want to make your gummy bears to be but it's gonna have to be some type of a jello you know whatever it you could even make homemade jell of kool-aid packages whatever flavor you want is a flavor that you know we're gonna make we're gonna need 1/3 ounce package of any flavor so I'm choosing to use the tropical fusion this is what yours is gonna look like after we put the jello in and we mix it all up now I'm handing it off to chef Mike and he's just gonna sit there and warm all this up and we'll take it from there but basically you're gonna want everything to be dissolved chef Mike just handed it back off to me and he cooked it for about one minute halfway through we stirred it and now I'm stirring it all again now we need to sit there and let this cool down a little bit you do not want to sit there and add your CBD oil when it is too hot so I always sit there and let this cool down a little bit and then we're gonna sit there and put the CBD oil in it now talking about the CBD oil now they recommend that you sit there and you start out with a low dosage and if you need to have more youth that's when you start working your way up to the higher dosages so this recipe calls for 300 milligrams of CBD oil and also talking about the CBD oil always buy it from somebody that knows what they're doing now I go to registered pharmacist and I bought my CBD oil from him so with that all being said I just wanted to sit there put my little two cents in about the CBD oils I buy mine from a pharmacist all right I brought out my little digital thermometer and I'm just gonna sit there I want to make sure if we're gonna be getting this I want to sit there and see what the temperature of the jello mix is so let's go ahead I'm gonna turn it on I'm gonna point it right on in there and it's telling me it's at 111 112 degrees so I'm gonna sit there and add our CBD oil right now to it so I'm gonna measure it out okay and now let's go ahead put it in now you're gonna want to sit there and mix this up really good and keep mixing when you think you mixed it up good enough keep mixing okay I'm quite confident I mix that all up now let's go ahead and talk about what mold you're gonna be using I know I said we're gonna be using the gummy bears so I have a gummy bear mold here and I have it set on the cookie tray that way I can sit there and easily transport these and you can sit there get other ones you know you can get ones for holidays whatnot as long as you have some candy molds basically it's what you need now next thing is you're gonna need some cooking spray now you're gonna want to spray each one of these candy molds all up now when I'm spraying my candy molds I like taking all my things over by my kitchen sink and going like this and spraying because you're always cleaning your sink anyways when you're doing dishes so let's go ahead and I'm gonna go over by my sink and I'm gonna get my candy molds a good spritz okay now that I sprayed my molds all up I'm gonna sit there and grab the gummy bear mixture here I'm gonna give it a final stir before I do place it inside they cut me bear molds gummy bears are on their way baby now I'm gonna go ahead fill my molds up you don't have to thumb up all the way all the cameras right before me - I don't so I'm gonna continue to do this off camera because the cameras really not being useful it's in my way right now so I'm gonna fill up my little gummy bear molds here and we'll be right there okay I have my molds filled up with the tropical fusion gummy bears now I'm gonna make up another package and I'm gonna continue to fill up the rest of my tray here as you see I finished up filling up my gummy bear molds that on your countertop for 30 minutes these sat on the corner for the 30 minutes now I'm gonna sit there and transfer them over to the refrigerator for an additional 30 minutes and I know I'm gonna get asked why was there more of the purple than the tropical fusion well that's because I used this I buy this old for from the Amish and it was the black cherry gelatin from them and it tells you to use 1/3 cup so I used what my recipe here calls for now that's the one reason why I had more than what I had when I used the tropical fusion okay I brought these out of the refrigerator now time to pop them right out of their molds I'm gonna just remove these and put them off to the side so I can show you what we're going to do so okay I removed one of the gummies go ahead I want you to make all your gummy bears stand to attention just like that so I'm gonna continue I'm molding all my gummy bears and making them all stand to attention just as they are right here and there you go folks that's how easy it is oh I see we got a roll one going again now we're just gonna sit there and leave these that sometimes they don't want to cooperate with you okay fine they don't stay in these on end the ones that aren't standing which I like to call the bad news bears but all the other ones that are standing attention we're gonna sit there and I allow them to sit like this for two days now this is gonna sit there and let them toughen up and dehydrate a little bit more and become more of them little Hasbro gummy bears that y'all no one loves so much but there's one further step that we have to sit there but they're one another one that we have to sit there and take this one more step further after this stage so like this for two days come on load guy you guys get with the program now stand up student you I'll see you in two days two days have gone by now what you're gonna want to do to the ones that are standing up is let me sit there and zoom down a little bit such as this one here you're gonna want to sit there and take it and just lay that little guy down like I have all these other gummy bears now we're gonna let them sit like this for one more day then they should be like them Hasbro gold gummy bears that we all love and behold so dear to us these should be just like them they should be you know that that should have that tackiness that the Hasbro gummy bears have you know I mean they're perfectly fine if you want to sit there and eat them this way go for it you can but if you want it to be more like the Hasbro gold gummy bears you're gonna want to sit there and do this extra step now folks I just want to sit there and put out a kindly reminder please keep these up out of reach of young little children remember this is a medicine and we should treat it as a medicine now if you'd like to just saw in here today please give me a big ol thumbs up if you're a new subscriber welcome to my channel if you're not yet subscribed go up hit that subscribe button tap

"hey guys and welcome back today we're making some homemade fruit gummies these are all-natural they can be made with fresh-squeezed juice and they're actually really easy we're going to be using the fruit shack here to create these gummies you can find these on Amazon and each kit comes with two droppers four trays and four different shape molds so I'll be showing you a different recipe for each mold today to start off by making our grape gummies and I'm going to be using some pre-done juice this is just organic juice I got at the natural food store you can use fresh-squeezed which is what I'm going to be using for the rest of the recipes but in a pinch this will do so we add our juice we add our gelatin get that all in there and then you're just going to let it do its thing for just about three minutes next we'll take it over to the stove and mix until it's dissolved and warm but not quite boiling then you're ready to start filling your molds Aarthi so cute they're little grapes which is totally appropriate because we're making grape gummies when they're all filled we're going to place them in the refrigerator for 30 minutes until set at that point we can take them out of the refrigerator pop them out of the molds and they're ready to eat I really love the freedom of being able to put whatever you want in these and you can skip all of that unnecessary packaging for a recipe number two we're going to be making our orange gummies this one I kept very very simple and I just used some fresh-squeezed orange juice and a little a sorbic acid so same thing here pour your juice into your little pot you're going to add in gelatin and let that do its plain I also add a little bit of honey so you can do that to sweeten them slightly and I love doing that in a natural way where other than all the added sugar from typical fruit snacks again we did corresponding mold so for orange I did the orange mold and look how cute they are when they're done little oranges next up we're making our strawberry gummies and for this I did some fresh juicing of strawberries I got to admit I don't think I've ever do strawberries before but they're really good I added a tablespoon of lime juice to this one and it just really complimented the flavor I made them a little bit more tangy but for the gummies it was perfect I had a little bit of honey and then did the gelatin I also let that sit on the stove I added the honey on this one after it was already starting to get warm you can do it either way and then once it was dissolved then I filled up our molds one of the nice things about this kit that it has two of the droppers in it number one you're able to get really precise but also you can fill up molds and let your kids help too so as long as they're you know old enough to be careful it's kind of a fun little mommy-and-me project and of course they're going to want to eat them even more if they're helping along the way so I love that about these now if you do what I did and you forget to put your molds on the trays never fear because the car that they insert it works perfectly so I'd realized that I hadn't showed you how to pop these out of the mold yet so I figured I would show you on the strawberry you can see they just come out really easily I think it's all about having the right proportion of the gelatin you're using and the fruit juice but any juice will do last step we are making our Apple and spinach gummies these taste so good and I love that they're green thin and with the Apple it just was really cute and you don't taste the spinach really at all but you still get all the good nutrients this one I actually added three or four handfuls of spinach and like I said you don't taste it at all so we had our fresh juice gelatin let it sit cooked it on the stove and then put it in the frigerator for 30 minutes and there you go they're great in school lunches anything you're doing with the kids and I have to be honest our kids hadn't ever had gummies until I got this kit and started making them which one's your favorite camp ain't it enjoy them igloo and I'm gonna shower you in and they're laughing would you like to wall it well I hope you guys enjoyed the video a thumbs up if you did don't forget to share it on social media if you want to share with your friends how they can make natural gummies with fresh juice and we'll see you guys soon bye girls", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "SwShBN4kTqg": "[Music] hello welcome back to operating sec this is a special video collaboration with Julie from a beautiful

ingredients you can kind of make it your own and try all kinds of different flavor combinations the only special thing that you guys are gonna need are these silicone molds and I will put a link down below they are the cutest little things adorable in this pack that I got off of Amazon there are three different colors and it comes with three droppers which make filling molds so easy so you guys I hope that you try out this recipe video and make sure you let me know and give me some feedback how you liked it let me show you guys what you're gonna need in order to make these super cute delicious nutritious gummy bears let's go ahead and get started for the first recipe we're going to be making a citrus blast flavor and for that you're going to need two karekare or large oranges and then you'll need a citrus juicer if you guys want to skip this part and just buy some store-bought orange juice it's okay I'm not judging and since I didn't have any lemons on hand we will be using bottled pure lemon juice and this is organic also need some unflavored gelatin you guys can get this at natural food stores or I can put a link down below where you can find it off of Amazon - this is grass-fed gelatin I just have it transferred into a mason jar here on a technical note pineapple cannot be used in these gummy bears the pineapple will not actually set up with the gelatin and for our sour grape recipe you're going to need some grape juice and some lemon juice and then for our last recipe you will need some home brewed kombucha we have a berry flavor and but not least you guys want to make these into sour gummy bears you're just gonna need some vitamin C powder we got this from Amazon and I will put the knife down for that below as well and we're gonna toss those gummy bears and this vitamin C powder and they're so sour and fun okay let's get rolling [Music] in a saucepan I'm just putting one cup of juice 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and then I am slowly whisking in the gelatin at a medium-high heat until the gelatin is all dissolved if you dump it in really fast you're gonna have globs of jello so you want to take it kind of nice and slow and whisk it right in and now using the dropper that came with the molds you're just going to fill up those molds one by one and this is the part where you're kids helping you comes in really handy because it's not difficult at all but it does take a little bit of time so having someone to do that alongside you it's just a really great thing for about 15 minutes okay so I just got these out of the freezer and I think they are ready this is kind of fun if you guys like popping you know those packing bubbles I think that you'll really like doing this too [Music] so I have all three flavors made up and these are ready for

milligram lemonade and I am more than happy to tell you it's just as good as all the other cannabis quenchers all the flavors uniformly excellent do not hesitate to grab cannabis quencher if you're not afraid of trying a drink at a dispensary near you I think they're great they're a little bit pricier than the confectionaries but but they are good for a nice change of pace and they're not quite as filling as the sort of confectionaries like the brownies and cookies as well so I like them as a good alternative here and there and the cannabis quencher is the sort of drink that I now go for when I would like a bowl that excuse me a drinkable I'm gonna go with cannabis quencher so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat I appreciate you watching as always and we will check

so Lindsay has a new album go check it out I'm putting links down below to where you can like find it or buy it Oh check it out check it out take a listen you guys requested that I make a cute back-to-school treat so we're gonna be making something from my new cookbook look what we're making fruit gummies they are so cute look how cute these are I'm gonna be using our little nerdy nummies mold but you can use whatever silicone mold you have at home that you find and you think it's so cute and you want to make it into a little fruit snack they're gonna make some fruit gummies today let's get started okay so Lindsey you've been on the show before we bake together before yes we made some treats we made a cake and a little tart but have you ever made gummies like candy before no this is a first for me and they look delicious so let's get thinking and look also how simple this is I was gonna say that what the ingredients here yeah now this is for three different flavors you could just do one if you want to like if you have a favorite gummy flavor hmm do that one I can do just watch out the like like these are the examples you've given but could I do like a grape if I love grape yes you can do any make gosh yes you could do grape fruit juice but we're using grape juice orange juice and it's strawberry puree that's what I'm excited about so I'll be putting all of these ingredients and their measurements down below so if you want to follow along go ahead it's down there for you but for the grape juice we've got the gelatin and maple syrup for the orange juice gelatin and maple syrup but then for the strawberry gelatin and a little bit of honey a little extra sweet yeah and we just make them each one at a time and then we fill them into this cute little mold and again is whatever mold you want I'm just using the nerdy nummies one because it's so adorable and I thought how perfect for back-to-school has a little smart cookie yeah oh my gosh I do a little smart cookie so hard yeah a little bit hard a little dinosaur Stegosaurus all the cool things in school this mold right here is from the road baking mine and if you're interested in it I'll put a link down below and what's cool is they have these little squeezes yeah Oh new step ones a little bit of prep Lindsey hold this cute little Bowl okay and then you want to spray it because these are very detailed designs and you want to stick he want him to pop out easily all right just just move it over there I don't want to get you too bad oh geez here we go here oh oh put the tape on this okay that's done and now Lindsey which one do you want to make first which flavor I'm kind of feeling the strawberry puree okay all right so I'm gonna hand this over to you okay and a medium sized saucepan so we're gonna add the three ingredients pour it okay yep everything oh it smells so good it'll delicious smells like just pure strawberries fresh movie though it it smell is this literally just a blended up strawberry or pureed strawberry yeah that's it that's amazing okay and a little bit of gelatin shake that in there shake shake deep deep deep deep DDP and honey it's a little oh my gosh that looks so good I can't strawberry and honey I can freeze that and just do a popsicle right now we could oh no no now your next cookbook I like to stay focused ro okay okay cool so di Lindsey I'm gonna have you do this it's super easy just whisk together those three ingredients together get everything mixed in get all blended and then we're just gonna let it sit for five minutes to bloom once it's blue we're gonna take that little pot and head over to the stove I could tell that you like your advancer cuz you're like you have such good posture and you look so pretty when you're doing it I'm like it's like a little little lady I was imagining pictures cauldrons call me witches but I'll take your magical [Laughter] okay my arms getting tired I need to get on your leg at work okay I'm good good we'll let it sit let it use this this little muscle right that's how bakers are so buff I mean really though we've already got the arms as Baker's right yeah we need the core in the squat so sometimes I like to do these when something's microwaving or baking because it really helped my arms are getting a little strong from all that whisking and also I have to carry around cookie all the time like your cute little dog Luna I can tell her with my finger is cookie she's 25 pounds right now so Lunas six pounds so that's a big difference like cookies like a you-know-who bowling balls I remember when we were at Justine's birthday and we were like standing around holding hot dogs just talking and I wanted to feel like a part of the group right so I pick up cookie this huge double bowling ball after a while like am i starting to lean back just like oh oh thanks Mike see this is what I looked like at the party oh yeah same girl I mean the other day so we're I mean at all okay clean clean she just don't kiss it it really wants to kiss your face and you didn't let her I'm sorry about it all right it's been sitting for five minutes and it is only bloomed look at that it's thickened it's a little firmer now we're gonna take this over to the stove on a medium heat and we're gonna let it simmer for just a couple minutes and then we bring it right back here okay do it girl okay it's like Oh medium we hurry iris yeah here I'll go oh as it starts to warm up it it gets all liquid me again just whisk a couple minutes then we take it back over here we take the little dropper and put it in the mold done all right we just took this off the stove be careful it's really hot and we're taking these little teardrop urse which come with it and you just you suck up a little bit and then put it in the mold I love the way this smells by the way isn't this so cute so we just oh yeah it doesn't have to be perfect and you're just gonna keep doing this fill up the whole tray and once it's full we're gonna pop these in the refrigerator to chill for 1 hour and while it's chilling we're gonna make another flavor okay here we go okay here we go in Oh a G in the fridge so while those fruit gummies are chilling in the fridge this is perfect we're gonna make two more flavors and I want to eat these like now yeah this is perfect so we can make two at a time we can do these together so I gave you the grape if that's okay Fanta I've got the orange the orange juice so pour in your grape juice and I'm gonna pour in the orange juice to a pot a little bit of gelatin or the gelatin first is it important to put the gelatin in first you can put it in second but I like to put it in first so it starts reacting right away so we don't have to wait as long for it to glue and then remember for these recipes I'm using maple syrup instead of honey this is just a sweet knit some nice natural sweetener I always like cooking with whenever I can honey or maple syrup I love that about your recipes actually they've been getting more and more like that over time and even you know if you're vegan and you don't want to use a gelatin they have a lot of gelatin replacements oh nice you could customize it you can make it for you all right let's mix these up and let them sit for five minutes I feel like this is a mix challenge I know who can with faster let me get my posture [Laughter] all the squats farther go home I just learned that the farther out you put your knees like the war at burns okay let us sit for five minutes five minutes to recover okay whoo litter bloom and let her burn bloom man a bloomin bird only a witch would have this and she's trying to block it with her body you show nymphal back your apples you found me out why do all those out there like big dip in the big boys oh man they're like okay now do the same thing is before I get your low-tier droppers and just plop them in the bowl oh yeah this is a little more liquidy this makes me want to drink a huge glass of orange juice right now it smells so good oh dear Oh Wendy you're so fast well I just had an accident but you know it's nice about this dropper accidents are very easily fixable yes yeah yes you can just flick it off or once they're done setting you just peel it so don't even worry about spilling you could use a little spoon I just like the dropper as they make a lot easier but you could use a spoon okay well no rush but I'm gonna play with your pup so Q are you adorable girl what a beautiful color like she actually is like blue yeah she's like this beautiful like blue-gray color and she's got these funny Sharky want some I know it kind of reminds me of like a Rottweiler oh my gosh Lindsey how did you beat me you really did such a good job motivation to play with the puppy is like I got a hurry you think I'm moving I'm gonna go so fast that I love her you're just also I think that's what makes you such a good you know baker and so inventive is the fact that that's your process fact that you're very meticulous you're very detail-oriented it's so and it's good it's slow it's good and that's why your cookbook is amazing I know everything you do amazing cuz you don't speed through it alright lanzhi let's put these in the fridge okay oh then we'll pop them out oh look at you look at you here I'll come help you not let me go the dog okay the gummies have chilled we've popped a few out here's what they look like look at they hold the shape so perfectly you can see all the little details and they're really easy to get out because this is a silicone mold and not a hard old like a like a metal one the metal ones are harder because you can't do this the silicone ones you just push them and boom look at that I have one Rhino I want to eat a dinosaur mmm I really want to try a strawberry one me too I think the puree one is gonna have the strongest flavor all of these gummies are a fruit gummy so the flavours are light and very natural but if you would like them to taste more like a candy like the gummies you see at the store like the gummy bears you add a little measurement of citric acid it's so good it makes it a little bit more tart and tastes more like a gummy bear so it's really up to you especially for kids whatever one you'd like you can't go wrong tada here are they delicious little fruit gummies that we've made today the recipe is in my new cookbook and I'll be putting a link down below and all the ingredients have you'd like to follow along a big thank you to you guys for suggesting we make a back-to-school treat and also a

one shining light on this February day and that is this video and what we're about to do that is we are making weed gummies whoa that's right we've made brownies we made cookies we made chocolates we made maple syrup which that was questionable I think that worked but we have not made the quintessential lead food which is weed gummies now I'm a little nervous for this video because when you're  around with candy there's a lot less room for error and there's you know big risks on the table here this is quite a bit of weed so we're here I have the setup of what we need but really we're going to be going back there for the majority of this video to the oven I'm assuming you have a whisk I'm assuming you have a little pot I'm assuming you have water that's it those are the things you probably already have now hopefully you also have weed and hopefully you know how to make it into cannabutter because I'm not about to go over that with you I have my fancy towel here that my sister got me for Christmas it says the food has wheat in it and in this house that's probably true you're gonna need sunflower lecithin I think that's how it said this one is like a heavy all national cold press Papa bah a link to this specific one in the description box in fact all of this info will be in the description box below because I'm not a reliable source now on to the slightly grosser ingredients gelatin this is basically like horse hooves sorry and then jello which is more horse Hope's exciting but this will give us the you know candy flavor the recipe I'm using is from this place called the canna school and then their recipe they say use a half cup of water but then in the comments people were like it actually works better or tastes better if you use a half a cup of fruit juice just has a little bit of a flavor so let me show you what I got so fruit juice is definitely not my area of expertise so first I got power eat fruit punch in this tastes like medicine so I don't want it and I'm gonna have to like throw it out this isn't nobody's gonna drink it and so then I went and I got v8 splash berry blend I just want something that's like a nice sugary drink that's not like gross you know but it's actually really hard to find let's see that's exactly what I'm going part  Dan we were at the store yesterday and I was like trying so hard to pick out a juice that was good and I'm not well-versed in juices like I said and he was like that's gonna crop sex to me gross no Michael what about this he's like what are you grandpa like it's not the tomato based ones they're her bunch okay so oh and the final thing that you need is obviously mold no you don't actually have to use gummy bears you can use whatever you want but I want to use gummy bears because if I'm traveling with this I want to go to disguise them as I get a candy this recipe makes about a hundred gummies small ones weak ones I want big strong ones so I got the cutest gummy mold it's like the medium size so this is by the modern gummy and they had a small size of medium size and then a larger size and there are like 36 of these in here or 38 so really all that's left now is to go over to the stove and mix all this together and the reason it's a little scary is because oh and I have to heat this up too but the reason it's scary is because we're cooking sugar and candy and if you I have to do whisking it as I mean as I'm squirting it into this so time is of the essence you know so let me get us all situated over there and we'll begin alright guys I have everything all set up my station is ready because once we start this process you really got to keep it moving I have to whisk this liquid for like 15 minutes non-stop as we go so I'm gonna do my best to kind of like show you guys but this might get intense I don't know and I don't know I'm trying to make this video funny but it's probably not gonna be funny because I don't want to joke around and then up my edibles that ain't gonna happen so we're gonna stick to the script today okay I'm attaching you guys to this which is actually um for the car but it works on the oven so we're getting creative here and you're gonna see a little aerial view of what's going down my dog is like you when you're gonna take me for a walk well we need to medicate first little Jimmy we need to medicate hey it's a girl Angie KB I'm gonna tell you what I'm doing step by step so first you turn this stove on to medium low add in the cannabis butter add in your soy lecithin powder and start stirring rigorously and then once that's combined you add in the fruit punch as you're choosing and then you add in the gelatin and you've got a like whisk a lot as you're doing this or else it'll get all clumpy kind of like cornstarch you know and you know just whisking away whisking away oh then you add in your jello powder you can see in the background my dog licking his dick so that's nice it's getting a little clumpy okay so then you just whisk for like 10-15 minutes and then I started filling up these molds which took a while I ended up switching to a spoon which is easier but yeah that's basically it [Music] all right guys the deed is done I don't know how I feel about the fact that I got some of this on me and you literally can play with it like special effects makeup and it's not coming off but tasty sense so mmm horse hooves that was pretty easy it did get a little tricky with the hardening but they acted online as if like oh my god it's gonna harden in like two seconds so I know I think that I did all right I lost the dropper like halfway through it just got too thick and it like clogged and it didn't work and then I just ended up using a spoon from my cabinet which made it a little messier but I think ultimately a lot faster so now these are just gonna set it says to put them in the freezer but then I saw people saying that they were better left out so I think I'm gonna do what you would do with normal jello and just put them in the fridge I don't know I'll let them set for a few hours and then I guess we'll taste test one right I guess so all right guys it's hours later and these things are set they're dumb this is how these came out they look pretty legit and then I had a little bit of excess left so I just pour it in here you know I haven't popped any of these out but let's see I'm impressed with myself these came out really good like normally I do a really bad job with this stuff but let's do the taste test so I'm just gonna eat this big one because yeah mmm mmm all right little gelatin II I mean it doesn't taste awesome cuz I can taste a lot of the coconut oil but I mean you know I'm not eating this cuz I  want candy you know I mean this cousin trying to get my rocks off so if you're trying to get your rocks off try this recipe you try one of the you saw I mean yeah boo tastes awesome cuz it's like very coconut oil II it's not bad it's just like you kind of want to get it over with is it a fail I don't think so I mean I guess we'll find out if it gets me high it's not a fail you know it's edible thank God we use that fruit punch stuff because I don't know how it tasted without back umm-hmm right no all right guys but that's it what do you think it was actually really easy hopefully very effective we'll see I'll let you know remember the recipe link will be below I'll also link where I got the soy lecithin powder stuff and follow me on Instagram if you want Angie Kb thank you for watching this episode of 'angels anything show and I'll see you next time good bye [Music] alright I'm here to report that the gummies worked thus laylee to gelatinous gummies did indeed work I am hi and also I have a pimple between my eyes which I've had for this whole video so you guys already know that anyway it was a success so definitely make them alright also Dan just up a Hello fresh alright guys more time has passed and they feel they need to tell you that I'm even more up now as you can probably tell because my eyelid is even more closed and my pimple is even more red so I'm not sure what's happening - then no okay don't do try these at home do you tres know Dan's rolling a great bodysuit [Music]", "pUhJnKKQDTE": "as marijuana becomes legalized throughout North America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the

Thursday", "uBlyb3dh02U": "good afternoon we're going to make some THC infused gummies first step is to make sure you have everything that you need out so our items are a three ounce package of unflavored jello or flavored gelatin not sugar-free I'm using two packets of unflavored as per the recipe that I posted and 2/3 cup cold water I've also got my lecithin to the side to put a little bit in because that is a nice fat protein that the THC bonds to there's a little machine that keeps it to a perfect time without having to go back and forth to the stove also has a link posted since we're doing super Lemon Haze on blue so let's again box tile I like to make sure it's very loosely powdery because it'll stick together I said it is a plant fat protein mini whisk mix all of these powders together enter water so we want to make sure that all of the gelatin is wet and separated and there are no clumps of gelatin that are still powdered the gelatin is mixed and 15 minutes has elapsed the gelatin has soaked up the water so enter the trusty little heater you turn that on I'm going to go ahead and break up the gelatin a little bit here and I'm going to wait probably about 10 minutes to come back and stir it again back quick search it's starting to look clearer for the record I'm doing blue for super-lon haze because true clear has a blue label just like I did read for indica and I did yellow for hybrid alright we're gonna let it sit another five minutes so it's been a little bit I'm gonna go with that is as clear as it needs to work because there's lecithin and it doesn't get that crystal clear like if you're doing candy but it is quite smooth quite runny I'm going to inject the super Lemon Haze truth here into it that has been so deep and warming in a cup of warm worth yeah it's tough [Music] and what i'm doing here is optional ma'am I usually pull that off but I'm going to pull some of the jello up in give it a shake and squirt that back in we all want to make the most of all of our product so I'm going to stir that in and once again I'm going to let it sit for five minutes to infuse before we put it into the molds all right we're gonna give it one more stir then because this is gelatin and not egg I'm not gonna whisk it super fast assuming it's going to stay in there [Music] smells like THC so the gummy bear molds that I put the link to hold about a milliliter you don't need to measure but they came with little droppers I'm going to hand this off to my partner because he has a much better non-payment you if you drip anything cuz it's silicone it's gonna that's basically gonna be one dose all of the little dots that end up on top of the silicone yeah kind of scrap all those at the end put them together it's almost like having an extra Bayer we use the opposite color or a different color than the jello you he's gonna go ahead and fill the rest of those up and we'll be back in a moment on to another bold [Music] we're gonna go ahead and stipple some cornstarch onto the back I put these in the freezer they've set and I've let them come back to temperature to make sure there's not a lot of moisture so this is my makeup brush there's a link to this this is the stipple the flat top that's what we're gonna stipple with so I've got cornstarch I just used the cornstarch lid they've got a little folded up foil and a paper towel in case I feel like it's getting too thick so I just went to stipple along the back of these and if you feel there's a bit much you can always go back and kind of wipe something away the nice thing about the brushes you can twist it and if you feel there's too much corn starch somewhere then you can use the edges of it so I like to know that my backs are good prior to pop them out I'm gonna pop this one out like so now gonna turn it over and show you the quick way I just stick my nail into it and pop them out and then lay them out afterwards welcome back to the final step we're going to say it's been 24 hours these will stay out overnight these have been out for 24 hours they're slightly smaller because they've now reduced down a little bit in size once they have dehydrated a bit as such I stipple them on the top with the cornstarch and I'm able to have them not to be sticky any further questions please feel free to send me a private message or post on the video however you'd like thanks", "osFBjWt5iG4": "hey guys so it is such a beautiful day\ntoday I think it's like 90 degrees out which is the hottest that it has been\nin a long time it is getting me all excited for summertime and all the get\ntogether 's and the parties and so in today's video I'm gonna show you how to\nmake some rummy gummy bears but as a special bonus to go hand in hand with\nrummy gummy bears I'm going to show you how to make some vodka infused gummies\nand they are delicious and they all go together they're perfect for any party\nso let's go spice things up okay so the first thing we're gonna do is get these\nlittle party cups and just put them on a pan or a tray just so it's easier to\nhall off somewhere next we're gonna get our gummies and we have three different\nkinds so of course these are the tropical gummy bears and these are lifesaver\ngummies and the flavor is basically just tangy so after we get these party cups on\nthe pan we are just going to open their little bag up and just start taking the little gummies putting them right in the party cups but\nyou don't want to fill them all the way to the brim and because your gummies\nwill expand and that fills up six I have a few more left but I promised my kids I\nwould save these for them next we are going to put the lifesaver wild berry\ncandy in the party cups and I have to tell you these all smells so good oh my\nword now you can't separate them with colors if you prefer but you really\ndon't need to and this filled up seven because\nremember you don't want to fill it up to the brim and I did have to save a few\nfor my kids so really this would probably fill up eight and this would\nprobably fill up seven for the gummies and these are the small packages but it\ndoesn't really matter and then of course we are doing the sweet tart flavor and\nnow the sweet tart flavor if you can see they kind of have a little bit of sugar\ncoating on them all they smell so good as well and then just put them in your\ncup okay so now we are gonna add our liquor to our gummies and we're gonna\nstart out with our gummy bears and our gummy bears our tropical flavors so we\nare going to do tropical flavor rum okay so you want to make sure the rum is\ncovering the gummy bears completely okay so now we're doing the wild berry\nlifesavers so I chose a blueberry vodka but you can also do the strawberry vodka or the raspberry vodka basically any berry but I chose\nblueberry and so you'll just want to pour the liquor right over the top of\nthe gummies okay so the sweet tart gummies are\nlittle tangy so I chose an orange vodka but really you can choose whatever kind\nyou want okay so now you want to put your gummies in the fridge for at least\n24 hours if you have them in longer it's good because then their bellies get\nfilled with liquor more if you don't want to know what these are these are\nmudslide pudding shots I will link the video below if you want to know how to\nmake your own all right alright guys so it has been about a day\nand a half and if you can see the gummies if you\ncan see most of the liquid is not covering them anymore\ntherefore it has gone into the gummies that is a good indicator that it is done\nand you are ready to party oh man guys can you see these I'm super\nexcited I'm gonna try all three kinds for you so first we are going to try the\nrummy gummy bears and you can just use a toothpick or you can use your fingers it\ndoesn't really matter mmm good okay so the next one we're gonna try is the\nlifesaver wild berry time so good okay now we're going to try the sweet tart\nmMmmm that one's really good but a little tang you I like that one I\nlike a mom they're so good and if you can see\nthere's just a little bit of liquor at the bottom so of course when you are\ndone eating these you can chug the liquor down and they are so good and\nyour friends will love it you will be a hit at any party I hope you guys give\nthese a try and if you have any questions just comment below and if you\nwould like to see more videos please remember to subscribe to this channel\nthank you guys so much bye and see you in the next video", "lbSDrgHGcDY": "welcome back today we are making healthy gummies the recipe is super simple all you have to do is add a third of a cup of fruit juice two tablespoons of honey and then I like to also add in two teaspoons or two packets of stevia you can also add in two teaspoons of granulated sugar or you can omit that stuff I bring that to a boil and then pour it into a bowl to let it cool while the mixture cools I hydrate 1 tablespoon of unflavored gelatin with one tablespoon of room-temperature water I mix that into my slightly cooled fruit juice mixture and once the gelatin is fully dissolved you can add it into your molds the really fun thing about this recipe is you can use so many different flavors of Fruit Chews to create tons of different flavors of gummies one batch makes about 70 small gummy bears but it can vary based on the size of the molds that you're using before you pipe the mixture into your mold it's a great idea to set them on some type of flat baking sheet to make them easy to move into the fridge it's also really important that you have a pipette like this to fill the molds most of these silicon molds that you can get online come with one but if you don't have one it's important that you do get one it's almost impossible to do this with the spoon you also want to make sure you filled your molds all the way to the top almost to the point where you can see the surface tension if you under fill them your gummy bears are gonna be really thin and aren't gonna really have the right shape that a classic gummy bear has I made 5 different batches of gummy berries using a bunch of different fruit juices including apple orange grapefruit juice pomegranate juice and black cherry juice and the juice is what actually colors these gummy bears as well so it's really fun to create such beautiful looking gummies without any artificial food coloring I found that chilling my molds in the fridge for 20 to 30 minutes is enough time for the gummy bears to set and they pop pretty easily out of the molds it does take a bit of time to get all of them out but it's totally worth it if you don't want to make gummy bears you can also make other shapes so I used a seashell mold here and I also had kind of a scary skull mold from Halloween and the gummy mixture worked great in that as well so don't feel limited to gummy berries you can definitely get creative with this you can also adjust the taste by altering how much honey or how much additional sweetener you add so if you like things a little bit sweeter you might want to add some more sugar stevia or if you like things to taste really natural you can totally skip adding that or reduce the amount of honey thank you guys so much for watching if you want to make your own gummies the recipe is also up on shale sweets calm", "cCzulqCnNtY": "[Music] we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are reviewing probably for the last time because they've disappointed me so many times nother bar this time they're salted all chocolate as you can see here it cost me 12 bucks at my dispensary although I believe I got a discount for 10 is it 200 milligram edible and if it really were as potent as advertised or merely cody has advertised it would be a good deal I reviewed two nutbars in the past on the boat pretty disappointing to be honest so I don't have a lot of expectations for this one I reviewed a 100 and a 200 milligram in the past and found them both to be lacking in the potency department but but pretty good in the flavor so let's go ahead and note but be salted almond one chocolate here and give it a taste I believe I picked this up at cool calm collective and Huntington Beach Orange County so here we go we've got our packaging here this fancy gold foil we've got a little bit melted somewhere along the way but you can see what it looks like they're little nutbar symbols get a bite you can see the salted almonds on the back it's okay mmm very sweet chocolate very sweet did you like almonds you're gonna like it better than okay it's good chocolate take a second place we just did let you hmm not that low liking the chocolate yet again but how am I gonna like how it makes me feel for that guys you're gonna have to wait just a couple of seconds me however I'll come back to you guys in two hours let you know our feline thanks for watching weeks two hours later alright guys it's been two hours I've got to admit that this is the best of the nug bars that I've had so far I am definitely the most high from this one which is curious that I'm certainly more high from this one that I alright perceive myself as being more high from this one than the other two hundred milligram when I had not a whole lot more but but noticeably to me so there might just be some batch issues I'm not sure there but I would say the last time I was that maybe a you know three something like that and it's what I felt no rocking about a five so you know there's you know definitely something they're still not my go-to not gonna be my first thing I like the taste of it this actually grew on me quite a bit as I ate it I like the dark chocolate I have like all of theirs in terms of taste and this one ended up being a pleasant surprise in terms of I was expecting nothing from it and a nice little high so I got to give it to nug bar on this one they they they earned some kudos so as mild as praise is that that as I have given it I'm not sure if you can call that kudos or not but you know whatever thank you so much for watching wheats guys I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on the next review peace", "egNB5MXTmmc": "[Music] hello squid the marijuana reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another drink Dixie elixir that's hard to read as Dixie there di xi\u00e8 elixir there are half and half lemonade NT th C infuse 100 milligrams so I reviewed a lot of drinks here on wheats and I find them to be pretty good there's some really great ones out there cannabis quenchers awesome Jasper's amazing there of course some Dead's out there but on the whole I do like the drinks so I'm really looking forward to this Dixie elixir half and a half a pretty cool little bottle here it's got a wrapper on the outside I kind of like the idea is that the cap there at the top if you want a dose the cap is designed to help you dose appropriately helps you decide like you know oh what's 10 milliliters blah blah blah blah blah what's it what's a dose of course we're going to ignore that and just drink the whole bottle in terms of half and half I love me some Arnold Palmer's which is what a half lemonade half iced tea is love love love them so I'm hoping like this the drinks in terms of taste are all over the map sometimes they're really bad like as Aspen but that means they can produce excellent rewards like zest and sometimes they're not too bad but they often have this really bitter aftertaste and I find that to be pretty often the case with the drinks I'm having trouble getting it off which is you know par for the course for me we're almost there keep peeling this plastic layer off until we eventually get to the goods oh boy there she goes okay there she is all defrocked there's a little cap that you can pour it in so on the back we've got our ingredients and our nutrition information I sadly don't see any lab and testing results but that's okay we're gonna hope that it has 100 milligrams in here it says shake gently before consuming which is what we shall do I assume this opens like a childproof lid it does handsome looking bottle there down the hatch hmm it's okay definite cannabis taste to it more tea than lemonade taste it's not too bad um it's only eight and a half ounces so I'll be done with it in no time again there is a slight cannabis taste to it it's not as bitter as the cannabis quench reserves ASP but but it is there so if you really hate that cannabis taste you might want to pass on this one but for me I'm uh I'm I'm I'm David it's again it's not as bitter as some of the the other brands out there hopefully it means it's still gonna be nice and strong so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I'm gonna come back to you in two hours like all of our reviews to let you know how this Dixie elixir has landed thanks for watching weeds guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] Dixie elixir half and half and it's pretty good it is in the oh it got me to about a six I'm about a six right now 400 milligram edible that's not bad and one that only costs eleven bucks which I think I neglected to mention the first half I'm pretty pleased with it the taste was good for a drink it wasn't outstanding tasting and it didn't get me crazy high but overall it's a pretty good little product one that I'm pleased with if you pick if you see it at a dispensary near you and you're looking for a drink and they don't and you don't want to get completely [ __ ] up the Dixie elixir might be the product for you I think I might try another one in the future see how it goes for me but overall this is a it's gonna give them my own thumbs up for me not a not a ringing endorsement but but far from uh from a negative review so uh that's gonna do it for this review here guys a nice short and sweet one but before I go and share with you a little cherry on top something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily we'd really did something I just love that I want to express to you guys and hopefully you will dig as well and this week uh it is going to be Silicon Valley yay there's a little Dinesh in a little guilfoyle now normally I'm very much against these little pop vinyls I think that's what they're called these

this time we have some gummies and i also have a cartridge so we're going to be using both in here and he's never tried delta 8 before so if you don't know what delta 8 is what we usually smoke is delta 9 thc so this is a new thing that they have it's delta 8 which is another cannabinoid that people have been you know it's been picking up a lot of steam now you know kind of like when cbd came out you know people are just like well you can get this legally anywhere in the united states it's just like cbd but i won't provide any links anywhere like on the uh description because i've been deleted over cbd before so just trying to be careful but it is 300 milligrams of gummies uh our thc eight in this in these gummies and we're gonna go half on it and we're gonna see how it hits and then we're gonna be hidden on some of this gorilla glue hybrid which is ninety percent delta eight thc with 10 terps i do like to mention is that i did try the other disposable one and delta 8 does not taste like delta 9 in any way it tastes a little bit different um but mostly i just tasted the terpenes but there is a bitterness towards the end like toward like a medicine taste but you know that delta a delta yeah it just came out didn't just come out but it's been around but people haven't really been talking about it as it is now can you um just hold these for a thumbnail or something oh over here so i could i don't have to see your knee all right now open the gummies so like i said ladies and gentlemen oh yeah they even have nutritional facts on this [ __ ] i'm like damn brother you know qr code as well and you know no no you know yeah so open it and that's uh let's see what pour some in your hand actually for uh for like a thumbnail and just a few and then put the the thing so i could read the the thing you know all right yeah okay got it yeah all right so back on this camera we are gonna eat uh so there's 10 gummies each i think um so you already have two in your hand no don't drop the sugar what is this [ __ ] thc eight okay so he has five they actually have uh nine in here uh i would say maybe yeah because i i've already tried this my tolerance is a bit higher so you still have 1200 i mean you want to split on this one no that's knocking this is perfect okay all right i need to be able to function later still you guys well we don't uh so i've been told that thc 8 or delta 8 thc is a bit more mild not as intense and psychoactive as cannabis but then again we're eating it and eating thc is different than smoking or vaping so different feeling so yeah cheers it's got some chew on it that's not saying not bad this is good candy okay candy wise that's pretty far there's a car just like hello you know what i did i did think that maybe they would have had more flavors just because the the packaging was all rainbow two players or so yeah these two i wonder if there's thc in the circle sugar crystals oh it smells like a berry yeah whoa i think i ate one you just look all the salt or so what we're going to do guys because i know our tolerance or edibles don't seem to hit till like 20 20 minutes or so later not not too long i mean it doesn't hit too quick we're going to be hitting on this and then we're going to stop the video and then we're going to um i guess turn that back the camera on and tell us or tell you how we feel you know i'm saying if we do even feel anything resume the video as soon as this is done but yeah it came with the same package this came with the same uh oh yeah same person oh okay all right open up handcrafted boys [Music] there is a bit like a slight bit minimal bitterness towards the end with that candy but un barely noticeable i didn't really notice it too much that's why i said barely he said too much and barely noticed it too much see all right maybe you do i guess i'm just kidding all right um yeah we're ripping this way go ahead we're going in wow oh by the way we're outside randy's house so don't trip we're just oh [ __ ] very thin pinkish heel looking oil this would look like if it's vape oil yeah i see maple like this all right so uh i did mention in my first delta eight video that interesting uh i did mention that when i first heard of pink oil i was like what the [ __ ] but you know apparently it's uh delta eight when it's uh it shows or it's delta a that makes it pink or sometimes so i don't know i'm not a scientist in any way so they're not are they all different you think pretty sure right what do you mean like as far as the color i don't know i think they're the same throughout the day so we're going to be using the shiv you guys know the shiv right off the bat i this is it seems like a pretty nice cartridge itself probably going to lower it to let's do a 2.6 and as usual we're gonna let now he said in case it's poison i'll do it first i guess that's right so that way i get poison next that makes total sense you should let me go down see that i get poison and then you'll be like oh okay i'm not going to hit it now all right or it doesn't even hit oh yeah delta eight sorry buddy you want to try again check atomizer damn thing's pretty smart it tells you like what possibly could be wrong with it yeah that's pretty cool all right so apparently this is not compatible with this um i don't have another battery in here but i'll probably do an individual video on this but we still did take the thc so uh we're going to wait and see what's going on um do you have a battery i think i do unless you can get do you have a battery in here let me go check that's all i was thinking or now i think i do have one it just might not be good [ __ ] it it's probably better one that doesn't work right that's true i'll be right back throw this away we'll be back see he's we're really outside his house put this inside i'm feeling the delta oh the friendly farm that don't work yeah i think yeah i think it's that one that's gonna work all right let's see you guys it's just auto hit oh it's dead [ __ ] i have a charge in my car maybe we can [Applause] oh you got in the mail yeah my brother orders it i think you can't hit it like that i think i tried it before hey what's up oh [ __ ] that was your brother oh no it's all good so it has like a weird blinker time you have to like keep hitting it until like it actually turns on let me see try it it's probably because it's like oh yeah it's still blinking red still because it's gonna look kind of dead actually we're gonna get some time to charge guys yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all right boys we back um he ended up being able to sneak a hit off this so let's just get another hit off of it um it's probably been about 10-15 minutes since we did take the the thc eight gummies so uh give it a few more minutes and we'll see but i planned on you know hitting this cartridge and uh hopefully boosting uh the [ __ ] feeling of the thca heat but yeah [Music] and so this is gorilla glue thc uh okay so it doesn't taste like medicine though don't taste bad you'll feel it and when you feel it just don't stop hitting it until it blinks but uh the similar bitterness towards the end but not bad like not much pretty much like a sprite like a lemon when you're trying it honestly it tastes like [ __ ] those medicine gummies that you eat the vitamin the vitamin ones yeah it tastes like that the flintstones don't taste bad yeah you know they're they're bearable at the end of the day this is people consider you know you know uh marijuana medicine you know what i'm saying so what's to say if it tastes like medicine a little bit you know it might be more willing to try it maybe the taste of delta 8 thc is that medicine taste because i've never tasted this coming from a distillate and you're gonna be like like thc nice little taste of like lemony yeah yeah like uh like a sprite like a sprite yeah that's a good one very similar to the other jack carrera one i do like to mention that uh gorilla glue is a sativa hybrid and jeff herrera is also a sativa so that's probably why they have similar terpenes or at least like a piney lemony you know so does this hit the same like amount of thc as the other one or delta nine or something i don't even know there's different deltas you could have like delta one through nine and [ __ ] now so uh i've heard from people i don't know if this is true or not i've read it i've seen people tell me that you know uh people use delta eight to lower their tolerance on delta nine because the tolerance of delta eight does not uh is not the tolerance with delta nine but i've heard that it isn't i've heard that uh delta eight is more of a like a more mild high it's not really too much as thc you know thc or delta nine thc [ __ ] getting confused but yeah um i'm a little confused on that too but i can see like so delta a is just basically it's a new cannabinoid that's not new but it's barely getting studied right now and it's barely picking up steam just like cbd did like two years ago um people are like a lot of uh street carts or fake cartridges that are uh probably pink or this pinkish hue it's probably delta eight you know since it's legal you can buy it and then probably street dealers are probably putting it in their cartridges i don't know um but me using this one is not bad you know i believe it's 25 for a gram out the door and for people that are in illegal states that don't have access to you know uh legal cannabis products you know this is a better uh not better alternative this is an alternative wait so they uh you can buy this legally and like in the clubs right now oh i have actually seen delta a products in authentic oh sure okay yeah but you can buy this online on websites there's a lot of companies three chai shout out to naruto i believe there's another one i forgot another one he mentioned but you know uh i'm in a place where i'm fortunate enough to have companies uh message me i don't really message too many companies anymore but uh when they do message me and then they uh i check out their website and it's cool seems legit you know i will consider it you know what i'm saying yeah it doesn't taste bad at all it doesn't it's funny it does taste like sprite hey [ __ ] a lot of people like sprite you know what i'm saying dude sprite's like one of the only few sodas that i want yeah because it doesn't dye your teeth sprites [ __ ] the [ __ ] sprite so after taking a few hits off this and the gummies do you feel some some type of i feel that change i feel mellow yeah i was honestly gonna say that too like i'm not like like i'm not stupid faded you know like you would get from dabs and stuff and like real delta and 98c but i feel like just like in the first video i felt something it was definitely different than a normal high yeah like i don't feel like um i feel relaxed i feel relaxed mellowed out i don't feel like let's say if i was to like smoke a dab i'd take too much of a big dab sometimes i get paranoid i don't feel like i'm gonna get paranoid or not my mind and everything is like i'm relaxed i feel it this is refreshing because it is like a sprite you know what i'm saying and uh like off that first do a blinker do a finger and see what's up but lightweight low key i kind of feel like the edibles are starting to hit but then again it could just be you know i'm feeling this but i'm feeling because when you obviously like i mentioned earlier when you eat something it's much different than smoking or when you're eating cannabis it's much different than smoking it we're vaping it but i definitely feel it in my eyes oh yeah look at you see my new merch got the the wax right here oh [ __ ] evolution you took that photo yeah no i got it off a website that's royalty free picks so you know what i'm saying once you put it on there anyone could use it unsplash.com i think it's dead again i think we got enough hits out of it i would say uh but like i said man i am definitely feeling something different than a normal high that you would get off delta nine thc ugh oh i did just eat habit and maybe you know smoking after you're eating you don't feel it i don't [ __ ] know i'm trying to [ __ ] say something uh how are you feeling and i definitely feel high though no joke just just not like a normal high it's not a weird battery yeah it's not the best battery but it happens we made it happen yeah my eyes it matters so you know your opinion i give it i'll give it a go give it a good grade you know like i would i don't know like if i didn't i mean i didn't know about it now that i know about it and i see it around oh yeah yeah i might be like more interested on this channel too no i will say that now that i know about it from like you exposing it to me i might like if i go to the street i mean to the clubs and see it i might be more interested in buying it now because now i had an experience with it and i know it was good so i might be more interested and when i see it in the store to go and pick it up so i do say it was good yeah i like it are you would you say you're pretty i would say i'm pretty highly look at me you gotta talk and prove it oh yeah no for reals i usually usually stump i usually be stuttering looking [ __ ] like a number you're hitting pretty good and i'm proud of that y'all know me i'll be stuttering yeah so uh like i said uh earlier there's a lot of delta eight thc like companies out there so please just do your research uh this one's pretty good and i i would vouch for some other ones based on naruto's opinion because he's tried them uh but yeah just do your research and you know uh they this website that they have actually tells you like you know delta thc uh delta athc 101 has blogs articles on there so if you want to check that out and learn more on this website specifically i believe uh i'll post it in the comments post go and check it out yeah but uh let us know what you think in the comment section oh yeah and by the way subscribe to the homie you know i'm saying kind of ended with that but hopefully you did enjoy the video you got anything else to say to the lovely people of the internet i just want to say i hope you guys enjoy the video as well and we'll see you guys on the next one man hey peace out [Music] oh", "QpjZIPBrHfg": "hey spices so with Father's Day right around the corner we are gonna be making a tasty treat so in today's video we are gonna be making some beer gummy bears that is right this is the perfect gift I did for your father so let's go spice things up so the first thing you'll want to do is pick out their favorite beer so this is a coffee stout that I just picked up from Costco you can find it in your beer section or I'll try to find it and we get below but this is the kind we are going with today but really you can pick whatever beer you want so to a bowl we are gonna add one cup of beer whatever choice you want of course alright so now you will want to add 1/2 a cup of sugar I am using a ultrafine sugar a lot of times you find this in making cocktails you can use regular sugar if you want but for me I find it dissolves better and lastly you'll want 3 packets of unflavored gelatin or 3 tablespoons now go ahead and whisk it all together alright so now I'm just putting it in the microwave and I'm gonna turn it on for a minute and then stir it and then a minute again alright so it's been a total of two minutes and the gelatin and the sugar has dissolved together and if you want to avoid all this foam all you do is have to have it not carbonated so if you want to take the lid off right away but it really doesn't make a difference you'll just have to make sure to get underneath the foam or sit it out a little bit okay so right here I have gummy bear molds and then I have this and then I have this dropper so I'm just gonna go underneath the foam and get the mixture and just pour them individually in each gummy mold and you'll just want to do that until they are all filled now if you're wondering what to do if you don't have gummy bear molds use any mold will do these are pineapples and also if who you're making this for does not like alcohol you can always switch instead of beer you could do root beer and then of course I have these on a pan so it's easier to move the silicone molds and then the last thing I'm going to do is put these in the fridge for two hours so we'll come back after two hours when they have formed hey spices don't forget to like and share this video and after two hours the gelatin has formed into these gummies would you like to see what it looks like alright so this is a little pineapple this is the grape and the little gummy bears yep he's definitely smell like beer but tastes like candy your father will love this Do It Yourself gift idea well thank you guys so much for watching and if you'd like to see any more videos click this link or this link if

introduce you to tequila gummy bears that's what I'm talking about look at the color on these bad boys those are gorgeous so we start off with some tequila okay little bit of sugar stir stir stir over low heat okay wait a minute you're burning off the alcohol that's why we keep the heat low in one or two hot okay we want this alcohol to stay alcoholic stir stir stir a little gelatin okay beautiful we got a little mix now we come around with a bit of food coloring to get off but look at the desired color look at that maybe a little bit more because we want a nice neon green and then we just squirt it you could pour it in but it'll spill everywhere so it's good if you could use one of these don't stop a thing is just squeeze it in and it's beautiful so this is a gummi bear mold okay and now we put it in the freezer and fridge sorry break it up and look what we have we have little tequila gummy bears Oh gorgeous I love these okay", "2_mDkLjlTCw": "so what is the best snack to eat at the movies say it with me popcorn but gummy bears are close second or maybe a third they're somewhere on the list gummy bears are delicious but what's the problem with gummy bears it doesn't matter how many gummy bears you eat they never seem to satiate you and they're just filled with sugar and calories because what are gummy bears really they're little tiny sugar bombs or sugar bears gummy bears are a delicious sweet treat i can eat endless amounts of gummy bears and they never seem to satiate me and that's the problem with gummy bears they are high in calories and high in sugar and they're delicious so you can eat a ton of them but they're not really satiating you and providing any sort of nutrition but today i have a gummy bears recipe that only requires two ingredients it is super simple and super easy to make very quick to make as well and you can make any flavor gummy bears that you want and these are low in sugar and low in calories so you can eat a lot more gummy bears and i'm rahul and on this channel we cover healthy recipes recipe reviews and all things related to fitness and nutrition so if that sounds good to you hit that like button hit that subscribe button and let's jump right into the recipe so the ingredients we are going to need for this recipe only two ingredients super easy super simple the first ingredient is gonna be sugar-free jell-o so this is sugar-free jello right here it comes in a bunch of flavors so whatever flavor gummy bears you want pick that flavor of sugar-free jello i have strawberry here and then we also have orange black cherry and another packet of strawberry so you're going to need one of these small boxes these are 0.3 ounce boxes and they have four servings so we're going to use an entire package of this so pick your favorite flavor what flavor should we do today we got orange we got black cherry we got strawberry i'm thinking strawberry because strawberry is probably my favorite fruit my favorite berry and i love strawberry flavored things i love strawberries so it just makes sense we're gonna do strawberry flavored gummy bears but whatever flavor that you want you pick that flavor of jello and the second and last ingredient we will need is some gelatin in this box there are four pouches of gelatin and we're gonna use one pouch so if you buy one of these boxes you can make four different flavors of gummy bears and you can just get four different packs of jello so very easy and the third ingredient is gonna be water so we're not gonna count that as an ingredient say it's two ingredients but if you wanna count water as an ingredient then these are gonna be three ingredient gummy bears but i'm hoping that you have water to make this recipe so let's get right into it so let's jump right into making this recipe first things first grab your jello grab your grab your jello grab your gelatin and grab your foods recipe will not need a food scale guys i know anabolic kitchen making recipes without a food scale is unknown to this channel i love this thing and i use it for everything i make but for this one you will not need a food scale i have a measuring cup right here and first thing we're going to do is put a third of a cup of water in here and a third of a cup of water is 80 grams of water i'm gonna measure out 80 grams even though this thing has markings on it i could just look at this thing and find out what a third of a cup of water is you might be wondering why am i using a food scale measuring the amount of water i'm using when i'm using a measuring cup that tells me what a third of a cup is well that is a great question that we don't know the answer to next thing we're going to do is take our gelatin take one envelope that's in here and put it right into our water and just let it chill let it let it chill on the side for a little bit because if you try to mix this it's kind of hard to mix but the gelatin just absorbs the water so if you let this chill for a little bit it's going to absorb the water and then you can easily mix it while this is relaxing for a minute let me know in the comments what your favorite flavor of gummy candies or or candy is for me it's definitely strawberry or pina colada flavor is there a better drink out there than a nice pina colada i don't think so so pina colada flavored gummies are amazing strawberry is always good and if anyone comments grape psychopath so take a fork or a spoon but a fork is easier and stir this up you can see there let this chill for a minute the gelatin mixes up super easily we're going to microwave this for one minute we don't want it boiling we don't want it really really hot we just want it warmed up so that the jello mix mixes easier in this so throw this in the microwave for around a minute until it's warm and then as soon as it comes out we're gonna dump our we're gonna dump our jello right in here [Music] while that's heating up the microwave let's open up our jello so if i read the ingredients on this should i be worried about what's going in my body i'll make that sacrifice because i want to eat gummy bears and it's okay so now that our jello mix is opened up we're going to wait for that thing 10 seconds left and it is going to finish right now right now right now first try get it [Music] so this is hot dump this right in here mix this up oh another pro tip if you have one of these milk frothing things do not use this to mix this up trust me when i was testing this recipe i used this thing this turned into foam a ton of bubbles came in the gummy bears did not turn out very well at the end they were like foamy gummy bears so don't use this thing use a fork or use a whisk so now that all the jello mix is dissolved in here you have a mixture that resembles lava but it smells good smells very strawberry if you have a gummy bear mold use that and put it into the mold or just get any dish and pour the mixture right into here and once it sets you can cut it up into cubes so we're going to make gummy cubes but it's 20 20 guys these cubes can be bears if they want to make any shape you want make pyramids make cubes make rectangles make circles greg you set but get a container we're just going to pour all the mixture right into this you don't need this i did it without it but i like to use a little oil spray just because why not just cause in case it sticks which it never does but just in case now that you have your container spread with oil take this mixture and pour it right in here so we want a thin layer so we can make small gummy cubes just like the size of a gummy bear so best part about having one of these is you can just pour right in really easily and guys one thing i forgot to say earlier is if you want these a little sweeter just add a little bit of artificial sweetener here add a splenda add some erythritol add anything you want into this mixture to make it a bit sweeter but i'm not going to add any because i'm sweet enough [Music] tastes pretty good is it bad to have jello raw wait there's nothing raw in this it just goes in the fridge it's not being baked never mind this is one tasty mixture so this goes right to the fridge for an hour and then we'll cut up into cubes and i will show you how these gummy cubes aka gummy bears come out so look how this came out a block you can just eat this like as is but let's cut this up into some cubes and make some gummy cubes gummy bears gummy bears that look like cubes but they're actually bears because we said so on this channel we want these cubes to be bearish so they will be bears so just cut it up into cubes but i want to try one right now they taste so similar to gummy bears they're so good and remember if you want to stop here gummy worms [Music] [Applause] this whole bowl right here is 50 calories and another tip on the calories on this recipe so it is pretty hard to know because let's go with the jello brand of jello this says 10 calories per serving and a serving is 2 grams of the mix let's go with great value walmart brand of the exact same thing if you look at the ingredients they're basically the same 2 grams is five calories so if you look at that so we know that nutrition labels can lie to us the real calories on this is somewhere probably between five and ten jello probably rounded up to ten our boy great value rounded down to five so even though these probably have the exact same amount of calories if you're cutting use this one if you're bulking use this one and you know i'm just kidding guys don't lie to yourselves don't trick yourselves it doesn't matter which one you use it is pretty minuscule and it doesn't matter that much so just use either one of these but it's something i wanted to show you these are pretty much the exact same things if you look at the ingredients they're the exact same but the calories on them are different so just a pro tip nutrition labels are not accurate so it is really hard to be that specific with your calories because even if you count every single thing in your diet the nutrition labels might be lying to you and they might not be having the accurate amount of calories because they're just rounding up rounding down we don't know what they're doing so the macros on both of these are zero carbs zero fat one protein and we know that one gram of protein has four calories so if there's one protein in a serving then there should be four calories in a serving so how do they get to 10 that is a mystery that we will never know the answer to or maybe there's some amount of carbs that that is less than a gram so they just said zero grams of carbs but when you look at the calories it's greater than five and they rounded up to ten we don't know we got to call our boy jello and ask him how he got to 10. and we got to call our boy great value and ask him how he got to five so if you use the great value jello mix it's 40 calories if you use jello brand jello mix then it would be 60 calories so we're just gonna go right in the middle and i know that there are 12 grams of protein in this and so we're going to say that's 48 calories so this bowl has 50 calories so you get a bowl of gummy bears for 50 calories and all those calories are pretty much coming from protein because there are 12 grams of protein in this no carbs no fat crazy imagine eating gummy bears instead of a protein bar so 50 calories you get all the gummy bears double this put a different flavor mix in with this 100 calories and it's just straight protein that you're getting so the gummy bears that you would get from any convenience store just regular gummy bears let's compare 50 calories of this to 50 calories of this so if i look at the back of this these are sour gummy worms and it says 100 calories for seven pieces which is 31 grams so 15 grams should be 50 calories let's go one of every color and there we go 15 grams so if you look at that that is 15 grams of gummy worms and that is not a lot quite disappointing 50 calories 50 calories the difference guys this is what i'm trying to share with you guys on this channel this versus this neither of these will fill you up that much right because it's not a lot of food it's only 50 calories though so what if this was 200 calories so you would have instead of three 12 of these for 200 calories or four bowls of this you see how this would eventually fill you up a lot more than this this is also straight protein so it's gonna be more filling than the sugar that you get from this guys healthy gummy bears we did it and taste test it's so good it's so good this is really good like i'd go crunch this bowl and i'd be super happy really good guys you guys got to try this try this recipe out and don't eat three of these eat this whole bowl instead and you're getting more protein and it's just as delicious you know that if i open this up i'm crushing the entire pack in this whole pack 500 calories and this would not fill me up this is not that much versus this so as always guys thank you so much for watching this video try this recipe out because i have a feeling that you guys will really enjoy this one i'd love to know what you guys will think what flavor gummy bears do you guys make let me know let me know down below your favorite candy and thank you so much for watching this video like this video if you like this recipe subscribe if you're new and i will see you all in the next video these are so good literally can't stop eating them these are so good guys i can't stop eating them they're delicious and it's just straight protein can't go wrong i", "Z9jrHoPJb3k": "[Music] [ __ ] enemy how y'all feelin did they mention it today we don't be talking about some [ __ ] kind of nanos these are some edible gummies these shits or Varmus [ __ ] but before we get into that [ __ ] of course you know I gotta ask you where the [ __ ] is another [ __ ] guys please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always say it cuz always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that so you can get a notification anytime so don't forget the follow up [ __ ] over on Instagram this cannot underscore me cannot under [ __ ] score me alright so if you don't like the word [ __ ] mother pregnant you should probably go to another [ __ ] sample I'm gonna just tell you that [ __ ] right now alright so hitting my little uh my extreme cubing dad my weed man came through the other day I want to say you sailor sunday driver I'm not 100% sure but the shade is bomb and any other boy with a little ounce of shape for Christmas so that's dope what kind of lead man gives you Christmas yes what kind of nanos Matt he's [ __ ] right here I ain't gonna front they probably the dopest they're probably the dopest edibles in my opinion that I've had that's on the market that I've had sorry he's gonna need no booze on the market I'm saying it was on the market that's I've had okay so I really like them it's a hundred milligrams and the whole thing and it's five milligrams each dummy now a lot of [ __ ] be like oh 100 milligrams etting she got it had thousand milligrams if you got a thousand [ __ ] from the [ __ ] shop it probably wasn't a thousand milligrams I don't give a [ __ ] what you say or what you think it probably was not a thousand milligrams now some people can't take that [ __ ] don't get me wrong but most people can't because I've had a lot of people that has say a hundred that ain't [ __ ] I ain't got I'd do a thousand I'd do 500 and then they'll take like 10 or 15 of a real actual tested gummy and number uh gonna be [ __ ] up so I don't want to hear that [ __ ] so you know but don't get me wrong some people's tolerance is stronger than that [ __ ] you know cuz I also know that because my tolerance is like probably 40 54 where I like my high to be and if I wanted I could go 60 70 and still be like oh I wouldn't like out there but I could see people being over 100 but my point is you give them up like as a try on the dole singing it yo [ __ ] is to hide I think you need to take a month like a break if your tolerance is too goddamn much so anyway in Tunisia's ah let's see you got twenty gummies in here so I can say it's 100 milligrams one gummy is a serving and so you're looking at 23 servings in this [ __ ] no I'm sorry so many free calories per gummy okay when you're looking at the fat to zero fats about six grams of sugar and I mean six rounds of carbs and four grams of sugar so if you're on a keto diet this definitely is not the one for you and if you are vegan this is not for you or vegetarian this is not for you and the reason for that is because this does have gelatin in it which is weird though because the main ingredient is going to be agar but then they put gelatin in it so you could have just stopped with the agar instead of putting the gelatin in it and this is why I say this for companies that'll do this I give you when I come into the dispensary and they'll ask hey do you have any vegan gummies right that's understandable I've never remember you might have had a [ __ ] come in and say do you have non vegan gummies even make sense so the average person I'm talking probably 95 plus percent of people do not know the difference between a vegan gummy and when it comes to the taste so if I was a company I would just make all my [ __ ] vegan because it don't matter who will eat it because now it can get to anybody because no one's looking for the gelatin the market is not looking for the gelatin so I would just change that up if I was you [ __ ] because they have some that are vegan and those are good and there's no difference in the taste so to me they might as well just do all of them as vegan so I don't know why they only do a couple of women beginning some of them not but that's that so the other dope thing with this company is that they do them in sativa indica and hybrid so I like that because now you can get a little specific with your filling and your effects of [ __ ] and some companies stick to just doing this shit's hybrid which i think is it I think it makes sense because you know if the person walks up and that's the only gummy there some people would not [ __ ] with it if it's in the car and not [ __ ] wouldn't fit sativa but if it's hybrid they're like all right let's go [ __ ] it let me get it so I see the positives of that however the ones who are able to beast like specific admission I see there should fly off the shelves way quicker then a hybrid ones so this one right here is a cran a crammed pomegranate punch weird [ __ ] I don't know but it did taste good and the other cool thing with this is that it's enhanced nano molecular technology that they put in here in gummies and what man no molecular means whoa I don't even understand how that makes it react faster because it makes it react faster but what that means is that's just like a way of like I guess you could say measuring like how the speed of your molecules changing inside of your body so I think what's happening here is that they've sped up the process somehow of making the molecules in your body change for you to feel that humming um it's scented at two hour waiting game these [ __ ] is like probably 20-30 minutes if that like I got to give it to a one what was it last weekend for some reason I couldn't sleep welcome to 1:30 was up like a [ __ ] and I had to go rock climbing at like 10 o'clock or so I was tired as [ __ ] didn't want to go because I hadn't had any sleep whatsoever so I took ten milligrams of this [ __ ] and this [ __ ] was like a six hour energy drink like it was dope it really worked there was no crash I was like goddamn that [ __ ] is pretty bomb and so I like that versus that two hours you don't know when is gonna kick in type of filling cuz I've had that [ __ ] happen before once and some edibles cup but god I took the [ __ ] because it took so long for dumb [ __ ] to kick in I'm sitting there and I'm like mm-hmm hey y'all see that leprechaun run by look how things are turning out of nowhere you forgot you took some [ __ ] so uh I like these because they react a lot quicker so I definitely say give these shits a try now let me show you what they look like they like in little coin shapes and they are gluten free for all you gluten-free [ __ ] out there so it's a little sugar sprinkles on top of it mm-hmm so I'm fine and taste of them are really good no no she was bomb man actually there's really really good so it says that the candies Awards I never saw this really the winner most accurate formulated edible I guess that you mean it's pretty consistent and what they're doing in it I guess it's on mark of what is supposed to but yeah I got a really say my Anisha it's a pretty dope and another thing is some people don't like it we on 5 milligrams per they like oh how come I can't get nothing stronger it's still a hundred milligrams in the package whether I gave you 10 10 milligrams or 25 milligrams it's still the same [ __ ] amount and I personally like when they can chop it down like that because first of all some of these gummies are just good goddammit and I like that [ __ ] so I like to be able to eat more than one and that's one thing the other thing is you have more control over your dosing so let's say you want to go 25 instead of going 20 or 30 like 20 is not enough but 30 is too much so you just want to be at 25 I ain't the one for biting the [ __ ] in half and then putting that [ __ ] back you got me [ __ ] up I don't think that smart I don't think that's a sanitary I think this is like a nasty bout [ __ ] you put that [ __ ] back into the bag with the rest of my fingers now you'll slime it and touch the other ones he you nasty so for me I like to go put five milligrams and so I can like micro dose my [ __ ] and I can have more than one I will say this does give you a little bit of after cannabis he tastes but who gives a [ __ ] it's [ __ ] candidates like I hate when people be whining over to flavor like my Adeline fat and in my mind I'm like I would like to taste the vodka but I'll still take a shot I know you know like oh I just love that case well you say you like the taste of survive that is because it was smoother than the dog [ __ ] you started on back in the day so get the [ __ ] out here so you don't get a little cannabis taste just you know manna lemon woman up and grab you chronic leaves and [ __ ] take the tents guys damn it but even with that being said it's really just a good good gummy but you do get a little bit aftertaste a little bit weak but anyway so definitely I say [ __ ] these if you find these [ __ ] I say get them I'm gonna ask the the company when I see them why they don't just do it all it just you know Eggar and just make them all plant based versus doing the gelatin I say this ain't no like oh go on and be vegan and about that this is literally just to me from a company standpoint it'd be like if I was only in the company I would just make it where I know everybody can get it but I wouldn't even promote them as being safe vegan I would just put them out on the shelf and let them be what they are so that would be me if I was the one doing it but anyway that's the end of this video I hope you guys enjoyed it like I say have you seen these [ __ ] make sure you get them and before you get out of here make sure you subscribe and hit that peace you can get that [ __ ] notification alright and go follow me over on Instagram so anyway I'm out of this [ __ ] y'all keep the love going y'all love each other y'all keep the peace going and be peaceful too each other and I would see our [ __ ] a [

pretty much the same as the original you're gonna want two packages of the um jello this is the three ounce the small box or 85 grams whatever flavor you'd like two tablespoons or two packages of unflavored gelatin so two packages of those nox unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water room temperature and a half a cup of water ice cold you have to have ice cold water to bloom gelatin we're going to want a quarter cup of light corn syrup for those of you who don't like like do not like corn syrup you can use invert sugar glucose honey or a gob you just need a syrup in there and what it does is it creates a barrier between your sugar crystals so that they don't come back together that's why it's needed some type of syrup we are going to need a quarter cup of can of butter a quarter teaspoon of citric acid a half a teaspoon of gour gum and gorgum is an emulsifier which allows us to bring oil and water together because as everybody knows they are mortal enemies so in order for them to be able to become friends you use an emulsifier and what an emulsifier will do is it takes each molecule a water molecule and an oil they go in together in a bubble and it creates a bubble around uh those two molecules so it creates its own um kind of uh it creates an emulsion that's what it does and that's what emulsion is bringing oil and water together to be a uniform liquid you cannot use xanthan gum it is not an emulsifier it is a thickener and it is a stabilizer it is not an emulsifier gum is an emulsifier a stabilizer and a thickener as well as it has a natural gummy uh texture to it which helps with your gummies and for those of you who don't use it or can't get it uh you can use soy it would be one teaspoon of soy or sunflower lecithin the other reason why i like the gourd gum is it has no flavor whereas lecithin does and i don't like the flavor less of them in substitute of water if you want to add a little bit more flavor boost you can use these kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters or basically any juice that doesn't contain real fruit if you do use a juice that has real fruit you have to use a mold inhibitor like this little the lorraine's mold inhibitor and that is a must otherwise they will go moldy in a couple of weeks then this is optional this and alcohol or um everclear the 94 alcohol or grain alcohol a really cool trick alert with this uh which you'll have to wait till the end to see it um but yeah this is an option um or if you make tincture you can use your tincture provided it is made with the high percentage alcohol it has to be the 94 ish around there for flavorings you can use the lorraine flavor oils i'm today i'm going to be making uh lemon raspberry so i'm going to start with a lemon base split it up split out half raspberry and make the other half of them and make them look all pretty gel food coloring now if you want to create a solid background white food coloring a thing with this you can only use one or two drops if you use too much your gummies will not set no matter what you can freeze them you doesn't matter what you do they will not set if you use too much very important one or two drops only and i think i've got all the ingredients here covered let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made all right so the equipment that we are going to need is basically the same as the old recipe there is one major difference we are going to throw away the immersion stick or the hand blender that apparently is a very bad thing for our gelatin so on top of creating a mountain of air bubbles so that your gummies don't turn out nice and clear it also breaks the gelatin so for any of you have this white goopy stuff on the top of your candies the silicone spatula or silicone whisk is going to resolve that issue so we're not going to use the hand blender silicone only metal will damage uh the gelatin who knew it was such a delicate little flower so silicone spatula very important silicone or a wooden spoon a little strainer or a bigger one if you've got one doesn't have a small one a small um saucepan heavy bottom is preferable and on heat transfer which means when you look at the bottom of your pot there is no discoloring um it's always one even if it is discolored in spots it means that your pot gets hotter in those particular areas and it can damage your uh your product so heavy bottom not heat transfer is the best thing to go for you of course your gummy molds these bottles are one of the best for dispersing your um dispensing your syrup into the into the molds they're by a sweet sugar bell and two reasons i like is because it uses the decorating tips which makes it nice as well as they have a very deep um lip to them whatever you call this a lip screw thing if you use the dollar store ones or ones that um have the really short short neck on them and then uh you're more likely it's the lids gonna pop off because the syrup is warm there's not a lot well the pressure on it it just pops them off so fair warning either that or um one of these candy funnels uh works great as well or the little odd dropper things that those some of those molds come with you're going to need some parchment paper and a drying rack i think i have most of the equipment covered you know me i always forget something um so let's jump right into those ingredients and let's get this made so on to making our candies so the very first thing we want to do is to bloom our gelatin so i've got my two tablespoons of gelatin here and you want to um sprinkle it onto your ice cold water and as i said for gelatin to bloom correctly water has to be i size very very very cold so we just want to sprinkle it across the top so this way it doesn't clump and then you're going to stir it into the water make sure it's well mixed in and that there's no lumps now one tip for you when you're doing this with your unflavored gelatin while you're mixing it it should start to um form into the texture of um of applesauce if it doesn't then you need to add a little bit more gelatin either your gelatin is not as strong or used a little too much water over whatever it is it's probably not going to be um quite enough so like this is just a little too soupy so i'm going to add in just a sprinkle there we go so that's more the texture that you want see like applesauce and then i usually toss mine into the fridge until i need it so i've added my um two boxes of jello to my pot already and then in goes our light corn syrup or whatever syrup you choose to use and yes you can use can of syrup and our other half a cup of water now this is one thing i learned the citric acid does not go in until the end so you never had your citric acid while you're preparing once everything's done and heated that's when you add in your citric acid the acid works like acid it melts things so it interferes with the cooking or the setting process if you add it in too early same thing if you use the cooked version make sure to only add it once you're done so once you've got your water and your corn syrup and your jello in the pot you just want to get her mixed and turn your heat onto low so we don't need to use a double board a double boiler as long as you keep it on lower minimum you're good if you start to see any white streaking take it off the heat immediately so you're just going to continue to stir this until the sugar and everything is dissolved okay so i've been stirring on low heat here for about 10 minutes we're pretty much done so you look at the bottom there and you can see it's it's nice and clear and when you stream it it looks clear so now that portion is done we are going to get our unflavored gelatin now that our jello and our corn syrup and that is done we are now turned off our heat this is when we're going to add in our citric acid uh so a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and again citric acid is what prevents your sugar from crystallizing right essentially it's an acid and it continues to melt things there is such a science and chemistry with sugar and water and acids and stuff it's like wow mind blowing so quarter teaspoon of citric acid in there give her a little gentle stir so next goes in our unflavored gelatin what i like to do is to cut it up into little squares makes it easier to melt and so we're just going to let them sit there for just a minute or so and then you just want to gently stir until your until the unflavored gelatin is all completely melted then once your gelatin is all melted and everything is a uniform color and texture that's how you know everything is melted and night skins come together everybody's being friends in the pot now we're going to add our can of butter and our gourgum so in goes our butter half a teaspoon of our gum and i use the strainer um so that it'll evenly distribute it over the uh butter um otherwise it can clump up and as well you want to make sure to sprinkle it onto the butter part and not the candy syrup because again if it hits the syrup part it'll clump the oil or the butter will make it melt it's a pretty wild uh ingredient i have to admit we're just gonna get that evenly sprinkled over our butter and we're gonna let that sit for one minute all right after it's been sitting there for about a minute we're going to start to whisk this now you don't want to go crazy whisking because as i said too hard breaks our gelatin it is going to break it a little bit but we don't want to go too gentle because we actually have to create be able to break that oil down small enough so that it can create an emulsion so it's finding that happy medium so i just kind of get it started here so we're trying to whisk with minimal air bubbles and then we have a look and take a look at the top and see if you see any kind of oil slick if you do continue to whisk it a little bit longer and then check it again if you still see some oil um coming up to the top you see some oil slicks happening we can add in a little bit more gour gum but this time you're not going to add it directly into the pot just get your bowl that your butter was in there's enough oil in there to deal with it and we're just gonna take a little bit like about an eighth of a teaspoon and you stir it into the oil into the butter it dissolves the gore gum as otherwise as i said if you just dump that in now it'll just lump up once it's dissolved into there just add it in like soup and whisk it again again have a look so here i've got some air bubbles we have a little bit of other gelatin broken a little bit but nowhere near like when we use the um the uh pan blender much nicer so now that we have this as our base here now is when we can add our flavors and our color so this said i wanted to do lemon raspberry so i'm going to split this off to half about right so for this side i'm going to add just a little bit more lemon and to this side i'm going to add in our raspberry it's probably a little too much raspberry and we're going to add in our colors so i'm going to keep the yellow which one do i want to keep clear i think i'll keep the yellow clear and i'm going to make the red solid so as i said if you've got the white um food coloring you have to shake it up really really well if it sits on the sits in your cover it has a tendency to separate so you really want to mix it well otherwise it leaves little white dots so that might be a little too much it's always let's do a couple drops a little heavy handed and i'm going to whisk this one together oh these red food coloring that's a pretty color now because i'm pretty sure i've added too much white like i said i only got to add in one or two drops because i kind of went a little heavy-handed likely this red isn't going to set but what i'm going to do is i'm going to quick test it i'm going to put a little bit into a i'm just going to put a little bit into a into a dish i'm going to throw this into the fridge for a couple of minutes to see if it sets up if it doesn't i'm going to add some additional gelatin to that side all right so my little test here it it's setting up that was just a couple minutes in the fridge we're setting no problem now if you'd done that and it was still sticky sticking to your finger then you would want to add about a half a tablespoon of additional unflavored bloom gelatin so you would bloom a half a tablespoon to three tablespoons of cold cold water and add it to that to the solid side but we're good and i went ahead and i added my yellow to my yellow side here and now what i'm going to just do is i'm going to let them sit for just a couple of minutes and allow the air bubbles to come up to the top and that white icky stiff stuff to come and we can pull that out before we pour it into our bottles so our syrup now has been sit and set for a little bit and it's cooled off and you can see kind of that layer on top here take your strainer and just very gently scoop that out so this is the kind of the air bubble a little bit of the broken gelatin but we can get a lot of that out before we put it in the bottle and then with your strainer and you just want to hold it over the bottle and pour your syrup into the bottle dead on on that one not bad and now we're ready to cast our candies so a tip for you put your molds into your freezer before you start that way they're nice and cold and your gelatin your syrup will start to solidify right away especially if you're doing two colors that way they won't all bleed together another tip for you before you pour turn your bottles upside down put your fingers over the tips and just tap them what this will do is bring all the air bubbles to the top or to the bottom of the bottles so again helps make it much nicer candy okay then and then just fill up your molds now one thing important with your molds is don't fill them all the way to the top you want to go just just below it go all the way to the top it creates a ridge that gets icky it gets hard these are guys you're gonna look so cool yellow on yellow is tough it's hard to see it especially when it's clear so this recipe will make about um about a hundred or so of this size mold that i'm using probably about 300 of the teeny tiny and probably about 60 50 60 of the larger size all right so my gummies have set get your cooling rack your drying wrap parchment paper design your rock [Applause] and just pop out your gummies now if you can stand them up if they'll stand up better but if not just lay them down and then after about 12 hours flip them and let them fully dry out i usually flip them a couple times a day i walk by and do my flip and these guys will take about 24 to 48 hours to fully dry out and you want to make sure that you have a dry place humidity will not help your candies dry out at all drying and humid do not work together so if you do have a human place um if you can get a dehumidifier that will greatly help you out so i'm just going to finish uncasting these little guys and i'm going to go into the next step and show you the little trick with the alcohol and what that does and then how to successfully uh sugar sour coats your candies so be sure to stay tuned so this is the size of the candies when you take them out of the mold and that's the size of the candies once they dry so they shrink there a little bit there all right so here's a trick that i learned a tip that i learned and um it's gonna make your lives a whole lot easier especially for those of you guys who ship and we're having troubles with your candy sticking together what you're going to do is you're going to take your everclear or your um everclear or alcohol depending on where you're from anywhere you're 94 or up percentage alcohol put it into a small spray bottle remember the equipment that i always forget to tell you small spray bottle was one of them so put your alcohol into a small spray bottle so we want to give our candies a bit of a generous spray here and then just mix them up let the alcohol get into all candy all over and again if you can do this with tincture if you've got your tincture provided you did it with the uh the high grade alcohol and once you do that just put them out rip them up and let the alcohol evaporate it takes about 20 minutes or so and that's it it creates um kind of creates a bit of a barrier it keeps your candies um chewier for a longer period of time so i've had these guys out for about four days and see they're still perfectly squishy and gummy and not dried out looking or anything and that's what the alcohol helps to do and it also prevents them from sticking together all right so the next part is how to successfully sugar coat your gummies all right so this is the really other cool thing that i learned how to successfully coat our candies so for the most part you take them out you coated them they melt it it gets ugly we're not happy because that's because we're doing it wrong well the reason is and citric acid as i said is an acid if there is any moisture it is going to cause it to uh to melt so that's what's happening is you take your candies out of the fridge it's warmer outside of your fridge you know room temperature it automatically creates moisture from cold to warm or if you just automatically put your candies in or there's any moisture it the strict acid will melt so in order to successfully coat them so they don't what you want to do is once your candies have fully dried after a couple of days and if you do the step with the alcohol coating and they're done take your candies take a drying rack and just spread them out onto the drying rack then you're going to get your pot of boiling water here and we're going to just hold the rack over the steam just move it around so our candy's getting cut getting steamed up here and we don't burn our hands so what we're doing here is we're creating them we're giving them a little bit of a heat steam melt to create a bit of tackiness and then our candies stick and they don't melt so once they feel kind of gooey a little bit gooey there it doesn't take very long just dump them into your sugar your sugar mix now for the most part you do about a cup of sugar to a quarter teaspoon or so of the citric acid and then taste that these guys didn't get steamed and give that a taste and see how you like it then just add a little bit at a time until you get the desired sourness that you would like or you can just sugar coat them you don't have to do the sour so once they're done you put them in the bowl mix them all up get your wrap parchment paper i don't have enough room ah i so need a bigger table then just shake off your excess and if there's any ones that didn't get coated just hold them over the steam and that's it onto the rack they're pretty much ready to go they take about 20 minutes to dry fully dry out and that's it you will have your sugar coating that will not melt and there you have them nicely coated sugar sour coated uh gummies that aren't going to melt on you all right guys so that's everything i have for you today i hope you enjoyed that video even though it was a do-over but good so is you did get to learn a couple of new things and that should greatly improve your candies all right so and once again thank you so much for joining me today and i hope you have an awesome rest of your day bye", "GlCw8icMXRQ": "[Music] my friends welcome to wheats the marijuana a show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at a new product new brand and we are taking a look at I don't actually know the name of this brand I think it's the master bud teller doesn't have an oh sorry the master baker 420 and they're lovingly named multiple Bayer Gazans 200 milligrams again from the master baker 420 very small edible company Emily seen them out a couple of places the gummy bears look a little weird never seen gummy bears that look quite like that very shitty packaging generic little prop 265 label seems to be prop 215 label cheap little ziploc bag with some cheap little stickers on it never a good sign no ingredients no laboratory testing also very bad sign but it was a more expensive than then you would imagine at 15 bucks for 200 milligrams for gummy edibles is a little bit higher that's a little bit more than so like you're at a pure or infused creations normally for that price so hopefully it'll be good I don't have a lot of faith I generally find to be gum needs to be not very good I've found a few exceptions to that rule but again the exceptions that prove the rule and generally shitty packaging no laboratory testing are pretty big indicators that something's gonna be a pretty shitty shitty product but will give it its fair shake hopefully they taste good and hopefully they'll get me high at 200 milligrams they certainly should so I'll go ahead and shut up give them a taste and if you guys have never tuned into a wheats root review before the way they work is I'm gonna eat the product some number of it in front of you maybe not the whole thing don't wanna bore you to death and then I'll come back to you guys in two and actually let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so okay nice little tear open packaging easy to open it's always a plus so here are our gummy bears very again weird we are looking gummy bears it's not focusing very well there but nothing like I've ever seen before a lot of like crystallized sugar on them let's give it a taste mmm not bad certainly taste better than infused creations or at a pure it doesn't have that really astringent cannabis taste there's a little bit of a cannabis aftertaste but it's not nearly as bad again as the sort of more egregious companies yeah not bad slight cannabis taste but not gonna make you gag so guys I'm gonna finish off these multiple bear gasp limbs which I do kind of like that name and then I'll be sure to come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how we're feeling so thanks for watching weeds and I will see you guys in just a bit peace welcome back to weeds guys there have been no bear gazans to speak of certainly not multiple bear Gazans not that I really know what a bear gasm is but I assume it's kind of like getting high or having a normal gasm orgasm and this is nothing like that this is like having shitty gummy bears and then not much else happening after that yeah there's not much to say about these they're bad they don't taste as bad as a tepee roar infused creations or some of the other really awful tasting gummies out there but they're just as weak as those in terms of potency and even shittier packaging and maybe a little bit more expensive than those as well so uh straight-up no thank you when it comes to the master baker 420 I think I might try some more of their products review some more cuz I think they have some things that are more confectionery in nature your brownies your cookies we'll see if those are any better but a really bad start so far for the master baker 420 with the fun named but not so hot of a product multiple bear Gazans 200 milligrams that's a total total pass for me if you guys see these skip them no problem saying that well that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys sorry for the bummer hopefully next time we'll have something a little bit more fun for you I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a future review peace", "EI2FrKdifbk": "[Music] we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I've got a fresh look at that ooh that is pretty to look at a fresh jar of Nutella and pancakes love Nutella if you didn't know a fresh jar to tell us and that means we are gonna be reviewing some gummies that's right guys we're back with more gummies I always know I'm telling you to be wary of gummies I'm weary of gummies and I'm wary of these gummies so this was a 500 milligrams worth of gummies don't worry I'm not eating all 500 milligrams today we're just gonna do a test to see if there any potent whatsoever I picked these up for 30 bucks at my dispensary so a very good deal if these are in fact 500 milligrams worth of gummies I doubt that that is gonna be the case this is the canna MX brand taste innovation only the finest quality there are 50 gummy bears in here in total with 10 milligrams per gummy bear so we are going to do 20 in total for 200 milligrams and we're gonna do our review on 200 milligrams of the canon mix in total canna MX canna mix I'm gonna go with canna mix is how you say that it's spelled canna MX all one word unless so again 30 bucks for 500 milligram gummy edible is a great deal if in fact it works but there are a lot of red flags chiefly the price you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles second the packaging this isn't cheap easy to make packaging it's just a sticker on a ziplock bag always a bad sign to we're almost always a bad sign I've had a couple of good things come in cheap packaging like this but not a lot um and just the fact they're gummies that's also usually a bad sign I have bad luck with gummies there are a lot of people unscrupulous folks out there making gummies that aren't worth they're a damn and I'm hoping that isn't gonna be the kids that can of MX we're gonna give him a totally fair shot so I have Nutella just to uh turley completely boost my of getting any kind of tolerance she's taking a little bit of extra fat with the gummies just to help process that THC so here we go let's open them up give the taste test the smell test all that fun stuff so you can see the gummies in there they look like pretty plain gummies they don't have any coating on them they don't have anything additional on them it smells both intensely fruity and intensely cannabis ewwww so here we go nothing on the outside they're not sticky or anything like that I'm just gonna grossly dip it right in Nutella get some fat going here there we go mm hmm well I didn't really taste any cannabis but that might be because I've got the Nutella on it but Wow okay a little bit of cannabis taste on that one okay let's just try one clean here there's a slight cannabis taste to them but really these are on the less cannabis II and of gummy taste that I for gummies or less cannabis II tasting gummies that I've had also a bad sign this is not gross tasting like the etta pure infused creations which I find really hard to stomach although I don't find those to be any good whatsoever so I'm hoping that doesn't mean that these are gonna be bad but we'll have to find out so I've eaten four already I'm gonna do sixteen more and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review you don't really care about how these can be Bears tastes you want to know if Kanna MX is something you should be buying in the future so guys I'll see you in two hours to let you know for sure thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been two hours since I had the canna mx-5s quality 500 milligram gummies I only had 200 milligrams of them but there's not 200 milligrams of THC in there i am i high at all i'm like a - maybe somewhere in there don't feel pleasantly stoned I feel like I had to join an hour ago yeah [ __ ] Ken MX and their gummy bears it's a load of [ __ ] these aren't potent at all another crappy gummy and another crappy gummy company all the telltale signs were there that she priced the sticker the she packaging oh and all kin of MX no do not spend your money on these guys if you see them stay far far away I do have some of their chocolate bars to review maybe they'll be good I have seen where chocolate bars are still good and the gummy brands are bad where when people have both like um we get a flavor ex their chocolate isn't bad but their gummies are terrible so we'll see but as right now just pass on the gummy bears don't waste your money and [ __ ] these guys for you know where's the lab tested result where's the nutrition information where's all that good stuff it's not here because they don't want you to know because it's just gummy bears they bought off the shelf and infused maybe some cannabis in there possibly who knows maybe I'm just high because I smoked like two hours ago and that's what I'm still feeling not feeling anything most boy I this is like our sixth dud review in a row or something maybe we've had a string up they might not all come out in the order of duds in a row but I have reviewed a bunch of doodoo back to back to back I am really looking for a diamond in the rough a pleasant surprise I was hoping Kevin MX was it gonna be it I gave him a fair shot but definitely do not gonna be the gummy bears from them so final conclusion if you see Kanna mx4 now avoid everything I'll review their chocolate if their chocolates good I'll be sure to let you know we'll assess them fairly but for right now there's no reason to buy any of their products because if they're gonna rip you off with this it's more than likely they're gonna rip you off with other things so sorry to be a bummer guys I really wish we could have had something more fun for you but at least we know not to mix it up with Kanna MX or something so guys thank you so much for watching this review I appreciate you watching as always and we will see on the next review peace", "1Y7hrWj9sY0": "hey everyone its James from fun foods and today I'm just going to make these Mountain Dew gummy bears now this was a request video and they turned out amazing so keep watching I'll show you step by step how to make these now the first thing we need to do in a medium pot we need to add two cups of Mountain Dew soda to it then just bring this over to the stove until it starts to boil while we're waiting for our mountain dew to start boiling get out a large pot and to that we want to add one more cup of Mountain Dew soda and then I have three of these packets of unflavored gelatin just take it out and sprinkle it on top of your Mountain Dew you don't have to mix it just sprinkle it all in there now just let that do its magic while we're waiting on our other mountain Dew to boil alright so when your Mountain Dew starts to boil we'll just turn off the heat and take it over to our work station now just pour your boiling Mountain Dew into your Mountain Dew that we poured the unflavored gelatin on and mix it in you want to mix it for about five minutes until all that unflavored gelatin has dissolved and at this stage now that all our gelatin has dissolved what I'm going to do is divide this I'm going to keep some of them this color this regular Mountain Dew yellow color and some of them I'm gonna turn green so I just want to pour some in another bowl not a lot and add a little green food coloring to it mix that up now just let these sit out for a little bit before we put them in our molds because I'm using plastic molds I don't want the heat the hot liquid to melt my plastic molds so you have to be really careful if you're using silicone molds you can put them in there right away that's fine but plastic molds be careful don't let them be too hot or they'll melt your molds now I'm going to transfer my liquid into something with a pour spout just to make it easier for me to pour them into our molds so they don't go all over the place so the little one here I'm going for the green in big one I'll pour the yellow all right so now I have my mold here and I just have this one template of little bears it's only six of them so I have this little silicone silicone mold it looks like bananas or something just use up the stuff the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna fill about half these bears with the green and then half with the yellow now hopefully I'll have just a steady hand when I'm doing the yellow we'll see and then just fill your other molds up whichever way you'd like now just take these put these in a refrigerator for a couple hours just until they set well my Mountain Dew gummy bears have been in the refrigerator setting up for about three hours I'm a bit nervous and I don't know if I used enough gelatin they are firm but not as firm as I want them to be so we're gonna try to get them out of here see if we get them out intact and that's always a challenge especially when you don't have a silicone mold so let's try this I'm gonna try with a knife gently to remove this and decapitate it the first one that's not good poor bear taste food anyway don't think it's gonna work out my friends we got to do Plan B we got to make them with more gelatin so since it didn't work out on our last attempt we're gonna try things a little different this time we're still going to start out with the saucepan and we're gonna add 2 cups of Mountain Dew soda to that bring this over to the stove and bring it to a boil while that's over on the stove boiling we have one cup of Mountain Dew in a large bowl this time I'm gonna use five of these packets of this Knox unflavored gelatin and I think that was part of the problem not all the problem but part of it I want to make it a little firmer than it was it was almost just like a jello and not like a gummy so we're gonna add five packets of this and you just sprinkle this in on top of your Mountain Dew [Music] and this time what I'm doing differently is preparing our molds a little bit different last time they didn't come out too well and of course if you have silicone molds use that because there's a lot easier but what I'm gonna do this time is I'm gonna spray this with some cooking spray gently just a little bit and then because I'm extra nervous about this is I'm going to let's wipe a little bit of the excess off it so it's a bit much not dry but just no puddles of spray now we want to take some powdered sugar or icing sugar and we just want to lightly coat this I'm just really going the extra step to make sure it doesn't stick in there now we can just fill our molds I'm gonna do three of them green three um yellow and hopefully they work out this time all right so I have pulled my gummy bears out of the refrigerator they've been in there about three and a half hours and now it's show time to see if they come out of this mold all intact I got my fingers crossed I hope it happens if not we'll have to redo this with some silicone molds so let's see how we did I'll start with the yellow one I'm just gonna kind of pull it away from the sides a little bit of my fingers before I try to pull it out hopefully that will work and see if I can kind of like push it and peel it out looks like it might work oh yes I did it so one of the other ones have come out nicely perfect well now something to taste us I'm gonna try one of the yellow gummy bears the yellow Mountain Dew gummy bears and see how taste tastes like Mountain Dew now I'm do gummy bear it's pretty good and this is the one I didn't put any food coloring in it it was just straight and Mountain Dew so really good well thanks everyone for watching I hope you enjoyed watching me make these Mountain Dew gummy bears is a lot of fun making these and thanks again for the person who suggested I make them if you have a suggestion yet you would like to see me make write it in the comment section below and hopefully I'll get around to making it also if you enjoyed this video be sure to hit that like button hit that big red subscribe button if you're not already subscribed you're gonna get a few videos a week every Saturday I do a mountain Dew video every Sunday I do my regular video every Tuesday I do a live stream and every Thursday night is a bonus video so for right now make sure you check out some of the videos I have off to the side and I will see you guys next time", "8YfY_NDparw": "and welcome back to my channel today I am going to be showing you how to make canna gummies I did a video on my channel on how I make that infused coconut oil so this is just pretty much a part 2 on how I make my gummies I'm going to show you what I use I had all measured out just to make it a little bit easier for you so you are going to need two packs of this jello it's 85 grams you only 2 of those you'll need 1 envelope of gelatin you will need 1/4 cup of cannabis coconut infused oil so I will link that video down below on how I made this and then you will need 1/2 a cup of water you can use juice or water I chose to use juice it just gives it more of a nicer flavor and you can't taste the weed then you are going to take your gummy bear trays which I got these on Amazon I think all for five of these were $20 so let's get started on the first step this is a very very easy recipe and anybody can do it I mean I can okay so we're going to put this on low heat and we are going to add our canna oil [Music] then our half a cup of water or juice you're gonna walk to so you're gonna want to get this to a boil I already pre turned it on so that's why it's sizzling like that so you're just gonna get it to a nice little boil and I do have this on medium heat so you don't want it to burn so just put it on medium then once it is boiled I will tell you the next step it's already hot so I should be able to add in my next ingredients which is the gelatin and the jello so again it's one cup of the gelatin and two of these 85 gram cellos I usually do not turn the burner on to warm it up so that's why it's like that this is one of the easiest recipes I have found so I am just stirring it and waiting for it to come to a boil which doesn't take long then I will start putting them in my trays so once it has just came to a boil like this you are going to turn it on probably one or two cuz you don't want it too high but you don't want it to get cold and then I have this and you're going to have to keep stirring it well you were putting it in the gummy tray if you don't the can't oil will kind of like go to the top like oil and water doesn't mix right so you just imagine if you stop mixing it like this it's not gonna work and then you are just going to put these in as you keep stirring it's kind of hard to do like both at once but you have to make sure that you keep stirring it I have not stirred it and then all of the oil goes to the top of the gummy bear and the gummy bear is just a terrible consistency it'll be gummy on the front and then the back it'll just be like pure cannabis so really it's not enjoyable for you to eat the gummies I usually get about four trays so I will just bring you a little closer and this is how the wheel gummies come out so not too hard so I'm trying to do this about hand just like this cute little cousin bears so that's how you make it it's really really easy to follow I can make it so you if you have any questions leave them down below and I will try to answer them for you", "YmpPGpPUw0Q": "[Music] hi guys welcome to Diamond delight edibles if this is the first time you're joining my name is Liz and all-you-can regular guys welcome back thank you so much for your support I just popped that 10,000 market oh my god think you could not have done any of that without your support guys I really really appreciate it it just means the world to me you like me you really really like me sorry just being an ass having some fun alright so today what I'm gonna do now that I showed you how to do canna candy sugar & Canas syrup we can now make our gummies without using butter and the Gerber is an emulsifier however if you want to make them super super strong absolutely go ahead and stuff the butter back in there but this gives you far more control over how strong or weak that you would like to make them now you guys are always asking me how much milligrams etc something is and I don't generally tend to answer that very often because it is all dependent upon what you make how you make it once you're starting THC is etc so what I've done is in the description there I've included a link for the calculator that I use it's a free signup it's a little course you're more than welcome to have a look take a look at it listen to her she's really interesting and lots of information but the calculator you can use for free and that's what I use so then you can go ahead and you can make your calculations and figure out how strong etc that you want to make your candies and with this it gives you a lots of versatility so you can go all can of sugar and syrup or half-and-half which is what I'm gonna do in the recipe so I will stop babbling on now and I'm gonna get into the ingredients of course and of course what we need and then we'll put all that stuff together and make some awesome gummies there we go alright guys all right so for our new gelatin for our new gummy version here you're gonna use one box of your paper flavored jello I three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water for blooming your gelatin or what I use are these kool-aid waters so they're just flavored water so I now use these in place of water they're great because they add more flavour to it or you can kind of combine some flavors which is really cool to do so I use those things are nice they're lighter and sugar and said just adding more flavor now another thing you can do for adding flavor is juice crystals now I get these at the bulk bar and you can only get them during the summer time but I get these in all different flavors and I've got two tablespoons of those again enhancing the flavor that way if you don't want to use or have these flavors artificial flavors you can go use those which work great the other thing you're going to need is a quarter cup of your can of syrup and a quarter cup of water for our jello and then for our candy side our candy version so it's going to be like the other one where we do the cook you're going to need a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar or again you can use a full can of sorry a full cup of your can of sugar same thing with your syrup I'm using a quarter cup of canned syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup again you can go and use as much or as little of either of those as you like I like to do the half-and-half mainly for taste and not to kill people so that's my kind of my you I don't want anybody rendered completely useless and then we are going to need 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and then as well if you want to add additional colors or flavors you can add those optionally as well and as I said if you want to add your butter as well it really makes them super duper you can do that you're just going to follow exactly the same thing except the previous steps from the previous version with regards to adding the butter and the Goregaon to emulsify it now something else I wanted to say and the same thing now in this version I'm not using the clear gel however you can use the clear gel exactly the same way as you do in the previous recipe of the regular and sour gummy recipe that's a good one to follow it's the most up-to-date and gives you both those versions that you can use and that's all we need for our ingredients and now we'll get into our equipment and then we will get the best part go and we'll get all this stuff put together alright so the equipment that you're going to need just like the other recipes a double boiler I just do a makeshift I get a bowl that will make sure that your water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you will need a smaller saucepan for our candy syrup two spatulas you will need your candy thermometer and you will need a larger pot that your bought is that your saucepan small saucepan will fit into ice water water with ice in it but a little tongue-tied today and obviously your candy molds now a lot of you ask me how many candy is gum you will get out of a batch now it's all depending obviously on the size molds that you use if you use about this large size I got these from Michaels you will get about sixty if you use of this size gummy which is kind of a little bit larger than those big ones you're going to get it probably about 75 to 100 and if you use the little teeny tiny ones then you're going to get about 150 to 200 of them so that's approximately what that recipe will break down to you for you and now d'leh before we get started there is something very important that I found out from my other recipe when I started this is and I don't do this in the other recipes but when we're working with the can of sugar and the can of syrups it is a must that we oil down the sides and the insides of our pot for the candy syrup reason being when it heats up and starts boiling the oil THC oil starts to separate and it sticks to the smiths of the metal of the pot you might have noticed that if you did that with a can of syrup which is why I redid the video for that specific reason so we're going to do things a little bit differently than we do for the regular candy recipe but I'll show you all those details once we get into it but the very first thing and don't really don't want to forget is we're going to lightly grease our saucepan and hold on just couldn't dribble a little bit of oil into it and then make sure to work it all the way around make sure to get it right into the corners because anywhere that this oil is not where there's no oil your THC will sit the only thing that dissolves THC oil is oil because it is oil soluble by doing this we're going to be able to scrape anything that sticks to the sides off much much easier then seeing all your products that they're going oh what happened so you said you want to lightly grease that you don't want to have any excess oil so make sure to do that up as well as your spatulas you want to lightly oil your spatulas for the same reason when we scrape it off the sides if these are not oiled it sticks to it and it doesn't come off so you want to make sure anything that is going to be touching the THC the syrup you want to make sure that you all and that's it I'm gonna get into putting our ingredients together and get this started oh one other thing I wanted to cover is with your moles I don't spray my moles beforehand but I have found sometimes that they do stick but so what I do is I care them so I will spray them or oil them down lightly let it sit for 20 minutes in the mold and then wash them out so it still leaves that oily feel but it's not gonna leave your Piquet knees all greasy and makes it far easier for them to come as well as you only have to cure them once every few once every five or six batches or so so it lasts a long time by doing it that way all right so now I promise we'll get into the ingredients in our candy all righty so the very first thing that we are going to do is we are going to microwave our quarter cup of liquid for about 50 seconds till it's boiling and we're going to bloom our unflavored gelatin all right so you're going to evenly sprinkle your gelatin over the top of your liquid whether you use water or the kool-aid water and then you are going to stir it in now a lot of punches I explained in about whether that your gummies did not are not that they're too sticky but they're not gelatin enough that can depend a lot of power on your gelatin I just bought a batch of gelatin because I buy a bulb that didn't it wasn't blooming at the strength of it or something was not working well I did two batches and I had almost double the gelatin so a lot of it is dependent upon your gelatin now one test that I do is when I put in the three tablespoons and mix it in it should start very quickly to get the texture of apple sausage and clicking up pretty quickly now this is not so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add in another half a tablespoon of gelatin yes I've just sprinkled on another half a tablespoon and I'm gonna stir that in and now I'm getting that texture of applesauce can you kind of see what I mean that's how you know you're probably are at the great strength for your gelatin starting off if your gelatin is not right from the beginning if it's mushy I'll show you when we go to put this in but that's the texture it should be once you once we've got it mixed in now we're gonna set that aside for five minutes or so to let that bloom now meanwhile we will add our box of jell-o I'm giving the blueberries well berry blue and we are going to add in our boiling water and stir that around and get it dissolving see was it and then just keep scraping because the jello will cause the sides of the bowl are cool it's good to just kind of stick to it so just keep scraping the sides down as you go and turn your heat on to low so again we only want to melt our gelatin over a hot water bath we don't want it hot at boiling at all that's what breaks our gelatin a lot of the time is you don't even think that you've got it too hot but really past hot water probably by 150 degrees it is that's about all you need so that's that's a big mistake that a lot of people make myself included so I'm just going to continue to stir that gently until the gelatin is dissolved and then we will add in our corn syrup and our other stuff and once your gelatin and that has started to melt the sugar takes longer because the sugar melts at a higher at a bit of a higher heat so it just takes a little bit longer but once your gelatin and that is melted you can add in your corn syrup and your flavor crystals if you're wanting to add so you saw your canister your quarter cup of Kanna syrup and then your flavored juice crystals if you want to add those in as additional flavoring and again just stir that until it all starts gets incorporated and now for you guys asking for those clear gummies how do I get my gummies clear this well you can now you could have perfectly clear gummies so I'm gonna kick it continue to stir this and just gently mix it together until everything is melted and combined I'd you notice I got my nails done so for all of you those wishing that I get them done they're done and to those of you commented there you go I know I looked at the videos and thought make and those are ratty looking hands so I do apologize hopefully it'll be better from now on in the future I hope you like these a little bit better do you got a look at them for quite a long time so why not make them a little bit more attractive and also just remember to continually scrape down the sides of your bowl so that the gelatin is not sticking to the sides and just to show you this is just how hot your water should be there shouldn't be any boiling just a little bit of steam coming off of that that's as how that's as hard as you want to get it otherwise any hotter than that it's gonna break your gelatin alright so now that everything's pretty much dissolved I'm going to add in our gelatin now here's another thing if your gelatin is after 5 minutes or so blooming is mushy when you touch it then your gelatin is not strong enough so whether it's old and it's weakened or there are different gelatin with different strengths if it is nice and firm to the touch and no mushy you're good to go so I just split this up into pieces slap her in and you're just gonna let that you're just gonna gently again stir that until it completely melts and again if you start to see any kind of foaming may take it off your heat immediately it's getting too hot so I'm just gonna let them set them going to continue to stir that until my gelatin is fully melted well once your gelatin is melted and everything looks good and it is nice and translucent just set it off to the side and now we're going to start our candy syrup alright for our candy syrup in goes our half a cup of white sugar our half a cup of Candace Canon sugar our Candace syrup quarter cup a can of syrup like I said before you're more than welcome to play around with your different measurements on that as long as it equals 1/2 a cup either way it doesn't matter and our quarter cup of light corn syrup our half a cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to gently stir that till ever - your syrup till your sugar and water and everything's just combined and then once you're combined here turn your heat on to medium Cline to start and then we're going to drop it down to medium once it begins to boil and you're just going to continue stirring this make sure to get all around the edges because the sugar likes to sit there and so we're going to continue to stir this until it starts to boil now all of my and all the other candy recipes I say as soon as we start boiling we're gonna stop stirring and use our brush not in this recipe and I'll show you once it starts boiling as I said the oils yeah I got a little syrup on the burner there so the oils start to separate out with the heat and until it gets all to the same kind of temperature it will they will stick to the side so we're going to have to continually work the sides of the pot but you're going to want to be very very gentle because we don't want to spit dirt into the syrup so as I said I'll show that all to you once it gets there now you'll start to notice as as it's starting to heat up if you scrape the sides of your pot see all that that's your oil and that's what we want to make sure it gets back into our syrup so I usually have to use the two you want as I said you have to grease both spatulas here and work it off get it back into the syrup and we're gonna have to do this continuously through the whole cooking process so at anytime that you see any darkness starting to form on the side make sure to scrape it down and as your syrup gets hotter you can just put your spatula in it'll just melt it off and also make sure when you are scraping the sides of your pot hold on to the handle firmly I've done it before I wasn't paying attention and whoops and the last thing you want is molten lava being poured anywhere other keeping it in the pot so when your syrup begins to bubble starts boiling you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and remember this is normally where I say we stop stirring not this time so we're not actually going to stir it what we're gonna do is just to continually scrape around the sides of the pot but don't go deep into the syrup we just want to stay around the bubble area and you just want to keep pulling this in so this is the alcohol of the excess alcohol and stuff burning off and any impurities that are in it so see how it's gathering up on the sides that's what we want to make sure get them back into our syrup whatever is supposed to cook off will cook off whatever is good will stay in so again just gently don't go into the stirs syrup just gently keep going around the sides and you'll do behind the candy thermometer towards the end and we are going to cook our syrup - if you want a soft candy you're gonna cook it to 260 if you want a firm candy you can go as high as 280 280 is soft crack I'm gonna go to just before that I'm going to take this to 275 but you see what I mean about the oils how they just continue they'll keep going to the sides of the pot as it heats up and gets up to temperature it will it will the oils will get incorporated and once your syrup is boiling in that you want to just turn your heat down to medium just medium a little above medium I said then don't forget to get behind in behind the thermometer because it will hide in behind there I love the smell of this syrup cooking it's oh it smells so awesome oh and just as a tip for safety always have a fan either an overhead fan I've got one going or the if you've got an overhead on your stove regardless when you're ever working with tinctures even though you've working them in a dehydrated yeah most of it's cooked off some of them may not be and you just want on the safety side always have a fan going and leave don't be sparking anything up in the in the general area so you've had your gelatin sitting over on the side and you have a look and you've noticed that there's all this white inky foam stuff and you're sure positive that you didn't do it high on high heat the heat didn't get too hot that'll happen so nice if the gelatin is old and it's starting to break down so if you do see that in order to compensate for that bloom another tablespoon of unflavored gelatin and we're going to add it into the candy mixture at the end that's gonna help us compensate for the gelatin that's broken in our mixture here so that will help it so anytime that your candies come out super sticky and you can't get them out of the mold the reason is is because the gelatin is not gelling properly so there's a really handy tip there for you guys now in order to get that out because I don't want that in to go my syrup I'm gonna run this through a strainer before we put it into our syrup so now I might actually my syrup while I was babbling away there is getting close to temperature I've got my ice water ready to go and as soon as it hits temperature I'm gonna drop the bottom into the pot and once the temperature starts coming down and the cooking process is stopped I'm gonna set it to the side until the temperature comes down to 240 before we add our gelatin in just watch your thermometer till until the temperature starts coming down and your bubbles start stop bubbling and then just set it to the side and said until your temperature comes down to 240 all right so now my syrup is cooled and then it's say because I don't want that white foamy stuff into my syrup I'm going to use a strainer to pour it through that way it'll catch all the chunks of jell-o gelatin and being bad and I'm going to mix that in now I also what I did was I bloomed another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid and we're going to add that in a little bit in a little bit so right now you're going to stir your jello and your candy syrup until it is all combined and if you find that your syrup is a little too sticky and it's solidified you can put your heat on to minimum you just want to heat the bottom to get the syrup off the bottom now you can make sure that you do so that you scrape the sides and if you said if you find that it's too hard coming off turn your heat on and it'll eventually start to melt so you just want to want to keep doing that until everything is completely melted in all the same temperature all right so now that everything is all melted together and nicely mixed now this is a test that I do to determine whether my syrup is did a job correctly if I pull it up and you see how it just goes in a nice smooth syrup it doesn't really seem to start gelling or anything it stays in a fine line so that's kind of telling me that this is gonna turn out way too sticky it's gonna come out what's it like you can't get it out of the mold it's more candy than the gelatin that's what I said about my gelatin breaking there that I knew that was gonna happen so I've added it I'm gonna add in the additional gelatin that I bloomed and I'm just gonna stir that until it's completely dissolved so now if you want your syrup just translucent that nice clear there you go you've got it you can go ahead and put it into your bottles your squirt bottles or use the little eye droppers for dispensing into your molds but however I never like to keep things plain so I'm gonna do half-and-half or I've got translucent and solid and also just to give you a look to see how to go about doing that all right so now when after adding the additional gelatin in now when I do my test you'll see it's thicker and it'll start to split up and almost solidify in midair so that's how you know it's likely going to set correctly I still had to not do things correctly that's occasionally but that is a very good indication that you're safe and good to go so if you wanted translucent go ahead and put it into your bottles at this point or use your eye dropper dispensers or whatever it is that you get it into your moles however I of course need to always get fancy so I'm gonna split this into two colors so I've got half of it translucent and half of it of the solid blue whoops all right so I'm just gonna eyeball this here if you want to be exact you can pour it into a measuring cup and split it exactly however I've been doing this from this pot for quite a while so I'm pretty good at it sometimes so because I mix the blue with the green because obviously the green from our can of syrup and our sugar so it's turned out a little bit greenish and I actually want this to be blue so I'm going to add in a little bit of blue color and then on 1/2 I'm going to add in white so this one I'm mixing in a few drops of blue you can use any kind of food coloring the gel base oil-based water base for this for this particular candy recipe does not matter so we're just gonna get that stirred in oh that's a pretty color you see it on the white that's nice that's a nice kind of teal color then in my other half I'm gonna pour in some of the blue the same kind of teal but this is gonna give me the solid background as the white now if you guys have white on hand make sure that you shake it really really well if it's hot it sitting for a while it does separate and you will find that if you pour it in you're gonna get a little tiny white it doesn't go well you get little white lumps or something like that it just doesn't blend really nicely so make sure to shake it really really well you can almost hear it come back together it's like you can almost hear the water at the top and then all kind of comes together and sounds a little bit thicker so I'm gonna pour a little bit of that in isn't that pretty so again you're just gonna thoroughly mix that in until it is one complete uniform color and once I've got that i'll get it into my bottles and we'll get this into the mold there's a little trick i learned the other day find it by Occident that's on most things happen so I'm if you want to have a half and half candy where you've got the clear on the bottom and the solid on the top what you can do to easily make that happen is use your hand blender on this we whip a bunch of air into it and once you put them together the air is all I'm automatically gonna bring the solid color up to the top or if you want to do that with the if you want it the other way around then air Rach you're clear but you're gonna have to wait a while for the bubbles to come out because that's gonna make it not so clear so I recommend just putting the solid on the back you can do that it's just a quick way of doing it otherwise you have to pour one layer let it set a little bit and then pour your second layer well aren't I just a cesspool of useless information today I'm just gonna pour this into my squirt bottle this should make a full almost a full bottle or a little bit more see bang almost right on now if you guys have to haven't seen these before these are the best squirt bottles ever they just make putting it into the mould so much easier especially if you want to blend colors absolutely highly recommend these I've got there's a link for them in the description there for you to make it easy if you'd like to order them and I'm just gonna do my clear and we'll get this going all right so I said I always do two colors I always like doing that so I did combination I'll either just whoosh or if you want to happen half you can do it that way you can go this way freestyle whatever you like and that's it get them all into your mold and you're gonna put them in the fridge for a minimum of two to four hours sometimes they've got to go overnight now if you let them go overnight and they're still sticking you can't get them out of the mold put them into the freezer for a few hours let them freeze up take one mold out of it I'd add out at a time and pop them out as quickly as possible if they still if there's still stop the first you'll come out if it starts to stick throw it back in the freezer work on another mold put them into a double boiler melt them down on low heat and add another tablespoon of gelatin melt it and recast them and that will fix that problem for you and that's it enough I'll come back low will pop these out so you can have a look at them and I'll show you how to sugarcoat them not that sugarcoating is that difficult but you can coat them with the can of sugar and just show you an easy way of doing it and that'll be it will say goodbye candies upset and you can do this in a bowl or I found that doing them in a large plastic bag worked a lot easier so in this I put a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar and I put a quarter part about a quarter cup of the flavored drink crystals that I used in my recipe again the drink crystals are totally optional for you just adds that little bit extra flavor and then I added about a half a teaspoon of citric acid because I wanted these to be a little bit more on this our side if you just want to have just a little bit of a tick bite but not really sour at all I add a quarter teaspoon so I'll do those two my sweet ones and then to the sour I use a 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid I don't recommend using much more than that one it's not going to the sour flavor isn't that great and it can also melt your candies because citric acid acid is water soluble so simple enough you can actually see it oh and I also have sorry a wire a wire rack with parts line o parchment paper line line on top of it for them to dry so I just pop them out these guys are popping out nicely and I get and what I do is I do one mold at a time so I leave the rest of them in the fridge because otherwise they start to warm up and they can makes it difficult sometimes for them to come out of the mall so I just think about one at a time and once I get them on the bag I go a little bit there and I just fish them out and shake off the excess sugar and we just lay them out to dry here just like all our other candies this is just a slightly smaller mold that I use same thing now see sometimes you'll do that and you'll see you think oh no they're not gonna come out they're stuck just pull the edges away and then they just they'll just come right out now if you do that and it doesn't come out that's when you would put them into the freezer so again you see that just around the edges to pull it away and they're good to go and that's about it I'm just gonna go through and sugarcoat the rest of these guys and then I'll be back to say goodbye well guys that's my little demo there on your cannon Candace Eric and sugar gummy bears I hope you enjoyed the demo as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to ask and thank you guys so much again for your support and let's get to the 50,000 whoo all right so you have an awesome rest of your day and thanks again for watching [Music]", "5-gIY7HuJNo": "they honestly turned out so good and I'm also going to show you guys how to make a coating on them that's like sour and fizzy kind of like on like the root beer ones you can buy at the store so these are actually like legitimate gummy bears instead of just like Harding jello like a lot of recipes have let me just show you them so you can see the texture of this is like really sticky this is what's making your gummy bears actually be like real store-bought guy bears and not just jello so here's the texture of the gummy make sure when it's still warm so you can really see that string yes this is just like candy nothing like just hard jello that you see recipes for so you know this is gonna be a good one so chewy just like the ones you buy in the store like they're so stretchy just like a gummy bear and like they're fizzy when you eat them so good hey guys welcome back today I'm going to show you how to make Mountain Dew soda bottle gummies I'm going to be using coconut oil to infuse mine but you can use butter or a tincture all three of those options will work for this recipe you're going to need some soda you don't have to use Mountain Dew you can use whatever flavor you like you'll need some jello I chose line because it's the closest to Magic Mountain Dew without like over powering and I'm do flavour some gelatin citric acid corn syrup lecithin potassium sorbate mixture which will keep your products shelf stable so you don't have to put it in the fridge you can just keep it in a drawer or in your car or whoever and I'll post the link for how to make this and some coconut oil you can also use butter or a teacher I actually would prefer to use a tincture for this but I don't have any right now so I'm just going to use coconut oil I made them last night and they turned out really well with the coconut oil I feel like you can taste the coconut oil flavor a little bit more than if you were to use like a tincture but whatever you would like to choose you can use because I made quite a bit yesterday for this recipe I'm going to do a smaller amount in the description box below I'll put the measurements for what I'm doing today but you can make whatever amount you like just multiply the recipe I have it below to make this recipe we're going to have to reduce our soda so that we can get the flavor without too much liquid we need half a cup of soda and then we're going to reduce it to a quarter cup alright we have half a cup here we're going to put on a stove on high and we're going to move let this cook for however long tanks to do half of the mixture so I'm just kind of going to have to eyeball it and see where it is and when it looks like it's a little bit lower I'll pour back my measuring cup and see where I'm at so we started with half a cup so we wanted to be 1/4 cup this will probably take about like 15 minutes now that we have our soda on the stove reducing we're going to prepare our gelatin so we're going to put 1/4 of a cup of our soda into a why dish dish so 1/4 cup and we'll just pour it into a dish and then we're going to put our gelatin on we need one and a half tablespoons of gelatin alright so we put 1/4 cup of soda into this bowl and then we're going to sprinkle a tablespoon and a half of gelatin on top so we're just going to sprinkle it lightly over so we can get as much much coverage as possible so that's one tablespoon and then we're going to do half tablespoon for a total of one and a half tablespoons then we're going to add 1/4 to 1/2 of a jello of flavored jello pack so yesterday I made these with more regular gelatin and no jello pack I need these ones here and while he turned out good I felt like the flavor wasn't strong enough and it needed like a little bit more flavor so I thought this time around I would add a little bit of jello so it can be anywhere between a quarter and a half of this depending on how much flavor you think you want so you can always take this out and measure it but I can just eyeball it we're going to sprinkle this on top so it may be like a third of it and then we're just gonna leave this we're not gonna stir it in we're not gonna do anything with it we're just going to leave it here and by the time you get back around to it most of the gelatin will have absorbed absorbed into the soda now we're going to add an a quarter of a teaspoon of this potassium sorbate mixture again I'll put a link down below this is gonna help it so you don't have to keep it in the fridge you can keep this outside in the fridge it's just like regular got me to buy from a store and then we're going to do a quarter teaspoon of citric acid the citric acid is not necessary it's just if you like them a little bit more sour if you don't have citric acid you could crush up vitamin C tablets and those who work as well so we're doing one quarter teaspoon and then we're gonna add in a teaspoon of lecithin I only have the pill capsules cuz that's what was cheaper for me to buy but if you can buy the liquid kind it would be a lot easier because it'll save you from having to bust these open now my coconut oil already has less of shin in it so I'm not going to add too much this mixture but if your coconut oil doesn't have less its it lecithin in it then you might want to add a little bit more of this so I'm just gonna do one for mine if I had the liquid kind I could just pour oh I probably would just do a quarter teaspoon so this is gonna help bind the coconut oil together with the gelatin liquid mixture so that our coconut oil doesn't separate from everything else and like I said I have more of this already in my coconut oil so I don't need too much in here but if you don't have any in your coconut oil you're going to want to add a bit more to your jello mixture and I barely even got out any with the pills really actually just by the liquid all right now let's check in on our soda we started with half a cup and you need to reduce it to a quarter cup so I'm just going to pour it directly right back into my measuring cup and see we're at all right looks like we're exactly a quarter cup which means I probably should have checked on this sooner that way I couldn't have reduced it too much but if you do end up reducing you too much just throw it away and do it again soda can always be replaced all right so I'm just going to pour my reduced quarter cup of soda back into the pot and then I'm going to add a quarter cup of corn syrup now this is the most important thing for your gummies to be like a real store-bought gummy so corn syrup helps but will helps the most is having the sugar heat it to a high enough temperature to get it almost to the softball stage so I'm gonna use a candy thermometer for that I know most people aren't going to have one of these but if you are planning on making gummies often I usually just purchasing one they're probably like something like ten dollars and they can be very helpful with making your dimes so I'm trying to put it on here and we're going to try and eat this to 230 degrees Fahrenheit now because you guys most of you guys won't have a candy thermometer I'm going to try and see if I could help you out by just telling you the time so I'm going to turn this on high and I'm going to set a timer on my phone or a stopwatch so I started to now and we'll see what time rats when this is got into 230 degrees Fahrenheit all right so we're four minutes in and we're at 180 degrees Fahrenheit and we're waiting for this to go to 230 degrees Fahrenheit so it looks like it's starting to thicken a tiny bit but it's still pretty much all liquid it will started thinking a bit when it gets closer to 30 now you want to be careful to not go over to 30 that's why having a candy thermometer it's good because if you don't have one you can easily within 30 seconds to a minute go over temperature and then it becomes too hard so while having it to that higher temperature we'll give you that real kind bear consistency if you don't have the candy thermometer just ear on the side of not too long because you don't want to ruin it but luckily this is just sugar and soda so if we wreck this mixture and just throw it away and that's why we add the coconut oil after so that we make sure that this mixture is perfect before we add our coconut oil or a tincture or butter that way we're not risking wasting it all right we're at 210 degrees and it's moving up fast so we got to keep an eye on it now now I'm not gonna leave I'm not gonna leave this unattended I'm just gonna watch it up until the moment it gets to 230 Thunder 8 minutes and we're at to 3000 or at 2:30 so we have to take this off now take that off the heat immediately see how fast that happens holy yeah eight minutes on high heat okay this is getting a little too hot so I'm gonna go hold it by the fridge so it doesn't heat up anymore all right so we see how fast the temperature can go up so if you don't have a candy thermometer be very careful to really not let it get too hot you do want it to get as high as you can safely without your candy thermometer because that is what gives a texture the gummy bears but it is hard to do it with other thermometer so I just took this off the heat and left it for about like five minutes so I can demonstrate to you guys what happens here so you can see the texture of this is like really sticky this is what's making your gummy bears actually be like real store-bought guy bears and not just jello so this is the key out this they're just going to be like hard and jello so that's kind of like what it looks like and this is gonna melt back down when we put it back on the stove and mix in our coconut oil now I'm going to turn the heat on like medium I'm going to add two tablespoons of my coconut oil so have some medium heat and stirring in the coconut oil with the soda and corn syrup mixture that we just brought to 230 degrees now we don't want to add in the coconut oil right after it hits 230 we want to take it off the heat we want to let it cool for a little bit like I would say five minutes is fine because we don't want to be adding the coconut oil for something that's 230 degrees because that's too hot all right we're just stirring this in and you can see that it's not actually combining so there's the oil and there is the corn syrup mixture so we're going to need to get a whisk to combine this a little bit better now we're just going to try and stir like this we don't want ki to be too high medium or medium low is good now we're gonna add in our gelatin mixture which is gonna help bind this okay this is getting too hot you can see so I'm gonna turn the heat down to low just take that off for a minute so don't have that I'm too high I would say medium low will be perfect now we're going to add in our gelatin mixture so clearly I had that too warm I should not be bubbling that much so I know I said to put it on medium heat do not put it on medium do medium low or low okay now we just have to be patient and let it melt a bit more so this is the hardest part is getting this all to combine because the texture of the corn syrup might stay chunky and then it won't mix properly but if we keep it at a low enough heat and mix it in with the whisk we should be able to properly combine it and you do want to make sure you have the lesser thin to help emulsify it so this is going to take a while probably going to take about five minutes with me stirring this all in make sure you're patient and you don't turn up the heat trying to melt this fast because that just won't work out well so just keep it at low or medium low to stir this in and do it slowly and by slowly I don't mean whisking slowly but just take your time you can see the chunks are less stuck together now it's starting to combine now you want to make sure before you do this you have your molds prepared so just lay your molds oh and put them on a tree that way as soon as this is done you can pour them in the difference with this and most of the gumming recipes you see online is that this one has a different texture using that corn syrup and heating it up to that own soft ball point so it does harden really fast it is really sticky so once this is done and we're going to want to put it into the molds as soon as we can so I've been stirring this for close to 5 minutes now and almost everything has combined just a couple chunks left on my whisk so I'm just going to push those out with a spatula she's looking really good you can see it has that stringy texture it's not just like liquidy so it looks like it's just about all mix perfectly - that one little chunk there and this took about ten minutes of slowly stirring incorporating on low heat so now we're going to put this into our molds I'm using one of these to put it into my mold but you can also use the little droppers that works fine I just find that this is easier and if you're making a lot of gummies this is really useful overtime to spend like five dollars or whatever it was now I'm going to turn the heat off and pour this mixture right into my little squeezy container if you're going to use the little dropper you can put this on a hot pad and do it directly here whatever works for you okay now use ones I guess that's just a snack for me so that's alright so here's the texture of the gummy make sure when it's still warm she can really see that string yes this is just like candy nothing like just hard jello that you see recipes for so you know this is gonna be a good one so chewy just like the ones you buy in the store alright so I just wrap a towel around here because it's a little bit hot and it's right off the stove and I'm just going to put these into all of my molds you can also just use any molds going bury molds or find you now let's just put these into the fridge it shouldn't take too long probably about 10 minutes all right now we'll just take them out of the mold they were in the fridge for about 20 minutes you can see how they're kind of different than regular jello gummies like they really have that like that sticky gummy bear texture and that stickiness will go away after they dry out for a bit and we put their coating on you all right so now for coating on them I did in three different ways I did one with sugar coating one with a fizzy coating and then some with no coding so the ones on the top here I was just sugar so I just shook it in a container of sugar and put it back on the tray and then for the fizzy coating it's one third of a cup of sugar one teaspoon citric acid and then I'm going to say 1 teaspoon baking soda but that was too much baking soda so do half a teaspoon baking soda instead so here's that teaspoon of baking soda but like I said we're going to use half a teaspoon not a full teaspoon like I did you could taste it too much and I'm just gonna mix that up quickly once I just shake that up I'm gonna add the gummies into it shake it again and put them back on the tray the one thing I do want to mention with this recipe is you can put them in their sugar or citric acid mixture as soon as they come out of their mold whereas with some of the jello recipes you need them to drive it first these ones you don't need to do that so you can put them on right away in that way you can make sure they really stick whereas if they get too dry they won't the sugar won't stick to the outside of the gummy and if that does happen to you you can just spray them with a little bit of water and just wipe them off so they're a little bit damp and that stickiness comes back and that should work for you quite honestly I kind of enjoyed them with nothing on them the most but I really did enjoy the fizzy sugary coating anyways that's all you guys I hope you enjoyed this video please comment if you try it out and if you did enjoy it please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe I hope you guys have a wonderful day", "oONRHdBHFfY": "hey love Sistani here and today I'm going to be talking to you guys about a new company that I was recently introduced to and all about how it helped me relax more so this company is called diamond CBD and you know a CBD is and you already know what I'm about to talk about my basically CBD is a what is it it's a component that's found in green and that's the component that makes you actually relax and feel better that's than what's actually helping a lot of people with their illnesses and pains and all that stuff so this company actually just done the work to actually take the CBD out of lead and separate it and put it into different products and all of that so you can actually they have a variety of products so depending on what you prefer you can get whatever so I got this candy cuz I'm obsessed with it means like I don't know why lately I'm in love with these rainbow gummy so not even gonna lie to you guys when I first saw this company I thought it was leave like we'd have just food food and I was like don't do drugs I don't know how that's gonna work but but that company like they explained it to me and then they have a video on the front of their site that actually explains all of this so you do not make you high they don't get you high at all you're not going to be like tripping or anything like that they literally just make you relax and feel more I don't know like say you have back pain like I normally no back pain it helped with that if you have issues sleeping if you have just a problem like with anxiety whatever and you just need to be relaxed this is for you it also helps with a bunch of other things okay so you do need to be 21 to use this or to purchase this and so on the front when I got this package I actually did not review this bottom part here I just saw this and then I went straight to the back because I started reading you know the serving size and it said four pieces so I'm like eating eating and I ate three pieces right to eat my fourth and then I see on the front and it says do not exceed more than one to two pieces every six hours so I took three like I said and I'm a small person I'm only buckling and I don't weigh that much like I'm pretty small so I took that and I promise you like the rest of the day and then it was just around around like maybe four or five o'clock for the rest of the day like all the way through the night I was like I don't know I felt so tired and I don't think these are supposed to make me feel sleepy but that's just how I react to a lot of things in general like whether it's alcohol and I've never really I've never done weed so I didn't know that this is how I would react but I just got really sleepy you know supposed to get sleepy per say but and it's got really sleepy like it helps you sleep better but that means that like your body will relax it doesn't make you like sleepy it's not a sleep aid so you're supposed to be able to take these any time of day so I got really really sleepy I wanted took a nap and then just the rest of the night I was like really tired and drowsy but the next day I took the regular dose I just took one piece of candy it's like just to help me relax before bed or whatever and I didn't really feel any more tired because of it but it definitely did help with my back pain and it helped me relax so I will definitely say these work like these are like probably one of my new favorite things because it's natural one and it's just it's just a good alternative to taking pain medication all the time and all of that now I do wish the serving size is a bit more because I like eating candy but I just I just probably need to get it in another form other than candy so they told me they have it they have drops that you can put in stuff they have well so they have they have it in other foods they have they have a bunch of options you just have to go to their website and see and then you can use that to make whatever you want and put it in whatever food or you can take it directly under your tongue whatever you wanna do now these in here it says the serving like if we're going based on what the back says it says serving it's four pieces so there's about two servings in here so if we're going based on the front and there's about four to five start rings in here so I think it's that's great these cost 15 dollars that's before shipping and these cost 15 dollars this back and they have variety of products all different prices if I if you're saying like I can get like maybe five pieces out of this that's pretty good that's actually pretty good and I would definitely get this again I'm probably going to get this again because like I said I do have back issues like I'm spine and stuff and so it did actually help with that a lot I recently got a desktop computer so the flora would often work off my laptop and so I got my desktop and so a lot of times I have to use it because a storage is better and all of that I have to use it sitting at my desk and that is always been an issue for me for years and years and years because I've you know even in high school I was home-schooled and so working at home you know doing my schoolwork I'd have to sit up and then at my desk and all of that it just always been an issue because my back hurts so I prefer to work from my bed if I have to do like you know stuff on my laptop or whatever because it's more comfortable and I can prop up a pillow and all that but yeah so sitting at my desk often time really hurts my back and I don't enjoy it at all like I will do everything I can so that I don't have to work at my desk because it's not the most enjoyable for me but this definitely helps I don't know if I should be taking it every day so I'm not gonna do that but I think it's safe like to you know do it every day it's not gonna be addictive or anything like that but yeah I'm probably gonna use it again and I would suggest that you guys check them out gonna link your website in my description box this is like a really cool product that very happy I was introduced to so make sure you check it out if you have not already make sure

gummy bears that have been marinated in mystery sodas. We're gonna sample them, guess them and discover, something amazing. - But before that we're gonna tell a 10 word story. - If. - Dennis. - Suspects. - Martha. - Of. - Marination. - He. - Won't. - Ever. - Love. - Oh, man. That's tough. When you just suspect\nsomebody of marination you won't ever love? There's, there's no hope in that. - No I think that Dennis\nis anti-marination and he's starting to fall for Martha but if he suspects her for marination, he won't ever love again.\n- He won' ever love? - Yeah, he won't ever\nlove Martha or any woman. - Oh, man, Dennis. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's Dennis with one S. - You know, I don't know\na Dennis. (laughing) - You know, Dennis is\nusual spelled with one S. - That's very funny if you're just reading what was written. - Well, that's only funny\nif you read what's written and you said one N. Because Dennis is spelt two Ns. - Oh, sorry one, one N not one S. (laughing) Yes, I was N said S so, Denas. (clearing throat) - Denas?\n- Denas. - Denas.\n- Do you know a Dennis? I don't think there's ever\nbeen a Dennis in my life. I had a neighbor once whose husband died, his name was Dennis\nbut I never knew Dennis 'cause he, he dies before I knew him. - Dennis? - Yeah.\n- I'm not close with a Dennis. - Her name was Bunny by the way. I had a neighbor whose name was Bunny. - Okay. - Had a son named Matthew. - Wow. (background laughs) I didn't know where you\nwere gonna go with that. - Bunny, Bunny like-- - Anybody been close with a Dennis? - [Stevie] Can you re-ask that question? - [VOICE] D E N I Z. - Nuh-uh. - [VOICE] Yeah, it's a Turkish spelling. - Oh, well that's not Dennis. - [VOICE] Yeah, it's pronounced Dennis. - Oh, it is? - [VOICE] Yeah. - Dennis?\n- So, Denis Villenueve is a Canadian/French film director. - And there's one N and one S. - Denas. - Denay. (laughing) - But I'm going to call\nhim Denas when I see him. It's Sundance. - So that's the only famous\nDenis you could find on Google? All right, so you've marinated some stuff. Let's take the first ones.\n- [Stevie] Denas - All right, so these are all marinated in the same thing obviously? It, it soaked it all up. These things are freaking, pretty giant. - Did they get bigger\nbecause they're marinated? - [Stevie] Yeah, they get big and juicy. - I'm going to use a folk. - [Stevie] I'm very distracted\nby the, the book on the, your book. - My, you don't ever, you don't ever curl up with\na romance novel Stevie? - [Stevie] Well, listen, I, I read lesbian fiction on my porch on the weekends as everyone knows. But, but on Kindle, you know how, you have a Kindle? - Um hmm. - [Stevie] You know how the cover, you have to pay for the cover\nto not be an advertisement? - Yeah. - [Stevie] They advertise me straight romance novels all the time. It's like get a hint, you know? Get a freaking hint. (laughing) That's what they look like. - Because you don't pay. - [Stevie] Because I don't\nread straight romance novels. So it's a lost ad.\n- Or maybe you should try we got one right here is\nmarinated in Italian dressing. - Italian dressing (high voice). - [Stevie] I do remember my\nmom having like a Danielle, Danielle steel--\n- These are good. - [Stevie] On the bedside table. - I don't know what they are marinated in, but they are good. It's hard-- - Have you noticed how there's a-- - It's hard to tell. - In the very middle of everyone-- - It's hard. - It's a hardness that has stayed. - Is it, is that, I think that's harder\nthan a normal gummy bear or is that a normal\nhardness of gummy bear? - That's the only thing\nI'm thinking about. Oh, this is also a smoor, which means it is a Good Mythical More that was voted on by the Mythical Society. And what you guys have\ndecided that we should do is readily, are sprayed with water every time they touch their hair or beard. This was suggested by\nGinger Snaps, not the brand, the mythical beast. - The majority of you\nvoted on that suggestion. And, but the, the, I mean-- - I don't touch. I mean, I don't, I\ndon't, I don't touch my-- - Oh, you just sprayed me. - Yeah, because anytime\neither of us touch something. - Oh, we both both get sprayed?\n- We both get sprayed. - [Voice] David told me\nto spray around there. - You sprayed me back here though on the back of my head (spraying). Oh.\n- Oh. Spray him again, he touched his hair. - Okay. That's point blank. I'm getting a trickled down my temple. If you get a triple,\ntrickle down you temple-- - You keep touching yourself. - Oh. You really out of it Jay. - Let me tell you-- - I didn't know I was touching myself until I saw Ben pointing\nat Jay he's like, there. Cause now that you, once\nyou, once you wet it, now I want to touch it. Now I want to, I want to fix it. All right, we need to guess. Cause I don't want to\neat too many gummies. - I can't tell, all I taste is gummy bears and they're good. - [Stevie] You want a\nthree, two, one on it? You really, you don't\nhave any kind of guess? It doesn't make them taste\nany differently at all? These are all sodas remember. - Oh, all sodas? - [Stevie] Yeah. - Okay. - [Stevie] You want a three, two, one? - Three, two, one. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Sprite.\n- Sprite. - [Stevie] No. No, but you've enjoyed this soda in something else recently on the show. - Squirt. - [Stevie] What? when did you ever eat, when did you have squirt? - When you weren't looking? (background laughs) - [Stevie] What? - What? - I wasn't listening to\nwhat you were saying. - It's not something-- - [Stevie] This soda has\nbeen featured on this show in a prominent way in this recent season. It's not, it's not, it's not our go-to. It's something that we featured\nin the next best thing. - It tastes lemony. - We'd featured it in the next best thing? - [Stevie] You poured it into your cereal and you named it the next best thing. - Oh, ah butter, butter soda. What's that called? - Cream soda - Cream soda.\n- [Stevie] Cream soda, yeah. - It doesn't taste like cream soda. - [Stevie] Oh boy. - Yeah, it does. I can taste a little bit\nof that. Let's, let's see, let's see the next one. Oh, I just touched my nose hairs. See. (spraying) - I kinda like it. (background laughs) I kinda like the mystifying quality. - Oh, these are, these are--\n- [Man 1] A little darker. - [Man 2] I'm going to get (indistinct) - Oh, this one is easy. I think. - [Stevie] There's something mesmerizing when you put your fork into the bowl in the closeup shot. Cause it jiggles like a jello mold, which gummies don't usually\nhave that exact kind of jiggle. - Okay. I got a guess. - Yeah. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Ruff beer.\n- Ruff beer. - [Stevie] Yap. - That was good. - It was pretty good. That's pretty good. - When I got my hair up like\nthis, I don't touch it a lot, But sometimes you gotta, you gotta do that. - I feel like a, a reprimanded cat. (background laughs) - Cats don't like it when\nyou spray them with water? - No. And that's how, that's how you're supposed to whop them. You're not supposed to beat a cat. You're supposed to spray them with, (background laugh) if you were to spank a cat,\nI don't know how you'd do it. - You think that dogs and cats have picked up on the cultural revolution? You know, people, our generation growing up\nespecially in the South, you did something wrong\nyou got your ass spanked, that's what happened. We don't do that anymore. But you also spank your dog guys. - [Stevie] No you don't know. - No, we did growing up back then. - [Stevie] You spanked them? - Yeah, if the dog did something wrong, my dad had like a roll of newspaper and he'd hit it on the back. - Yeah, you gotta-- - I'm not suggesting this. - You gotta communicate to the dog that you did something wrong. - And I'm saying-- - And, and the go-to was\njust hitting it on the back. - Culturally, we have all\nmoved on to a next level where it's positive reinforcement, right? So do you think that the\npets have picked up on this? - [Stevie] I don't know if\nthat's true for everybody. - And they're like, hey, we're staying inside now. We're getting pampered. We got it made, let's start minding. I think they've, I think,\nI think it's worked. I think it works.\n- I think word has gotten out that dogs are not getting spanked as much. I know there's some people still doing it. - What's the question?\n- I got nothing on this. - I don't think dogs\nare like sharing notes. I don't think they have a forum. - That's where you're wrong. This one is subtle. Hmm. I just bit my tongue a little bit. - While we're thinking about--\n- It hurt. - I'll let you know that, you may not know this, but you can shower with us because we put ourselves\non a shower curtain. - I know. (spraying) See. - And it's available at mythical.com. And also if that's a little\nover the line for you, we also just put our faces on a towel, which you can then touch your body with. also available at mythical.com. - Get a towel. Get a shower curtain. I got, I got nothing. - [Stevie] You're not\ntasting anything in this? This is the one of the more\nsubtle sodas I would say. - All right, I got a guess. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Sprite.\n- Sprite. - [Stevie] Yeah. - Yeah, sprite is so subtle. You can add it to something else. - There's a, there's a lemonyness to it. I do like what it does to the, to\nthe bears in general, - It makes them like jello. - Yeah. - If you wanna make your bears like jello, how long did you soak them? - [Voice] Twelve hours. - Twelve hours. - Oh goodness look at that. - Were these all--\n- That is a warm. - Were these all the\nsame color originally? - [Voice] No. - I can't even get one. - Ooh, smells like cleaner. - Hmm.\n- Hmm. - It's very lemony. Is that because the-- - That's because you\ngot a lemon part of it. - Oh, really? Yeah, let me get a different-- - The consistency. I mean, it, it's become like a dessert. - The, the-- I'd love to\nput this on ice cream now. You know how you can put\ngummy bears on ice cream and they get too hard? - Yeah. This, this does that. - You do, you soak them and\nthen you put these on ice cream. I know what I'm doing tonight. Well, I'm marinating\ngummy bears for 12 hours. - Tomorrow night, for tomorrow morning for breakfast. - Staying up all night,\nwatching it like a hawk. - I mean, this tastes like, I mean, this tastes like furniture polish. - I think I have an answer,\nbut it's based on his reaction. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Dr. Pepper. - [Stevie] No.\n- No. - [Stevie] No, the color\nshould give you a clue. - Coke. - [Stevie] No. it's a purple color. - Grape soda. - [Stevie] Yeah. - Grape Gatorade. (laughing) - It didn't stain my tongue. - That, that's, that's good now that I know what it is. I like that. - Oh, thanks. (spraying) Okay, that was, you made it, you're, you're\nmaking up for lost time, I see what you're doing. This one didn't really do\nany colorization at all. - No it didn't. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. I have an immediate guess. - Have you noticed how these don't have the hard center like the bears do? - Yeah, the, the worms--\n- It goes all the way through. - I think the worms are softer\nand floppier in general. So it-- - So they can have a little bit of a-- - Modulation. - [Stevie] Be careful you have a-- - That?\n- [Stevie] Yeah. - Oh yeah, I'm saving it. - [Stevie] Okay.\n- Okay - [Stevie] Okay. - I'm ready to guess.\n- I'm gonna guess. - Three, two, one - Hawaiian Punch.\n- Mountain Dew. - [Stevie] Yeah, it's Mountain Dew. - Oh, yeah. (spraying) Did I touch his beard? Stop touching your beard. - That was pretty good, Mountain Dew. Mountain, that seems\nlike an internet-y thing, Mountain Dew gummy worms. (clattering) - That's going to be the thumbnail. - Look what happens to the Swedish fish. Oh, my gosh.\n- Oh, my gosh. - They become salmon. (background music) This Swedish fish became salmon. - What, what kind of\nfish were they before? - I don't know. - I think we did know at one point. - [Stevie] Swedish. - I've been feeling a\nstrong call to Scandinavia. - How am I supposed to respond to that? (laughing) - I just, I've been looking\nup pictures of things. - Of what things? - Just, just the world. And I keep landing on like, ooh, what is this place? It's like, Oh, that's the coast of Norway. - [Stevie] There's an Instagram account that's Scandinavian houses\nand properties for sale. Oh, that's, that's a real\nlike wanderlust situation. - A long trip to buy a house. Don't, don't buy the house in Norway - Hold on. But listen, do you know,\nthere's only 5 million people in the whole country - But if you do, I'm going to visit it. - There's only 5 million\npeople in all of Norway. That's half as many people in just the state of North Carolina. - And what are they doing for each other? I mean, do they-- - They're also really happy. Like they're like the\nhappiest population up. - A lot of them make shoes, don't they? - No, that's the Dutch. It's a bitterly cold and a lots of it. And the whole coastline is just rocky. And then like once you\nget above a certain point, you're basically in the Arctic\ncircle during the summer, the sun never goes down during the winter the sun never comes up. - I think it sounds too cold.\n- But they're happy. - I think it sounds too cold there. - Well, I just want to visit.\nI don't want to live there. - You, do you like what's happening here? - Yeah, but I've kind of forgot. - It makes them a lot more edible, I'll tell you that. - [Stevie] Oh. - Strawberry. What was that noise you made? - [Stevie] That was like,\nooh, those are fighting words. I like Swedish fish. And I'm sticking up for the commenters who like Swedish fish.\n- The only place they stick is in your teeth. (spraying) - Ooh. - I just wiped my face\nonly to get it re-sprayed. The, there's nothing, no taste in there that's not a Swedish fish to me. - Yeah. - [Stevie] You've been\nwanting this to be a thing for the entire year.\n- Oh, coke. - [Stevie] Yeah. - I was going to guess Dr. Pepper. - [Stevie] Cherry vanilla Coke. - Oh cherry vanilla coke.\n- Oh, cherry vanilla. - [Stevie] Does this work? (bell chiming) - Yeah? - [Stevie] No, it didn't work. - I heard a bell if\nthat's what you're asking. - [Stevie] It didn't work for\nwhat I wanted it to work for. - You want us to start salivating? - There's a hiking trail\nin the North of Sweden, which I know is not Norway. - Here's some other ones, more Swedish fish. - It takes, it's called the King's Trail and it's, it takes one month to hike it. And it's just the pictures\non Instagram, mmh. You want to go? - Yeah. Are you sweating? - Yeah, I'm nervous. - You've got a lot of perspiration. He's eating the whole fish of course. - These are different. - [Stevie] I've never had the thing that these are marinated in before. - Squirt.\n- Squirt. - Gummies taste like Squirt. - Squirt is a good soda. - [Stevie] I've had Squirt. - If Squirt is like a, it's like a Sprite, but it's more lemon than lime like a Fresca. Fresca and Squirt are\nkind of exactly the same. - [Voice] kind of is. - Yeah. - I, you know, I've been missing Fresca. We, we, I, I drink Fresca. I went through a Fresca phase and, and LaCroix came along and I forgot about it. I bet you they hate LaCroix. - Well, Fresca has-- - I went through so many phases-- - Fresca has sugar. - I know. - That's what I-- But I got, but I also got diet Fresca. - I don't, I just don't like these. They're still waxy. I liked, I really liked\nthe gummy bear before. - I actually prefer Swedish\nfish without the marinade. - Yeah, it's not working. - What it did for the\ngummy bears was better. - What is this?\n- Oh, shoot. - [Stevie] It's-- - Stevie has never had it. - [Stevie] Yeah, I don't\nthink there's any way that you would guess this. It's Cactus Cooler. - What is that? - What is that? Cactus Cooler? - [Voice] That's soda.\n- Oh, hold on. We had, we had that on\nthe show, didn't we? - Probably. - Oh, no. We've never had this Cactus Cooler. - So it's a cactus. Oh, they got a nice hat. - I do like that hat. Vintage Cactus Cooler hat used on Etsy. Click on that, let's buy that. - So what is the Cactus Cooler taste like? - [Voice] Kind of orange I think. - I see $15. - You can just get it as a-- - Oh gosh. Okay. It's weird, it's itching there. (background laughs) I'd like to know how big\nthat hat is before I buy it. - Yeah. Usually you can\njust, you can hang that up. You can hang that up, man. - It says in EX. Vintage Cactus Cooler\nsoda mesh trucker hat in EX, unused condition. It looks small though. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I think, I think you\ncould pull that off. - I like a trucker hat. - I think it like a, like a, I think it's, I think that would be\npulled off better by a girl, like, like a cute chick. (laughing) It's a cute cat. - Every cute chicks out there-- - It's a cute chick hat. - Go get this Etsy hat. - Vintage Cactus Cooler soda hat on Etsy. - I can't see out of my right eye. - Get it, get it. Orange pineapple soft drink is what the Cactus Cooler is flavored. Let's get rid of this, we don't like it. (clattering) Is that it? That's the discovery. Cactus Cooler exists. - Dr. Pepper makes it. - Is that right? - And Keurig, what? - Keurig Dr. Pepper. What does that mean? - [Stevie] Did you get\nsomething in your eye? - Yeah, water. (background laughs) - Yeah, Keurig Dr. Pepper, formerly Keurig Green Mountain and originally Green\nMountain Coffee Roasters is a publicly traded\nAmerican beverage company. - Keurig is Dr. Pepper.\n- As of 2018, Oh gosh. The newly merged conglomerate\nalso sells sodas, juices and other solid drinks via it's Dr. Pepper Snapple division also called Dr.\nPepper 7up incorporated based in Texas. - They make 7up.

Controlled Substances Act the USCS a hashtag feel the difference will roll around a little more supplement facts a serving size is two gummy bears so basically there are 30 servings in here 16 calories per serving so that's 16 calories for two gummy bears no fat 3.6 grams of carbs 2 grams of sugar 20 milligrams okay of hemp per serving and 10 milligrams of CBD per sir roll it around again and bang we're back to the front now for my favorite part I'm gonna go over some facts and eat a couple of these alright guys so as promised here it is got my facts sheet now just so I can make sure I'm telling you the right stuff so on the bottle you saw the CBD is legal that is used inside this product you may have looked and went well why is CBD legal you know I've heard the CBD isn't legal done it up let me go over that okay our products are exempt okay meaning CBD FX's products are exempt from the CSA and DEA s drug scheduling practices which classify whole half extracts as schedule one drugs because extracts from the stocks of European grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice and that is where the hemp is grown that these guys use to extract the CBD it is grown the biomass is over in Europe their product does meet the standards of the 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp which means it has to contain less than 0.3% of THC in the gamete or in the product period in the CBD oil period and again they only use CBD that is derived from a European biomass so that's how it's legal it is also non psychoactive and non psychoactive hemp was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 so there are your working facts now let me tell you a couple other things that are also some facts these things are freakin delicious alright the red they're my favorite color alright they taste like a fruit punch slash cherry I mean they're delicious so pop the cap you're gonna have a little safety seal I just normally yeah I just shut my thumb through here they gave me a couple bottles of these but I figured to show you your fresh bottle so pop it open and really they are little gummy bears I mean they look just like gummy bears and they basically tastes just like gummy bears except with a little pop so there you go it really is just a little gummy but I mean you know what I love these things so now that the FDA which you can and what you can't say let me roll that around so you get a nice glamour shot there since the FDA has determined what you can and can't say I'm just gonna tell you some personal experiences for me again I've been using CBD on and off three years what it does for me and in particular the CBD F FX products what they have done for me I used to be the guy that goes to bed let's say 10 o'clock at midnight I'm still up why cuz my brain won't stop okay it won't turn off I'm just going going going going going sit there flip through social media think about work think about this think about that couldn't shut my mind off I popped two of these half hour hour before bed I'm out and when I'm out I mean I am out don't wake up in the middle of the night no tossing no turning just everything just shuts down that's nice alright that's what I use it for also I work in a warehouse during the day yes that's right I am NOT the YouTube famous you know YouTube superstar I have a day job um and a work at a warehouse I do a lot of walking around you know up ladders down ladders all kinds crap I come home I am sore alright pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away okay after a workout at the gym pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away I mean it's not it's not a super drug but it takes the edge off for me okay other people you know say they use it for anxiety and stuff like that I don't really know if I have anxiety but I will say when I do take them it puts me in a just a nice mellow mood but it's not anything that you that you aren't functional you know I mean I could eat these in the morning before I go to work put in eight hours all day and still be totally fine doesn't make me drowsy even though it does help me fall asleep but the reason that helps me fall asleep like I says it just helps me turn my mind off so that being said I highly suggest you try something like I said if you're like me you don't like all the over-the-counter crap you think a lot of stuff that the doctors give is just you know blah blah mumbo-jumbo because they want you know Big Pharma wants to show some pills down your throat try these all right just try them what's the worst that's gonna happen it doesn't work for you okay sorry you know but I'm telling you most of the people that I talk to they've tried this it works for once you find out how many you actually need okay

your door try a couple gummy bears you know take the edge off guys just take the edge off all right so until next time it is your boy big J for VAP Co TV where you watch the side of a pan I am power [Music]", "vLm9VAXFl6I": "and so I'd still take my life in it a fruit roll-up what's up guys welcome back today I have yet another gummy video for you guys and I'm very excited about this one because I think it's going to make a lot of people's lives a lot easier and it is going to be delicious today we're going to be doing a little experiment making gummies out of two ingredients store-bought gummy bears tincture or coconut oil so I just bought some gummies from bulk barn any gummies are fine and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to melt these down and I'm gonna add to some of them tincture and to some of them coconut oil and we're gonna see how they're going to turn out I think the ones with tincture will turn out amazing the coconut oil ones I'm not so sure about so let's try it out and see how it goes PS these are like the best gummies ever they're the Albanese brand you can buy them at a lot of places and they're so good they have like the best flavors the green ones and the white ones are my favorite so I'm actually not going to use them for this recipe so I'm probably gonna eat them while I'm melting them first step is to sort your gummies you don't have to smoke them if you don't want to but I want all my colors to be separate all right let's do this so I separated my gummies into yellow and orange purple and then my favorite ones just to eat while I'm doing this and we're gonna melt them and then add in our ginger and coconut oil and see how it goes I have no idea how long it's going to take us to microwave them so I'm going to start with like 15 second intervals and just check on them and then we'll find out how long it takes to melt them without over putting them I don't know so start with these great ones here there's a total of 13 gummy bears in here and they're just regular sized right there I mean they're a little bit bigger than like kuriboh gummy bears um but they're pretty standard so I was going bears and you guys can even see that okay so I'm gonna check on them in about 15 seconds and see how warmed up and melted they are so that's 20 seconds and they're starting to melt but they still need a little bit more so I put it in there for another 10 seconds okay so this is a total of 30 seconds pretty much melted and good to go I'm gonna add my tincture into here for this amount of gummies I'm going to do 1/2 a teaspoon of tincture so it's just room temperature you don't want to have it like really cold or frozen because it will affect the heat from the gummy so we'll just put that half a teaspoon in so there it is and let's see how well this stirrer is in if it doesn't stir it hopefully you guys can see that can you oh you guys can't even see that there we go so hopefully that stirs in well and if it doesn't we are going to add some lesson and lecithin into this to help combine it but I think that there's enough things and the gummy bears to start with that we shouldn't have any issues getting this to emulsify or combine or whatever you want to call it so that looks pretty good and then we're just gonna put these into a mold the same way you would with homemade gummies and let them sit and we will move on to our next batch so this is quite a bit thicker then they're coming mixtures so it seems like it's kind of hard for the little syringe to pull it up so that's one a little bit of an issue here so let's see yeah see we can't really soak it up so our options would be to microwave it more so it gets more liquidy or to add more liquid but I do not want to add more liquid so I am going to put it in the microwave for another 10 seconds okay so that was another ten seconds for a total of 30 are sorry a total of 40 seconds and I think they should be good enough to be able to put into our molds so I have about half in the mold then it's being a little bit trickier to put in that I thought it was going to be I'm having some trouble like getting the the dropper to like suction it up and that's because it is really thick so again I'm going to put it into the microwave for another 10 seconds and warm it up some more now if you had a lot more going there zero melting I'm like I did it this won't be as much of an issue because the heat will contain itself because there's a larger amount because there's such a small amount that's getting cooled off quicker and thickening faster and also like my dropper is like has a limited stuff to suck up so that won't be if you're doing a larger amount but it's not hurting anything by putting it in the microwave for just like 10-15 second intervals you just have to make sure you work kind of fast so let's throw that back in okay so looks a little different now I guess it just melted a lot more it's a lot more liquidy and put these interim moles okay so I put the purple ones into a molds now let's try some more but with the coconut oil let's do the yellow ones one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so we'll do thirteen of them just like we did last time and then we're gonna microwave this I'm going to start it with 40 seconds okay here's our 40 seconds melted they're nice and liquidy still might be a bit of an issue with the syringe dropper thing but if you have like one of those bottles you can dispense them with that'll be like way easier but let's add in the coconut oil so I hope you know what nut oil is what I expect to be the most difficult but I think that there's already less lecithin in the gummy bears so the oil should be able to emulsify pretty good but we'll find out so let's have it half a teaspoon of coconut oil okay we got our half teaspoon let's mix that in so so far it's actually mixing in really well that's all something I do for gummy bears with tincture instead of coconut oil because they I think they taste better but I know that most people you should just have coconut oil on hand the texture is a little bit different with the coconut oil I'm going to put that back in the microwave for another like 15 seconds alright so I did another 10 seconds I thought 15 might be too much all right now let's put these in their molds it looks like it's a lot harder using these so I'm gonna use one of my squeeze bottles which will be a lot you hear well I guess I should say hopefully it will be a lot easier you can see that like the coconut oil's making it like that doesn't like stick to the sides of the bottle that much I'm actually very surprised how well the cup oil mixed in oh my god that's so hot oh god it burns okay so don't touch hot melted candy because it is really hot and it hurts okay and this is cooled off a bit now that I've changed the bottle so hopefully it comes out okay if not I'll put it until I got a hot bowl of water or something look at all that gelatin or gummies sitting on the top there and I gotta get him down I'm just gonna leave this to sit upwards to get this to come down guys it's just it's it's too sticky this didn't really work that well either I'm gonna take the metal cap off and I'm gonna put it in the microwave just like this hopefully that works okay I did it ten seconds in the microwave it still doesn't look like it's gonna come out like this No okay this is not working either see another way that we can get this into the mold I mean like it's still gonna taste delicious I'm probably gonna have to eat a lot of this like just peel out of the bowl and stuff okay my plan was to cut a hole and squish this through but I don't think that's gonna happen well let's let's try see oh it's working okay I mean it's a little hardened now Oh No okay this is not working very well okay so the melting of the gummy bears and adding coconut oil didn't work very well I don't know why it seems like it almost got like harder like I now I'm just wondering if I like I microwaved it too many times like I don't know it just it won't come out really it's too thick to come out of anything so I'm gonna make another batch with the tincture just to test that out um again and see it's like it's definitely going to work or if it's user error and I mean it still I'd still take my get it a fruit roll-up it still tastes good if you wanted to you just melt them and then I mean this is really good little easy to get through oh look but you could just melt it and put it onto like parchment paper or silicone and peel it off after and just cut it into strips it's like the same thing it just won't be in the molds the actual gummy product mixed really well - coconut oil it tastes amazing of course you just they just happen to make sure it's pretty making the mold so still work very good I'll be snacking on this later okay let's do some more with the orange gummies and let's put some more tincture and then this time 1112 where do we do 13 or 12 I remember 30 I think and you don't have to do 13 so it's just the number I'm doing I don't know just - just what it is I'm doing and yeah you can just use whatever amount you want obviously you're really good okay let's microwave this you've got 30 seconds we're gonna do double the tincture so one teaspoon instead of half a teaspoon see this looks like it might have been too much tincture too much liquid and they might not set but you could always add more gelatin but I have a feeling these will set they'll just be a lot softer but if you want them to be able to firmer you could just add a sprinkle of gelatin a little more liquidy consistency as will definitely be easier to put into our moulds hopefully this one works a bit better I think it will we just got to act fast I mean using a dropper I probably would've been fine I don't know why decided to use this because it's such a small amount coming out already there we go oh yeah that's perfect oh and also just FYI if you buy these bottles which are really great for gummy making when you're making larger amounts not like this much died by making the tape it comes with like this I don't know if you can see that it's really really small and the gummy mixture is usually too thick to come out so I just put a different tip that's a little bit wider on there to make sure it can get through this was really difficult to use with such a small amount that I had so use a dropper if you have one this is usually my go-to option to squeeze things into molds but because there is such little amount when I squeeze it it's not really doing anything whereas if there was like this much gummy make sure when I squeeze it the pressure would push it out but because I made such a small amount obviously it's gonna be a little bit trickier I will just eat this out of the bottle later I'm just going to put the gummies that I need into the fridge probably for like 20 minutes alright guys I'm back but it hasn't been 20 minutes it's been two days so I took the gummies Oh after 20 minutes and they were not nearly hard enough I couldn't even really get them out of their molds so I put them in the freezer for a little bit like about half an hour and once they were hard enough I popped them all out of their molds and just left them on some parchment paper but they still were a little bit too squishy and too like corn syrupy so I left them out for a day and they were still a little bit too squishy Tomo for another day which is where we are now so it's been two days and they are perfect so if you guys make these just leave them out on a piece of parchment paper for a couple days depending on how humid it is wherever you live it might be a little bit different like it's not very humid where I live at all um so they dry up pretty quick but if you live somewhere very humid they might take a lot longer to dry or they might even not work for you in the first place so I'll show you what they look like so both the purple and the orange ones turned out very well you can see they're sticky obviously because they are sticking to my fingers so they are a little bit stickier than like a regular gummy but they're they don't really stick together in the bag because I've let them dry out for a few days so the purple ones had half a teaspoon of tincture in them and the orange ones had double that amount so they had one teaspoon of tincture and I thought they were gonna have a lot of issues but they're totally fine yeah they turned out very well and they taste just like the gummies did before I remoulded them last thing just to clarify um my gummies with the coconut oil didn't turn out only the ones with the tincture worked for me I don't know why the coconut oil ones didn't work if you guys know why please let me know because I'm very curious so yeah guys these turned out fantastic I'm super impressed with the results I definitely am gonna use this method many times in the future um going forward what I would do is for every 10 dummies I would do half a teaspoon of tincture so you can just multiply that by however many you want to make in total but based on what I've seen with these with half a teaspoon and the regular teaspoon they both turned out so you couldn't probably get away with using a little bit more but if you're looking for a starting point I would go with ten nine bears and half a teaspoon all right please let me know if you guys try this out I hope you enjoyed the video and let me know if there's any videos you would like to see I hope you guys enjoyed this video please

marijuana review show where we review edibles and help you make sense of your dispensary showing you which animals are worth your hard-earned dollars today we're looking at a new brand TK over edibles there are 200 milligram Bharani they proclaim it to be an award winner but don't tell us what award day one say award-winning best edible right there on the package no ingredients and no nutrition information very small brownie square tiny little thing very basic packaging so TKOs and they call it that because they sing it's going to knock me out but TV sends for technical so that is a very boring looking square ass browning smells like weed has a pretty high we'd smell or a pretty potent D weed smell I'm not optimistic to tell you the truth this nothing about the screams this is gonna be a good one it smells bad looks funky it's kind of hard but I'm willing to the doubt and it was affordable this was seven dollars at my dispensary for a what they say is a 200 milligram edibles so we shall see but let's give a taste no wait okay not good not good aroma yuck it's no koruba salted caramel or brownie but in this case guys looks we're not to see them it looks it tastes as bad as it looked there's a lot like weed there's a pretty great flavor very dry kind of stale taste in people it's not very big so yeah okay pepin back up here I have got to polish this off which is something I'm not looking forward to once I polish this bad boy off that's customary with our weeks many reviews I will come back to you guys in two hours and let you know how we're feeling and let's cross our fingers that work feeling pretty good because otherwise man I go in through some nasty food for no reason okay well with that I will see you guys in two hours and wish me luck I hope hope his ropes see you then hi guys I am back it has been 2 hours since I had the TK hoe edibles award-winner brownie and I gotta say it has been a pleasant surprise pleasant surprise it tasted pretty awful admittedly and while not quite a TKO it still packs a pretty good punch for a 200 milligram edible I'm pretty high right now I was not expecting this so maybe the awful taste was due to its onion advertised potency potent delicious every time is their catchphrase I can tell you at least one of those is true and at least one of those is false the third one I don't know so with that being said if you see a TKO edibles brownie in the dispensary near you it's affordable this cost me seven bucks and as long as you are not particular about taste as long as you are okay with the foul tasting edible give it a shot it's a potent edible for a fair price but if you're really really conscious about a flavor that's gonna be a hard pass so that's it for this review of weeks we will check you guys out on the next episode and thank you so much for watching", "H81YYnKdDbM": "You might have noticed we have\na slight obsession with gummy at Vat19.

"WcnQ0chDp_Y": "you majestic and magnificent rockets are defined as a vehicle propelled by thrust I won from burning onboard fuel one two three four five have any fuel and the most unlikely of all the mythical gummy bear so we've got three different versions of our gummybear rockets those are gonna go into these four inch rocket casings inside this is a tank of liquid oxygen a valve and the rocket engine with the gummy bears and then the rocket nozzle those are all the major components that go into a hybrid rocket now if you remember it's a hybrid rocket because we're feeding liquid oxygen through our fuel grain and that's what this giant tank is full of liquid oxygen literally some of the scariest stuff on earth to say this is flammable is really it's not accurate cuz this is what makes things flammable it is the enabler for burning which is exactly what it's doing in our Rockets with the LOX and rocket casing ready to roll cue the first fuel have act gummies and that pretty that is gorgeous so the gummy bear fuel grain is going into its housing there are a lot of fiddly bits that all have to work perfectly in the concert snap rings o rings rocket grands housing and everything and it all has to be properly assembled with the engine loaded and locked it's go time for launch this is the pre-launch setup we mount the rocket insert the altimeter on the descent parachute into the nose cone and then erect guide rail reminds me of something after that we D asked the area here we go because just as our bomb squad so the only ones qualified to do the final capping in of explosives our rocket techs here are the only ones qualified to work with the super unstable liquid oxygen once they have the LOX in place they put in the ignition system and the countdown sequence begins it ends of course with me counting from five to zero and I hit the launch button the moment I do an igniter starts a little fire in the base of the rocket at the same time a valve opens up and liquid oxygen begins to spray down the middle of the core of our fuel grain it is ignited by that flame and hopefully also in turn ignites to fill grain causing a chain reaction of explosive force that since the rocket skyward system is armed theoretically this is it will hand-packed gummies bears be a viable rocket fuel to one there we go see any smoke Hey come on baby that's the lights out that's the sound of not working miss the sound of failure well we just fired our first gummybear rocket roar these were the gummy bears were just jammed into a rocket grain shape with no other modification and we got a successful firing which is we heard it burn and shoot out some fire and then we started to hear the telltale sound of gummy bears individually peeling a hoof from the rocket grain and getting pooped out of the bottom of our rocket but not with enough force to actually lift this rocket we didn't get any else we didn't get one inch yeah the ignition flame appeared to light the locks oh nice you're eating it me I'd still sweet Wow let the loos pack flavor some fuel simply fell apart", "JOc2ux2daIg": "hey everyone I just wanted to let you guys know that my online chocolate shop is now carrying dark chocolate truffles with the most delicious whipped dark chocolate ganache filling they're so good oh my gosh they're only available for a limited time and we do ship internationally so if you would like a box definitely check out the link in the description box down below hello everybody welcome back so as you may see I have a little guest here today that enthusiam camera and so today we are making some gummy bears for dogs and this is part of my little Paddington's pantry series because this if you look at the camera is Paddington my Pomeranian and every so often at me makes and dog friendly treats so today we are making some coming ears and I didn't know that dogs could eat gelatin for the longest time and once I heard that that was possible I'm like oh my gosh this needs to happen for you too so we are making a lot of element gummy bears today but actually not bears they are a little like bone shape how cute is this mold I'll have them will link in the description box if you would like to check it out and before we get started I'll someone let you guys know that I have a member the only exclusive Facebook group that'll give you guys access or will allow you guys fix - um actually dictate what videos I film and give you guys a lot of creative control over this channel and over my chocolate shop on Etsy so if you wanna learn more about that I'll have that link in the description box below but without further ado let's get started and look at me bears and also in that group you'll get like behind-the-scenes photos and videos of Paddington's okay let's get started so first what you want to do is place two cups of fresh watermelon in a food processor and pulse until smooth show you to remove any pulp and then measure one cup of watermelon juice and so I'm using waggling in this video just because it's safe for dogs and it's like a nice kind of flavor for gummy bears that I recommend be using fresh fruit and it kind of this way versus using store-bought juice just because there's a lot of additives in store-bought juice like for humans and you don't necessarily know if there's an ingredient in there that could harm your dog there's a sweetener called xylitol off it on the screen here and that is so toxic three dogs so you definitely want to avoid anything with that and any kind of artificial sweetener so just to be safe I'd stick with fresh fruits or dogs safe beef broth beef broth I've purchased um beef broth powder from the pet store and it's safe for dogs there's no onion or garlic in it which is also toxic to dogs so before you decide to make experi dogs just do a quick Google and make sure that the ingredient that you're using like for the juice is animal friendly or dog friendly um one thing to really stay away from is any kind of juice that contains grapes or grape juice obviously those are so toxic for dogs oh my gosh so definitely stay away from that but I just recommend like call your vet or do a quick google before but watermelon is safe and paddington like I was sitting on the couch the other night and I was eating watermelon and he saw me and literally like dough onto me because he wanted it so badly so and you want to kill some gelatin into some water and microwave for 15 to 30 seconds or until it's liquid and it regards to the gelatin there's a lot of chatting in this video but you want to make sure that you that you're using a Knox gelatin which is plain unflavored unsweetened gelatin and don't use jell-o that like the job of box dip powder um that's because there are artificial sweeteners in that too and those aren't safe for your dog so just to be safe I'd recommend using thin box gelatin and I'll have that linked in the description box below and Amazon if you want to pick them up they want to pour the liquid gelatin into the watermelon juice and mix well or they make sure enjoyed gummy bear or Minnie bone mold and but into the fridge until it's set for about one to two hours let's unmold feed them to your puppy and are done that is so if it guys so much for watching these yummy should be stored in the fridge will probably last you around like four or five days just because gummies don't tend to like last as long as like the regular kind of like hard baked cookie and when they're at room temperature they soften up pretty quickly so I definitely recommend storing the fridge if you guys try these out please please please send us photos and take us at pink open e & pennington underscore calm on Instagram we would love to see what you make and always makes me so happy to see your creations and yeah please subscribe button entering the notification Bell so you notified on the upload because I upload

you guys so much for watching and I will see you tomorrow for another video", "3j2v1S3jr7s": "hello everybody welcome back welcome back to cook miss so I apologize if I look like death I'm just getting over since food poisoning so bear with me welcome to the second video today and this is the second video that is new Earth's New Year's Eve inspired so these are some champagne gummy bears and

don't think they'll get you drunk but they're really cute addition to any New Year's Eve party or any Christmas party and they have some gold leaf in them so this is edible gold leaf kind of expensive but if you want to go all out for something special for Christmas or New Year's this is like the cutest treat and it's so fun of putting the gold leaf in the gummy bear containers I don't know why

Christmas chew and a soon and I forgotten many times asked you guys for questions so I'm a filling within the next few days so if you have any questions that you've ever one to ask me it can be anything um definitely ask me down below and I'll make sure to answer it in the Q&A which is going live on Christmas morning or sometime on Christmas so you know let's get started and make the coming bears so first wrinkle the gelatin into the water and let develop for 5 minutes for the champagne into a small pot and bring it to a simmer add the gelatin and whisk until philippe salt sprinkle some gold leaf flakes into the inside of a gummy bear mold and gently pour the liquid on top place them all in the fridge until the gummy bears have fully set for about 30 minutes so you can eat these as is or package them into little cellophane bags for a New Year's Eve gift or you can pop them into some champagne glasses and top with some champagne for a cute sparkly touch to your cocktail and you are done so thank you guys so much for watching I hope you like this recipe I make sure to stay tuned tomorrow for an only cookies recipe we're getting so close to Christmas I can't believe it's

show you in this video pretty much how to make any cocktail into a gummy bear that's right thank you it's not that hard is it no not at all we had to get in touch with some of our College chemistry professors but there's a little chemistry involved here we're not gonna go into all that right right in a great depth but we didn't know what lessons are professors were did we know yeah you do with students all the time non-stop right yeah so we're gonna show you how to make a Negroni gummy bear mm-hmm but we're gonna talk about it in general terms too so that you can bash in any of your favorite cocktails into a gummy bear that's right not just cocktails but favorite spirit yep you can do different liquors and then instead of mixing a cocktail in a glass you can just that's the fun part so Joey bears are the kind you buy at Walgreens are some sort of fruit juice or fruit flavored juice mixed with gelatin right which is this stuff here that's what isn't your jello right citric acid sometimes if it's a tart gummy bear right and then sorbitol right so we're tells assert sugar alcohol seen nationally in apples and pears and peaches plums stuff like that but when you combine it with the gelatin it firms up the gelatin right yeah that really creates the viscosity but it also creates a higher melting temperature right so that way it will stay more all congeal together like the gummy bear it does even everyone covered yeah kind of class societies plasticize is it a little bit and it's the sorbitol mix with gelatin that they used in the gel caps and medicines and stuff that gives it that firmness right also all right and the things that you need we needed to talk about in gym when making gummy bear cocktails esta Lucien mm-hmm evaporation and coloration right right so dilution is because you need to add some water to this right mm-hmm yeah when you're mixing a regular cocktail you're gonna mix a cocktail with ice then you may even pour it over ice so you're gonna get some melting of that ice that's gonna add water to the cocktail here if we just make the cocktail and then put it together and put it in the gummy bear it's gonna be too strong so we actually add some water typically about half of an ounce to account for that dilution that the ice usually provides regular cocktail now the amount of gelatin we use and the amount of sorbitol in this recipe is for a regular-sized cocktail which is anywhere between three and a half and five ounces right so if you're you making an old-fashioned for example which is just two ounces or if you're turning some liqueurs or The Cure's into gummy bears you want to start with four ounces of liquid plus or minus so for the old-fashioned for example you would double that recipe exact right because all the recipes are geared for using one tablespoon of gelatin and reason the Knox brand here and if you buy it in the box here they come with these little envelopes and this is a tablespoon so it's eard for that breezy you see we're gonna make a lot gonna buy this 16 ounce size so the 1 tablespoon of gelatin and 2 teaspoons of the powdered sorbitol and that's what you make for your cocktail right and with the gelatin you're looking for a bloom of 225 anything lower then that's what they use more for jellies and jello so we want something that's that has a higher bloom of 225 to really make sure we get that gum gummy bear cases yeah the bloom isn't a measure of the thickness that the product is going to end up all right so you run a hide them like that now we have to talk about coloration right because now if you're making like this for example is a Negroni that comes out nice and cherry red right but a lot of cocktails aren't touched that way for example here this is our the old-fashioned cocktail commuters and if you don't use my food coloring you're gonna get this sort of tan color here which is not all that appetizing right it's not really what you would think of as far as color when you're thinking in an old-fashioned so look a couple drops of round food coloring will make them look like an old-fashioned and we use these like for example the the brown for the old-fashioned is here we buy this variety pack and we like putting a little food coloring in all of them because it kind of just brightens them up this is geared for it's a frosting gel that comes out and drops but it's geared for cake icing and frostings little things like that right so when gummy bears come off of the assembly line they're what they're called toothsome right they just grab them as in like you can bite them and pull them apart right it's the fact that they sit on the shelves at Walgreens and are exposed to the air that makes them rubbery because some of the fruit juice and liquids have evaporated right right and with liquor the ethanol that more readily evaporates and so there's an issue with the gummy bears where you're gonna get some evaporation once you make the gummy bears if you just leave them set out you're gonna really evaporate off all the liquor and the flavor so when you make these you want to make sure that one they only have a shelf life of about two to three weeks and then you want to make sure that you keep them covered so once you make them you want to make sure that they stay in an airtight container or keep them in the tray and put saran wrap over the top that way then when you go to serve them the last a couple hours but you don't want to leave them sitting up - yeah because that losses will be gone and you just have something to eat which is right very flavorful exactly so and this is a mobile use it's a silicon mold but that we buy and it comes in this packet here with two of them and a little eyedropper and the eyedropper is important because that's what you used to fill up with and it's difficult to be pouring these things in from a beaker otherwise but they're nice you don't need to spray them with anything that you just want to say so you just pop them right out and put them still them to your guests or put them in your mouth right right so we've talked about the dilution the coloration and evaporation those are the main things right there are coupled through juices that don't do well with gelatin that's right if you're using fresh pineapple guava mango Kiwi or papaya those have little proteases that will break down the collagen and not let them to bare set right so you can boil these juices and deactivate those proteases and it won't break down the gelatin pineapple if you're using pineapple from the can it in the canning process they already boil it so that'll be perfectly fine yeah so we're gonna show you how to make a Negroni cocktail dummy beer but as fill the literature earlier it's fun to do spirits individually right and put them in your mouth now when you're doing we're gonna give you just an overview of some of those of the liquors and spirits and stuff that we've done so that you get an idea of how to do that this is our chartreuse gummy bear so here we have just four ounces of green chartreuse 1/2 ounce of water tablespoon of gelatin and 2 teaspoons of serveth all right absinthe here beside it absinthe is not particularly sweet so to our four ounces of absinthe we add 1 ounce of simple syrup mm-hmm and then the gelatin and sorbitol if you're doing a low proof like a wine or champagne this is a rose a champagne for example you don't need to add any sort of water it's just runs with champagne the gelatin and the turbot all right and so once you have your gummy bears that have the different liquors you can literally just mix one in your mouth so if you want to have a Negroni you can take your gin your Campari and your sweet vermouth take one of each pop it in your mouth chew it up and raw mix it together and you got a nice big row yep or don't put don't take the gin take the Bourbon Aparri excuse me with and you have your boulevardier exact right so that's a fun way to do it to make the Negroni gummy bear cocktail to a small soft spot you want to add one and a half ounces of gin one and a half ounces of Campari one and a half ounces of sweet vermouth half ounce of water the two teaspoons of sorbitol and then one tablespoon of the unflavored gelatin powder and you just want to kind of sift that over the top so it doesn't go in and form large clumps once that's in there let it sit on the counter top for 10 minutes after 10 minutes we'll take it to the range and turn on the flame to the lowest amount possible you want to warm this up and stir it constantly to dissolve the gelatin you do not want to bring it to a boil and if you start smelling a burning type of smell you want to turn off the heat but stir it around the tiny little starlight sparkles in there are the gelatin granules so you want to keep your eye on those and just stir it until they're all dissolved once this dissolved we'll take it over to our mold and fill up our silicon mold bears and you want to fill it just proud of the top so the back of the gummy bear is nice and round each cocktail will make about a hundred gummy bears once it's full let it sit on the countertop for about 30 minutes just so they initially set so you can move them around then move them into the refrigerator and they've been set firmly for at least an hour after an hour or two in the refrigerator bring them out if you're not serving them right away you want to wrap them in saran wrap and just keep them in the refrigerator if you're serving them just pop them out like this they will stick a little bit to each other not terribly so but if that bothers you you can do what they do at the factory and that is add a little bit of food grade mineral oil to them just a couple of drops too much and it will cause the runs so be careful and then just fix them together with your hand to get them all coated and then they will sit well together so that's how we make our gummybear Negroni it's kind of a template for our you can make all the gummy bear cocktails just kind of take your favorite cocktail experiment and have fun yeah we use fresh lemon juice lime juice and you can do that or even substitute citric acid so just add one eighth of a teaspoon of citric acid in place of your lime or lemon juice in your margarita or gimlet or a whiskey sour or things like that and if you're using fresh citrus juice make sure that you use a fine mesh sieve to strain out the pulp when you make that cocktail we do that so the pulp from the citrus isn't a distraction from being able to see the gelatin dissolve and once you get these cocktails and the technique under your belt and when you go off the wagon then you get yourself a large gummy bear mold and make yourself a giant gummy bear I've still that's right enjoy Cheers you", "uIPRrcxet6g": "g'day guys and welcome today I'm going to show you how to make gummy bears at home this is a great fun recipe for the whole family and it's very easy so for starters into a cold saucepan add half a cup of cold water 2 tablespoons or 20 grams of plain unflavored gelatin and 185 gram packet of flavored gelatin or jelly mix use whatever flavor you want and this will determine the color and the flavor of your gummy bears now give this a quick mix together and then turn the stove on to a low to medium heat and just allow this mixture to warm slowly for 5 to 10 minutes and just give it a stir every now and then once the gelatin is fully dissolved just pour it into a jar that's suitable for pouring and allow it to cool for a couple of minutes while this is happening you can skim off some of the foam on the top if you like this is purely cosmetic and now I've got my bear mold here you can use whatever shaped mold you want to make whatever fruit animal or shape you'd like so simply pour the mixture into the mould and then into the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes until it sets repeat this process for any other flavors and colors you'd like then just carefully remove them from the mold and you're done guys you have got a gummy bear a great variation of this is to make sour gummy bears so to do this just sprinkle over a little bit of citric acid and will make them nice and sour don't go overboard as it is a preservative and enjoy these are a great idea if you're looking to have a bit of fun in the kitchen and of

to make a non-alcoholic version these sparkling gummy bears okay so these are crazy easy to make and as always I'll leave the full written recipe for you guys down below or you can get on my website at Lindsay and baek's calm so first we just place the gummy bear bulbs on a baking sheet and I'm gonna sprinkle some edible gold stars into the molds and I'll leave the link for where you guys can get this online but it's totally optional it just kind of makes them really extra special then we're gonna pour 1/2 a cup of Rose a into a medium sauce pan and sprinkle two quarter ounce packets of gelatin right over the top so if you want to make these non-alcoholic just leave out the half a cup of Rose day and in a quarter cup of cranberry juice with a quarter cup of sparkling club soda so you still get that sparkling gummy bear flavor then just stir this all together and let it sit for a minute so the gels and has a chance to start to bloom then over lo he's just staring a quarter cup of white sugar and if you want you're gonna have a drop of pink food coloring to give it that rosy color then you're just gonna stir the mixture until the gelatin and the sugar are dissolved for the tricks of making these so they stay nice and sweet and boozy is low and slow on the stovetop don't let it get over ninety degrees Fahrenheit so you still get that really intense rosacea champagne flavor shining through and that was basically it now we're gonna turn off the heat but we're gonna leave it on the burner to keep the jealous and warm while we fill up our gummy bear molds so I'm just using a little dropper that came with the mold sweep and also just pour the mixture right on top and use a spatula to kind of wipe away any excess so I got this gummy bear mold online I'll leave a link for you guys so you can get one too but you can definitely just pour the mixture into a regular 8 by 8 inch pan and just line it with plastic wrap that way once it's all firm just pull it out you can slice it up into a little square gumming it so you don't even need the mold at all and they come out totally perfect you got you can kind of already smell the rose day we're just gonna pop these in the fridge to firm up for a few hours or you can just pop them in the freezer for about 20 to 30 minutes until they're nice and firm and then we can pop them out and give you a try you guys how insanely fabulous to these turn out oh my gosh I love the little stars these are not so cute then we just let them come to room temperature and they are soft and gummy and ready to serve if you're not

that these are going to grow us but they don't use gelatin so if you're vegan or if you don't need gelatin for any other reason this recipe is perfect for you so let's get started so you want to pour some juice and sugar into a small pot and bring it to a boil over medium heat then add some powdered agar which we are going to be using in place of gelatin and simmer for one minute then pour the mixture into a gummy bear mold and pop this into the fridge until set for about 20 minutes so you can just use juice as in or you can add some coconut milk to the juice and it gives you like this obviously like delicious coconut flavor but it also lightens the color of the juice so it's not like a pastel color that's an awesome option or route to go down I googled and try to see if we going with vegan and the answer I got was it isn't so that's why I didn't use any food coloring in this recipe so yeah so if you want to add coconut milk what you want to do it for the juice and sugar into a small pot and bring it to a boil over medium heat then add the powdered agar and simmer for one minute and then add some coconut cream and mix until it's fully combined if you don't want to use coconut cream you can always use almond milk then pour the mixture into a gummy bear mold and pop this into the fridge in full set for about 20 minutes then just unmold the gummy bears and you are done net so thank you guys so much for watching I hope that you like this recipe if you would like more vegan recipes definitely comment what specific recipe you would like down below and I will get

cool so make sure to stay tuned and I love you guys so much and I hope you have a fantastic weekend thanks", "gy47dkoOlU0": "hi I'm Shireen the founder of my pain centre your number one research or tried and trusted CBD products all the products we sell I use my parents use and my friends use we don't sell any product that we haven't tried or that we use in our daily lives so visit us at my pain center calm hey one of the questions we've been getting a lot lately which makes sense due to cove in nineteen is i'm new to CBD where do i start and that is a great question there's so many products right now out with CBD in it it isn't hard to know like what is the best place to start do you start with gummies do you start with an oil do you start with tea do you start with honey do you like there's just there's so many things there's coffee there's bath bombs there's lotions there's shampoos there's soaps i'm gonna give it to you real easy if you are new to CBD and you just want to try to see if it helps you whether you're struggling with sleep anxiety stress or pain I will recommend gummy bears start with the gummy bears or any sort of edible so chocolate almonds peppermints but make sure that the product actually has CBD in it meaning if it is being sold on amazon.com technically they're not allowed to sell products with CBD in it so just be careful where you're purchasing your CBD from now if you are having pain I'm just gonna caveat this from the gummy bears if you are having some sort of pain in your body that's like localized so you're just hurting like right here in the back of your neck or on your hand like just right here this is hurting I would suggest a cream you don't really need a CBD gummy unless for some reason that pain is keeping you up at night then you can also in conjunction use the CBD gummy now you're probably thinking okay well on my paints intercom there's like ten different types of gummies where do I start so all the gummies are pretty similar we just offer different taste profiles to fit our customers need so we have a five milligram gummy a 10 milligram gummy 20 and then 25 the most popular place to start is a 10 milligram gummy now here's the thing with CBD there is no set dosage that I can tell you is what you need everybody is so different it all depends on your weight your body genetics what you just ate what you're using it for how out-of-sync your body is so for example our bodies are like cars and we have to tune them and if you haven't tuned your body in a while you may need a little bit more CBD in the beginning to tune your car but it really doesn't matter about you and your you could have a partner and one of your partners could take a 10 milligram gummy and feel the same effects that you would need to take a 20 milligram gummy for it just varies like that so I'll give an example like I'll take a 10 milligram gummy during the day like if I'm about to like step into a really intense meeting or I have to get on the highway right I mean right now it's not as bad getting on the highway but I'm in Florida and we have a highway called I 4 and it's just a hot mess and so if I'm getting on i-4 I'll take a 10 milligram gummy I have a customer that's 280 pounds and if he takes a 10 milligram gummy he falls asleep he gets drowsy and that is a side effect of gummy bear or any CBD if you take too much of a CBD product like it's too strong for you one of the biggest side effects is drowsiness so when you first start with CVD I was highly highly highly recommend you tried in the evening before you go to bed and not when you're operating any heavy machinery like a car so I start I usually tell people start with a 10 milligram if you do start to think you're feeling drowsy you can always cut it in half I take ten milligrams during the day for random things and then I'll take a 20 milligram gummy at night for sleep if I really want a really amazing sleep I may take a 25 milligram gummy so I'll just show you quickly like what the gummy bears look like so you know so these are these are our 10 milligram gummy bears this is just like a regular gummy bear that you would find like Hasbro gummy bear the ones at the movie theaters we sell these in a regular flavor and a sour flavor sour bear flavor as well and those are really good they taste like sour patch kids our 5 milligram gummy is also a sour patch it's a sour patch kid that's a 5 milligram gummy we've had some parents use those on their children for like a DD or anxiety I'm not advocating that you should use them on your children but I'm just saying that if you do want to use them on your children start with the 5 milligrams you'll also see like we have watermelon gummy bears and these are these are 10 milligram gummies as well just like the regular bears but they taste like watermelon so like I said each gummy bear just has a different flavor profile and then we have a 20 milligram profile gummy bear and then these are our 25 milligram gummy bears so these are apple rings tastes just like an apple ring smells like an apple ring we also have these in peach rings those are delicious too those will put you out I shouldn't say that they put me out I don't know if they'll put you out so it's just all about trying and testing so like I said I suggest a 10 milligram one see if it works if you're feeling more relaxed but it's not really putting you to sleep then take 2 at night you can take 3 at night if you want to as well and then once you figure out how many you need then you can come back and get a 20 or 25 milligram gummy as well so I hope that helps I didn't bring them here but I should have but we also have chocolate almonds those are 20 milligrams so if you prefer something sweet at night or something sweet during the day just be careful you don't have too many and then we also have a peppermint and our peppermints are actually butter mints and those are 50 milligrams and they have a little melatonin in them too so those are really great if you really really struggle with sleep and you really want to be knocked out but I'm gonna caveat all of this CBD doesn't work on everyone everybody everybody is different right how they react to CBD so I could be telling you a 15 milligram peppermint will put me out for like 6 7 hours it may not work on you and that's just something you're just gonna have to try CBD and see and I can't I can't tell you if it's gonna work on you or not so give it a try though I mean you have nothing to lose everything is 15 percent off on our site right now during the coronavirus chaos because we understand everybody is very anxious and stressed out right now and having trouble sleeping I can attest to that and just yeah let us know if you have any questions hit us up support at my pain center calm you can send us a DM on Instagram Twitter Facebook my pain center and we'll talk to you soon take care of have a good weekend and stay safe guys stay safe I don't know what I'm doing I'm sorry", "siG8cRs7cU0": "hey guys today I have a couple of gift ideas for you I've seen champagne and rose a gummy bears all over Pinterest so I had to give them a try for myself to make them poor rose' or champagne into a saucepan on medium low heat you don't want all of the alcohol to burn off while you cook so don't turn the heat up too high the full recipe with measurements will be below this video so don't forget to check that out add sugar and whisk until dissolved [Music] you'll also add unflavored gelatin [Music] food color is optional but I added one drop use a dropper to fill the mold then put this in the refrigerator to set I left them in for a couple of hours then popped them out of the mold [Music] I also made a second batch with champagne and I like them both but the rose' was a definite favorite either one would make a great gift [Music] [Music] clean the surface of the glass first then attach a sticker or a stencil I find that stickers work better for this because the etching cream has a way of seeping under any stencils that I use and ruining the project this isn't the actual sticker it's the sticker paper surrounding the letter that I want to use and it works really well add a layer of etching cream and let this set for three minutes pack the etching cream into the glass a few times during this three minutes after the time is up rinse away the etching cream and remove the sticker this makes a great gift for newlyweds for a housewarming party or around the holidays when you'll want something to toast with more

Store-bought gummy bears, although delicious,\ntend to have tons of foreign, unpronounceable ingredients in them. So I want to show you how you can make them\nyourself at home with just four ingredients and all natural sugars. So let\u2019s get started. Being able to bake is so great for a lot of\nreasons. One in particular is that you know and can\ncontrol what goes into your food. My one tip is always is to use quality ingredients. We\u2019re going to start out by preparing our\nfruit for our homemade gummies. So I have some strawberries that have been\ndefrosted. Feel free to use fresh, but when berries are\nout of season, I like to use frozen. Now what we\u2019re going to do with these is\nput them into a food processor and make a puree. We\u2019re just going to puree them until they\u2019re\nnice and fine and there\u2019s no lumps. Next, we\u2019re going to take our puree and\npass it through a sieve. Now we do this step because we want to remove\nseeds and we also want to end up with a nice, smooth strawberry puree at the end. So we have our lovely fruit puree, we\u2019re\ngoing to head over to the stove and combine it with the rest of our ingredients. In a heavy-bottom saucepan, add in your strawberry\npuree, water, lemon juice, and honey. And then heat all of these ingredients together\nuntil they just come to a simmer. Now that our mix is simmering, it\u2019s time\nto add in our gelatin. Now if you are vegan or don\u2019t eat gelatin,\nyou can always replace this with agar powder, which you can buy online or at a health food\nshop. Sprinkle your gelatin over the mix and then\nwhisk it in until there\u2019s no more lumps and your mix comes back up to a simmer. Ok perfect. So I\u2019m going to take this off the heat. I can see that there\u2019s no lumps of gelatin. It\u2019s nice and smooth. If you do find lumps of gelatin in yours,\nyou can feel free to pass it through a sieve again to remove those. To make these real, authentic gummy bears,\nI\u2019m going to set mine in this mold I got online. It\u2019s really inexpensive. However, if you don\u2019t have one of these\nmolds, you can always line a tray with cling wrap and this\u2019ll work just as well. You\u2019ll just have to cut our your gummies. I\u2019m going to put a link for this mold along\nwith the recipe for my gummy bears on biggerbolderbaking.com. If you\u2019re using a mold, lay it into a tray\nbefore you start filling it up. Pour your mix into a jug with a small spout\nso it\u2019s easy to pour into the molds. And also, if you see any bubbles floating\non top, just scoop that away with a spoon. Now just very slowly, fill up all of your\nmolds with your gummy mix. If you see any air bubbles, just pop them\nwith your finger. So when I worked as a pastry chef, one of\nmy jobs was to make the sweets for after dinner. And every night, we made pate de fruits, which\nis exactly what this is. It\u2019s kind of like a fruit paste. Ok and that\u2019s them done. So now remember, you don\u2019t just have to\nmake strawberry. You can make any flavor you like. I also made blueberry homemade gummies and\norange flavored homemade gummies. The orange flavor is particularly easy because\nyou just use orange juice instead of a puree. Once you\u2019ve filled your mold, we\u2019re going\nto put our gummy bears in the fridge overnight so they can set. If you like this video, don\u2019t forget to\nsubscribe to my channel so you don\u2019t miss out when I upload a new one. So I made these gummy bears yesterday because\nI wanted them to be nice and set so I could show you. If you\u2019re using a mold, just go very gently\nto ease out your gummy bear. You don\u2019t want to damage him. Just look at this little gummy. He is adorable. And the best thing about it is you made him\nand you know exactly what went into him. It\u2019s all good ingredients. You can create any fruit flavors you like\nso the possibilities are endless. Don\u2019t forget to head over to my website,\nbiggerbolderbaking.com where there is a recipe on how you can make your own sour gummies. Thank you so much for watching and I\u2019ll\nsee you back here next Thursday for more Bigger Bolder Baking.", "jZYpZTfWLmA": "today's video is sponsored by raid Shadow legends in today's video we're going to see what happens if we try to freeze-dry a one pound gummy bear [Music] [Applause] since you guys are aware a 1 pound gummy bear is 11 servings I say it's like maybe 2 for me but according to this the back of our 1 pound gummy bear it should only be 11 servings but a 319 carbs 1,300 calories this is fantastic it also says it's equal to 280 standard sized gummy bears so we've got two of these 1 pound gummy bears you may have seen that these are not the biggest gummy bears in the world but we figured that this was a pretty good step up from our standard size they don't stand up real great by themselves but we want to see what happens when we freeze-dried should be kind of interesting now we don't actually know if it's gonna get all the way through a gummy bear in the past we have freeze-dried dubbing bears when we have freeze-dried gummy worms got some really cool results they puff up they turn into kind of like a crunchy cheeto that goes gelatinous it's very different but because of what Callie was just saying that we don't know if it'll make it all the way through we've got two gummy bears and we tried two different ways one of them will just be on the tray and we're gonna see what happens - I need your other one few times the other one we're going to slice up into smaller pieces so that poor gummy bear will not be all in one piece we just want to see if that's necessary to get the whole thing to freeze-dry and it might be freeze drivers aren't really designed to get through like this is almost 2 inches thick in some places so we can set our freeze dryer on a little bit higher heat and I think we can set it to go for extra time and we may just have to run it through a second time even after the first time through but we're gonna see what we can do to have the best chance of getting this gummy bear to freeze dry entirely because if it does that'd be cool and we've had like the little gummy bears have like we pulled inside so not these particular governors we did have some trouble in the past with Albanese gummy candies I believe I tried gummy worms from them and while the trolly gummy worms they puff up beautifully the albanese ones for some reason didn't I don't know if it's just because it's a different recipe exactly but I do love these they are the best I got this bag for my birthday and I'm halfway through it so I do want to throw some of these on the tray as a control as well right here we have that just like that and then this one you're just gonna slice up maybe not quite a quarter-inch but not much more than that I want to try a couple like paper-thin slices okay so see what happens of course that requires being able to slice through gummy bear before we load the freeze dryer with these colorful gummy bears though we

going for a glowing red that will just burn the dummy instantly see how that does haha you didn't want the joint you always want the torch Nate you always want the torch I am corrected so now if I put this back it's just gonna burn instantly so this is not a perfect solution you could have just burned it until it was char and let it come off that way and now if I try and cut it's just gonna back that burning there that's as thin as you're gonna get I think I'm so impressed almost wow that's gonna stay right there and this is now going to go this direction okay so we've got our gummy bear sliced up we've got our mini controls and we have our giant gummy bear we're gonna run this up to the freeze dryer it may take more than one day I'm betting it will but let's see what happens all right fingers crossed hopefully in a day and a half that we'll have done something if not we'll probably just set it for another cycle and run it again may go and it's possible that like the stuff on the bottom will freeze dry and the stuff on top won't we may flip it over if we have to do another cycle to get from the other side they'd see how that works we've also had it before where they have melted in the drying process if it's a soft enough material I don't think these are because we've never had that problem with the gummy worms in the past it's some of our chocolates good so we'll see what happens fingers crossed well these are things we freeze-dried them we did I did come in and set it for a new cycle at that point I flipped over the giant gummy bear it hasn't really changed much since then this is basically what it looked like except now it has fly spots on all the protrusions yeah yeah and you know I bet it the middle of this is still not completely freeze-dried but we got much better results than I thought we would especially on the blue one that we cut into pieces these look very puffed up yep well okay and we've mentioned this in the past even this is a denser material than you get out of like patrol Ebro gummy worms so this is Albanese and Albanese are sort of a thicker recipe we think we're not sure why but they don't puff up the same but even these have puffed up the decent about now I want a cone open okay start from these small and so this is just a normal sized red gummy bear what what exactly remember how hard it was to cut through yeah full sized I'm gonna try the spine of the knife and see if it's any harder no pretty much exactly the same okay so we've made cheeto dust with gummy bears again yep that's bizarre I just revived the process let's check out the inside of the biggest rat you pick it up fate has decided for us that it's time to see the inside of the big one and look at that that looks changed all the way through sounds pretty cheeto ewwww no no I was right oh yeah this does have more chew to it so what Albanese always does there's a little really chewy gummy in the middle yeah that red one was crazy [Music] and this pink one I was pretty crunchy we didn't actually weigh it beforehand to see if it was accurately 1 pound we were just going and supposedly about what the box said what case we've lost point 1 yeah 6 maybe pounds off and it is still like there is absolutely still a weight to it it absolutely doesn't feel as fluffy as they normally are this is still a dense I am going to measure all of the blue parts together to see if more weight has been lost from the one that we cut up it feels like it that's if we can get everything to stack and balance nicely on our scale new strategy okay new strategy a bowl uh-huh we're professionals 13 points that's actually more what and we ate ears off of it dude I bet the ear off of it so all right all right okay our blue one that seems to have puffed up more to me actually has more weight to it still it's crunchy like it's not soft and cheeto we like these ones normally are where they break in little pieces it's just sort of snapping like if your finger nope I couldn't I tried to get a slice that didn't quite work broke or too much for that but we might have invented the loudest food in the universe you know how people are like movie theaters are a place where people want silence let's make the loudest treat possible popcorn and give it to them and put the ball in a dark room together we've made something louder [Music] it's pretty crunchy I'm gonna cut open this one living is our biggest piece what the inside is like and pretty grungy all the way through I'll give it this so the flavor is so much stronger we find that a lot can we do this even though it has expanded I feel like the flavor condenses without the liquid in it like before you eat it and you're like like the first thing that hits you is this is a gummy texture next it's okay sweet and then you can kind of get the aftertaste of bluegrass right first thing that hits you here is I have blue raspberry in my nose that's interesting [Music] [Music] I'm now going to be tasting artificial cherry in my mouth until I die I do regret that blue raspberry that concentrated is good cherry that concentrated is cough syrup okay so I put this gummy bear in the water to see if it would do anything and it's just kind of slowly dissolving while it floats to the top now I've got water in the microwave to get really hot I don't see what happens to it in hot water instead of cold water oh wow I'm so angry about that I think it just air is escaping fast enough that it's like bubbling and I can smell it smell the lemon so warm water way faster I'm just gonna take a piece of our giant bear and throw that in there too I'll the steam the lemon ones and then I just took a big chunk of blue and drop it in and it was all the way gummy bear teeth [Music] what did you have today alright gummybear team now the deal [Music] how cool is anyone not as flavorful as kool-aid here's the weird part guys this is super bizarre that is delicious and I'm really upset about it all right guys we have freeze-dried yet another very odd thing what else do you want to see because you know that freeze dryer is gonna be around for a while let's go in the comments below thanks again to our sponsor rage shadow legends click the link in the description to get playing today guys that's not all you know we've always got more for you see hit that box up the top to check out the most recent video and we will see you in the next one talk to you then [Music]", "P_KArHdguG8": "What's the story behind gummy bears? How did they get their start, and what makes\nthem so perfectly chewy? They're a ridiculously satisfying candy, but\nas it turns out, there's a lot more to their story than meets the eye. Here's what you should know about gummy bears. Gummy bears have been around for almost 100\nyears. They were created and popularized by a German\ncompany named Haribo. Hans Riegel, the founder of Haribo, was only\n27 when he became a trained confectioner and started his company in 1920. Riegel began by producing hard candies until\nhe decided to try a few experiments with gelatin. It took two years, but he invented his first\nbear-shaped candy made of gummy in 1922. Riegel originally called them Dancing Bears\nand they were a bit larger and thinner than modern gummy bears. It wasn't until 1960 that Haribo updated the\nDancing Bears name to Gold-Bears. Then in 1978, the bears changed shape to the\nshorter, thicker version that we know and love today. While gummy bears have been a popular candy\nin Germany since the 1920s, it took many decades before they became widely known and loved\nin the United States. According to Bon Appetit, U.S. high school\nteachers in the 1970s would bring gummy bears into their German language classrooms so students\ncould try snacks from Germany. As more Americans were introduced to the tasty\ntreats, candy companies knew it was time to jump on the gummy bear bandwagon. Jelly Belly was the first American company\nto begin producing these little bears in 1981. However, Haribo wasn't willing to sit quietly\nand watch from the sidelines. So one year later, in 1982, their gummies\ndebuted in America. Other brands such as Brach's and Albanese\nfollowed years later and started producing their own version of gummy bears. Have you ever grabbed a handful of gummy bears,\nand picked out all of the bears of one specific color because, presumably, they were your\nfavorite flavor? Then you bite into the gummy candy only to\nfind out the flavor was lying to you? It happens to the best of us. According to Charles Spence, a professor of\nexperimental psychology, all our senses affect one another, and flavor perception can be\nincredibly multisensory. That's the reason why when we see an orange\ncandy, we think it's orange fruit-flavored. Keith Dannoff, Vice President of Marketing\nfor Haribo, told NPR that the company's gummy bears come in five flavors: strawberry, lemon,\norange, pineapple, and raspberry. Oddly enough, there is a green colored gummy\nbear in the mix. But when we bite into that green bear, the\nflavor is actually strawberry, which might come as a big surprise to some gummy bear\nfans. \"The red one is more gooder to me 'cause it\ntastes like berries.\" We all know that there's something unique\nabout biting into gummy candies. Next to the flavor, it's the texture that\nwe love. But what gives them that special chewiness? Well, much like other classic treats, such\nas marshmallows and Jell-O, it's all about the addition of gelatin. Gummy bears, gummy worms, and all of our favorite\ngummy goodies are made with sugar, corn syrup, water, coloring, and flavorings, but it's\nthe gelatin that really gives gummy candy that perfect, squishy texture. Gelatin allows for the thickening of a product,\nwhile still keeping a gooey consistency without adding any color or flavor. Gelatin comes from collagen, which is found\nin the tissue, skin, and bones of animals such as pigs and cows. Also, this is the reason that vegetarians\nand vegans should stay far away from traditional gummy bears. \"Did you learn that at vegan academy?\" There's always something joyous about eating\na handful of gummy bears. They're one of the most adorable candies out\nthere, and for many, it's hard not to remember eating them as a child. But what if you could take gummy bears and\nreally kick them up a notch to make an adult version? Turns out you can. Just like the magic combination of Jell-O\nand alcohol, you can make your own gummy bear shots. All you need to do is add gummy bears to a\nbowl or a cup, pour in vodka until it just barely covers the top of your gummy bears,\nand let them sit for a few days. The bears will absorb the alcohol, and you'll\nend up with plump, juicy bears that will make you feel warm with nostalgia - and booze. There aren't too many candies that have been\nmade into successful television shows. Sure, there's plenty of commercials for various\ncandies, and of course, they appear within shows, but a TV show inspired by a candy is\npretty rare. In 1985, Disney decided to capitalize on the\npopularity of gummy bears in the United States and produce a cartoon. A group of cuddly, colorful bears make up\nthe characters in Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears. The show tells the story of a civilization\nof bears that was almost destroyed by humans. However, there's one group that still lives\nbeneath a medieval kingdom. Most humans stopped believing in Gummi Bears\nlong ago but a young boy named Cavin [still believes in them because of the stories his\ngrandfather told him. After being chased by ogres, he's discovered\nby a group of Gummi Bears who are understandably suspicious of humans. \"I've never seen a human close up before. Zummi, do they really eat Gummi Bears?\" \"Oh no, oh no, of course not, Cubbi.\" Cavin earns their trust and they join together\nto battle the evil antagonist, Duke Igthorn. He's on a never-ending quest to steal the\nbear's Gummiberry Juice, which keeps them bouncing and gives people superhuman strength. It might sound a little gimmicky, but the\nshow actually had a big international following and aired for six seasons until 1991. When you consider the number of companies\nproducing gummy bears, all vying to be crowned the favorite, it's extremely impressive. Haribo has factories all over the world. Plus there are plenty of other gummy goodies\ncoming from such brands as Jelly Belly, Albanese, Trolli and Black Forest. The amount of gummy bears being produced and\nsold is astonishing. In 2017, Haribo announced plans to open its\nfirst U.S. factory in Wisconsin. According to the Seattle Times, Haribo said\nit will create 400 new jobs, adding to the existing 7,000 people Haribo employed worldwide\nat the time - all working to produce 100 million gummy bears daily. The introduction of the new factory was in\nresponse to the ridiculous growth the candy industry had seen in gummy bear popularity. According to Quartz, U.S. sales of gummy bears\nfor Haribo alone from 2011 to 2017 had increased to $115 million. Not bad for a little bear from Germany.

make elderberry syrup which is high in antioxidants great immune boosting properties and just overall really great health benefits so this week we're going to be doing a recipe using that elderberry syrup and we're going to be making some immune boosting elderberry gummy bears for the kids take your one cup of elderberry syrup put it in your pot and turn it on medium heat once that starts to warm and you can feel the temperature change in the liquid you can go ahead and actually turn this off you don't want it to come to a rolling boil it's going to take that much longer for them to set up [Music] because it's only one cup of liquid it usually heats up pretty quickly so there's a couple variations that you can do for this recipe so you can just use your elderberry syrup that you made last week and add your gelatin in and put it in your mold and that's totally fine for me personally i like to add the gelatin a few drops of my young living thieves because this really has a lot of health benefits to it as well and an eighth of a cup of honey just to make them a little extra sweet so again i'll have both variations written over on the blog so you can decide which ones you want to make so now that your elderberry syrup is simmering you can either add your essential oils if you're going to use some if not that's fine too then you're going to take a quarter cup of beef gelatin now this is grass-fed organic unflavored beef gelatin if you're vegan you can also use a vegan gelatin and that will work just as well so you're going to slowly add that to your pan and just continue to stir so after your mixture started to thicken up a little bit at this point you could add your eighth of a cup of raw honey you'll want to stir that up until your honey is completely dissolved if you're adding honey so now that all the liquid is blended together it's time to add the liquid into our gummy bear molds so these particular molds i purchased on amazon they came in a set of two and they also came with this dropper now you don't need a dropper to fill your gummy bear molds but i did find that it made the process a lot faster a lot cleaner and a lot easier if you don't have one of these you can use an old like medicine dropper from a kid's prescription or a kids medication that you purchased over the counter droppers are just really handy to get these molds filled so if the molds you have at home you find you're having issues getting your gummy bears out of you can take a ghee cooking spray or a coconut spray and you can spray in the molds and that should make it a lot easier to pop them out these particular ones i've never had issues getting them out they always come out really clean so now you're just gonna take your liquid and you're gonna start filling up your mold so another good thing to do if you're intending on putting these directly into the refrigerator is to do this on top of a cookie sheet you don't want to have this really warm liquid in your gummy bear mold and trying to pick this up to put it in your fridge that could also get really messy so putting it on a cookie sheet will help luckily these set up really quickly so just having them out on your counter for about five to ten minutes after you put all the liquid in your mold will help set it up before you put it in your fridge so once you remove your mold from the refrigerator this one has been sitting for about 30 minutes it's time to pop out the gummy bears i like to store mine in mason jars with lids and just keep them in the refrigerator and then in the mornings my kids usually remind me to get out their elderberry gummies so i have elderberry gummies here and then i've also made a batch of ningxia gummy bears and my kids love them both so these pop out super easy do so again check the description box down below i will have a list of all the things that i used here today and where you can find them as well as substitutions for the beef gelatin if you want a recipe card you can head over to the blog and print that out i will also have a couple different variations for this recipe over there that you can have as well i hope you guys have a wonderful weekend and i'll see you next time", "1EtbenDg0YM": "Oh again everybody and welcome back to the channel in today's video I'm gonna be sharing my super simple gummi recipe but first if you wouldn't mind hit that subscribe button if you are new here to the channel and if you already have subscribed thank you very much and if you wouldn't mind please give the video a big thumbs up to show your support so today guys I gotta tell you to get to this point to share this recipe with you has been a long road by far this gummy recipe has taken me the longest to develop in the kitchen I have tried everything under the Sun on the internet to make gummies and believe it or not the simplest of recipes is the best and easiest way to make gummies at home now today I am just going to be showing you my plain-jane gummi recipe if you are interested in infusing those gummies I encourage you to check out my video on infusing gummies and I can leave that link in the description below go ahead and check it out but for today this is just a three ingredient gummy recipe that you can make at home now the cool thing about gummies is that you can buy molds on Amazon for anything you can have Star Wars gummies you can have worms you can have bears you can have anything you want it's a really just a family fun event that you can make in the kitchen and it shouldn't be that complicated one of my biggest critiques of the internet on these recipes was why is everybody making it out to seem so complicated it's not it really is not three ingredients go to your local grocery store and you can find them and I'm gonna show you when we get into the kitchen and you could have gummies within an hour this whole recipe takes about 15 minutes total it's crazy easy but I gotta say to get to this point I did a lot of convoluted recipes with bloomin and cooking and God it was just awful it was awful everybody had a different take on how to get to that point where it was a nice gummy and it's just not that hard guys I hate to break it to you it's not that hard whoever is making these recipes make him seem hard I got to assume Heather don't know what they're doing in the kitchen or they're really just trying a roundabout way to make it seem harder than it is so that most people don't do it which you know it is what it is but today I'm gonna share with you the easy 15-minute three ingredient gummi recipe that you can have and share share along with all your other friends and then again guys if you want to infuse them go ahead and check out that video I'll leave that link in the description below so let's jump into the kitchen let me show you what we're doing in there and then let's start making some gummies alright folks before we get started on today's recipe I want to make sure that you have everything you need to get started so first you will need a small stove pot a Pyrex measuring cup definitely highly recommend the Pyrex measuring cup a fork for mixing and of course gummy molds and a big thank you to magical for sending these gummy molds so the ingredients are as follows and these are the three simple ingredients unflavored gelatin flavored gelatin and fruit juice now with the fruit juice you want to make sure that it's refrigerated you want it to be at a cold temperature and that's key for this recipe so the first thing we're going to do is we are going to measure out our fridges and that's going to be 1/3 of a cup so that's right about there sorry for the mess there let me clean that up ok so now that you have your 1/3 cup of fruit juice and in this case we have pineapple fruit juice now it's not from concentrate and I think that makes a big deal I did experiment with concentrate and it just doesn't come out as well it's not as flavorful it's still gels fine but the flavor isn't there but the next thing you'll need is one package grams of just unflavored gelatin and so once you add that you want to mix it around now you can use a spoon I just prefer for cuz I feel like it breaks it up a little bit better and you want to make sure that most of the chunks of the gelatin are out and this is very key all right so now that that's mixed around I'll bring it up to you and show you there's no chunks in it all the gelatin is dissolved now you're gonna take your flavored three ounce gelatin and put it in there now in this case guys this flavor is just one of the flavors I like I like the orange pineapple it gives it that very tropical flavor and you can mix and match with fruit juices and flavors this is just one that I really like and so as you can see it's starting to dissolve and get going so now we need to let this sit for 10 minutes okay so we just let it sit for 10 minutes and while that's going on what I like to do is put water in the pot and get that up to temperature so when this is done we can get it right into the pot so right now I'm gonna go fill this with water and get it up to temperature meanwhile this has to sit for 10 minutes so I'll see you guys in 10 minutes all right folks welcome back it has been 10 minutes our timer has gone off and so right now this is the blooming stage of the gelatin so now that that's all set our water is nice and warm we're going to lower this into the water and we're going to mix it around now this process takes about anywhere between three to eight minutes depends on how hot your water is you don't want to boil it you just want hot water now you could microwave this for like two to three minutes and then bring it out but the last thing you want to do is burn the gelatin it will not come out correctly I have tried it in the microwave it is super simple but you have to be very careful so you have to check it about every 30 to 45 seconds once it gets past a minute thirty because every microwave is different so that's why I like the stove but feel free I will leave the instructions on how to use a microwave in the description below so for the next three to eight minutes depending on how hot my water was when I put it in there I'm gonna wait for this to get ready and meantime make sure that your molds are clean and ready to go so I will see you in a few minutes and again guys if you're looking to use the microwave I'll leave those instructions in the description below so I'll see you in a few minutes all right folks so it's been about three minutes and the gelatin is now a very liquid consistency now this is really what you want you don't want to really boil it or do anything like that you just want it in a nice liquid form and this is why the Pyrex is so important because you can put it directly in to warm boiling type water on the stove without having to worry about any issue so that's why I say folks that you really want to use the Pyrex measuring cup again you can put it in the microwave I just you know don't prefer it and I don't really like and I really don't like giving instructions on using a microwave because everybody's microwave is so different with the wattage and stuff and how powerful it is so that's why I lean towards using the stove now as you saw guys in the time-lapse video I added a cutting board and the cutting board is just so it's less mess it's not necessarily required but it definitely creates less of a mess when you go to bring it into the fridge so this looks like it's all ready to go so I'm going to turn our stove off here and I'm going to pick up our bottle and we'll just dry off the bottom real quick so that no water leaks in to our mold next thing I'm going to do is I'm just gonna pour all the molds it's as simple as that so I'm gonna pour these and then we'll go have it set in the fridge all right folks so now I'm just gonna have these go into the fridge and sit for about an hour meanwhile while that's occurring you're gonna want to make sure that you wash out this Pyrex it will become extremely sticky so you're gonna want to make sure that you rinse this out and get all that gelatin out of the Pyrex disk so you can reuse it and it's not a pain to wash so I'm gonna go to let these sit in the refrigerator for about an hour and then I'm gonna show you the final product so I've taken the gummies out of the fridge and I popped a few out of the molds to show you here they are they look great you know some of them have this like like a bubbly back that's normal you can cut that off if you really want just for presentation purposes but overall to get that you have to just get rid of that bubbles you have to just kind of like take a spoon over it just to take the bubbles off of it but I didn't really do that for this process these are for my own personal consumption yeah they pop out of the molds really easy you just go like that and off they come so yeah real easy recipe these were in the fridge a lot longer than I normally do is I just got busy here at the house and you know forgot about them so they were in there for about 12 hours you don't have to leave them in any longer than two hours but for this time we just you know left them in the fridge I had got busy but if you guys have any questions about this recipe feel free to leave a comment below or send me an email on that information will be in the description below and as always folks you can find me on Instagram and Facebook those links will be in the description below also and I really hope you enjoyed this recipe but until next time take care and I will see you in another video", "t2Pd-13M20g": "- I'm cosplaying as a gummy bear! (beep) (classical music) All right friends, Halloween is just around the corner and I have some issues with Halloween. First and foremost, a lot of gummy candies, which is like my favorite thing, are not vegan! I still think it's weird that strangers are giving out candy to children. So, (laughs) I wanted to see if I could make my own vegan version of gummy bears at home. Flip It is a series on my\nchannel where I take one thing, and make it into the vegan thing. So I'm going to take gummy bears today, substitute out the gelatin, which is not vegan, and substitute in agar agar, which is. (claps) So let's see if we\ncan make vegan gummy bears. (whirring) (pouring) (mellow electronic music) All right, what is agar agar you may ask? It is a seaweed or an algae. It has a little bit of a taste, but not much, it's very mild. But it acts the same way\ngelatin does, almost 100%. The only real difference is that it doesn't quite get as hard\nas traditional gummy bears, which is fine, they're just gummies that\nare a little bit softer. We are going to naturally sweeten them and also naturally color them. We're going to make a blue-purple color, we're going to make an\norange flavor and color, and we're going to make green ones. And I'm going to use\nspinach to turn it green. I'm going to use an\norange to make it orange; and taste like orange. And I'm going to use\nblueberries to make them purple. If you guys are new here, I'm Candace the Edgy Veg, and you should hit that subscribe button 'cause I make new videos every single Tuesdays and Thursdays. And if you like this series, give this video a big thumbs up 'cause you know it's gonna rock! Also appropriate that this\nis my Halloween video, that I have a new hair color. Oh, if you guys want to know where to get these\nlittle gummy bear molds, and then I not only have gummy bear molds, but also little bears and little robots and little dinosaurs. I'll leave a link to the\nAmazon thing that I used, just in the description box. Well, this comes with a dropper. All right, to make these\nas super, super simple, depending on the flavor\ncombinations that you want, and the color combinations that you want, really the possibilities are endless. What I like to use is just apple juice. It has a pretty neutral flavor. But you can use any sort of\njuice that's your favorite to achieve different flavors. Another think that I am going to do is just color them naturally as well, by blending different ingredients to get the color that I want. So if you want like red, you can use beets. If you want purple, you can use blueberries. So all I'm going to do is\ntake the apple juice... You could also do this if you want cocktail gummy bears. You can do this with wine as well. I've done ros\u00e9 ones, they're so good. But you just wanna blend whatever\nyou're using for the color together with your liquid. So whether it's water, whether it's apple juice, orange juice, wine, blend that together in a blender and add it to a small sauce pan. Bring that liquid to a simmer and add in your agar agar and give it a good whisk. Now you can taste it here\nto see if it's sweet enough. If you want to add extra sweetness, add some agave in there\nuntil it's dissolved. This will also make it\na little bit chewier, making it closer to the texture\nof traditional gummy bears. I find between maple syrup, agave, and regular sugar, the regular sugar sets the most naturally. It does get a little bit chewier than the agave or the maple syrup. I opted out of maple syrup just because you're always\ngoing to have that maple taste. Sugar and agave are a bit more neutral. All right, so I brought these to a simmer and then let them simmer\nwhile stirring constantly for about three minutes. And now I'm going to take\nmy little eye dropper and fill in my bears, my gummy bears. These are like little piggies. I thought they were\npiggies when I bought them, but they're little panda bears, gummy bears and robots. So the green is looking a\nlittle darker than I would like. I would prefer it to be more vibrant. I think you could probably mix in a little bit of spirulina but I just picked something that was more neutral like spinach, spirulina does have a taste. But the cooking and oxidization\ndefinitely made it brown. So I'm just going to take my dropper and then fill in the little molds. (mellow electronic music) All right, so I'm sticking\nthem into the fridge. I popped up a couple just to test them. I have some here, some up here. My freezer's pretty full, so I also stuck some in the fridge, but I'm going to let them set. Now a lot of websites\nsay just 10-15 minutes. I'm gonna leave it for a\ncouple hours and come back. (classical music) All right, I've popped\na couple of them out. Look at that little guy. A little teddy bear. I mean obviously this\nis a tiny little mold, but you can get bigger ones. Like I said before, the texture is different\nthan a gummy bear, it doesn't have that\nsqueaky gummy chewiness, it's a little bit softer. But they're really tasty. I was thinking, if you wanted to do sour versions, you could probably add\nsome Vitamin C powder or citric acid powder, which is just Vitamin C, and then you get that tang.

Bye.", "e7oO5yGHo_I": "hey guys welcome back to my channel as promised I'm coming to you today to deliver the keto gummies and if you are not subscribed to my channel please subscribe and leave me a comment thumbs up on the video if you like it and if you want to see the keto gummy recipe this please stay tuned [Music] okay guys back with the recipe for keto gummies I have all of my stuff right here I'm going to read you the recipe I'm going to show you what I have and then we'll get on with it so basically the recipe says one small box of sugar-free jell-o one packet of gelatin powder and 1/4 cup of water okay and so I'm going to show you exactly what I have here ignore the washer in the background if you hear it I'm going to make four different kinds of gummies of gummy bears and whatever I can but I'm going to show you what time I have I have a these are all kroger brand no they're not all kroger brand okay I have a Kroger sugar-free raspberry okay so we'll have raspberry gummies I have a Kroger sugar-free orange orange gummies I have a jello brand sugar-free lemon and I have a kroger brand sugar-free strawberry oh I have five cards actually I may omit one I'm not sure important make four different cons I like different colors so I may take out this strawberry and then I have kroger brand sugar-free line so I'll probably do a lime a lemon orange and I think I'll do strawberry and I'll take out the raspberry okay there's that and then what I have here this is the unflavored gelatin and a Kroger brand there's four packs to a box they look like this I have one more pack right here and then I have a whole new box so I'll be using that okay so I'm going to show you my molds I've got a little bit of a collection here these are for when I make keto fat bombs always use these they're small so they're not too big when it comes to the fat bomb so I'm just going to put those to the side because I won't be using those okay these let me start with these right here and these are just these tiny tiny gummies okay they're real small and I have a blue one orange one and a green one in these I've ordered all of this stuff gummy stuff off of Amazon okay now these are right here I'm ordering off Amazon these gummy bears are much bigger as you can see they're about twice the size probably and then they also have some gummy worms in there so those are cute so I have two of the sheets of those okay I've got some more things in here but they're more for fat bombs too like I have a jack-o-lantern then I have the little spoons these are fat bomber related so I'm just gonna leave those in here what I will need though these droppers these are what you use to suck up the jello in here and then it's so much easier to just get the jello in the little molds with these so also I got these right here at Dollar Tree okay it says they're ice cube trays they're pretty I don't know if I want to use them I'll make you like a test on one or two of these because they are kind of I mean they're not as these are here like really as you can see they're really and it's easy to pop the gummies out these are still you know there's still pliable but I don't know how good a gummy would pop out of these so I may try like one flamingo and then next time I make them on there if I like them or not so if if they don't work good for that I'll just use them as ice cube trays they are adorable so okay so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna get 1/4 of a cup of water it ready and we'll get it in my pan I'm gonna change my camera angle and then we'll take it from there so I'll be right back okay guys I'm just put a fourth of a cup of water in here I've got the Stowe bottle on and I'm going to start out with orange so I'm gonna make this packet of orange jell-o in here okay pan quite big actually and then I'm gonna need this pocket a regular jello in here okay so what I'm gonna do is get these stirred up okay so I knocked my tripod over okay so hope you can see this yeah I'm getting this going it says to stir it says it'll thicken up a bit but the end whenever everything gets dissolved it will get thinner so that's what I'm going to do okay I got it up on half probably not the best idea in the world especially since this pans a little big anyway this is okay so yeah it does seem a little thick right now I've made this before it's been a while I can't really really remember I made it in a smaller pot though so play the better I'll be able to so sorry if you hear background noise okay it's almost there I just have to do it for just like a couple of minutes trying to get all this down through here I don't know why I grabbed this big of a pan I think I'll switch out forever for the rest of this what I'm gonna do though is I'm gonna go ahead and get all of the jello ready and in a bowl and then I just don't know how I feel about this we'll see we'll see how this one turns out just because I don't know it's thick it seems really thick I don't remember it being that thick before so I'm just trying to make sure everything is dissolved it looks like it is so what I'll do is get this poured in a bowl and what I'm gonna do is put you on pause but I will be back when I have all four jell-o's made and sitting with my molds so I can show you how I'll fill them up and everything okay so I'm gonna put you on pause I'll be back with the jello in the bowls okay guys I'm back what I've done is went ahead and made the red and the orange and I want to fill I'm gonna fill these up and then I'll show you and then I'll go ahead and make the green and the yellow and then we'll do those next so I'm just going to have a variety so what I'll do is I'll produce insert some background music here and I'm just going to go ahead and fill these up without talking [Music] okay guys I made ultimate mistake there of not putting the gummy container here on a like a cookie sheet or something like that but this right here worked good I did not spill any if you just have like one of these little cutting container thing or cutting boards you can slide it right under if you forget like I did and just get it on the cookie sheet so what I'm going to do is go ahead and get another cookie sheet because I feel like I'm gonna need one more mold so I'm gonna get that one on the cookie sheet first and especially since I'm gonna do one tester of those so I'm up high just do like this one right here so I'll be right back okay guys I'm back I have made the lemon jello I have it ready for the molds I've made the lime jello also ready for the molds so what I'm going to do I got these I got this on a pan cuz I know I'm gonna need some more of these and I've got the Flamingo there so I can do the test one so what I'm gonna do is I'll probably put some background music on and just be quiet while I'm filling these up [Music] okay guys I have got everything filled up now so what I'm going to do is get everything in the refrigerator and when everything is nice and set I'll be back to show you how I get the mole or get the gummi bears out of the molds one thing I want to say is whenever you are filling up the molds the less bubbles that you have the better if I had a toothpick I prayed pop some of those bubbles I'm just gonna see if I can get some of these bubbles pop because it's just better if you don't have any bubbles in there it's a couple of bubbles but not a whole lot actually not a whole lot at all so I'm just better if you can't if you don't have them so okay and what I did I didn't have enough Millan left so I did a lemon lung flamingo so we'll see how that turns out we'll see if I'm able to get it out or not so anyway I will be back to show you the finished product okay guys I am back and I think that these are ready to be popped out so hopefully they are so what I'm gonna do is to show you how to do it see here they are they're all in here so basically what you do is turn these things inside out just like that push them right up through there what I'm gonna do I'm putting them all on this plate this so I can get a really pretty thumbnail see how they pop out perfectly you can see wherever the camera is Yam they're adorable so my whole family is kind of excited I'll have a feeling I won't get too many of my keto gummies but that's alright that's alright I'm anxious to see how the Flamingo one is going to come out just to see if it comes out good I may make like another batch of just like regular not sugar-free gummies for the family and they're a little bit bigger I feel like they'd be pretty good doing all the little tiny ones first they come out super easy they're things almost clean when they get out so it doesn't take a whole lot of clean up after and you can see they're so pretty and colorful bad boys I can do the yellow ones next they come out super fast okay there's those okay let me get the yellows I did not spray these molds at all I feel like spraying them would probably give a strange flavor maybe I didn't spray them I do feel like you don't need to I mean I don't know what kind of molds I'll have to see when I get to the Flamingo but and you can see like if they have bubbles in them this is basically I mean you can see the bubbles but you're gonna eat them anyway it's not really a big deal so hopefully the worms will pop out good this is actually the first time I've used the worm molds so I thought it'd be cool all right there's all of those go ahead I'm gonna go with for the worms first here's all of these so let's just see oh look at there pop boop boop you didn't fall on the floor thank goodness okay there's the worm I'm gonna put them around the edges there okay there's the yellow worm okay the swarms kind of attached to the other worm there's the red worm the strawberry worm and then we have our orange worm that came out perfect and glide about that now these gummy bears are a little bit bigger as you can see this facade of the other ones the size difference they're not too much but I made a row of all of those different colors well do the tops one thought I saw one go fine come on have a really pretty thumbnail with all these on here and then I got this jar here at Dollar Tree has a really nice tight fitting lid so I think I'm just gonna keep them in there usually I use like a mason jar with a lid so I don't know I may do the mason jar put a picture at the end on whatever I decide however I decided to store them after every all the family members get to get a try them they're not getting all of them them because they're not kedo i buy in my bag of gummy bears right right right right jack right okay so there's all of those that I'm gonna go for the single flamingos let's see here we go okay okay not good check it out came out excellent so what I'll probably do is just make a little put him down there let's just make a little a hopeful meet and try a flamingos my pregnant to use a couple boxes of jello just all in the same color maybe maybe that raspberry and then just make these because I do have one more well I only have one more pack of the unflavored gelatin anyway here are the Quito gummies adorable hope you enjoyed this video if you liked it please give me a thumbs up please subscribe to my channel if you want to see more videos like this and leave me a comment if you are going to make some of these bad boys there's a whole bunch of different flavorings you can use if you choose to use like the unsweetened jello and stuff like that so yeah like and you can use even T to make to make it my not sure how to do that I haven't done it before I'd like to try anyway why didn't answer okay guys thank you for watching I'm gonna put a video up picture up at the end on how I ended up storing these so thank you for watching", "pptDV899P6E": "feed your students craving for understanding ways with the colorful gummy bear wave machine with simple and inexpensive materials this I catch and demonstration is great for the classroom all you will need is duct tape bamboo skewers ring stands clamps and of course some gummy bears use ring sense to elevate the tape and keep the setup Bridget be sure the tape is quite tense next place the skewers with gummy bears at roughly even intervals across the tape get your wave machine moving with a single pulse like this we can observe the propagation moving down the Machine due to the energy we insert by pushing down on the tape the gummy bears add mass to the system and slow the motion down so it is easy to observe show your students how waves reflect at fixed ends and even simulate the change in speed of a wave as they propagate through different indices of refraction have fun with this activity and let us know if you have any questions or any fun activity ideas we love hearing from you you", "LMD5aAC9wAk": "hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is liz if this is the first time you're joining you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much i really do appreciate your support i really do mean that i love you guys so today i'm going to show you how to do the sour version of a gummy uh gummy candy so this has got includes the gelatin and a cooked syrup candy syrup you combine them and we then apply the sugar sweet and sour sugar right afterwards so we don't have to wait for it uh to dry uh or to figure out when we need to add it we add it right afterwards and um all right so i'll just get right started we'll get into the ingredients the equipment that you're gonna need and then how to put everything together all right well thank you so much for joining and i hope you enjoy the video okay so this recipe is done in two stages well technically three because we cook in two different stages and then we combine everything so for the first gelatin for the jello half you're going to need three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of your favorite jello flavor a quarter cup of light corn syrup a half a teaspoon of citric acid a half teaspoon of gour gum and a quarter of a cup to a third of a cup of your can of butter and for the liquid you're going to need um a quarter cup that we're going to heat up to boiling and then a half cup that we're going to be using to bloom our gelatin and you can use any liquids that you like i like to use these um kool-aid or the kool-aid jammers these ones are good because they're a water-based and they're clear so you don't have to contend with color and they're also half the sugar so again you're not going to it helps cut back on the sugar since we got a whole ton of it in it that totally up to you though you want to definitely stick to a clear type liquid those powerades if you like those type of things those vitamin waters if you like them i don't like them they do not add the greatest of taste but if you do add juices like with it have real fruit juice in it then you're going to want to use a mold inhibitor because mold will develop very quickly and if you want to add additional colors or flavors uh we can do that i'm going to be adding 2d fruity and so i'm going to kind of make it pink and purpley i don't know tutti frutti colors and if you want to have a nice solid uh background you're going to need white food coloring so that's for the gelatin part the jello side gelatin side for the cooked candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar a half a cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water so for the equipment that you're going to need you're going to need a double boiler so you can use any pot and metal bowl i like to try and use a thicker thicker metal so that it doesn't get too hot you're going to want something to disperse your candy i love using these bottles they work great and they've got the piping tip which makes it really nice or you can use an eyedropper now this recipe is a little bit thicker so i'm not sure how well an eyedropper is going to work with it you're also going to need an oops timber you're also going to need a smaller pot for your sugar syrup and a candy thermometer two spatulas you're also going to need a hand blender and if you're going to be splitting your syrup either by doing different colors or flavors you're going to need a measuring cup to split that out if you're just doing all one you don't need that or in in lieu of a hand blender you can use whisk in a very strong forearm so the first thing that we want to do is we are going to bloom our gelatin and we are going to heat up that other quarter cup um you may need a little bit more liquid if you do you can just add it in later on if needed so we're going to heat this up in the microwave for about a minute and 20 seconds and we're going to sprinkle three tablespoons of gelatin unflavored gelatin onto our half a cup of liquid you want to kind of evenly spread it and then you're going to mix it in so that it is thoroughly mixed and that there are no lumps so you want it to kind of look like light up you want to look like applesauce and then you're going to just set that aside for five minutes and we're gonna add our boiling liquid to our jello mix and you're gonna stir that oh and you're gonna start you're gonna put your heat on to the lowest setting we just want our water to get hot we don't want it boiling gelatin melts at just hot water so we just want a hot water bath and we're going to stir that in and we're going to add in our corn syrup that's our quarter cup of corn syrup and we're just going to stir oh sorry and we're going to add in our half teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to stir that i said until it's dissolved it takes about five five six minutes or so for all of that to melt and in order to get this stuck gelatin off the side you can use some very hot water and a brush and it'll just you can wash that off otherwise if you don't it won't it doesn't melt and then it you'll get bits and stuff in your jello then you also want to make sure when you're stirring is to rub your spatula across the bottom because the sugar and the gelatin can stick to it and you don't want that so you want to make sure you'll feel it you can feel it smooth on the bottom if there's stuff stuck you'll feel it kind of rough you just kind of want to work it off scrape it off then once your gelatin or sorry your jello is fully melted we're gonna add in the gelatin and what i do is i just kind of cut it up into smaller pieces just like this and just in she goes and you're just gonna gently stir that until it's melted and if your water is hot now if the um your pots nice and hot you can turn off the heat you don't gelatin required doesn't require much heat at all to melt and if it gets too hot the gelatin will break which means it's not going to have that it's not going to your candies aren't going to set that well and the sign that you'll know that it's too hot is if you start to see white foaming stuff white foamy stuff happening on the top of your mixture here on your syrup now that everything is melted we are going to add in the can of butter and our gour gum and the reason that we have to use gour gum is it is an emulsifier and it is going to allow your oil and your your water to come together as one as one liquid versus being oil and water you know don't mix together an emulsifier allows them to come together as one solid solidified unit in short it basically mushes the oil and the water together to live happily we're going to pour in the our can of butter and i've used a third of a cup so as you can see adding you're adding the can of butter or oil to our gelatin you can mix and mix and mix until the cows come home no matter what those two are never going to blend together now you might get the appearance if you kind of whisk really really quickly you have the appearance that it's combined right that kind of looks like that's all combined however if you go and you set that and if you want to set that up now all of the butter would raise to the top of the mold now if you've got one of these little strainers or a strainer it's great for doing the guru so we're going to use a half a teaspoon of gargum and you're going to gently sprinkle evenly sprinkle it over the top if you don't have a strainer you just want to make sure to try and get it evenly over the top there this will adhere to the oil and allow it to mix in with our with the jello and i'm going to let that sit for a minute and now we're going to get our trusty hand blender [Music] and you'll continue to mix that until it is completely all one color all one unified color you don't see any kind of streaking or any kind of any difference whatsoever that's when you know it it is fully blended and emulsified and you're gonna be how about that texture and once that's done we're just going to let that set to set aside and leave it on the hot water but turn off the heat and then we're going to do our candy syrup all right so for our candy syrup we're going so for the candy syrup you want one cup of sugar a half a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water you're gonna mix that together until it is blend till it's all mixed up and your sugar starting to dissolve and we're going to turn the heat on to medium-high and you're going to stir the syrup until it begins to boil so as soon as it starts to boil then you are going to stop stirring that's when we add the candy thermometer and we don't stir it again and then you're also going to want to grab a jar of hot water about whatever something of hot water and a brush so you can wash down the sugar crystals off of the side and that'll prevent your syrup from crystallizing once it begins to boil there we're going to add our candy thermometer i'm going to try to add the candy thermometer now if you ever wonder why i kind of have this weird looking thing the one that i have said it setting on it that thermometer doesn't always work for me it occasionally will fail um this i like the digital but the digital um doesn't have any way of holding on to it it's more meant for just kind of sticking it into checking a temperature and then i have to use the tin foil to protect the digital from the heat so that's why i kind of have this weird makeshift candy thermometer and we're going to cook this syrup to 208 280 degrees soft crack now you can go a little bit if you want your candies a little less chewy you can go a few degrees less you can go to about 275. if you want them a lot chewier then you can go to 300. i seem to find the 280 is perfect for it well for what my liking anyway so we're going to continue to cook that syrup until 280 degrees just remember to wash down any crystal any sugar crystals that may form on the sides just to let you know you're doing this at the medium high it will go fairly quickly so don't leave the kitchen normally you do the sugars at a lower temperature so you have a little bit of time this doing it at the higher temperature it will go very quickly so i'm traveling you don't leave your kitchen and then you also want to get a pot of just cold water or a bowl of cold cold water stand by uh we're gonna put the bottom of the pot in that to stop the syrup the cooking process so we're at 276 270 see how quickly it starts to go 278 279 280 leave the candy thermometer on because we want to bring this temperature down to 240. you can turn your heat off leave it in the water until the temperature starts coming down and then we're just going to set it on the side here until that temperature comes down to 240. so once your temperature comes down you can remove the candy thermometer and we're going to add in ow be careful the syrup is still very very hot you're going to get your gelatin mixture and you're going to have a look and you're going to make sure that you don't see any green or anybody butter separation now you might see a little bit of cut like see how that color there difference that suggests your jello that the air is coming out of so don't worry about that what you care is if you see any kind of green or oily looking so that's good we're going to pour this into this candy syrup and be very careful when you're stirring this now your gelatin is going to be a lot more liquidier than the liquid liquid ear i know i come up with my own words uh then the candy syrup is going to be thicker it's also going to start to solidify as you can see on the spoon that's why you're going to gently stir it and we're going to turn the heat on to bury it to the lowest temperature and you want to make sure to take your spatula and go all the way around the edges the syrup will has a tendency to stick along those edges see so i like to use the hand blender whoops to make sure that everything is fully uh mixed together and blended and emulsified [Music] and then you're just going to gently stir to make sure that it's all nicely mixed so now at this point is when we're going to add in our flavor and additional colors if you like or as i said if you want if you're not doing that you can just go ahead and put this into your bottles right now and get ready to distribute into the molds so i'm going to be adding one of my newest favorite flavors tutti frutti love this flavor i usually use about a cup and a half and again you just want to gently get that all mixed in now if you are going to be splitting uh if you want to do two different colors this is this point you're going to put it to the transferred over to your measuring cup and split it in half or if you wanted to do two different flavors then do that before split it in half add your different flavors but i'm just doing one flavor base two colors okay so i have got now whenever you look at a um a measuring cup always look at it straight on get down at the level and look at it straight on if you look at it from a down level you see you don't get an accurate reading that looks like two and a quarter cups however it's more like two and a third cups so for this one i'm going to do i'm gonna add some more red and i like to use the no taste red i hate the taste of red dye i can always taste it and everything so i like the no taste red the one thing about it however is it doesn't have quite the intensity of red that the regular does but i'd rather forsake a little bit of the intensity on the color versus the intensity on the flavor there we go that's a nice red and the other side i'm going to do purple i'm going to add in some pink i want a more pinky purple versus a dark purple and a couple drops of blue now mix that up see what we get now right now because we did i didn't add the white into it and it looks like it's a solid color it's actually it'll come out kind of still a little bit translucent so if you want to get a solid background and that it's not going to lighten up or get that kind of clear or translucent look you want that solid opaque then you need to add in the white so i'm going to add a couple drops into white on both sides so we have here when we add in the white it's going to dull down our color a little bit so that i'm just going to add in a little bit more of the red and add a little bit more to the purple purple i think i'm gonna leave i like that color but the red i wanna looks kind of orangey and see how much nicer that color is now it's a lot richer and gives you more that solid background makes it opaque versus having that translucent look to it and now i'm just going to get ready to pour it in the bottles and distribute it into the molds all right so now we're ready to distribute into the molds and you can go do half and halves now don't fill up your mold all the way to the top if you do it ends up leaving a sharp edge on your candy that dries out and it doesn't make your candies very pleasant so don't fill them all the way up to the top and it's also when you're trying to pour try and keep it to the middle and just let it distribute it out once you have your mold set up while all filled up you put it into the fridge for uh two hours sometimes it may take a little bit longer basically two hours or until they're set all right so it's been a couple of hours and our candies are ready to come out of the molds and we're gonna make up our sugar sour mix so you're going to add one cup of sugar and to that you're going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid cut it and you want to make sure to thoroughly mix that in so you're going to get even citric acid on everything not just get like a big hunk of it on one candy that's kind of gross so you want to make sure to thoroughly mix it in now the nice thing with this recipe is as soon as we take them out of the molds we're going to put them right into the sugar this sugar mix you don't have to worry about waiting for them to dry or partially dry before we can add it and the reason for that is citric acid is water soluble so when you do the other gummy recipe when you just take them out they're still wet and gummy bears are essentially water and gelatin so as soon as there's any moisture on them the citric acid will begin will automatically begin to melt it doesn't do it on this because you have the sugar coating or the sugar candy syrup in there that helps protect the gelatin and that's why they don't melt as soon as you put it on and that's why this recipe is way better for doing sour or sugar coated candies now these guys are going to be a lot stickier than your regular gummy recipe so you just kind of pull it and they'll start to peel out and then you just work them out and then just pop them right into your sugar sour mix and as they warm up a bit uh they will start to get a little more tacky so no worries as long as you can pull them out of the molds they're good and they do stick to your fingers they do just kind of put it down into the sugar you can just kind of rub it in and it'll get them off that's nice once the your sugar or your sugar sour mix is on they no longer stick together see look at that and then you just put them on the rack to dry as per usual now what i like to do is i like to put holes in my parchment paper so that way you're getting air from both sides it helps with drying the other nice thing with this recipe is it doesn't take anywhere near as long for these to dry as the regular gummy recipes they're pretty much dry in a few hours to overnight now if they do start to get a little too warm and too hard to get out of the mold just put them back in the fridge for a little while if you actually keep a little bit of sugar on your fingers once they get a little bit sticky it'll help with them not sticking to your fingers a little aid with them coming off see if they stick they will fuse just pull them apart now if you're taking these out and they're just not coming out they're way too sticky um they're too gooey you can put them back in the fridge for a couple of hours or um and if you take them out and they're still not going to come out what you can do is uh put them in the freezer for about an hour take them out put them back in the double boiler on low re-melt them and add a half a tablespoon to one tablespoon of bloomed unflavored gelatin and that should add enough a little more gelatin there that'll fix that right up and if you find that they are too gummy oh sorry not if they're too gummy if they're too chewy they're like rubber bands again same thing just put them back on the double boiler on low remelt them and add a couple of tablespoons of um liquid to it and mix it all in until it's all melted recast them and that should take care of that problem if you've taken them out and there's um your butter is all risen to the back same thing just put them into the double boiler re-melt them add a little bit more gargum and re-emulsify make sure to use the hand blender or your whisk really really well like i showed you earlier so again if they're stuck like that uh check first to see just gently work around if they come away then you're good you can pull it out of the mold but if they're doing that they're not coming it's not coming away at all then they need to either go into the longer go into the fridge longer or to add some more gelatin to them they are a little bit more work but they are definitely worth it in texture and flavor in everything i've pretty much abandoned the other gummy bear recipe personally i just use this recipe now i'll just do either sugar coated or the sweet or the sugar and sour mix option is if um they are being really sticky um they are kind of coming out they're set but they're just really sticky um that can happen because it gets it picks up a little bit too much moisture in the refrigerator you can just let them sit in the molds for a couple of hours on the counter before taking them out that'll assist in drying that out a little bit now if you can stand your candies up it's a good idea some of them won't stand up though too small to whatever decides so if you can stand them up great if not you just want to flip them over every couple of hours until they're dry and as i said before this recipe and the drying time is it's a lot less time and that's it for them so just leave them out and enjoy some awesome sweet and sour gummy candies so that's my tutorial on sweet and sour gummy candies these are the little bad boys they haven't dried yet but you can see they're really nice they're little that little squishy now because they're still wet tastes awesome so i hope you give this recipe a try whether you want to do just sugar coated or the sugar sour it's a great recipe i'm sure that you'll love it if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments i'll always get back to you and i think that's everything i've got for you today well thank you so much for joining time diamond delight edibles wish i could get that straight um thank you for joining diamond delight edibles it's been a pleasure have a wonderful day [Music] you", "9byEOvA8-0w": "hello everyone we are back yet again with another week's review it is time for a week's mini review where we help you make sense of your dispensary and in these mini reviews we take smaller size edibles this is a 200 milligram edible and review them in a smaller format than traditional instead of our 30 6120 I just come back with you guys at two hours later and let you know how we're feeling so today we are reviewing something that we have never reviewed before a new brand this is from mcclenney confections quality you can taste and feel we shall see as you said this is a 200 milligram edible handcrafted cannabis nougat and caramel dark Belgian chocolate and it's the dark sneakers I guess kind of like Snickers except dum sounding all-natural ingredients whatever that means 1 to 8 servings we're just gonna have one serving and it says at the top the portions of a portion of donations go to animal shelters in need which is great ok it's got kind of this fancy plastic packaging just sort of unique I've never seen packaging like this for an edible nicely sort of floral rounders just got this odd plastic packaging let's open it up see how difficult is this it's not so bad inside maybe the slightest slightest hint of marijuana smell but nothing that's gonna get you busted that's for sure more of a dark chocolate aroma as it says but let's go to try okay and it's pretty good you can see the nougat and caramel inside there wow that is pretty tasty it tastes kind of like a dark chocolate Snickers bar without peanuts it's good it's very good um I'm eating it refrigerated so it's a little cruel but I like it that way I could get it and suggest you try it that way so in terms of taste Wow those consumed excuse me this gets high marks for taste but the proof is in how high this is gonna give me this this family at 200 milligrams only cost me I believe seven bucks is pretty affordable but we will check back with you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling thanks for watching Leakes hi guys I'm back it has been two hours since I had the dark sneakers chocolate bar from mcclenney confections I've really enjoyed it this bad boy only costs me six bucks maybe seven bucks can't remember exactly which but it's a hell of a value good tasting really enjoy the taste no discernible marijuana taste whatsoever I'm pretty quality chocolate I think and over two hours later I'm still feeling pretty stoned so if you see a dark sneakers at a dispensary near you go ahead and grab one you're not going to be disappointed thanks so much for watching wheats we'll check you guys out on the next review", "eAnRuqGXSsY": "okay okay what oh gee the dummy burrs not do gummy bears today let being covered chocolate I have these they never complain too much far enough back or another spacing good no no well it looks like the more vertical ones don't get stuck but they're all I mean if there's long as you keep them like straight forward yeah yeah I like that I like that one wow this is gonna be exciting video can max get it before they get eaten up Robert [Music] okay you could just someone's daily bread clusters right worst-case scenario down here on your dad toss you know he was like at the end of the bag or something and he just threw a hook and pull out of it to the chain like instead of line in my views they're like yeah we'll see what happens don't work you know if you want gummy bread clusters on the right yeah I guess listen see what what Craig's doing is more important than what you're doing so you know takes right yeah you know let me just Sunday to know we got a streaker so how come I haven't seen the blower on top in a while yeah do you guys not needing like in the beginning I remember yeah we we use it on Oreos like but most of the stuff does need the extra you know the extra push to get more drop it off yeah yeah and I'm sure the people at home but hey I don't care if I can't see the details I just want more chocolate yeah I was just gonna say I don't think anybody that's coming here is gonna complain yeah [Music] you reason against the clock - let me give you the lay down on their backs yeah this is flat on the back that makes sense how many times have you guys done this unmanned Rover before a couple time maybe turtle this is at least a second is it slightly less tedious doing it this way plus tedious we've been doing it by hand oh well it's a lot faster I'll tell ya yeah this board I mean still not really that fast is it just cuz there's so many yeah they're so like it'll still take you forever to do a whole bag yeah is that all one bag over there yeah that's okay awesome yeah they yeah it looks like line them up on the back is the way to go my dad you can do it it's suffereth we're getting there there I got to hurry up dummies thunk OH holy gummy well the gummies Batman so I haven't had gummy bears in many many many years so do each color have different flavors or they all taste the same yeah beacons can't eat bears yeah I think they're actually I think they have like gelatin in them or something oh yeah yeah I don't know jenos Swedish Fish well they're all red so it's probably won't taste red taste right yeah the red tastes a threat to me but the Scandinavian swimmers from Trader Joe's all the different tastes when Max get to it before it plops on the rug taste that was a close driveling drunkies very strong places like chocolate factories yeah that's how the old saying goes anyway yep can he do it has it ever actually fallen off yet yeah that's how I know how much time I have left yeah trial and error I just haven't been down here error and error yeah well how long has it been since it fell down it's been months okay so just in the beginning yeah it's good need adjusting the temperature dad [Music] [Music] to second they dumped abomination neck's is too thick I'm trying to lose weight right oh I was talking about like thick-headed I'll talk about thick-headed you know you could be like ethan klein thick all right so this is gonna be kelly's second bag ohh dummy bears yes yeah yeah you have any tips and tricks for people doing this Ellen well I don't really think many people are doing this at home hello are you I'm good you need any help let me know yeah because I don't think everybody would have proper equipment yeah we don't have the bags at home which I understand because I'm the new girl hmm so I understand that the orange scale is pretty famous I came over from the old country yeah so it's and it's it's very reliable so we like the orange ghetto and I can't imagine there's a lot of people who have machines to cover gummy bears but if they did if they did yeah then sure they should they could totally do this at home so you just pick them up to put them in the bag and blame on the scale all right pick them up and I put them in the bag and then I weigh them on this case in that order yeah yeah unless I'm really close because if you have all right let's let's add a few more do it okay so and you know I think that dark chocolate is lighter than milk chocolate hmm I think I've noticed that like one pound a one pound of dark chocolate is lighter than 1 pound of milk chef it no but if you're covering stuff I think it weighs different that make sense this is all in my head but that's ok ok so when it see then you got to be like oh we need one more it has to be accurate because nobody wants to get gypped on the chocolate mm-hmm that's not fun No so yeah I I got the dark chocolate ones and I have never tried chocolate-covered joiners gummy bears yeah I had before they weren't my favorite but some people are crazy about them right so what do you do what do you do after have you put them in the bags well after I get them wait because I'm really organized so I am like a system mm-hmm so what I do is I'll get a whole bunch together and then after that is I'm gonna weigh them when they're always on a label so should I come back when they're all waiting yeah and then we can like label them and state bloom and then barcode them and then we can get him on the Shelf that's totally fine sounds like fun what is this part 2 and part 3 part 3 we already know so this is part 3 and so what we do is we take the bag are you gonna get all the air out cuz nobody likes stale candy mm-hmm so get all the air out I'm gonna burping oh we burped the bag burps to being everybody and then we fold it nice and snug and then we have to put a label on mm-hmm see cuz presentation is everything how you determine which bag or which color goes on with bag well decision getting necessarily for color but you want a variety cuz nobody likes boring either yes we need a variety of colors and then we need to make sure that we have the right weight on it because if I put this out and I have the 4 ounce label then that's wrong we don't want to do that because you know it's the whole thing not corpse breathing down your neck that's right I mean like because then I'll get fired and I like just started here so I kind of wanna keep my job labeling is everything yeah you gotta have great label with the right weight and you gotta have it pretty and nice and snug because nobody likes that's a lot of things you're under all ones yeah needless to say I had no idea how much detail goes into being a candy wrapper yeah it's it's a little crazy and I also am just scratching the surface to what I'm going to learn yeah so Karen's teaching you the ways Karen is teaching me and your mom is teaching me so I am learning from the experts gotta get I've got to get it right because you know people are used to consistency too when you change something you don't you don't want them to be like aw I can tell Kelly wrap this in yeah and that would be my luck somebody wrap this wrong it doesn't look right I'll take Karen's handiwork we need to we need to repackage the whole thing alright so I know you're gonna keep doing that but can we show the people what you do next after that well then I got a barcode it okay so and oh yeah I have it right here oh boy so we have the dark chocolate gummy bears and half pound because we're doing a half pound and hey careful where you point that gun this yeah sorry all right where's Bowl see I hey that thing's loaded I haven't done anything today so I'm a pointer sorry no he's also had your thumb up - oh did look kind of like a guy yeah I'm not violent I promise I'm a non-violent individual I'm family candymaker that's right you know cuz candy makes people happy so why would you want to be violent mm-hmm so we're gonna paste I was wrong got a piece the barcode in there and do did you do gotta pick the right label and I gotta count how many bags because we don't want to waste labels or barcodes so I've got four five six seven 12 13 14 yup 14 bags those and we're gonna print out the labels so after all of these get packaged up all nice and pretty where you get the barcode on them and then we're gonna get best by dates that's my date yes it's not like the store see that's why I wasn't sure it is a sticker so we know that when you buy the candy it's fresh cuz you're gonna have fresh candy too so I'm gonna pull all of these I'm one have one perp cuz if I did that see any labels there are there would be no room by you might have Best Buy later so one of these I'll give you an example yeah what can you do that again case I missed it slow motion Wow I think people really got that in there and then we need Best Buy sticker but I don't know how long these last so I look that up too because everything that we have is different depending on what the product is dairy okay this is the only gun we use around here man all right so is that the last thing you do other than put it out there well no then I gotta write it on the handy-dandy clipboard so we know how many we have because then when we have the stuff we can put it online for the people mm-hmm and put on the shelf for the people so the people can come to all of the people and buy the candy and the chocolate-covered gummy bears which are ready yeah oh we're so where'd we put it out on the floor and they all have their little spots Olivia's gonna go here we've got our dark chocolate gummy bears and soon we'll have the four ounce and I think later I might be doing some of the milk chocolate gummy bears so that way we'll have these all back to replenish our stock from Christmas because everybody just loves us and just keeps buying it so yeah you know gotta get it out there for the people so it come to a very unfortunate decision this is gonna be our last shoutout video because there's so many shoutouts that people are requesting and we can't get to all of them so we feel really bad for the people who who asked and then never get it and they might be asking like 10 times but if we never see it we can't you know we can't do that shoutout because I used to answer every single comment and you see every single thing on every social media and then we got way too big I was a good thing I'm glad we're getting somebody comment so they can't get y'all I'm glad I'm glad we have so many people asked for shadows and we can't get to a mile but it's unfortunate for the people who are asking all the time so we're instead of leaving a couple people out or a lot of people out in the cold we're gonna leave everybody out in the cold warmer clime yeah so that's that's our solution to that problem it's gonna make the same thing for live streams just because when we do live streams everybody like almost everything will come and just ask them for a shoutout so if we were to do a live stream it would just basically just be us standing here just giving shoutouts and I think people want to see us making candy so if you do want to shout out if you do a super chat then we give you a shout out but other than that we'll we will just be answering questions and stuff for free so anyway to shout outs I have four four I have three ish okay is the an Alexander from Elizabeth New Jersey mm-hmm Keegan Graham from Lowell Massachusetts Carol and Leonard from Calgary Alberta Canada and Jennifer sinkovitz she didn't actually ask me for a shot up but she sent a note a thank-you note saying thanks for your YouTube channel I'm gonna subscriber I like it so there you go Jennifer and I'm not unasked-for shout out the way I'm ending this thing and I have a couple I have to take off my gloves so it's sanitary yeah I can't be touching ears I mean you can't take them off after using the camera to what you want clean candy-making okay it's just that hammer doesn't care about my camera they just care about the candy okay so Jules almond I think on how you say her name happy birthday to Kailyn Brown whose birthday was on December 5th yeah so we're telling you we're a little behind Angeline merger see from South Africa living in China and so she want me to say so that is all the the shoutouts for Hercules candy hope you enjoyed him yeah cuz it was good while it lasted this is the end my only friend hmm this is the end was that from a song I think the doors song probably yeah I'm sure our people will tell us probably [Music]", "db3sIVwDbUM": "- I feel like CBD is for people who do not have a weed plug, and can't afford a psychiatrist. (upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually. (chill beat)", "_XVNvnQLo44": "hey thanks for joining me today I want to show you how to make gummies a lot of people ask about hey do you have a gummy bear mold well essentially all of our chocolate molds are gummy bear mold so you can really make any shape that you want to so what I want to show you today is you're doing this from scratch we're not using a box mix of any sort so the powder gelatin that we have here at sweet wise is a really great deal because you can get a whole pound and then we're going to be using some of the sweet wise flavorings those are all natural and then the citric acid that we have here as well so the recipe is pretty basic I'm just going to use a cup of water and two-thirds of a cup of sugar and then I'm going to use four tablespoons of gelatin but before I get the rip to the rest of it like with the flavor and color and everything I want to give you a few tips on mixing this what I did I went ahead and did a cup of hot water with my sugar because when you pour the sugar into the cold water then it takes a little bit more time to dissolve that granulated sugar and you really you know want to dissolve that before you get to the gelatin it just makes it a little bit better so I went ahead and this hot water that I mixed with the sugar and I also went ahead and mix my color because let me show you this if you add the color I'm going to do red in this one just to show you the difference if you do the color in here then it can be kind of gloppy and it's a little bit hard to mix into cold water as well you have these little spots that don't mix as well so when I mix it with the hot water this is essentially the same thing with a different color okay so you can see how much clearer it is when I use hot water mix the color in and the sugar that's all I am right here 1 cup of water 2/3 cup of sugar and the coloring and then it's cooled back down to room temperature now we can add the gelatin and I've got 4 tablespoons of the sweet wise gelatin and I'm just going to go ahead and sprinkle this slowly on top and I'm not going to stir it quite yet I wanted to start absorbing all of that liquid and you'll notice that it starts to bloom is what it's called it starts to absorb that liquid over time and once that's all absorbed then we can melt it so that'll probably take a minute or two so we'll just leave that alone and come back to it okay so my gelatin is all dissolved so now I'm just going to add a teaspoon of the lemon flavoring now this is an actual lemon oil so if I was going to use like this cherry flavoring over here in the red I would probably want to do two teaspoons in that but the lemon is so much stronger I'm just going to do one teaspoon in that give it a little stir and then I'm going to take it over to the microwave should take about 20 seconds and then it will probably be ready all right so I'm going to check it give it a stir I think this needs a little bit more time I'm going to give it about another 15 seconds you want to make sure that you don't overdo it on the first round because you you can scorch some spots you don't want to do that so this is ready usually I have a lot more foam on the top and this this batch turned out really nice but what you want to do before you start using this is just kind of skim this off just kind of gather it off to the side and take a spoon then just kind of discard it off to the side that way you can have a nice clear gummy okay you don't have to have every single particle out of there but just having the bulk of it out really helps now you can pour it right out of here it has a nice funnel but that really only works well if you have a bigger cavity like this if you're doing something more finely detailed like these teddy bears or these little gems I really like to put it in a squeeze bottle so let me just go ahead and pour that in here and since it's nice and warm that'll go quickly if this does cool off you can pop it back in the microwave for 10 or 15 seconds and it'll be a lot more fluid again you may have a few little leaks in this but I wouldn't worry about that too much okay so let me show you about preparing these you really don't need to oil these or anything but it does help but come out a little bit more easily I'll show you an example these have not been oiled they sat at room temperature about 20 minutes this one was oiled and this one was not so you'll see I'm just gonna take a toothpick and I'm going to kind of start the edge and then get my finger under there and pull it out that one pops out really easily this one will come out easily but not as easily as the oiled one this one does have a little bit more shine to it if you'll notice but what I want to warn you about is if you do add like a spray in here and we just do one of these down here like a quick spray like this all these bubbles that are here we'll come out in the surface of the jello so you want to avoid that by just kind of brushing it around or maybe taking paper towel and get that excess out of there so just to show you how to fill these I want to fill this one just to the edge these bigger ones I pop in the fridge for like 20 minutes and they're fully set if you left it at room temperature I'm guessing this would be at least an hour these take about 20 minutes these little bitty cavities they take about 20 minutes at room temperature and then they pop right out and I'll show you one of these as well you see how easy that comes right out and then of course the rubber Ducky's it which is why I did the yellow with the lemon if you want to do that for a baby shower again this is a little bit bigger cavity so if you want to pop that in the fridge for about 20 minutes that would come out as well but you want to avoid like over filling these you can take like a bench scraper or something to clean that up but if it forms on there then it's just a little bit ugly and then you can always go back and trim it up with scissors but that's just more work so I just say use the squeeze bottle and make it a little bit easier on yourself one more tip if you want to make the sour is to use citric acid now this is very very strong so don't use it straight you're going to just really give somebody a heart attack I do like 5 or 6 parts of sugar just granulated sugar to one part of citric acid so if you're using a teaspoon measure I have two teaspoon measure whatever that's fine too but what I like to do so like these already done you can put this like in a little salt shaker if you want to but I don't like to sprinkle it right out of the container because it'll just be too heavy so just put a little bit in my hand and then I also don't sprinkle down close to the piece I'm doing it just kind of it sticks too much in little globules if you'll raise your hand a little bit higher and just kind of sprinkle from up high then it gives you a little bit more even coating and it's also not quite as strong as if you did it really really close so there's a really great easy way to make gummies you can make them the regular way or the sour way I really like that you can kind of customize your color if you do want to like for a baby shower for a wedding or for a birthday you can kind of make the colors and flavors work to your advantage rather than just buying something that's pre-made plus just having the custom shapes and different sizes people are really going to be impressed that you made these so give it a try thanks for watching have fun with it you", "AgJ_1UQlC3U": "[Music] my name is Liz this is the first time you're joining if you're a regular subscriber thank you so much and welcome back so today I'm going to be doing a sugar-free can of butter gummy candy recipe that's mouthful uh and so for all those people who diabetic or don't like sugar or on a healthier on a healthier version this is a healthier version of a gummy bear for you so I don't really have much more to say all the instructions and everything or coming forward so what about further ado we'll just get started okay so what we're going to need for our sugar-free cannabutter gummy candies is three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of sugar-free jell-o for our liquids you can either just use real lemon juice you could use these flavored waters that have no sugar or any juice that has no sugar at it and you can just use water and for additional sweetness we can add in some honey or you're gonna need a half a teaspoon of gorga a half a teaspoon of citric acid a quarter to a third of a cup of canned butter melted can of butter and if you want additional colors or flavors you can add those in as well you can use the the oil base or the gel based flavors the equipment that you're going to need obviously your mold whatever molds you want to use a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler any pot small pot and metal bowl that fits you know you don't want it to touch the bottom so you want it to have enough room and that you can do a makeshift double boiler you're gonna need a bowl for blooming your gelatin something to disperse your syrup so you can knead these bottles are great because they've got these tips these piping tips on them which makes it really nice for dispersing however any squeeze bottle or dropper will work measuring spoon a lips a hand blender if you don't have a hand blender a whisk and a very strong forearm and that's about everything obviously spatula and I think that's everything that we need to get started so we'll put all the ingredients together and go over the measurements so the first things that we need to do is we're going to turn our heat on to the lowest we just want to get the water hot once it's hot you can turn it off and next we are going to bloom our gelatin so you're going to need 1/2 a cup of your liquid and three tablespoons of your gelatin you want to evenly sprinkle it over the top and then you want to make sure to stir it in then stir it up so that there's no lumps and then you're going to set that aside for five minutes to let it bloom next you're going to take a quarter cup of your liquid and you're going to microwave it for a minute or minute and 20 seconds until boiling your going to add your sugar free jello to your double boiler and you're going to add that quarter cup of boiled liquid in and you're going to stir it up until your gelatin or - your jello is dissolved and while that's melting if you want to this is when you can you would add in two tablespoons of honey if you want to add some additional sweetness to it now if you don't like the taste of honey I'm gonna say don't do it because you are gonna have that bitter taste of honey pour it in it and you also want to add in a half a teaspoon of citric acid try not to get it on your spoon like I just did you actually want it in the pot and you'll just continue to stir that gently until everything is dissolved now that everything is dissolved we can add in our unflavored gelatin so what I like to do is time to split it up in the bowl like this so it's all in pieces and it it'll dissolve quicker and you're just going to stir that in until that is completely melted now this should be warm enough to melt the gelatin but if you find that it isn't melting you can put it back on the heat for a few minutes so I had to add mine back on the heat there because it wasn't melt melting it was actually starting to solidify so I'm just got that back on the heat so that it's melting now if you've got a bunch of jell-o and gelatin stuff stuck around the sides and you can't get it off but you can just use is hot hot water and a brush then you can just easily then wash it off wash it down into the pot now that everything is melted and all dissolved now we can add in our canna butter and our Garg um so just dump in your butter your can of butter actually add in 1/2 a teaspoon of Garga now if you have one of these little strainers it's great because you can use it makes it eat nice to just evenly distribute across the top if not just try and make sure you kind of sprinkle evenly across the top of it and once all that's on you're gonna let it sit for a minute and then we're gonna get our trusty little hand blender or our whisk and now we'll get our trusty hand blender and start blending [Applause] [Music] once you're fully mixed you just want to let stir it gently so we can start to work out some of those air bubbles and we're just gonna let it sit for a couple of minutes now at this point once everything's done and incorporated if you want to add in any additional flavor or color this is when you can do it so I'm just gonna add in a little bit more red to up that red a bit and I get this no taste red because I hate the test a taste of red food coloring and Wilton's makes this no taste red which is great the only problem is is it doesn't really give you the same intensity red as the regular red does but I'd rather forsake a little bit of the color for the taste because I really don't like that kind of bitter taste that red has and next I you can use ready to pour into your bottle or you can just use your eyedropper to distribute it into your molds and we're just gonna do that next and now you just distribute into the molds and the things you don't want to fill up the mold all the way you want to just leave it a little bit of the a little bit of the edge there otherwise it creates a sharp edge on your candies so and and it tends to dry out so it's not very it doesn't make it very nice so you want to keep it just below the below the top and once you fill up your molds you're gonna put it into the fridge for 20 to 40 minutes or until they're set another thing you want to try to pour right into the center of the mold and let it distribute it I know some of them you can't they have to be little feet or legs or tails but if you can otherwise the reason is again it's not it causes it won't stick to the sides and cause that edge and if you've made these before and have done it to the top you have that kind of sharp rigid edge that always dries out and it just doesn't make your candy very pleasant that's the reason all right so I'm gonna put these into the fridge to set by the feel of it it feels pretty like it's already starting to set so probably 20 minutes is all they're gonna need now if you want your candies to have a go back to the clear more clear looking what you can do is just put it on to the heat on low heat for a few minutes and the air bubbles and that will work out and it'll go back to that clear that clear look all right so they've been studying for 20 minutes they're ready to come out now so what you want to do is lay some parchment paper down on a wire rack what I like to do is I like to poke holes into my parchment paper so that way I can get air coming up through the bottom as well just hit this with driving don't have to is just something that I do and you're just gonna stand your little gummies up if you can some will stand some won't that's it you're gonna just leave them out to dry for anywhere from 24 to 48 hours there's your gummies your sugar-free gummies see there's one that we let's that I let sit on the heat for a little while let the air bubbles come out of it and that's it there you go sugarfree gummy bears cannabutter sugarfree gummy bears gotta make that clear all right let's get one of these little bad boys a try so just like a regular gummy bear or gummy candy no difference there okay all right tastes really good so it's really going to be dependent your taste be a big factor on the liquid that you use so you definitely want to use something that does have a lot of flavor or definitely your favorite juice no sugar added juice probably those nectars are good again if you're diabetic I'm not sure about that sugar contact I know there's not extra sugar added but I don't know how much regular sugar like natural sugars are in there if that's good or not but that may be an option as well if you do though use a nectar or any kind of real fruit juice I would recommend using mold inhibitor lorraine's makes a mold inhibitor that you can order online you may be able to get it in your specialty store and if you're using any type of real juice or real fruits in your gummies all right so that's about all as well I hope you enjoyed it if this is the first time you're watching I do hope you subscribes ORS many more videos in my library there and many more to

a treat for you we'll be making the Huy lemon peel gummy bears this has been the biggest snack craze right now in Hawaii it's nothing new but since everybody's been home and craving all their favorite foods this has come up more than ever it's a simple recipe that you can make at home it includes the Huey the Huey is a Chinese dried salted plum you can use the Huey in the seed form or in the powder form this recipe uses the powder form this also uses lemon peel which is another Chinese dried snack and gummy bears of course now you can use any gummy snacks that taste great gushers strawberry belt peach rings anything really you can use the sauce on fruits as well it's really yummy the kids love it toss it in the freezer if you'd like make it a cool treat before I get started I'd love it if

week also don't forget all the recipe instructions and ingredients are always listed in the description box below so how they might come along and let's make so many lemon peel gummy babies all right first we're going to get the lemon juice I like to use fresh lemon but if you want to use the artificial ones from the store you can roll the lemon with the palm of your hand and cut in half this will help get the lemon juice out easier then you're gonna squeeze the lemon to get the juice now I have a kabillion of different kitchen gadgets but for some reason I don't have like a regular juicer I have the full-blown juicer that you throw the whole thing in but I figure I just squeeze it here because most people don't have one anyway so if you squeeze the lemon and place your hand underneath you can catch the extra seeds that fall out if some slip away from you just make sure you get them out of a bowl when you're done [Music] next you'll take your lemon pill strips and place them into a food processor if you don't have a food processor you can use a blender we'll go ahead and grind it until you get fine pieces continue to grind it down until you get the strip's down about this size next we're gonna make the sauce take a bowl and add the lemon juice that we squeezed earlier some granulated sugar and some of the human father Meehan whey powder can be found at most grocery stores in Hawaii you can buy it online on Amazon at crack seed stores around it's pretty easy to find all these go ahead and mix that up until well combined and you're gonna go ahead and add your gummy bears toss the gummy bears in the sauce until well coated [Music] then you're gonna add the ground-up lemon-peel lastly stir it up and enjoy [Music] and that's how you make lemon lemon peel gummy bears really easy right if you try this recipe or any of my other recipes please let me know leave a comment in the comment box below what's your favorite thing to put the Himalaya powder on and until next

things one when are you gonna be back in the kitchen damn and to never go back to the kitchen man yeah I'm a little sick right now that's why I might sound like this so today what we're gonna do is we're gonna take a bunch of gummy bears melt them down to make a mega gummy bears first off I got a teddy bear mold rented this yeah I didn't know you could read stuff what I'm like hi there can I get the teddy bear mold no like you want to buy it or do you want to rent what you can rent it so I actually am renting this currently for a dollar ninety-nine a day they didn't have the traditional like gummy bear one so I'm going with this guy four different bags of gummy bears we got green we got red we got yellow and we got blue now I want to show you guys something because I know this is gonna come up this will reuse in a day okay you guys are probably thinking I thought it was like a little gummy bear this is the same material as those little gummy bears traditional stereotype gummy bears that you guys are probably thinking of I was originally at knows the ladies like so what are you doing this was like one of the few times is actually honest through the store associate I'm like I'm gonna develop these data like a huge bear Valachi she's the bigger wise girl Lucy he ate a sack same song with these guys plus it was easier to separate the colors that way so let's go over to the stove and let's melt actually before we do that guys make sure you subscribe to my channel and click the bail free for a limited time right now my subscriptions are educating they're always pretty good guys subscribe my channel let's go okay so to my understanding we got to fill up the pot first and then we're gonna put the bowl in like that and that's gonna kind of heat it up this is a bad idea are we not blocking the air from getting now I'm gonna use a bigger pot I think his bigger brother well I forgot to mention you've got no idea what I'm doing go ahead and turn that up to full okay let's let that boil so we're gonna start off with the red ones okay so it looks like what you've successfully melted a bunch of gummy bears suffer that clump we know this melt a little bit more and we're gonna pour the first layer in our mole I know things get stuck way easier than you think so I'm just gonna put some vegetable oil I don't know if the gummies gonna stick yeah like this is gonna help it's pretty much fully melted looks like sweet and sour sauce here we go now we're gonna do is take this put it in the freezer well that's cooling we're actually gonna start melting the other colors alright next we're gonna do blue I want the bottom of you more blue which is why I poured it we will see down there for our third color we got green that's weird already seems to be melting we can't let water get in there I don't know why but this is so satisfying like the Bears aren't fully melted well you just like stab right through them unless not least yellow my favorite flavor I have favorite color do your thing yellow all right that's three layers in our bear mold the last one is gonna be yellow I better this perfectly look at that I didn't know how much incoming bears together like what the quantity would be when you melt it down but damn that I nail it okay we're gonna let it freeze for about an hour you come back and check on it freeze well my job okay it's been like two hours or like more than that let's see this bad boy oh my god this thing is perfect oh my god it is so stuck to this pan no this feels wrong why does this feel so sexual right now Oh oh my god look at that we even got the face okay stop for sure get to clean my windows after this but it is currently stuck to my window [Music] this thing is so sticky this is a mega gummy bear which is what we've done by melting other gummy bears it's like the Optimus Prime of gummy bears right here yeah I don't know it's her strategy to cutting gummy this is doing nothing oh look at the layers look at the layers beautiful red we've got blue we've got green and then BOOM yellow it's actually really nicely done that is the negev gummy out with sliding already that's the mega gummy bear it's literally the size of my face actually bigger than my face hey it takes you 20 minutes to melt every color of gummy bear it takes like 2 hours to fully cool and on top of that it's loaded with sugar it's now becoming a health nut it was fun it was something I wanted to try for a long time I was so amazed at how well these gummy bears actually melted if you guys want to see a really good picture of this on Instagram follow me at the autocracy scribe my channel if you haven't and I'll see you guys [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "oQhItiXuOJ0": "[Music] parents look closely at this picture it looks like regular coughs syrup if you saw it in your childhood room would you think twice about it it's called cush the drug got a Miami Dolphins player arrested in Collier County this week and then he was cut from the team we sent NBC to investigator David Hodges to find out what it is and you know if these illegal drugs are hidden in plain sight being a big issue for parents and Peter the biggest danger is that they're far more pwned than anything parents may have seen or even tried when they were young so to help your kids we're gonna help you spot them at a quick glance you might not recognize it what does this look like to you ketchup pills that looks like marijuana syrup the final answer is correct Kush syrup found in the car of Miami Dolphins player and Collier County sold in a medical marijuana dispensary in California but not untouchable for kids in South West Florida pretty much everything through online channels you can figure out a way together Steven hill helps kids with substance abuse at Sal's care he says teens will try something like Co syrup just because it's new but I just think it's a different way to do it different and possibly more dangerous syrup has a thousand milligrams of THC the active principle of marijuana per bottle and if taken all at once 10 to 20 times what you're typically going against smoking a joy the side effects would be palpable a lot of times very erratic hallucinations and you can also get psychosis on a temporary basis so the the judgment and your behaviors are definitely impacted grown-ups don't know Lesley Robinson is founder of Street chicks and recovery which runs a marijuana adolescent prevention program in Lee County middle schools she also produces videos helping educate kids about some of the side effects of marijuana in products like Co syrup and it's so potent you're gonna be able to tell your child is high she says the best way for parents to spot these drugs is to pay attention to the new products on the market educate yourself on the other forms besides the bag and the smell the Collier County Sheriff's Office told us they don't recall ever making any arrests where this kind of syrup was down before but many of these drugs come and wave so the best advice for parents be on the lookout if you didn't buy it or authorize it question it for the NBC to investigators I'm David Hodges call email or download the NBC 2 news app and submit your tip now", "9dadHGeDI7o": "[Music] [Applause] hi guys um we're here having a little vacation and i wanted to share with you a little hack that i have um

today I'm gonna be showing you how to turn regular Cola bottle gummies into you guessed it infused Cola bottle bellies here's what you're going to need two tablespoons of warm water four ounces of Cola flavored gummies one-and-a-half teaspoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon of potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below one to two teaspoons of a herbal tincture if desired and a soda bottle mold the first step is to sprinkling a gelatin over the warm water there's no need to stir it just leave it to sit for about five minutes so it can bloom now you can take your Cola gummies and cut them so the lighter color is separated from the darker color place the lighter colored gummies into a dish and add about a quarter of your gelatin mixture then place it in the microwave for about 30 to 40 seconds until it melts once it's melted pour in some your tincture and then stir it in I'm going to be placing my mixture into a squeeze bottle and then putting it into a cup filled with warm water to keep it warm and liquid until I have everything ready to go now repeat this process with the other half of the gummies you'll be using your remaining amount of tincture and all of your gelatin my tincture is having some difficulties binding to the gummy mixture so I'm adding in about a teaspoon of lecithin to help it emulsify now I'm going to pour in both mixture at the same time putting the light color on the top and the dark color on the bottom once that's done I'll place them in the fridge or the freezer for about in half an hour so I can take them out of their mold [Music] I want some of them to be coated in sugar so I just filled a little bag with some sugar and shook them around and then I will leave these to sit out for about 24 hours so any excess moisture can evaporate that's it now your gummies are ready to be enjoyed [Music] thank you guys so much for watching if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe [Music]", "1dld8NFfnB4": "hi guys so cuties today we're gonna draw a gummy bear so let's get started to draw this gummy bear working the first time I drawing the nose and mouth area so I'm just gonna come right here and draw a curve so this is gonna be a center of the bear so it's just a nice little curve and we're gonna round it off on both sides it's nice and even and we're just gonna draw a little curve that comes in to the center and back so it's kind of like a jelly bean so towards the center and come back down and then at the bottom we're gonna add a curve so they're just going to do the mouth area okay and then right here in the center we're gonna draw a little oval for his nose there okay so then we're gonna come to this side right here and give it a draw circle for the eyes it's around the top right on this corner let's sit here about right here I'm gonna start a hand same thing on this size about right here just try to point across [Music] [Music] there now let's make them draw sec UI someone come in here with two small circles for highlights and the curve line at the bottom then shade in the top [Music] and the lines at the bottom so same thing on this side [Music] okay so we have the nose and the eyes in let's come over to the side right where the eye is we're just going to give it a little bit space and we're just gonna draw a curve right here so but right here I'm just gonna draw a slight curve just going to right drag this point right across that bub right here so same thing and then from there we're gonna come up here you can draw the ear so from right here come in a little bit or you can start right here just imagine this line going through so whichever way is easier for you I'm just gonna imagine that going through and about right here I'm just gonna give myself a little gap and I'm gonna draw a curve all the way over so if you're using a pencil you can just go all the way across and then you race that part later that's easier so we're just going to draw a curve right across so now we have a space for the ears and it's down a little bit more so in here we're just gonna draw a curve for the ears and same thing on this side all right there make sure about the same level and we got a little ears in now we're gonna come over here and tuck this curve in a tiny bit just to define the head area in the neck where it starts ok so then now we can come down a little bit more so we're gonna start to draw the arms so just pop it out a little bit more not too much because gummy bears are pretty compact so from there now we can come and straw the hands so I'll just do this side first so then we can now draw the other side a little bit later so I'm just going to bring this in and curve and come in so let's just same thing on this side so let's see here come down so let's give ourselves appointment drag this right across and above right here in the center area so I'm gonna aim for that point and then once again round it off man I'm going to end at this point about right here then connect okay so now for the body area right here we're gonna come in a little bit just trust slight curve on both sides so we're still keeping it pretty compact and then from there now we can draw the feet so come out a little bit and right here we're just gonna ground it off all right there start to bring it in and go all the way around oops okay and then same thing on this side there's just some days my hands don't work everything goes wrong so high right here okay and then I'm gonna bring this up just like the other side [Music] they're now in the center right here we're just going to add a little curve all the way across and then because this is my Dras acute gummy bear and we're going to come right here and add a little heart and that is

so you won't miss any new drastic you videos see you later you [Music]", "lAguCOu_Nmk": "hey everyone its Laura from our oily house calm and today I'm gonna show you how to make immune-boosting gummy bears [Music] as we go into the cooler months we are doing everything we can to keep those immune systems high and just last week I showed you guys some of my favorite tips on boosting the immune system and I shared my elderberry syrup recipe and today I want to share with you how you can make elderberry syrup gummy bears so to do this recipe you're going to need some elderberry syrup so if you miss that post where I shared my recipe I will link that up in the cards in the description below so you can check that out for this recipe you're gonna need a cup of your elderberry syrup so I'm just gonna pour it in here and then I'm just gonna put half of a cup into my glass bowl for right now and then we're going to add in some gelatin and this is some unflavored gelatin from grass-fed cows and this is really adds a lot of protein and has tons of help in if it's for you and this is what I'm going to use to make your gummi bears set up do you need 1/4 of a cup of this gelatin and I like the kind I use in the description below and we are going to whisk this together pretty quickly gelatin doesn't harden going to whisk this together until it is completely mixed into your elderberry syrup then you're going to add in 1/2 a cup of hot water you don't want this water to be boiling but you want it to be hot to kind of help dissolve the gelatin into the mixture then you're just going to continue to whisk this together you're gonna smell it kind of has that jello smell because of the gelatin and then after it's you know well mixed you're just gonna add in your other half a cup of elderberry syrup just keep whisking it together so it's well incorporated once it's all whisked together we are going to put it into our mold and I have these cute little gummy bear molds that I found on Amazon that I just love and I'll link them in the description below if you don't have gelatin molds you can make these just with a 9 by 13 pan and you can just pour it in there then just cut it into little squares that's totally fine too but my kids think these are really fun and then before we pour our mixture in there I'm going to grease them with just a little bit of coconut oil just to prevent them from sticking so I just grabbed some coconut oil just kind of rub it into my bears a little bit here I'm gonna use a dropper to drop them in and this came with my molds if you don't have one of these you can use like an old medicine drop or anything just kind of makes it easier to put into your mold so I'm just gonna fill up all of my gummy bears after you have your molds completely full we're just gonna pop these into the refrigerator and because my molds are so small these will be hardened in about 20 minutes but if you're using a 9 by 13 pan you might have to leave it in there for about four to eight hours once it's all set up you can just pop your gummy bears right out of your mold you can take these daily to help boost the immune system I like to give these to my kids five days on two days off just so we don't get any type of immunity to them they really just help to boost the immune system they are loaded with vitamins A B and C they're completely healthy and the kids really love them and you guys can use this same recipe to make all different types of gummy bears so I have tried this instead of the Alpha berry syrup I'll use an orange juice I've used grape juice we've used strawberry juice these are super fun my kids love them we can make all different flavors in colors I shared some of my kids favorite recipes for gummy bears in the description

gotta [ __ ] later but you'll be fine i [ __ ] pissed myself [Music] you", "zoshAm3-szc": "good afternoon everyone as you know I have the best superintendent in the entire United States with me today Jacqui bird and we're here together once again to talk about the great response from the school board and what happened because 12-year olds did things that they shouldn't have done and here's what it amounts to yep this is marijuana it's gummies it comes in a block it's about a hundred milligram block and this hundred milligram block is supposed to be torn in two Tim individual doses of THC laced gummies now once again I'm not gonna elaborate on the fact that I warned all of this was coming these gummies are produced in California and they're sold online and Leviticus Jones who's 12 years old came into possession of this package of gummies which is about so big Leviticus has told us a couple of different stories about how he can't became involved with possessing this but be that as it may we're working with him his parents are totally cooperating and understand the gravity of the situation so Leviticus comes to school today claiming that he got these this gummy that he tore in two pieces from someone else on a school bus that's still to be determined during second period which is gym class he presented this to a total of six other children in seventh grade I'm told that there were two boys 12 years of age and four girls of the six of them that received a piece of this gummy five of them were transported to the hospital because of an overdose it's easy to figure out six kids a hundred milligram bar that should be into ten separate doses of legal use in California of THC is now distributed the ten dosage between six children we rush them to the hospital with EMS where that are being treated the last child was taken by her parents to the hospital Leviticus will be charged with one count of possession of THC our marijuana resin six counts of distribution of THC within a thousand foot of a school and possession of paraphernalia so it would be seven felony charges and a misdemeanor charge we're fortunate in that the children are all gonna make a great recovery you're going to be all right there's no long term injury or illness here as we understand but obviously we're concerned we're concerned as to one how did a 12 year old ever come to be in possession of this drug this illegal drug in the state of Florida and - why did he offer it to these six kids which quite frankly with the exception of one little corner have apparently devoured this bar they're in gym class so the investigation goes on at this time and we will report the results of that to you let me turn it over to our superintendent and she will give you details about what they did and I just want to brag on the school system their response was remarkable to this emergency whenever it manifested itself at about ten o'clock this morning superintendent Burton Thank You sheriff good afternoon everyone you know again I applaud the staff for what they did when they learned of something happening well students they responded immediately they went by classrooms to check on children they went by and they made sure that they got the children and make sure they make contact and contact it the EM has to come out and take those children to the hospital for you know to make sure they are safe and to make sure they're going to be okay they're all okay but you know the sad part of this is again we could have been here with a different outcome if someone did not respond so I applaud the staff for what they did they follow through with the procedures and the protocols that we have in place and making sure we keep our children safe what I want to say to our parents is that everyone at school today is still safe they'll be safe again tomorrow they're gonna be safe throughout because we do have procedures in place to keep children safe but parents I ask you please talk to your children please make sure we're looking at their online social media if they're buying and purchasing see what it is and then parents talk to your children say if someone is offering you something something that's going on at school that's not normal please let them talk to you and notify us immediately notify the sheriff's office immediately if there's something wrong we want to make sure that everyone is safe when they come to school each and every day so again I applaud not only just our school staff I applaud the Sheriff's Office for making sure that they follow through and making sure that they do what they need to do to protect our children the sheriff and I have a partnership and we have a commitment to keeping our campuses and our children safe at all times you know I can't I don't know the exact symptoms because when they heard about it they they actually went to got the children and they had them transported you know so I don't know the exact symptoms or what they're you know exhibiting at that time because they responded very quickly when they learned of it this is the first time that I'm aware of right now that they can consumed it yes it is legal in California for adults it is not legal it is not legal in the state of Florida in in any way so any possession of this is illegal in the state of Florida and as to their symptoms they had stomachaches they were nauseous dizzy one of them was all but passed out and took obviously way more than the recommended illegal dose by the way fine I'm surprised that I'm finding myself have to talk like that but the bottom line is it's all illegal in Florida and even in California it's illegal for a child habit but when you can go online you know Green Hornet's becomes something that'll sting you and it stung all those kids today I know that Leviticus has it I don't know that he bought it online he's told us at least two different stories of how he came to possess it and we are working through that now so excuse me his parents were totally cooperating with us but obviously they will be working with us on the investigation we're focused on Leviticus at this time we don't have any indication that his parents contributed to this if we determine that then obviously there would be other criminal charges but we don't see that at this time in the investigation his parents have been forthright totally cooperative they they are concerned not only that Leviticus did this but that he exposed these other children so they're concerned about the other children as well and according to Leviticus he didn't take any of this the other kids did but he said he didn't so it's uh it's frightening and fortunately for us it was not some other drug that was more dangerous in small doses than the was even though this was toxic to them in the amounts that they took the other kids have eaten the evidence so to speak so in the in the technical term you could draw blood and then there would be misdemeanor possession but no we're not going to charge the other children they will be dealt with appropriately by their parents and the school system under discipline conduct rules there Leviticus right now is the one we're focusing on but if someone else provided this to Leviticus we want to know because ultimately he's 12 years old so if a 20 year old gave it to Leviticus then our focus is the 20 year old but we've got to work through that during this investigation six six kids and Leviticus is seven okay one child went with her mother five went to the hospital we've not found the one child so we don't know whether or not that child consumed but we're told antidotal II that they did but we've not confirmed that yet Leviticus says he didn't take in at least five for sure maybe the sixth one who we've not talked to we know we know five consumed we suspect the six one consumed five went to the hospital by EMS one written with the parents for six and Leviticus says I provided it ask them if they wanted some and they all tore pieces of the bar off and consumed it and Leviticus is facing seven felony charges in a misdemeanor okay anything else", "zYgVCXcyrcI": "hi welcome to dive into light edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and to the regular subscribers thank you so much and welcome back new subscribers thank you again for joining I'm so excited this channel is kind of weirdly taking on a life of its own it's it's really really exciting but a little overwhelming I'm not gonna lie it's kind of cool when there's like you know a couple thousand people seen it but now we're getting into some not large numbers for me um that I never expected and it's like what oh but it's super cool and thank you guys so much I couldn't do this obviously without you so today I know I've got another company recipes up there and I'm always working to refine and make things better so in this recipe this is good for regular gummy bears or regular gummy candies or the sweet and sour there's really only one difference in the change for that recipe whether you want to make regular or the sugar sugar-coated and so I wanted to go for that as well as a little bit a little bit of change in the method but any one of those recipes will work so kind of how I'm gonna how I would list it is the regular gummy bears that I put is more like a condensed jello realistically it's jell-o and gelatin and you harden it up that's condensed jello and then the other candy this the sour one with the the sugar-coated sour ones they're more like a real candy so I know also how the gummy that's more like a real candy versus just condensed gelatin and I will stop babbling on now and also I've got a recipe at the end there if you want to stay tuned on how to make inverted sugar which is a replacement for corn syrup so if Kourt lake corn syrup is difficult for you to get expensive just not available in your local grocery stores you can actually make your own at a fraction of the price and it's super easy to make however it is very very finicky but I go over all of that at the end there about the inverted sugar so I hope you stay tuned for that and and check that out and I think that's all I've got for us right now I'm gonna get in as I usually do get into my ingredients the utensils you're gonna need we'll put everything together and we'll get some candies made we're getting started what you want to do is to get a pot of either ice water or set up a pot of cold water and put it in your fridge or freezer about an hour before you want to start this very important you need the really cold water to start to stop the cooking process for the syrup so just get that set up ahead of time and now we'll get into your ingredients and the tools that you're going to need all right so I'm just gonna go over the ingredients now the ingredients for the gelatin side are exactly the same whether you want to do be regular or whether you want to do the sugar coated it's exactly the same the only difference is whether you're doing the sugar coated or the regular is in the candy syrup and the difference there is if you're doing sugar coated you're gonna use one cup of sugar actually I'll go over that when I get into the sugar part you never mind about that right now we'll start with the gelatin side so you're going to need a one box of jell-o three envelopes of gelatin or three tablespoons you are going to need a quarter cup of corn syrup or you can use what's called inverted syrup which is a substitution for corn syrup I have a video at the end of this to show you how to make your own inverted sugar which I use quite often which I'm actually using today I'm just showing you the bottle for what you've got what you need in the light corn syrup you will need a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/2 teaspoon of gore gum a quarter cup of liquid now I tend to use the kool-aid jammers or the or the kool-aid waters they're great or the Hawaiian punches are great to use as well or you can just use water you're gonna want a half a cup of liquid again you can use your juice or your gelatin I'm sorry your juice or your water for the gelatin and for this you need it needs to be cold so for your gelatin it has to be very cold and for our jello portion we're actually going to boil that and the only other thing is if you want to add some additional color and additional flavor we can do that as well and I think Oh sorry and we also need a quarter tea store sorry a half a teaspoon of citric acid I apologize almost missed that our half teaspoon of citric acid that's everything that we're going to need for our gelatin side and now I'm just gonna when we start the syrup I'm going to go into the ingredients in that for the syrup side and then if previously I talked a little bit about clear gel for the regular gelatin gummies you can actually use this now for either one and again we're gonna do all the work on our gelatin side and add this in so with regards to the clear gel if you want to use it what you need to do beforehand is you take a cup of the clear gel and you mix it with a quarter cup of sugar and you keep that to a side mix it thoroughly so that the sugar and the starch are thoroughly mixed the reason for that the starch will clump if you do it on its own or doesn't have the sugar properly mixed these starts will clump up in your mixture so that is why we add the sugar then you are going to use two tablespoons for your gelatin for your gelatin mix now this is an option now what this does is it takes your candy to that next level that more professional candy like you get in the candy store so it's not as gelatin like it's more it's a little bit softer it's more of that gummy candy versus just like concentrated gelatin and I've been using this ever since I first since I tried it I used it in all my candy now it's I love it it's not that expensive you get a large container of it and it lasts quite a long time so if you do make candies more on a larger scale or on a professional level you might want to give that a try it's excellent it's a little pretty pain to work with but I'll go over all that adding that in so for the candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar okay laureate let me back up here if you are making the sugar-coated gummies you are gonna use one cup of sugar and a half a cup of corn syrup if you want to make regular gummies that are not sugar-coated you're going to switch that you're going to use one cup of corn syrup to a half a cup of sugar but it's to a half a cup of sugar so the recipe is exactly the same this is the only part that'll change regular gummies one cup of syrup to half a cup of sugar sugar-coated gummies one cup of sugar to half a cup of corn sort syrup and the water remains the same half a cup either way you go that's all you need for the candy syrup side temperature cooks to the exact same we're gonna cook it to 260 all right so the equipment that we are going to need is a double boiler you don't have one no problem just what I do use a metal bowl that fits into a pot you want to add water into the bottom to the pot you just don't want it to touch the bottom of the bowl you're gonna need a second pot for your syrup you would let you want to use a heavy bottom pot it works it's better for even the heat distribution for your syrup that way your syrup cooks evenly you don't have any hotter spots you're going to need a candy thermometer a hand blender a whisk a couple of spatulas and a strainer if you've got one handy and I think that's everything that we need for our equipment I usually end up finding something that Wow's that we need but this is generally the majority of the equipment that you're gonna need so next I'll get into the ingredients for putting our gelatin portion together and then we'll then we do the candy syrup and then we combine both of them alright so give me a moment to get everything together here and we'll get started all right so let's get started with our recipe so our very first step what we're gonna do is our quarter cup of liquid we're gonna heat up in the microwave for one minute we want that boiling then with our half a cup of cold liquid we're gonna bloom our gelatin so add that to a bowl and your gelatin you want to evenly spread it over your liquid and again water or the juice I'm actually using kool-aid jam or yes or sorry I'm using the kool-aid waters you know if you do use real juice with real fruit all you need to do is to add a mold inhibitor laureen's makes a makes one and that's what you need to use if you if you use anything with real fruit in it otherwise they will mold very quickly but if you use fruit jammers Hawaiian Punch they don't have anything real in the sugar content they don't go mouldy I literally have gummies that last for months I've never seen mold on them so with regards to your gelatin you want to sprinkle it evenly and then mix it up to make sure that there are no lumps and then you're gonna set it aside for five minutes to allow it to bloom and meanwhile I'm going to microwave this for one minute so you're gonna add your box of jell-o to the double boiler you're gonna set your temperature to low and we're just gonna wait for I'm just waiting for my liquid to boil all right so we're going to add our boiled liquid yeah it got very hot I'm gonna add that in and we're gonna stir that around let our gelatin let our jello get dissolved you might need to add a little bit more liquid to it if you find that it's not fully dissolving but it takes a few minutes anyway and you want to continue to scrape all the gelatin off the sides otherwise it will harden up and we're just gonna stir that and let our water get warm now it's really important with jell-o and gelatin is the heat jello and more gelatin sorry I apologize the our unflavored gelatin melts at just hot a hot water bath if it is too hot it breaks the gelatin and what will happen is your you'll notice it'll start to get very foamy if it starts foaming immediately remove your bowl from the heat and let it cool down you also may need to add about 1/2 a tbsp more of unflavored gelatin because you've kind of broken the the you broken the gelatin a bit so it may not be as sticky or it may not be sorry gel as well so you may I need to add in an additional half a tablespoon to compensate for that so I'm just gonna continue to stir this on the low heat until it is till it's pretty much fully melted until the sugars all fully melted so now that my gelatin is pretty much melted we're gonna add in our quarter cup of corn syrup and get that thoroughly stirred in and we're also gonna add in our half a teaspoon of citric acid we're gonna let that all mix in and melt together again try and keep the sides of your bowl as clean as possible so now that our jello is all melted we're going to add in our gelatin and your gelatin is bloomed when it is nice and spongy if it is squishy at all then either your gelatin is it's not strong enough because gelatinous do have different strengths or it's old and the gelatin is just broken so you want it to be nice and firm and just break it up into pieces and scoop it in and then we're just gonna stir that until that's melted and again remember you just want to warm hot water by at this point you don't want the water underneath boiling at all otherwise your jello your gelatin will break and again if you see it starting to foam up at all take it off immediately now once your gelatin is all melted and everything looks nice like so we're gonna add in our can of butter so you know it in a quarter to a third of a cup of can of butter I'm doing a quarter cup they have dogs and cats behind me [Music] cats trying to trip me up here and then I'd in the Gerber gun this is when you want to use the strainer throw it on there and you want to evenly sprinkle it all over the top and now we're going to get our handy dandy hand blender and so you're going to blend this until it is completely all one color one unit alt one texture and that you're not seeing any kind of oil separation [Music] all right so we've got that all what we called emulsifies so what Gord got gorg um is an emulsifier what an emulsifier does is it allows oil and water to come together essentially it creates a little bubble so when we use the blender it breaks the oil particles up into tiny little part into little pieces and the emulsifier acts as a bubble and holds the water and the oil together in little bubbles that's how it all comes together and your water and oil live happily together otherwise your butter is going to separate and come to the top if you don't use that now a lot of people have asked me if you can use zanza zantac xanthan gum no you cannot it is not an emulsifier it is only a thickening agent so geurim is an emulsifier it is also a thickening agent and a stabilizer that is the other you can use lecithin I prefer Gore gum because lecithin gives it a flavor that I really don't like and I find that the Gore gum works awesome with you don't need the lesser than now at this point if you want you can add in your some additional flavoring I add in about a cup and a half full and if you want to add in some additional color I do it on this side as well I use the no taste red if I'm doing red color so I'm doing raspberries so I use the no taste red reason for that a red die has red food coloring I mean has a tends to have a bitter flavor to it so I like the no taste rent the only downfall about it is you don't get quite as an intense red as the regular ones but I would for rather give up a little bit of the color for than the flavor so I'm gonna mix that in and I'm gonna use the hand blender again just to get it full all mixed together the color comes out much nicer when you use the hand blender [Music] and when you're riding a clear gel you're gonna want to have your whisk ready and coupes and we're going to add in a tablespoon at a time and you want to evenly spread it over the top like so and then use this too and then you're gonna have to whisk it for about a minute or minute or two you're gonna notice it start to thicken up it's just kinda like cornstarch you know when you're making gravy you have to keep mixing it a little while for it to up for it to thicken up and do its thing we're gonna do and you can see how it's starting to thicken up and now we're gonna add in the second tablespoon same thing evenly over the top whisk and you're gonna repeat the same thing we're going to whisk it for about a minute or two until it's all to look pick it up so you can see how it's thickening up here I said you want to continue whisking for about two minutes and it should look nice and smooth and again all one uniform texture and color alright that side is ready is finished now we're gonna do the candy syrup side alright so for our candy syrup side because I am doing sugar or sour coated ones I am going to be using one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and a cup of water now remember if you want to make regular gummies our only difference is you're gonna use a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of regular sugar that is the only difference there you're gonna mix that together until it's up until it comes up together and your sugar begins to dissolve make sure to go all around the edges because the sugar likes to hide on the edges all right so and once your gonna have that all mixed up you're gonna turn your heat on to medium medium-high and you're going to continue to stir this until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you're not going to stir it all right the other one of the things I forgot is you want a pastry brush or a paintbrush clean paint brush so that you can clean off the sides of the pot to use a cup of hot hot water and that'll melt any sugar crystals that you've got and you want to get those off the side because any sugar crystals can cause your syrup to crystallize later on and just continue to stir it until it begins to boil Oh once your syrup begins to boil stop stirring and you're going to add in your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook this until 260 now if you want a firmer candy you can cook it to about 280 so anywhere between 260 280 you can experiment on your firmness if you want a softer candy cook it to 250 but I found 260 seemed to be a really good temperature for it and we're just gonna let that go until we hit the proper temperature now you also want to get your pot of cold water handy and the only thing that you'll do drink the cooking process is if you do see any sugar crystals form just wash them down and now while your candy while the candy syrup is cooking you just want to consider this because stir your jello side because the top part of its gonna start to solidify and the bottom is gonna be liquid because it's closer to the heat so you want to continue sure to mix that up and it all stays nice and smooth and keep it on keep it on low temperature so you have the low hot water bath keeping it melted all right so I've hit 260 take your pot and submerse it in cold ice water turn off your heat and you want to wait until the temperature begins to come down on your thermometer then you're going to place it on the counter until the temperature hits 240 well once your temperature reaches 240 you can remove your candy thermometer and we are now going to add in our gelatin or our jello and our gelatin mixture right so now we're gonna get our jello we're going to get that added in and then you're gonna very carefully stir this until it is fully mixed together your sugar the sugar syrup and the gelatin come together but be very careful because this is very hot you're going to pull it from the bottom and again make sure to get the edges and then it's this is up to you it's an optional step I do I like to use the hand blender on it and the reason I like to use the hand blender is just to make sure that everything is all mixed and blended thoroughly together [Music] [Applause] well see you like that be careful I'm gonna clean up my little mess here and then we're gonna get lit gonna let this sit let some of the air bubbles come out of it we you can work them out by just gently stirring it let it sit and then just look gently stir it again we need this to cool down a bit so you can do that and I'm just gonna clean up a little all right so my mixture is cooled down a bit and I'm going to pour it into my to my bottles my squeeze bottles that was one of the things I forgot in the utensils or tools you need is your squeeze bottles or eyedroppers and I use these squeeze bottles they're by sugar sweet sugar bowel and they've got their nice because they've got the piping tips for them which makes it really nice and easy as well as they have a wide bottle and a wider thread if you use bottles that have too thin of a thread if your syrup is hot or really thick it'll pop the top right off if after you filled your bottles if you still have syrup left just keep it on the lowest temperature just so that we can that you it'll stay so melted there otherwise it will solidify all right so now we're gonna get ready to put this into our moulds all right and then when you're filling up your mold you just want to fill them up just a little over halfway you don't want to go all the way to the top because that way it makes a rough edge on them and it makes your candies not very nice so you just want to try to make them as clean it's also you want to try not to get any jello on the edges there and you're just gonna fill up all of your molds and then once you've got them all filled you're gonna put them into the refrigerator for a minimum of four to six hours I found its best overnight so if after four hours or so II go to try to take about there knock coming out just leave them for overnight usually that usually works if they're still not going to come out of the mold you can put them in the freezer it means that you've got too much syrup the gelatin isn't working too well what you can do is put them into the freezer get them out of the molds remount them at about a tablespoon of gelatin and recast them and then if you find that you take out your candies and they're far too gummy too sticky you can remount them and add a little bit of liquid to it means that it has more too much gelatin you can add up I probably say about two or three tablespoons of liquid to it remelt it and just recast them and this recipe makes about sixty candies if you use smaller molds and if you use those little tiny bear molds you're gonna get about at least a hundred to 150 all right so these candies I had in the fridge overnight and I made lemon yesterday so you can see now I did I have found that they do stay there are better if you leave them overnight then just leaving them for a few hours and they'll come out and you pop them right into your sugar sour mix now your sugar sour mix should be one cup of sugar to a half a teaspoon of citric acid don't use any more make sure to thoroughly mix it in and that'll make a nice sugar sour mix if you just want sugar just use sugar what I usually do is for the sweet ones I will use a cup of sugar to about a quarter teaspoon of citric acid just a little bit because it brings out the fruit flavors so you just mix them into your sugar shake off the excess and lay them on a a rack with parchment paper to dry overnight now these guys also dry a lot quicker and then the other recipe and just pop them out now if you find that they're getting too sticky like this you can put them back into the fridge sometimes they do the when you leave them out they get too warm so as they get a little bit too sticky so what I usually do is take out one mold at a time and do them and that's it you'll continue doing that until they're all are all coated and just lay them out on the rack to dry overnight and those are your sugar or your sugar sour coated candies your sugar soda yeah cannabutter gummy and I just want to go for also a couple of things with regards to molds when you get brand news if you get brand-new silicone molds what I recommend to do is to cut to season them so I use a spray the spray cooking spray I spray it on let them sit for 20 minutes and then rinse them in hot water I don't use soap on them again but I want to rinse off all the excess cooking spray and then that kick that that cures them which is nice I found that red silicone mold do not work well for some reason they're thicker and I can never get anything out of them so I tend to stay away from red silicone molds I found the blues Browns and that work great but red mm-hmm does not work Oh to make inverted sugar replacement for corn syrup you need two cups of white sugar one cup of water and a quarter cup or sorry a quarter teaspoon of citric acid you're gonna need a pastry brush or a clean paintbrush brand new one will be better in a glass of hot hot water we're going to need a pot you want your pot to be super clean there cannot be even a speck of dust or dirt in your pot because it will cause your syrup to crystallize now you want a spatula and your candy thermometer that's pretty much all you need so to get started we're gonna get started in just one moment all right so we are gonna combine we're gonna put in our sugar or 1 cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're gonna stir that till the biggest sugar begins to dissolve and any sugar crystals that are on the side you want to make sure to wash down we'll do that in a minute and if I change you see anything in your sugar at all any dust or any little particles whatsoever make sure that they come out because I said anything at all in your sugar will cause it to crystallize and sometimes things happen you get little little dust or little pieces of stuff I said then wash down any sugar crystals off of the side and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high you want to make sure that your pot is always in the center of the burner so that you're getting proper even heat distribution not where your sugar is cooks prop evenly and so we're gonna continue to stir this until our syrup starts to boil the moment it begins to boil you're gonna stop stirring it stirring once it starts boiling will actually cause your syrup to crystallize and we need to avoid that at all costs so just continue stirring until it begins to boil and wash down and in between keep the washing down the sides of your pot for any sugar crystals whatsoever like literally one crystal will cause your your syrup to crystallize so although it's really easy to make it is very finicky when you're stirring it's also very important to take your spatula and go right around the edge of the pot the sugar likes to settle in on the edges so you want to make sure that nothing's sitting because otherwise if it sits to the bottom it will will stick and cause you problems so the reason why inverted sugar is so finicky and while any crib one single crystal or dust will cause it to crystallize because what we're making is a what's called a supersaturated solution so I don't know if you remember science class see that science stuff does come back to you if you you made saturated solutions and supersaturated solutions where you add a saturated solution is where you have water in salt you have us salt to its maximum saturation point in its water once you go one crystal beyond that it becomes what's called a supersaturated solution and that is what we're making here because we start out first of all with a saturated solution the two cups - 1 cup of water tea cups of sugar - 1 cup of water creates a super create a saturated solution by cooking off the water we are now gonna have more sugar content than your water which then creates your supersaturated solution there you go science for the day you've learned your something new you're done oh sorry one thing I did forget is you're going to need the lid for your pot mine as you can see this one is too big for it if you don't have the right lid no big deal just use them flipped over they work just as good so you definitely need the lid to your pot because once we stop cooking this we're gonna put the lid on it immediately now as soon as it starts to boiling you're gonna stop stirring it you're not going to stir it anymore from this point on you're going to add your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook the syrup to 230 for between 234 and 237 if you want a little bit of a looser syrup then 234 if you want it a little bit thicker than 237 but you're not gonna go beyond that and the only thing now that we're gonna do through the cooking process is wash down the sides of any sugar crystals form that it's the only thing you want to make sure that's equal that's it that we're going to do through the process so keep an eye on the thermometer goes fairly quickly don't walk away don't go be hitting the bong or anything silly like that and as I said as soon as it hits 234 you're gonna wash down any crystals that may be on the sides and then we remove it immediately from the heat place the lid on it and put it on your counter or a stone block and you're not going to touch it again until it's room temperature it is very important that it doesn't get agitated or moved in its cooling process because any agitation again can cause it to crystallize now if your sugar does start to crystallize at any point not a big not a huge deal put it on low heat re melted and it should be fine so as it's boiling while it's boiling into all the sugar melts the crystals can splash up onto the side so said just keep a very close eye and if you've got which imma call it screws here normally there's little bolts here on your pot where the handle make sure to clean around there because the sugar likes to hide in on those and the sugar also will gather behind the thermometer but I only tend to move that one time near the end of the cooking process because as I said you don't want to be agitating your sugar at all so when my syrup gets close to to 29 to 30 is when I will gently move the candy thermometer and wash the crystals off in and behind mat and then gently move it back all right so my temperatures now at 234 I like to actually let mine go to about 237 I like it a little bit thicker so at about 236 I'm gonna pull it because your sugar does still tend to and continue to increase once you pull it off the heat so we're at 235 236 I'm going to remove the candy thermometer turn off my burner remit place it over on my back burner here cuz it's nice and cool wash off any crystals that may be there for the last time be very careful and then you're gonna place your lid on it and you're not going to touch the syrup again until it reaches room temperature as soon as it reaches room temperature you can use it you can either store it on your counter or you can put it in the fridge for up to six months and the one thing is you can transfer it to another container however any time I've ever done that I have it ended up crystallizing I guess the agitation of moving it from one container to another so I just tend to leave it in the pot that I cook it in so I always recommend if you're gonna do that use a pot that it's not your favorite so that if your it's off to the side for a couple of months you're not gonna miss it so I basically designate one pot for my syrup so I'm not gonna miss that pot if I'm if I need it for in the next couple of months and that's it for inverted sugar making your own corn syrup so this said this is I use it quite often in place of my corn syrup it's great if you do not have access to a corn syrup easily or like places in the UK that you really don't have corn syrup you've got I think it's called a golden syrup I'm not sure but now you can easily make your own well I hope you enjoyed that little tutorial there on how to do your own inverted sugar thank you very much for watching you have a great so that's my little tutorial there on a regular gummies and sugar sour coated gummies I hope you enjoyed that as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll get back to you as soon as they can I do apologize I do sometimes have a bit of a delay there I don't mean to but some life takes over sometimes but I do try to get back to everybody as I can and then here's our little of my little lemon and I did lemonade and or sorry kind of turned out like lemonade so there lemon and raspberry and these are there were little little puppies aren't they cute well good luck with your candy making and I'd love to hear how your how yours turned out and if you have any questions about the inverted sugar let me know and I hope you have an awesome rest of your day thank you so much for watching and if you're new here and you like the video I really do hope you subscribe take care have a wonderful awesome day [Music]", "_qLXHN_lvhA": "quick video on how to make sour candy gummies you'll need one box of jell-o three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin which is about four bags 1/4 cup of corn syrup half a cup of melted infused coconut oil 1/2 a teaspoon of gore gum 1/4 cup of kool-aid any flavor and half a teaspoon of citric acid you also need a strainer that things spatulas molds and also a fan spray get a bowl of ice-cold water you need 1 cup of sugar 1/2 a cup of corn syrup and 1/2 a cup of water and this will be for later to make the gelatin you'll just need 1/2 a cup of water you will add in the 4 packets of gelatin so the full box [Music] make sure to stir everything thoroughly and then we'll just set it to the side until we need it later now you're gonna put your quarter cup of kool-aid or you can use water in the microwave for one minute [Music] now I'm going to get my jello and my kool-aid that I got out of microwave and pour it into a double boiler you're gonna stir until the jello dissolves on medium heat once it's all melted together then you're going to add your 1/4 cup of corn syrup again you're just gonna stir until it all mixes together you're then going to add in your half a teaspoon of citric acid and then mix that together until that dissolves [Music] now once the gelatin is squishy and firm you're going to add that into the mix [Music] you want to break it up into little pieces just so that way it dissolves a bit quicker stir until everything is melted and make sure the water from the double boiler is not boiling you do not want to burn the jello once everything is melted you're gonna put your half cup of infused coconut oil you want to mix that thoroughly now you're going to get your Gore gum and a strainer if your mix looks like this it's because everything is not mixed thoroughly so you'll want to get a whisk and now help everything just mix faster and more evenly now you're going to add in the gore gum and what the gore gum does is an emulsifier that allows the coconut oil and the water to mix evenly so you want to add that onto the top and then mix it until it all dissolves once that's done you're just gonna put the heat on low and then put it to the side while we work on the candy syrup side you'll need another pot you want to get a ziplock bag and a pan spray let's pray the Pam inside the bag and this is so that way the gummies the mixture does not get stuck inside the bag you also want to get your molds ready and also put some Pam spray on that as well turn on the stove to medium heat you're then going to add your one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and your half a cup of water you're gonna want to mix this thoroughly until you see that the sugar has all dissolved [Music] now once you've seen that the sugar has dissolved you're gonna turn the medium up to medium-high then you're just gonna continue stirring until it starts boiling Wow that's boiling you want to make sure you stir your jell-o gelatin side periodically so it doesn't thicken as you can see it's starting to boil and you want to make sure again that you just scrape the sides of it so the sugar does not get stuck once the candy syrup starts boiling you want to make sure it reaches a temperature of 260 degrees now that has reached 260 degrees you're gonna take your pot turn off your stove and just immerse it into the cold water until it reaches 240 degrees once it's reached 240 degrees you want to place it onto a cold surface not onto the place that we were boiling on so that way you can cool down a bit and then you're gonna add in your jello mix into the candy syrup [Music] mix everything thoroughly until it's all one color and you see no bubbles let's sit for about five to 10 minutes until cool so that way you can pour them into the mold then grab your ziploc bag cut a hole in the bottom corner also grab a bowl and this will be so it's easier for you to pour in your jello mixture pour the jello mix inside the bag and then grab a spatula to get everything out I [Music] personally like this method better just because it's easier and less messy then you know refund refilling those syringe or squeeze bottles as you can see there's a little white in my jello mix that just means that I do not mix it long enough so it can be mixed evenly so again you want to make sure it's all one color no bubbles and you don't see any white in your jello mix just so that way you can get the best results these are still gonna taste good but just so that way you know you can get the best results for these gummies mix everything thoroughly a hundred percent [Music] now that I have everything in the molds we're gonna put this in the fridge for about an hour and a half after an hour and a half you will then be placing them in the freezer for about an hour an hour and a half again now for the sugar sour mix it's one cup of sugar and half a teaspoon of citric acid pour your sugar in the bowl then if you want them a little bit more sour then put a little bit more than the half teaspoon of citric acid and then you're just gonna mix it up until you have a nice even sugar sour mix once you try out the mix if it's not sour enough just add a little bit of citric acid at a time just so that way you don't get an overpowering sour taste get some parchment paper so we can place the gummies on now you want to get one tray of the modes at a time when you take them out the freezer so that way it can be an easier faster process taking them out and then sugarcoating them you can either do one at a time or you can do multiple I do multiple just because it's faster just make sure you place them separate from each other so that way they don't stick together and then all you do is shake it up and then you have a evenly coated gummy and then you'll just want to continue this with all of your gummies [Music] these molds I actually got from Amazon I searched up weed molds and as you can see they have these nice emojis on them the other ones have these weed leaf plants on them so they look pretty cool if you want to check them out I can link them down below in the description just so that way you can find them easier and you actually get a pack of six with a little syringe as well so it's a really really great deal so my phone actually died after this part is like cut I coated them I cut them up and as you can see there's nice little squares and I actually ran out of molds and I use an ice tray so I use these heart-shaped ice trays so if you don't have any candy molds you can use some ice trays just make sure you coat them with Pam's so that way they don't get stuck and it's easier to push out [Music] so now that I'm done coding everything this is the last part the hearts this is how they look up close they look delicious and they taste delicious too now I'm just going to be placing my gummies into my bags so with the emoji ones I put six in in a bag these square ones I put seven to eight in a bag and the heart one since they're bigger I put four in a bag and this is how they look so I'm gonna continue doing them with all the other ones and I'm just gonna fast forward [Music] now that I'm all done this is how they all look like in their banks and then I just store them in the freezer until they're ready to eat so I hope you guys enjoy this video if so give it a thumbs up let me know what you think in the comments and also subscribe to my channel thank you guys [Music]", "NH6Y4xBrKzc": "guardzilla bear welcomes to ryan toysreview what do we have here today ooh we have a do-it-yourself giant gummy candy

never like this amount we'll see how it goes you're down to do this oh hell yeah all right he's gonna eat the whole [ __ ] bag yeah you ready he's [ __ ] down that [ __ ] again it's gonna taste like ass no it tastes pretty good i mean it's [ __ ] gummy worms let's see how it goes but um yeah so for those who don't know delta 8 is actually 66 percent the psychoactivity of delta 9 but i mean 500

hoping i'm like paralyzed that's what i'm hoping for so yeah [Music] those taste like real gummy worms though that [ __ ] well no they are real gummies yeah but normally like if you infuse like a cookie with thc and you can still see guy should be [ __ ] up it will be worth it though dude perhaps you're doing that i mean it's not like it's not like you know i mean you don't have to work tomorrow right he's underplaying it dude yeah i'm unemployed baby you're good you're good 25 minutes how do you feel better cousins not bad not bad i don't think it's i feel like it's not hitting yet all right we'll check back in it's a placebo effect right now i his eyes are getting kind of red man i'm baked let's make that right here let's go to the light a bit so these uh people can see how red the eyes are um so guys um i shouldn't say guys i don't like that hey you look at those eyes right there that's what those edibles do after one hour that's 500 milligrams of delta 8 thc um edibles man they're frying me already hell yeah it's been what are you expecting in the next 30 minutes sleeping probably so we'll see if we get any more of this are they sativa indica or what just distilling distillate oh so [ __ ] blacks is that what that is i guess you could call it delta 8 wax i mean wax is desolate um i guess but there's different methods of extracting it like co2 and bho and i guess the consistency determines what you call it but it's just distal it's just super thick and sticky and uh basically the gummies just regular gummies and they actually spray it with the actual thc oil

today we have some rainbow six siege we have two games for you guys today they are pre-recorded gameplay from the past ball this one this first game is from today the other game also we have gummy bears just so the first game is i gave my plate today on the 20th of september and the other game was um um it was actually in the youtube membership video so if you guys saw that it was the background gameplay for that but i did want to include it in this video just because i really wanted to make a siege video tonight with these gummy bears and i didn't really have any other siege gameplay that i like really wanted to share with you guys so i have recently started to play ash more and actually really really enjoy playing at i'm trying to learn some of the different operators that i can use so if you guys have any suggestions for good operators for beginners i'm pretty sure i already got it kind of figured out but if there's an operator that you see me not using that you think i you know could be good at then feel free to let me know also you guys all noticed that i increased increased fov to 90 and also i didn't realize that the game settings wouldn't automatically update when i got my 144 arts monitor so i also updated that in the graphical settings and it is beautiful beautiful i love 90 fov thank you guys so much for the tips and also the 144 hertz refresh rate and this game is really really awesome so hopefully you guys are all doing well i really am enjoying making videos for you guys and hopefully you are all enjoying them we are moving up to three three uploads as i commit suicide three uploads per week on monday wednesday friday so i hope you guys enjoy the new and increased upload schedule i think my phone was like interfering with the microphone i got a crazy triple kill there you guys all seem to do really like the gummy bear video the last one that i did that was on minecraft so if you guys enjoy the gummy bear eating be sure to drop a like on this video and i will definitely make more videos similar to this so be sure to um oh excuse me if you have any tips for me i would appreciate if you guys share them with me down in the comments nicely of course but i am trying to get better at siege and i'm getting better slowly but surely but i would like to um really increase my skills at this game i'm slowly learning the maps and the layouts and everything but um any other tips would be great i do need to um go into these maps and like look at like camera placements and where the the walls and the rooms are and stuff so i'm trying to get better at um rotating more and trying to switch up my positions just so i don't um you know sit still all game and get caught off guard i was playing a lot of doc and ash today i just kind of realized that instead of a sledge or thatcher and capkin because those are the operators i normally play although i did play talk in the last video i think because he was like the cover the last two of us is actually me and one of our moderators here on the channel until we clutch up this 2e3 to get our team the flawless actually clutch it up with the uh the cap can trip but still nailed it we got uh we did not get mvp this game however we did go five and zero which is pretty nice i'll take it so here is the second game this is an ongoing match and we came in and we were down to zero so um i kind of expected to just lose either we would lose the third round or we would like come back a couple of rounds um but you'll see how the gameplay pans out i thought it was a pretty cool gameplay so so so so um i just want to drop a shameless plug for the channel memberships here have you made it this far i really appreciate you watching we also have channel memberships available on the channel and a few people have already signed up for the gold deer which includes the benefit of being able to play games um with me and i will you know record and maybe we can get some cool

whispers with like the cupped hands like this let me know what you guys think of it i've just kind of been including it in the videos recently and i feel like it would sound good but i'm not entirely sure i've made some videos with the um the candy box and you guys seem to really like that i don't have a candy box tower just have the um the pouch with the gummy bears in it but maybe that's enjoyable who knows so so so i need to get some more gummy bears out excuse the sounds unless they're enjoyable then you're welcome i guess these gummy bears are very very good you can't go wrong with some gummy bears let me know what you guys think of the new siege operator i almost have 25 000 renown and i kind of want to know like if he's worth getting and like showcasing he seems pretty cool um just i don't know if it would be worth it for you know because i still have let's dive enough i could probably get two you know like 10 000 renown operators or like a 10 000 renown and a 15 000 renown um instead of getting him but if he's truly that good you know then maybe i'll uh i'll jump on the hype train and make a video for you guys so so all right everybody there it is that is the end of the gameplay i appreciate you guys watching this video i hope you enjoyed it and i hope you sleep very very very well good night", "7E4h_jZAoII": "we love gummy bears and this time we're freezing them in

we're gonna make flavored candy also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music] I'm rolling up all your good and all your gun [Music] this is not for you no chocolate for your dog you", "0gsvUuwBZVo": "hey everybody welcome back it's Master\nBlaster we're back at Johnny's green extractions and today we're in the\nkitchen we're gonna make gummy bears today and we're gonna infuse them with\nshatter we're gonna make 100 gummy bears here we're gonna use half a box of\njell-o two packs of gelatin maybe a tablespoon or two of our vegetable\nglycerin and we're gonna use our shatter here there's seven grams in here this\nshatter has to be decarboxylated which means it has to be heated to change the\nform of it from a THC a to THC so that you can get a medical effect from it and\nwith that being seven grams that will break down into point forty five\nmilligrams of shatter in each one of these gummy bears so they're going to be\nquite strong because they are for our own personal use and basically a medical\nused to help you sleep etc I just want to stress the point here that these are\ngummy bears and if you do happen to make something like this it is so important\nthat if there are children around whether it's grandkids your kids nieces\nnephews friends that have kids any kids that come over you can't just hide this\nstuff you actually have to lock this away because if a kid did get into it\nand they do seem to find things they will be hospitalized so everybody keep\nthat in mind and that's with all all edibles that you make that are THC\ninfused okay so our first step here is we're gonna decarboxylate this shatter\nwe're gonna put it in the oven at 200 and\n50 Fahrenheit for half an hour all right that's our first step here all right everybody we decarboxylated\nour shatter we melted our jell-o mixture it's warm remember everything's in low\nheat now we're just going to melt our shatter right into our liquid here slide\nit over to the heat pretty sticky   okay go we're gonna mix that in here now ok we got our hot liquid here we\nadded a teaspoon and a quarter of food glycerin just to disperse the shatter\nin here now this is a little tricky to do so we've got to move quick here here\nwe go and basically that is it okay everybody this is master-blaster\nsaying thanks for watching give us a thumbs up subscribe peace and we'll see\nin the next video bye guys", "MTn3wB7_Jnc": "hey guys welcome back to our channel so today is gonna be a little bit of a different video we're gonna be testing out these little gummy bear molds that I got from my sister-in-law she actually sent them over for the kids for Christmas and yeah so we're gonna try them out we did actually film this video yesterday and I filmed it with my kids but the recipe didn't come out very well I think I might have made a mistake on making it so I'm gonna add a little bit more gelatin today and we're to see how these would come out so these molds you can buy on Amazon for about $8.99 I have mine here in my dish rack just dry now cuz we did use them like I said they were just kind of like jello just a tip on these gummy bears they're not like your regular gummy bears tell you buy at the store but they are a lot healthier I'm gonna be using four ingredients you can use even less if you want to just put juice with them but and you do have to keep them in the fridge and I read that they can last up to two weeks in the fridge and a container so they're not like the gummy bears that you get in a package but if your kids like little treats like that then it's perfect so what I'm gonna be using today is just this pineapple juice I got from Walmart you're gonna want so any kind of juice that's not from concentrate and then I did go ahead and go on Amazon and bought the vital proteins beef collagen it's like grass-fed beef gelatin but this is the one that they saw at Walmart so I bought this one you need three tablespoons of gelatin a cup of your juice but I'm gonna throw in some strawberries so I'm gonna have to blend them up I'm gonna put them in there then measure up a cup with the juice here then we're gonna blend it and then we're gonna put it in the saucepan we're gonna add this gelatin let it it says that it has like bloom so you're gonna see little cracks on top and when that happens then we're gonna bring it up to a simmer you're not going to want to boil the ingredients then we're gonna add our honey after we take it off the heat because you don't want to mess up any kind of benefits from the honey so we're gonna do that and then we're gonna pour it in the molds put it in the fridge for two hours and we'll show you how they come out we'll let you know if they come out really good I did see a bunch of cool like health ones you could just put like turmeric in these molds and honey you can make like cool little gummies for one like your stick or anything like that but today we're going to be doing strawberry pineapple gummy bears so let's get started [Music] so I just removed these from the bridge and it's been a little over two hours I tried one and it actually came out pretty easily this is what they look like they're super cute and the true test is gonna be the taste test so let you know they taste [Music] all right [Music] I don't phony [Music] okay good [Music] I'm Annina Seth keep them in the fridge for two weeks but these wouldn't last two minutes and my head yeah I like these I don't usually know as honey baby house honey well if I had one kid this would be like the best like your first kid when you don't give them junk after you have five it's like I think the two tablespoons of honey was perfect well I don't the rejects so there you have it your gummy bears let us know if you've made these before and if you have come up below on any recipes that you might have

In the early 1980s, experiments\ninvolving gene splicing and cross breeding led to\nthe birth of the gummy worm. But the masses were\nstill unsatisfied. Since then, scientists\nand engineers have been working around the\nclock to devise a solution. Something, anything to quench\nthe global gummy craving. That solution has arrived. Introducing the giant\ngummy bear on a stick. It's enough gummy bear\nto feed a family of six. Research shows this prodigious\npiece of candy tastes just like an\nordinary gummy bear. A regular sized\ngummy bear weighs about a tenth of an ounce. The giant gummy bear on the\nstick weighs over half a pound. That's about 88\ngummy bears in one. Beta testing revealed that\nthe prototype giant gummy bear was too unwieldy to\noperate with bare hands. Thus, engineers designed\nthe portability beam, known as the stick,\nto assist consumption. It aids in preservation,\nallowing the bear to be easily wrapped\nup and saved for later. With the implementation\nof the stick, the giant gummy bear has become\na mobile, mess-free delicacy.

fat and three because we're actually reviewing a hundred million gummy bears what's correct we are reviewing the ED of your 100 milligram Getti gummy bears today looking at in another this is another in this series if that appeared that we're going to be reviewing smaller dose to the last time we took these if history is going to repeat them itself these will taste awful and won't get me that high I'm hoping against hope that both of those things aren't true but there are no guarantees so the peanut butter minims just that just bad to help me get some of this as the best part of this th e so that's why I'm eating news those are gonna taste so much better than these I have a feeling alright let's open it up here oh man I thought last time this packaging was easy to open but now it's not looking so good balls all right I'm gonna have to grow grab some scissors technical difficulties back that's a negative anytime you have to go for the scissors she'd never have to do that finally finally let's give it a sniff oh man Oh smells like gummy bears with weed here we go that is awful oh and it gets worse it's got that harsh aftertaste oh oh they're so bad oh why would you do this to yourself and get gummies guys why why candies and goes-- why I don't understand it I really don't but I'm willing to keep doing it for you guys just because you seem to like them I I I'm not sure I get it so the head of pure 100 milligram gummies guys I'm going to finish these bad boys off not looking forward to it and I will see you in two hours to let you know how they are feeling and let's

head of your gummy bears 100 milligrams and nothing really I can't say nothing I little high it's sort of as equivalent if I had maybe smoked a small bowl recently so on about in line with what I thought not a good value proposition at ten dollars not at all they tasted awful tasted really really bad and I'm not very high there isn't really a lot to say about the etta pure gummy bears and then they taste terrible and they really don't get you that high I have a few more and appears to review and I hope things turn around for them and again I want to I do want to say that I think these are more potent than like the infused creations that I've had so take that as you will but you know just gummies and candies just don't do it for me they may do it for you edibles you know can everybody experiences them a little bit differently maybe they just don't seem to work but I'm willing to give ed up here a fair shake in the future reviews guys and I hope you will too should you stick around

you're a regular welcome back so today I am going to show you how to make these awesome Jolly Rancher gummies from actual Jolly Ranchers that's right so I make these with canister up you can also do them with the can of sugar if you want to know how to make those I do have videos they're made from textures there is a specific one can of sugar and then the other one for the can of syrup is can of flour powdered sugar and syrup not well show you how to make the syrup if you'd like so from the actual gummy art from Jolly Ranchers I've made these gummies and I'm going to show you just how to do that so it's usually I'm going to jump right into those ingredients and what we need to put that together and get it all put together for you so you can make these awesome candies well one thing I did I want to tell you so in the recipe I used three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I would recommend using four tablespoons of unflavored gelatin to the same three quarter cups of liquid so I I will put the correction in the ingredients in the comments I do sorry I'm they turned it a little bit softer than probably what I like so I would go with four tablespoons of the unflavored gelatin all right so now we'll jump into those ingredients and get right to her alrighty so for our Jolly Rancher gummies what we're going to need is about twenty of your preferred flavour of Jolly Ranchers so I'm going to use the blue raspberry and peeled of course take off graphics you're going to need a quarter cup of can of syrup that we're going to mix with this then for our candy syrup we are going to need one cup of white sugar regular sugar and 1/4 cup of can of syrup and a quarter cup of regular light corn syrup 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and a quarter cup of water for syrup then we're going to need three and sorry three and a half tablespoons to four so if you've got the packages of the gelatin you can just use the four packets they got a little bit off one you'll be good and 3/4 of a cup of water for your gelatin cold it needs to be very cold and then for our equipment we are going to need a candy thermometer a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler just use a pot where another heat safe Bowl will fit on top and that will suffice another pot for your candy syrup a couple of spatulas and then your bottles if you've got the bottles for dispensing your syrup if you don't have these guys these are great things if not you just use your eye droppers you've got those and of course your molds and that's everything we need to get started so let's jump right in and get it going alright so our very first step we want to do is bloom our gelatin so you are going to take your three and a half tablespoons and you're going to sprinkle it over your liquid you want to kind of get it all mixed around and then you're gonna get that you're gonna mix this in your gelatin into your liquid so you don't have any lumps and while you're mixing this this is a good yet to know whether your gelatin is a good strength or that it's not too old while you're mixing this it should already start to gel and while you're mixing it it should how to get turns to about the consistency of applesauce and that's how you know your gelatin is good and then we're going to just put that aside to bloom or total ready to loot till we need it now we are going to melt our our Jolly Ranchers and our corn syrup so we are going to melt our Jolly Ranchers and a quarter cup of our corn syrup all on our double boil just don't forget to put water in your bottom of your double boiler I've done it how come I plug it in hold on alright so we're gonna turn our heat on to medium medium or medium-high and we're gonna get our candy put your Jolly Ranchers into the pot mine got a little stuck in the bowl here got a lot of humidity too don't want to give it up gotcha and we're gonna put in our quarter cup of corn syrup our can of corn syrup and that eats up everything will begin to melt the Jolly Ranchers will start to melt you just want to try and get the candies covered and covered in the syrup just start getting things moving around but just going to continue to stir and this until the until your candies though the Jolly Ranchers are completely melted so it does take a while for the candies for the Jolly Ranchers to melt just be patient it does get kind of goofy and glumpy don't you can see that but just be patient it will all nose what I do is I let it sit for about a minute or so let it get heated up and then I stir it around breaking trying to break it up mush it down you just don't want to really overwork it does that just continue to do that your lumpy mess will turn into a nice syrup will see very shortly all right so now my candy start my Jolly Ranchers are all melted so you can see that a little better so we're just gonna set this off to the side for about five minutes to let that cool down before we add in our gelatin because if we add in our gelatin now it'll be too hot and it can break through gelatin that's a lot of problems that happens with with it so the next stage I'm just gonna let that cool down and we'll add in our gelatin and get that melted in and then we'll make that by the candy syrup and get it all put together so now that my syrup is cooled down it's time to add in the gelatin and I like to just do this and cut it up into smaller pieces and then we'll just plop we're all in and get that melting now you'll find if it's not melting you can turn your heat on to low put it back on the double boiler auctioneers probably enough heat from the water still from the double boiler to to melt the gelatin if it's not hot enough right still Cece was started melting because we have the cold temperature and the warm you can kind of have a separation here but once everything comes to the same temperatures and everything will mix together so you may find that your candy is kind of is starting to solidify getting a little clumpy well the gelatin is not really is not fully melting if that's the case then turn your heat on to low or just want to gently heat the reheat that up you just have to be patient with this because it is gonna take a few about five or five minutes or so for everything to come together properly you might think oh no it's not working but don't worry be patient so you're going to continue to gently stir this over the low heat until everything your Jolly Ranchers and your gelatin of all melts together in one even uniform syrup and there's nothing sticking to the bottom of the pot yeah once everything is melted together and everything's one uniform texture and color and there's nothing sticking to the bottom and now if you find here you may want to add a little bit of additional food coloring because the blue with the green it's gonna muddle that blue a little bit so if you do want that with more intense blue like your Jolly Rancher go ahead and add a little bit more blue food coloring it's just exactly what I'm gonna do here so you took the one out of much just one drop will make one to two drops at the mouth you can see the difference there with one drop me get that mixed in so that's a much nicer blue how well you can see that so I skip it too much then it's gonna I'm gonna spill it and not like we haven't seen me see me do that before so we want to see what the color is gonna look like you just drop it onto something white there and I'll just see what it looks like so I'm happy with that color goody-goody I'm just gonna set this off to the side and we'll get our candy syrup started alright so for our candy syrup part portion we're gonna pour in our 1 cup of sugar our quarter cup of cannister up our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our quarter cup of our sorry our half a teaspoon of citric acid and our quarter cup of water and we're gonna get stirred together so you just want to get it mixed together so the water and Evert the sugar in the syrups are all incorporated and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high forever this pillar so we're going to continue to stir this until until it begins to boil then if you have any duty sugar sugar sugar sugar crystals are so acceptance I just want to scrape that off or get a pastry brush and hot water and just wash down the stop then as soon as your syrup begins to boil you're going to stop stirring and we're going to watch your candy thermometer and we're going to cook the syrup to 260 degrees Fahrenheit and that's it just the letter go now periodically don't forget about your jelly the gelatin and your candy syrup you want to go around and stir that because it we can do start to solidify around the edges if it's like to pull off too much solid once once go around and just make sure that it's all still doing good but don't worry it'll get remelted once it gets out we added into the hot candy syrup whose life my candy almost up to temperature once you hit 260 you want to remove it from your meat immediately keep the candy thermometer attached because you want to wait until the syrup comes down to about 240 before we add in our other mixture the best is that you have a stone or marble surface to put it on is the best thing it draws the heat out quickly and and it doesn't get the surface doesn't get hot at all if not just put it off to the side burner and wait until your heat comes down to 240 all right so now my temperatures come down remove your candy thermometer grab your can you stir up your gelatin and your Jolly Rancher syrup and now we're going to gently pour it into our candy pot candy syrup here it'll probably bubble up a little bit and then you want to gently mix this and and continue stirring until it's all combined and you want to try to stir it gently to incorporate as little air MIDI as little air bubbles as you can but we need to make sure everything gets stirred there we go and once you're all good with air we're gonna get this poured into our bottles or you're just gonna use your dispensers your little eye droppers so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pour it through a little strainer this isn't necessary if you've got one great if not don't worry about it so because it gets so hot these gelatin may break a little bit you get that little bit of whiteness I can't really turn the pot that way for you but if you do you can run it through a strainer just so that doesn't get in and if not no worries it'll all kind of go up to the top I'm just gonna pour this in I don't want any left in here now one thing you can do is you can fill up if you want to know if your gelatin it's gonna set correctly is you can just set up one or two cavities in your in your candy mold put it in the fridge and it should start to solidify very fairly quickly within about five minutes or so it should start to set so you'll know if it's still really gooey and tacky then you may have difficult study let it leave it for twenty if after twenty minutes it's still not setting then the gelatin has gotten too hot or it is not it's not some notch Ellington's are all the same strength so it may not be strong enough you can remelt you can add that back into the pot and add in about another half a tablespoon more of gelatin so this way it saves you a lot of time and this has got to cool down anyway because it the bottles are too hot to handle even if I use the oven mitt you don't want to do it when it's super hot because what will happen is it'll warp your bottle and it'll screw them up so one of those will end up leaking on you so you don't want to do that so while my bottles are all that while I'm waiting for my syrup to call I threw a couple into the fridge so I'm gonna see how they're gonna set up now I wasn't setting you may find your bottles because the bubbles will start to come to the top and instead if any gelatinous broke them out White's gonna come to the top as well so what you can just do is get a little spoon and just scrape that tops kind of skin right off of there oh yeah that way it's not gonna end up into your candy and make it muddled want to have a nice clearer looking syrup all right so I did check my candies they are starting to set up nicely because the syrup is hotter it's taking them longer and I don't want to leave this get too cold so yeah so the velocity is really you just distribute it into the molds if it's still a little hot for your hands full you can use paper towels on it which is exactly what I'm gonna do cuz that's too small just hold up some paper towel to put around it I thought I don't go with the oven mitts because I find that they're heavy and clunky and that's it just disperse it into your molds and put them in the fridge for about two hours for them to fully set and I'll come back we'll pop these out to see what these bad boys looked and chase like I tasted the syrup and oh my god it's so good it tastes just like a jolly rancher now if you find that your candies don't set you put them in the fridge for two hours they come out and they're still sticky you can't get them out of the mold don't panic put them into the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours let me get good and frozen and then pop them out so I don't you have to do one mold at a time take them out one at a time pop them into a double boiler remelt it add another half a tablespoon to a tablespoon will be good enough bloom gelatin and that will fix that problem and the same thing if you you've gone you've made them set them up and they're just way too jelly they're very very jelly to sick you can still you remem and add in a little bit about a quarter of a cup of liquid and that should take care of that all right so I will be back when these are set and we'll pop them out and see how pretty they look all right so welcome back here so my gummies I have them sitting in the fridge just over two hours and now we're gonna take them out so as you see first it looks like they're gonna be sticky but you just got to pull around the sides and we'll start to pull away as long as they're doing that and you can pull them out you're good you're gonna slay them on your parchment paper or stand them up if you can some of your candies molds are able to stand up others won't so I bought these guys on their sides and then also when it's warm especially it's warm I only take out one or two molds at a time to take them out and leave the rest of the fridge so that they don't warm up too much if I don't have a hard time getting them out of the molds and then I'm just gonna let these little guys dry for 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go yeah if there is still a little bit sticky once you've dried them you can toss them in a little bit of cornstarch so you don't want to do too much usually what I'll do just coat my hands in them and then run my coat my hands and cornstarch and then just run my hands through the candy and just kind of get a very light coating on them the other thing is you could do the same thing with oil so if you want to just take some cooking water olive oil coat your hands to them rub it in and then just gently go over your candies look at a little bit of an oil that will help them to stop from sticking as well and there you've got it Jolly Rancher canna gummies look at that baby and these guys taste so good oh I tried one earlier I don't know if I'm gonna get these to drying time get them fully dried they're so good but anyway guys that's it for that tutorial I'll be back to say goodbye and yeah that's about it oh one thing is gonna tell you so if you tried taking them out of the molds and they weren't coming out they're too sticky as I said don't panic put them in the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours pop them out put them into a double boiler let them melt down again and then bloom a quarter or sorry a half a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of liquid blue matte add that in and that will take care of that problem recast them and you should be good that's awesome thing we working with gelatin and the either if there is a mistake you can usually fix it as long as you haven't burnt it oh and remember that this version of the recipe is just for playing gummies we are not going to sugar or citric acid these if you do they're going to melt I will do another version of the Jolly Ranchers of the sour version for you okay so don't add your sugar and citric acid to this they will melt so that is my tutorial on a can of Jolly Rancher gummies I hope you enjoyed that and if you have any questions as always please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and as I said in the beginning of the video in case you just skipped right over it use four tablespoons of gelatin versus three and a half it'll make that little bit of difference or a little bit softer than I probably would have liked but if you like a softer gummy go the screen 1/2 but if you want that more firm gummy go with the four and you'll be good to go check out that baby's its see-through ish it's got that clear candy looking it tastes just like a jolly rancher it's so good so please let me know if you give this a try I'd love to hear from you on which flavor you prefer and once again thanks so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "Rasb-rz1Hts": "- I love pot but, the people\nthat are making edibles need to slow the fuck down. (audience laughing) Oh my god, what're you\ntrying to do to people? (laughing) I had a pot gummy bear the other day. (chuckling) I think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldn't be able to steal your soul. (laughing) Right? What the fuck are these people\nmaking these things, man? (laughing) They're not consistent, that's\nalso part of the problem. You don't know what you're getting, 'cause they're not making the same place where they make Tylenol. (laughing) Now there's some greasy dude with a Grateful Dead tee shirt\nand a gray ponytail. (laughing) He's got a bowl of ingredients\nand he can't remember whether or not he put weed in yet. (hearty laughing) This dude's time traveling,\njust back and forth and just keeps chucking\nweed in there 'til it looks like lawn trimmings. (laughing) You eat it and that's not\nwhat you're looking for. (laughing) It's not regulated, you\ngotta ask questions. I ask the dude at the pot store, I go \"Hey man, how strong\nare the gummy bears?\" He goes, (laughing) That's not a unit of measurement! He's like El Diablo, El Diablo. (laughing) Fuck, man. How much should I take? He goes, just the leg. (laughing) Just the leg? Why you selling whole bears? (laughing) The fuck you tryna prove man? (laughing) They just watch you leave\nwith that bear they go, \"Oh shit.\" (laughing) They know, they know you're not gonna die. You gonna think you're gonna\ndie, but everybody lives. (laughing) Learn some shit, you learn\nsome shit from the scary trips. (laughing) See the thing about\nedibles, one of the problems with it being illegal, is that\na lot of us don't have a lot of information that we could use. Like there's a difference\nbetween smoking it and eating it. When you smoke it you get\nTHC, but when you eat it, it's processed by your liver, and it produces something\ncalled, 11-hydroxy-metabolite. That's five times more\npsychoactive than THC, and it lets you talk to dolphins. (roaring laughing and clapping) This is a real moment\nthat changed my life. (laughing) I was in Hawaii and we were\non a boat and we were fishing, we're pulling these lines behind the boat, and I was so high, I\nwas trying to figure out which way the Earth was spinning. (laughing) 'Cause then like the\nboat's going this way, and the sun's up there, I'm like, (long droning humming) (laughing) For like 20 minutes, I'm paralyzed. (laughing) So, while this is all\nhappening, these dolphins just show up, and if you've\never been around wild dolphins, they're very trippy. It's very different than you expect. Because, they look at you. They like check you out, they\nlike pop out of the water and they like look at you. (laughing) Like a person, not like a\nfucking deer, a woodchuck, they look at you like another person. Granted, I was so high I\nthought I was gonna die. (laughing) But, I'm making eye\ncontact with these dolphins and I start thinking, \"How\nsmart are these fucking things.\" (laughing) Because we're fishing, dolphins eat fish, but you never catch dolphins. (laughing) Ever. (laughing) No one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin. (laughing) And all I could think of\nwhile these dolphins are like hopping through the water\nand looking at us and shit. (laughing) I was thinking if people\nlived in the water, you fucking catch them all day. (laughing and clapping) They wouldn't even have\nto live in the water if cheeseburgers just\nfloated down Geary Street. (laughing) At least once a week a guy would be like, I'm taking a chance! (roaring laughing and cheering) And you see them get\nyanked up to the clouds. Fuck, we lost Billy, the\nbottom of his sneakers and a puff of cloud. (laughing) You don't caught dolphins on\nfish hooks man, that's weird. They're around fishing all\nthe time and like, psht bitch! (laughing) They're fucking smart, how smart? Well I watched a dolphin\ndocumentary, and it said, they have a cerebral\ncortex that's 40% larger than a human being's. I don't know what that means,\nbut if you say it right, and don't fuck up the\nwords, it makes you sound smarter than you really are. (laughing) (funky music)", "yJzm2iPjmdE": "good morning and welcome to WTF where we transform food here at the modernist pantry Test Kitchen I'm home cook hot mess mark Fischetti and I'm Scott Guerin the research and development chef here at modernist pantry and today we're talking about one of my favorite I'm gonna I'm not gonna lie my favorite ingredient in the in the modernist pantry catalog the druids grove vegan gelatin this is actually this was my introduction to the to the company and and to your cooking skills so this WTF is a particularly special one thank you for being here for it so here's what's really cool about this this is vegan gelatin but tell us a little bit about normal gelatin what that's used for and then where the vegan gelatin comes in so we'll kind of go over how normal gelatin is used normal gelatin would need to be bloomed in water if you're using sheet gelatin you would bring it out and then add it to something and heat it up or if it's a gelatin powder you would sprinkle it over the water bloom it again I'm sorry bloom it so that it hydrates and then add it to your that water to your mixture heat it up and then eventually after you heat it and cool it it will make a gel so that's the basis of what gelatin does now this works in a similar way as it does make it gel but you need to use it in a slightly different way you don't just you know bloom it if I were to sprinkle this over water it would start to clump up because it loves water so much so I'm actually going to do a demo right now because I need people to see just the difference between it because if it is a one-to-one replacement for regular gelatin but it's not a one-to-one replacement on the method of those recipes so if you just take a recipe that has gelatin you you wouldn't be able to use this in the exact same way you would get a very similar result but you wouldn't be able to use it in the exact same way so what I'm gonna do and the biggest thing you should do with this is if you have a lot of dry ingredients so here I have sorbitol super-tall is a sugar alcohol it's going to help sweeten our gummies without your raising the calories through the roof so oh okay so I have the vegan gelatin here I'm just gonna pour it in and then I also have right here is a citric acid so it's going to help with acidity and an in flavor I will talk about that a second about why the acidity yes and then this is sodium citrate and sodium citrate acts as a buffer because vegan gelatin it's not the biggest fan of acid and I know I added asset to this for flavor right but I need to add this to my water to help buffer that to allow the vegan gelatin to actually work so and I think it's kind of important to point out that you are dry mixing all your dry ingredients first whereas normal gelatin you might just lose so the reason why I do that is that I'm dispersing that vegan gelatin into a large amount of sugar or sorbitol or whatever you're mixing it in it can be a small amount too it just helps break it up and evenly mix it with the water now this looks like a lot but if I take this here and this is just some liquid that I have that sodium citrate in there and you'll see it just mixes in very easily and it won't clump the last thing I have to do is have a little bit of flavor we're just making vegan gum so if I were to make this and then pour it into a large mold as you can show them right there we're gonna have a giant gummy bear and you can see one that I already have made through the magic of television or internet television the magic of Internet is so so very simply and you can see it's a nice fluid here yeah and I'm just gonna pour it right into a pot and I'm gonna bring it up to a simmer the reason why we bring it up to a simmer is that it needs to activate so when I heat it up it's going to hydrate which it pretty much just means dissolve yeah it's going to dissolve all those little bits of vegan gelatin and then when I cool it it's going to turn into a gel now temperature-wise am I looking for would be looking for a different temperature than we would be looking at it's a a traditional gelatin recipe like is that a modification to watch yes oh absolutely when you're using vegan gelatin it it gels just like gelatin sure but the properties are slightly different so it's going to up here a little bit it's going to gel a lot quicker than regular gelatin if you ever made it like a gel of desert you take it you pour it into the glass molds and he put it in the refrigerator or the kids would stare at him for three to four hours before they're even ready they start to or or until the end of the episode in this yeah so you can snack all you want okay with this once it hits 140 degrees it could still be pretty warm to the touch it will still be warm to the touch but it would be gelled yeah so if this happens a lot faster so you can have dessert ready you can make this almost album new you can make it and have it ready at when it hits the table so it's pretty good as long as you're doing it in small amounts like I'm making gums or what yeah like this you know mold this big that that'd take a while but yeah not really this took what like 20 minutes in the ice bath if that yeah as long as it was set up and I could pop it out yeah see it right here I made one this morning and that's when you go with like the aggressive giant gummy bears and you're doing the little drop since we yeah that's all how long it takes that that the cold temperatures to get through to the centers that are very easy so we can just see it heating up right now no this works with a lot of different recipes it doesn't just have to be a gum or like a jello style dessert this can replace and I know you get the recipe when you actually order this product gelatin that's usually found in marshmallows yes that's how I met this product and you were like look we get marshmallows I was like wow life change they're not dense the only additive that you add is a versa whip which helps with the kind of the fluffiness of the marshmallows but you get a beautiful vegan marshmallow that tastes just like a normal marshmallow I wouldn't yeah if you have a friend like the freeze dryer like we have it was the world's largest Lucky Charms Marty absolutely about five pounds so one of the things you'll notice well that's kind of getting yeah well it's doing its thing is we've got our mold in an ice bath that's not necessarily a recipe thing that's a you know these these aren't a modernist pantry mold this was just something we picked up you know it's the plastic molds not the silicone molds that was a learning experience yeah because it's the first one we it looked like a pug yes so this does heat up quite warm and if you see it on the overhead you can see it I'm coming up to well over boiling temperature there's so much sugar alcohol in here that it's going to need to come up a little bit higher so I pour it into the mold and the first time I ended up with the almost nothing so I just put it in a little bit of ice bath and that's gonna have really helped it set almost immediately yeah now if you happen to have a silicone mold these ones do come from mana dispensaries yeah I did actually yeah I couldn't be one-to-one it's what you used for the small gummies right yes definitely want to treat yourself to the silicone mold over a cheap plastic mold you'll just have a much better time with it you won't have to worry about the mold melting on you plus super super super reusable for all of your things and one thing that's different about these is you don't have to dust with cornstarch or anything like that you can it helps get them out but I was able to just pour it right in there very easily and then pop them out within maybe 10 minutes because they set up so quickly yeah so it's good because we wanted to show people how to use this product if we had I think a few comments last week about a again do a demo and yeah we won't be able to do one every single week because some things are a lot more difficult a lot more time-consuming but this is so simple we want to show you how simple it is that you can make it gummy now it won't set up unless we want to sit here for about you know 10 20 minutes Francois yeah so but we'll show you that once I get it in there and then yeah give it about 10 20 min so you could have a giant gummy bear to show off for your friends for those of you playing at home yes this means that we will have access to two giant gummy bears so if you're in the area I don't know so if traditional gelatin is made from from animal based products this is actually made from red seaweed so it's whatever gives the seaweed its its structure you extract that and you start at phones ringing yes a little bit yeah so whatever gives the red seaweed its structure its extracted and it gives the gelatinous structure and as we can see right here I'm getting a nice boil on our vegan gelatin gums so I'm just gonna stop but I'm gonna let it cool down just a little bit before I pop it into the mold I don't want to pour it in directly because it's so hot at this point I don't want to melt any bit any bit of this mo because I do want to reuse it will have another puggy bear yes um so yeah you would say it comes from it comes from in this case it's a red seaweed if there are other seaweeds and if you just like where to Google vegan gelatin agar agar is kind of a commonly used one this one's not well one it's easier to use than they are certainly yeah it's about the same it's just all dealing with the texture yeah because we want the texture that's going to simulate traditional gelatin as closely as possible if you want to just just show them that the jello desert the wiggle of this so it's it's crystal clear yeah and it jiggles and but it has a nice creaminess that is very similar to gelatin yeah and that's one of the things I really like about this is that it's not just for items that have gelatin in them yeah I like to kind of replace a little bit of like eggs that are in custards for vegan custards and things like that because you get that texture if you mix it with it with soy milk you really get like a beautiful almost you know creme brulee kind of flan which you've had and yes like that you can make some really amazing things so it's not just a one-trick pony it doesn't just simulate joked and it simulates a lot of different things in it I think the testing will really show over time is like well how versatile this is yeah and just the big big big things to look out for is make sure you try mix it first no matter the recipe I know we're gonna keep hitting on that a lot it's because otherwise as soon as it hits water it does like clump as long as you try mix it even with the sugar that's in your recipe or whatever it'll so I just want to show everyone that it sits nice and fluid it's not clumpy if if it does clump up for some reason it may be that you did the the recipe wrong or the recipe ratio is wrong that you got we do have a few recipes that we are you know putting out there for you guys if you go to vegan gelatin if you search for vegan gelatin on modernist pantry com you see this exact recipe right below it so it has all the links to the ingredients and a very base recipe that you can make any flavor that you want yeah super simple I'm use myself as home kitchen hot mess I do mean it I even I pulled off this Gumby recipe no problem yeah so I'm just gonna actually pour it right in I'm just gonna fill the base no I made a half gummy for you to take home that's fine yes two full gummies is a finish it great I don't want to look like the vegan gelatin um all right so you know to kind of play around with it and get going with it vegan gelatin just to do the quick break it's $15.99 for this four ounce to put that in perspective for the home cook that's sixteen packets of traditional gelatin is worth so you do get quite a bit of playtime out of this whether you're going for confections it's also kind of good we were talking we were chatting about shallots and uses about including it in your stocks right this is something you do even with traditional stocks to add a little bit more of that mouthfeel yeah so so if you get like a canned veggies stocker or whatnot from the grocery store and you add a little bit of this and obviously I would dry mix it with maybe a little bit of salt or something or if you want to you could put it in a blender and then slowly sprinkle this in if you're not adding any other 3d in so that's another easy way to add it so I'm do that and then heat it up it will add a little bit of viscosity to it when it doesn't hot this is usually done in very small amounts so you don't want it to turn into a thick jello because jello no veggies dog is never gonna be thick jello it yeah it sounds awful yeah exactly but for that nice little bonus and mouthfeel that you typically lose this / - I make my own stock it's it's watery but because it's all veggie stuff it's quite it's alright so this is gonna set up before a little bit while we stare at it longing Leigh we always in these WTF stalk about not only where we transform food but what's the food we talk about what's the food babe better what's food possible you may have noticed this in our last episodes this one's probably gonna be a little bit different because with vegan gelatin it's all about what's the food made possible and in this case it's everything would traditionally rely on that gelatin that animal-based gelatin was just a reliable one just one replacement so here's a little thing is it each one of those packets from like if you bought a powdered gelatin it comes in packets now each one of those packets is seven grams so this is exactly seven grams I believe it's a teaspoon that's in one of those packets as well so if you see a recipe that says add one packet of whatever gelatin powder gelatin if you take seven grams of this or a teaspoon and you add it in and in just the way I showed you I went in bloom if the recipe says the bloom disregard because you're using something slightly different so if you add this in you're going to get the same thickness as you would in the traditional recipe because it is a one-to-one replacement yeah and now that you've kind of seen it done you'll know what to look for when you cook it but I got to tell you because I don't have the poly science wonderfulness an instant-read thermometer goes a long way especially just for your first time working with it and so you get used to the feel and how it looks when you're whisking it through the pan so an insta read thermometer the Druids grow vegan gelatin is if you can see it on this side here it is organic non-gmo gluten-free and vegan so that checks all the boxes for making amazing amazing things and this is a really really fun ingredient all right anything else we want to say all right no I to be honest I think it's one of my favorite ingredients as well just because it's so versatile and I've been able to make a lot of really great vegan alternatives to many items so awesome alright so

excited because today's video is super special it is a first for us we are celebrating and making a recipe for Mother's Day and it's special because this is gonna be the first Mother's Day that's not just for our mom anymore yeah this is Molly's first Mother's Day as a mom herself I got something so here I know why do you think of your sister and know your mama oh mama look at my mama over here you're an auntie this is this is so crazy I know I can't believe it our family is going I'm so excited about it and I really wanted to make a yummy recipe to celebrate Mother's Day and all the moms out there there was a bunch of recipes to pick from in our new cookbook and I thought let's really make it a treat let's make wine gummy bear yes I love my and so does Moe and Moe can finally have a little glass of wine now so we are really gonna celebrate and if you would like to make these non-alcoholic you can do that right moe yeah you can make them with orange juice or an apple cider or anything else but these are really fun because you can make them with white wine red wine or Rose a or whatever your favorite wine is my mom's side of the family is Italian and we just love lying we sip wine at dinner and she cooks with wine she's his wine when she's making like pasta sauces this is just a total ode to her it's a very yummy yummy treat so if your mom likes wine she may love this recipe I'm so excited this is the first time also that we're making gummy bears on the show homemade gummy bear and they're good yeah they're yummy okay Bo since you are the new mama mm-hmm which type of wine would you like to start off with we'll make that one we'll show how to do it and then I'll make more but which one do you want to start off with let's do rose egg all day oh we do a Rosie all day make these it's the same process with all of them whether it's rosy or a red or a white but we're gonna walk you through how to make the roses I'll make more as well and also before we get started when these are made like when they're all done they do contain a little bit of alcohol it doesn't bake out there's a little bit left over I think you have to eat like 50 of them for it to even be like half of glass of wine but I just thought I would throw that out there as a disclaimer that it doesn't bake out completely but you do have to eat a lot of them to feel an effect if that makes sense yeah okay so there was my disclaimer all right mo are you ready to get started I'm ready let's get started first step in front of us we have all of the ingredients and I'll be posting the ingredients and the instructions and the measurements in the description down below so if you'd like to make these yourself you can know take it away what's the first thing we do to make some gummy bear well the first no way I eat your hand sorry it's the Bears mouth here the first thing that you definitely need to make gummy bears is a gummy bear mold and this one is actually from the rope aching line yes that's ours and I love it because it has a little detail of the little bear faces and it has the little bear paws it's a little detail this is so cute we took so much time developing and designing this one but you can use any mold that you've got there's so many of them online but this is our favorite and it even comes with a little dropper that helps you get it in the mold so just like it's still everywhere which is something I would definitely do so this is wonderful I love gummy bears but I was like why don't they have cuter little faces so we put a little bit of detail but not too much and they're like just so adorable so I'll put a link down below to that mold as well know what's the first step the first step is to take some of your rose egg and mix it with the gelatin and then let it sit to bloom and blooming is just letting those materials come together combine and it kind of gets blooming is like if it gets yellow gets a little like grainy and it looks like jello weed takes about five minutes takes five minutes all right move show them how to do it we've got a little bit of the rose a we're starting with Rosie you don't drink it you mix it oh that's the tough part mo it kind of matches your shirt actually kind of yours too okay okay we do not plan this this is just a happy accident I'm all about it and then you mix together like this and you'll see it's already getting a little chunky and that's what you want but then you're gonna let it sit I don't even know the last time I was able to have Rosie come on it's like a year it's been over your mo has not had Rosie or any wine in over a year let's set this back to the side let that blue yeah we're gonna add this blue then what do we do next next step take your sugar corn syrup and a little bit more of Rosie and a sauce pot over to the stove we're gonna heat these up together for a couple minutes in the saucepan mix together the sugar corn syrup and 1/3 cup of wine and bring to a boil over medium heat once boiling reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes then remove from the heat and take it over to your baking station we just remove the mixture from the stove I'm placing it down here be careful because the pot is hot hot and while the mixture is still hot no what are you gonna do we're gonna add the bloomed of gelatin you can see it's kind of its kind of jelly it's kind of grainy looks like jello it really sticks together it's very firm yeah the gelatin absorbed all of the rose' which is what we wanted scoop it in there mo be careful mo just gonna keep mixing that together having that melt while Lou is doing that I'm gonna add our last ingredient citric acid then mix together till the bloom gelatin melts with everything else we're almost a wine go means oh that smells nice Molly doesn't that smell like a fancy little wine night it does like we could just watch some movies curl up on the couch and like eat little wine gummy beers yeah which is what we should do today we should we should do that once mixed it's time to strain our mixture this is gonna get rid of bumps and chunks before we make these adorable little gummy bears we want nice smooth delicious yeah gummies yeah we don't want chunky gummy you got smooth oh yeah in front of us we've got a medium-sized bowl and a little strainer do you want me to hold that yeah just be careful okay I'm gonna pour it in really slowly okay and then pour it through whoa nice and slow want to get everything I like this mixture cuz it really does stick together yeah scrape it in there we want to make as many dumi beers as we can no wine left behind no wine left behind oh look how pretty color this is okay okay let me see oh look at what we got here you got some clumps get out of here awesome clue we don't want that in New Guinea yeah get out of here okay now it is all strained and while it's still warm we're gonna put it into our gummy bear mold we can use these little guys they're like little droppers little teardrop bears they just you just fill it all the way up to the top yeah so mo tell us like what it's like to be a mom now I have so much respect for all moms out there I am so obsessed with Grayson like he is probably the best part of my day waking up like seeing a smile and cuddling with him and just seeing him name seeing him grow every day and learn new things it's it's the coolest thing he's so cute he's so cute how does mom life is it like like like tell me about it well you don't sleep you really don't okay it's been an adjustment but you just you get used to it learn how to function on a lot less sleep yeah that's right that's what you're doing and that's why you deserve a delicious Mother's Day treat that's right so this Mother's Day if you're not making her one of these do something nice for Mom she'll call your mom say thank you yeah cuz now mo knows how much work it is to raise a little baby and it's a lot of work okay baby Grayson is taking a nap right now but can we see him when he wakes up yes all right the tray is full mm-hmm and it is ready to chill we're gonna pop this in the refrigerator for two hours to set and then they are ready to serve also this recipe makes about five dozen gummy bears mm-hmm so depending on your tray size you might want to make a couple trays so she'd probably you press it in here I should really I'm gonna go put these

and we're gonna finish making some gummy bears yeah okay oh my gosh I think I'm back I'm back oh right mm-hmm the gummy bears have chilled and you know it's just time to pop them out mm-hmm in front of me I just have a piece of parchment paper but you can pop them onto a plate into a bowl whatever you'd like to know in your mouth all of them you have to wait they're kind of sticky so you flip it upside down and push them out just push them yeah fish your mouth Oh oh my gosh look at that how cute they are cute I love the details like look here musta come here they stand up like it up also oh if you ever make these and you skip the ingredient citric acid they just won't taste like a gummy it's hard for me to explain but when I was playing around and developing this recipe I need it without that ingredient and it just wasn't right it had the sweetness but it just have that Oh lemony likes it like citrus that that all the gummy candies have so I went to like our favorite candy place sugarfina and they have like champagne gummy bears and all this and on the back it had all the ingredients and I tried adding the different ones and you know what it was citric acid you are just a little bit of that and it just changes the game so if you're ever making gummies and they don't quite taste right and you're not using that ingredient that could be it that's the ticket as soon as I test baked and I added that ingredient and took a bite I went what what what that's a gummy bear they're going up and not just for wine gummy bears but any gummy bear if you're making like a juice flavor or you're making a sour gummy literally anything that ingredient is so important cheers to us I got a taste test okay yeah happy Mother's Day mo mmm I love this it's light it's meat and it's got that mm-hmm that little Turk after flavor and you can still yummy used even though it's such such such a small amount of Rosie that's actually in it you know him you still get the flavors of it which is delicious most favorite all right mo let's pop the rest of these out and then that let's make some other flavor yeah we have like red wine white wine and a rose a we can make some extra for Mamma Mia our Mamma Mia oh she loved it yes she would let me oh right cue the montage [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] tada here are the homemade wine gummy bears that we made today we have our rose a blue are red and our white yep and remember if you ever want to make these non spirited you can just replace the wine ingredient with any fruit juice like you could make these with grape juice yeah like a dark grape juice or a white grape juice you can do whatever you'd like you just evenly replace the ingredient again I'll be putting the recipe down below and we'll be taking lots of pictures

popsicles and I just wanted to see if they're a DIY or D I don't hey guys it's Rachel aka rclbeauty101 and you are watching DIY or D I jumped will retest out crazy DIY projects and see what actually works I really hope these air I D I do because I really want to take a cool Instagram picture of them so I'm going to use these really super nonspecific instructions that I found on the Internet but let's see how it works now what we're going to need is sprite popsicle molds and gummy bears so first things first take off the tops okay so I feel like the instructions are very self-explanatory but let's let's see how it works so I'm gonna take some sprite and put it halfway into each of these containers everytime I don't close the sprite all the way it gets so flat in the morning and then I'd rather yells at me okay now we're gonna take some gummy bears and put them in all of them you could do a design but like anybody got time for that and just kind of drop them in oh oh yes okay wait there's one minute here okay and then I'm just gonna fill it up to the top so now you just put the tops on and put in the freezer I'd mind if I look too much natural again so now I just pop them for the freezer and then leave them in there until they freeze and then take them out and set up like a cool scene thing and then take your cool Instagram pictures because I have very high hopes that these are gonna work okay so I just took him out of the freezer I left them until they got fully frozen and I'm really excited to see how they turned out because so far I don't see any visible flaws so let's see how this works out I'm doing a purple one okay why does my life suck like why is my life for the less than sign okay so we're not gonna do purple in we're gonna go with the green oh that's so disappointing I can't even see the gummy bears it looks so like it like you know when you're driving there's like frost all over the windows and you can't see anything this is so disappointing like I don't know II think if I try to take a good picture of this it would work out like even if I look a professional photographer so the gummy bear popsicle you are Addie I don't I'm gonna put this back and pretend that this never happened click over here to see the infamous pizza cake and then click over here to see the fun fatty candle how many guys to let me know in the

to you with a video on how I made these alcohol gummy bears these are actually gummy bears that I mean they're not gummy bears that you can buy at the store in soaked in alcohol so this is the mole and these are have I just finished those I'm just I just have to be mold them and I put them in these little containers whoops I dropped one I put them in these little containers like this so first we're gonna go over the materials your than me you're going to need a mold of course these moles came from Amazon they are the the silly pops molds I will try to find a link and put it in the description one of my customers actually bought these for me um she emailed me or she texted me asked me could I make these I'm like you know I gotta find a mold and she just went ahead and bought it for me so so you get four in a pan you get two blue and two yellow and it also comes with these little you get two of these little drawers you get a blue one and the other one you will need a measuring cup so I'm probably not gonna use this big measuring cup I'm just going to use these two so I have the 1/4 cup and a 1/2 cup you need jello of your choice I'm going to use strawberry jell-o I'm you need gelatin unflavored gelatin this is in the same section as the jello I purchased this one from Walmart also with the jello make sure you don't get the unsweet because my first set that I made was with us we jello and it was horrible it was hard I tried to add sugar to sweeten it up that didn't work it was horrible you and me after all of your choice so I'm going to do mango Ciroc yeah mango Soraka I thought that was making a speech containers that I store mean these are food wrecker teeners you can buy these from michaels is 2 4 6 8 10 to about 20 tensile pack for $5.99 there 4 ounce jars and and put three of these one should be molten you can fit three of these in a jar and think through what fit but you could see it three of those in the John alright so let's get started first thing you want to do wash it again so you're gonna wash your hands and so the first thing you do is you're going to measure 1/2 a cup of your alcohol and you're going to put it in a pan oh yeah and of course you will need a pee so you're going to put a half a cup of alcohol of your choice you want to put that in your sauce pan like so okay and you're going to you're going to take one pack oh I hope I won't repeat this is my first time buying this me and a pack I don't realize it came like this but oops I wrote that myself so what you're gonna do is you're gonna put this in here and you're going to let it dissolve it takes approximately five minutes for this to dissolve ten I don't have a good angle so it's gonna take approximately five minutes for this to dissolve so I'm gonna come back once the dissolve at a better angle so you guys can see okay so I'm back in it has been approximately five minutes and I hope you guys can see that where it's dissolving okay so then what you're going to do is you're gonna put a quarter of a cup of alcohol in there yeah I know this looks a lot alcohol and then you're gonna stir it a little bit more okay now it's really dissolved okay so then you're going to turn your burner on mmm now you can you can put this in and let it resolve over heat which of course it is all faster but you don't want to cook your alcohol as much because you still want it to maintain it take because we all know once you start cooking alcohol cook the cook the drunkness out of it or however you wanna say it so I'm just going to sprinkle my jello in here and it's my burner is on so once this once this jello dissolves then there to be done so it's not gonna take long for it to dissolve just a few minutes you can do this in a microwave as well um probably quicker well I don't know if it or not but you can do it in a microwave I've made jello in the microwave not alcoholic jello but I've made your little in the microwave before you don't want it to burn so that's mine that's why I'm stirring because I do not want it to run clean once I have it on medium heat so these the little jars that I put mine in so I'll sell these for $10 a jar and yeah I think that's a good price that's a big deal because yeah I think that's a good price all right it's slowly getting hot and you can mix like any alcohol any jell-o flavors I mean the possibilities are endless last week I did peach and strawberry this one that I have in this container I mean in this mold this is lemon and Hennessy and this one here is [Music] pineapple jello and pineapple pinnacle vodka almost there guys I have made some of these for my neighbor or the lady that bought the moles and yesterday she messaged me and she wanted some and then one of her friends on it's on so I'm like okay cool alright that's almost a song i'ma let it bubble once it start boiling get a little bubble to it and then um cuz normally that's how I know it's all dissolve when when it to get a little bored sore because if I keep stirring it's not gonna do anything y'all noticing a watched pot never boils if I keep stirring it it never will boiled but I don't want it to see so which this is a good this is a good pot this is a Rachael Ray pot it's a good scent so I don't think it's gonna stick [Music] and my next thing is making labels for these because when I made them for her before you know I just made them you know that was my trial so I wasn't making them to sell and then I've made some for girl at work I just put them in like little Ziploc baggies but now since I'm actually going to be selling them that's why I got these little jars and I'm going to make some labels and put on here I'm not sure what I'm going to put on the label yet but I need to figure it out because I can't just give a customer some without a label on it it looks like it's dissolved you guys it looks like it's dissolved I think it's all design so what I'm gonna do next is I'm a messy worker like all the way around so I'm gonna turn off and then I am going to pour this over in this measuring cup okay pour that over there and change my okay so I have a cord over in my cup so what I'm going to do now you can just pour it in like this but I tried that and I wasted so much alcohol you guys like my first cut because doing it with this it takes longer so porn is so quick so the first few times I make these I can only feel one for tray and half of another one well that's because I was wasting so much alcohol but now that I started using this I can feel three complete trays so you know that's like a lot of alcohol abuse so you're just going to we all know how to work these you squeeze your diaper let's put it in there now every time I pull this out like some sport out I'm not sure why so you just um put it in there and you just failure your mold just like that very simple no it's shooting out at me I'm not sure why and these are some cute little animals on here you have ducks there's um a little monkey the bear of course a lion that's a line yeah that's definitely a lion a duck so they're really really cute so I know you guys don't want to sit and watch me do that so I'm gonna finish that off camera but once they're done you just once you're done you just sit this in a refrigerator I I left mine in for like at least four hours so you're just sitting in refrigerator and then you could just this one didn't turn out so good cuz I oh my gosh I don't know if it's because I'm I had it on top of the stove when I had the stove on so guess what you guys this one is kind of messed up okay I think it's because I had on top of the stove and I left it stove on but anyway you just pop them out and they are like like here's the worm so you just pop them out after like four hours you don't have to put them in the freezer some people put theirs in the fridge you do not have to put them in the freezer I mean I guess you could for faster results but I just put mine in the refrigerator and I leave it in there for like four hours and it works perfect so thank you guys I'm going to finish filling this up and put this in refrigerator and get ready for work thank you guys for watching if you like if you like the video please give it a thumbs up please subscribe to my channel I'm sorry I've been away for a while but I will be more consistent with posting videos so I

their packages and Albany's world's best so we're gonna find out if it's the world's best but here they write this as well our gummies and candies taste different and by different we mean better

close that just a bit there we go he was getting a little the air was a little stale in there so you know i just want i just want to freshen it up no i don't think there i don't think he can even get

gummy bear safe uh this guy's having a seizure on top of the roof all right let's see if we can we can get one more safe house out here what is this a rocket can we oh oh all right wait can we can we launch this to space let's see fire oh my god there's actually a rocket in there why did it just peek out and then go back in can we put a gummy bear in there one gummy bear i put him in where is he oh there he is all right it looked oh he's going down to the bottom all right we're launching this gummy bear to space guys here he goes oh jesus oh that's whole that's this is the worst thing that could have happened i thought it was just like a space shuttle i didn't know it would blow up i wonder if the gummy bear being in it just kind of threw it all off maybe that rocket would have been fine if not for the gummy bear hold on i kind of want to see this now there we go we got to open the top first that makes sense now fire now fire come on why is it having such a hard time getting out of there is it constipated what's going on troon one way troon the other way i guess we'll true that way it just peeks out it's prairie dog and it won't go all the way up and then it blew up it's the worst worst missile ever all right well once this radiation goes away oh god it's killing me oh there we go hopefully nothing no funny business happens hopefully there's no zombie gummy bears or anything like that oh god oh geez he's got a sword look at this massive thing some some about his expression is even worse but the most terrifying part is that his ears didn't get any bigger he reminds me even more of shrek now all right well let's see if we can put something down um can i make him i have these things where i can make them more proficient what if i make him perfectly proficient okay he is now perfect if you couldn't already tell yeah he's now perfect all right maximum health 5 000 health um i'm gonna put down one cartoon cat actually no not a cartoon cat cartoon cat's too strong i'm gonna put down one bridge worm let's see what happens here if he gets him with that big sword all right now it doesn't seem like oh god oh what's going on here guys um hmm not not what i thought okay he died he has this big old sword but he didn't even use it hold on let me see if i can let's see how long it takes to kill this thing with this sword one hit it took one hit it took one hit to kill it and he couldn't do it they're not good at hand-to-hand combat or or anything of the sort they need guns they've got a bunch of star wars guns now that'll do them that'll do them well all right gummy bears gummy bears on an army of gummy bears bang there we go small small ears big smile big grin on him god he's terrifying why why who made this god okay let's go ahead and put down um i don't know let's say one siren head ah there we go all right the siren heads loose on the gummy bears now i've got a really good feeling about this uh well actually no they're all right it seems like they're trying to get inside but the fat one's clogging it up oh he made it through okay um siren has just gone wild on him but he is taking a lot of damage they are shooting him that's good guys i think they might actually kill them and kill him as they retreat inside they're all going inside it's i don't know they just they they require shelter i suppose but they're gonna get him real close and then then nothing then nothing oh can he get inside it seems that he can't get inside let's go on in and see what it's like for them in here ah yes okay that's uh they just see a bunch of legs and hands coming through i think siren head can get in if i bring him around this way can he get in oh oh nope still can't still can't get in they're smart i'll give him that the gummy bears they came in here and it seems like they're making their own civilization now uh they've got they're setting up i bet they're getting tomorrow they're gonna have jobs the next day they'll have prostitution bet right that's just how it goes with intelligent beings such as gummy bears um hold on i'm gonna give them some people to rule over all right let's get some citizens in here oh they're shooting at them they're throwing grenades at the citizens they they weren't built for this they're they're kind of mindless i made them that way i took out their brains oh jeez oh no there's a lot going on in there now i really stirred the pot by putting those uh putting those people in there it's really not good there's gummy bears dying they're killing each other i think the gummy bears are afraid of the people they're afraid to be eaten they don't realize that the people they don't feel uh they're not they're actually not real people all right i'm gonna have to take out the siren ad them i'm gonna have to finish them off they really can't do it on their own you know this is wrapping itself up really nicely jesus oh god oh he ate their head but not their ears he didn't eat their ears because they they had already had a bite taken out of their ears that's gross he only wanted the heads god what's what kind of sick freak just eats the heads off the gummy bears come on you got him big gummy bear you can do this okay you're weird ew what's going on with his stomach that's really gross get in there yeah big gummy bears getting them watch out all right i'm gonna say big gummy bear guys i'm gonna save him oh die couldn't save him well a lot just happened here guys you know that's just the way it goes you you get your gummy bears then all of a sudden shrek shows up bugs bunny siren head it's just a lot to unpack um i'm still processing what just happened i think siren had his too he's almost dead he's got a lot of battle wounds from uh from all this from whatever just happened um i think it just goes to show you things that uh the gummy bears aren't they're not very good in a fight you know give them a gun and they can they can stand on their own two feet for a little bit but eventually they're gonna be face down with their butt cheeks showing yeah i really don't know what else to say here all right rate my flip", "gwyTK2hK9pc": "hello everyone and welcome to making gummies 101 today I'm going to explain an easy and simple way of making homemade gummies if you dig this video please punch that like button and don't forget to subscribe for future and easy 101 cannabis videos today i'm gonna be using cannabis infused vegetable glycerin and we'll be doing this without using additional sugar however I will be using jello and that's basically pure sugar I do use my own homegrown and I will be making a separate video on how to make the glycerin so materials I'm gonna be using today are gonna be a pan a whisk a spatula some gummy molds and a syringe the ingredients I'm gonna be using is one cup of cannabis infused vegetable glycerin 12 ounces of flavored gelatin of your choice so I'm using the cause of the blue raspberry jello yeah the blue raspberry jello one cup of fruit juice of your choice I use real apple juice I really like the taste of it and it makes it can really bring out the other flavors easy it's kind of a neutral flavor I don't recommend using citrus juices pineapple juice or orange juice nope two and a half ounces of unflavored gelatin I recommend knocks it's very sturdy keeps everything together it's it's pretty hardcore as far as gelatin scum a quarter cup of honey or agave syrup I use agave I recommend natural honey it can be a little difficult to mix but you know it's a lot healthier so either way is good and one tablespoon of tart and sour or citric acid powder in this case I use citric acid powder so I've started off by separating all my ingredients by my citric acid powder my Knox and my jello I'm gonna start by combining all of my gelatin together once they're in the same bowl I can give them a proper stirring okay that's looking good next we're going to be moving on to the agave syrup and the apple juice I've already added the agave syrup to the apple juice I'm just mixing them together now once they are mixed I'm going to add them to the bowl of gelatin powder now I want to whisk this gently I have to make sure it's mixed properly so I don't have clumps of sugar stuck together and you know in the end ruining some of my gummies once it's finished put it to one side and let it bloom while this is happening I'm gonna heat up my vegetable glycerin it'll take about an hour and a half and in that time the gel will starting to thicken so right here I have one cup of cannabis infused vegetable glycerin it's been on low for about an hour and a half it does take some time to heat up and start to smoke so just be patient don't let it smoke too much though or it will burn keep it low keep an eye on it and keep stirring it circularly every now and again with my molds lined up I'm ready to pour my jello into my vegetable glycerin since my jello has been sitting there for an hour and a half it's giving it time to solidify a little bit from here I can scrape it out of the bowl directly into the pan it's good to use a spatula for this part just to ensure you're not wasting anything and you get it all over the bowl at this point I'm going to use my whisk just to give it a nice gentle stirring it's okay if you want to turn the heat up a little bit at this point just to help melt the jello as long as you keep stirring it and afterwards you turn it back down again it's too high for too long you will burn you're just doing this to melt the jello once it looks thoroughly mixed in it's a good color and consistency to you grab your syringe as you can see I have assistance but it's okay if you're by yourself and you have to stop stirring to fill up your molds as long as in between filling your syringe you just give it a little stir give it a little stir so right here I'm basically just showing how I fill them up I'll edit this speed up the process but I try not to keep the syringe too high above because then it can create bubbles and your gummies and just visually it's not very pleasing that's all [Music] my personal favorites are the snowmen the very big you know I can use one syringe or I can use four syringes for me it's nice because it's a great way to control the dosage so I'm just gonna finish up these last little few right here make sure I finished with everything in the pan and then I'm just gonna pop them in the fridge give them a chance to cool down and get them all ready now for the final process I'm gonna keep them in the fridge for 8 to 16 hours usually the longer the better so they stay solid now that a few hours begun by I'm ready to take them out these those are my bears thanks to the Knox gelatin this should pop out righties look at that hey mister bear you look pretty solid I can actually identify what you are cool beans once that's done we can bag them and tag them so here's all my gummies in total not you shabby we got our festive snowflakes good our presence went mine done ripen one of those Halloween on Christmas we got our spiders we got our bats oh yeah and up here we have our snowmen well actually two sets of snowmen the badness to Frosty's you can see how thick those are my personal favorite and then there are smaller counterparts right there alright everyone so that's it thank you very much for coming by and checking out this video I hope you liked making gummies 101 don't forget to Like and subscribe for future videos and any comments or anything as well please feel free to drop them I'd be growing happy smoking happy eating", "DGbITXSfySg": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is Liz and this is the first time you're stopping by and the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much for joining so today I am going to show you how to make real fruit gummies yes made with real fruit so you can use frozen or real arms not frozen fresh fruit that would be the word fresh or frozen I prefer the frozen however like I said you can use either and you can make these yummy yummy cannabutter and fruit snacks now your kids would love these too - the can of butter obviously but if you want to make a really nice candy for your kids just follow the recipe along it just exclude the can of butter and the guar gum and you've got a great relatively someone okay you're sticking fruit in it so we can call it somewhat healthy candy for your kids alright guys so let's jump right into those ingredients what we need to get started and yeah we'll get these made oh one thing I want to tell you if you are because we're using real fruit you do need to use a mold inhibitor lorraine's makes one so it's called Lorraine's mold inhibitor I however do not have it if you do not use a mold inhibitor you will need to keep these in the refrigerator you won't be able to keep them out for like two three weeks on the counter because they will get moldy if you do use the mold inhibitor however you will but I do not have it so I'm not using it but I just wanted to let you know that piece of information so with mold inhibitor you can keep them out and we'll have a lot much longer shelf life without it you're gonna want to keep them refrigerated and get the meat and fairly quickly alright so for our gummy fruit snacks what we're gonna need is about two cups of fruit so I use frozen fruit I just find it's way easier you so you can use any favorite any favorite fruit that's you like I'm using a mixed berry combo so it's blueberry strawberry and blackberries the only fruit that you cannot use is pineapple and I think also mango because it has they contain an enzyme that will not allow gelatin to set but other than that you're free to go so it's said you can use fresh fruit or frozen fruit and I said you can buy one about 2 cups we're only going to use about a cup the extra you can always freeze and save for later then a for our candy syrup you're going to need 3/4 of a cup of light corn syrup 1/2 a cup of granulated sugar and a quarter cup of water now if you have a can of syrup or can of sugar you can absolutely use those as well so again you want to split part of it so quarter cup quarter cup however you want to split that up you could absolutely use those but today I'm just demonstrating with cannabutter now for the rest of it what you're going to need is a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/4 cup of sugar granulated sugar another quarter cup of granulated sugar that we need to premix our clear gel with you're going to need instant clear gel now you don't have to use this if you don't have this you can eliminate it but what this adds to is makes that candy a little softer instead of being so gelatin like it makes it that softer that real candy texture loves of fruit snacks so this is an optional if you've got it if not you don't need to if you do not need you are not using the clear gel eliminate 1/4 cup of the sugar you're going to need three quarters of a cup of ice cold water or blooming your gelatin you're going to need three core three tables sorry three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin so it was three and a half tablespoons on a flavored gelatin and a half a teaspoon of citric acid 1/2 a teaspoon of gore gum now this is our emulsifier this is what's going to allow us to combine our butter with our water because that's a water oil mixture and you need an emulsifier in order to combine those two to become one so that they become friends instead of mortal enemies and that is it I believe so for this we don't need any extra color or flavor and that's what's really nice and now another side note for those of you who do not like corn syrup you can make a substitute called inverted sugar which is 2 cups of granulated sugar 1 cup of water boil it to 234 degrees as soon as it hits that temperature removed from the heat put the lid on the pot do not touch it again until it hits room temperature once you're at room temperature it's stable good to go if you want more details about how to do that check out my canna syrup video its basis in its making inverted sugar but with candy syrup just avoid via the can of sugar part that's all ok so that's all we need for our ingredients let's jump into our equipment that we need and we'll get going all right so for the equipment we are going to need two small sauce pans a whisk spatula the hand blender this is for emulsifying if you don't have one you can use the whisk it'll work you just have to want with really really hard but these are definitely an investment if you are going to be regularly making Jam and things like that you're going to need a candy thermometer now check this said I got this off Amazon it's a dual so let's pop the probe it's got that probe and then it's got a probe that you stick in the side which is awesome so I can just slide it in my pot and keep it on the side oh it's great remember the issues I always had before problem solved and you're going to need your distributing bottles these are a sweet sugar or bell I believe yes we took about I got links for all these equipment if you want just to make life easy you can check out what it is in the description there and then just a cup of hot water with a pastry brush or washing down the side of our pot that's pretty much what we need I'm sure I'm gonna throw some extras in there Oh obviously your bowls now a trick that I've learned with my molds is because this is gonna be a loser syrup and I'm gonna do two colors as always put your molds into the freezer that way wouldn't you put as soon as you squeeze it in it kind of immediately starts to solidify that way your colors don't bleed all together so it's a really cool little trick for you all right so let's get all those ingredients put together and let's make some fruit snacks so the first thing we want to do is get our gelatin bloomed and we'll be set aside and waiting for us so we're gonna add our three-quarters of a cup of ice-cold water and three and a half tablespoons of our unflavored gelatin and you just want to sprinkle it kind of evenly over the top or it'll be four envelopes of the gelatin approximately and then you wanted this to mix that in until it is well mixed and there's no lot and then while you're mixing this well how you can kind of tell that your gelatin designs your gelatin may not be thickening as well is while you're mixing it it should start to feel like applesauce the texture of applesauce now I'm feeling this is a little bit thin it's all dissolved and it's still not quite as thick as I'd like it so I'm gonna add about another half a tablespoon to that that's better so that when you mix it up and it's all dissolved that's the texture you want it to be so like a like an applesauce and then I'm just gonna set that aside we'll let that bloom and you need at least a minimum five minutes but it's okay it can wait longer okay so the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna prepare our berries or our fruit whatever fruit that you're using so we are going to put our heat on to medium high okay so the first step is our berries now what you're going to need to do is to prepare your berries ahead of time and we eat you're going to be to macerate them then what that means is I'll whether you're using frozen or fresh put them into a bowl instead about two cups you're gonna add a quarter cup of lemon juice and two tablespoons of sugar mix that all around cover it with saran wrap and put it into the fridge for a minimum of two hours if you are using frozen fruits if they're going to be about four hours or you could just leave it on the counter that's no problem and you want one you get will create this really nice syrup and everything will be defrosted dissolve whatever defrosted not frozen anymore do that ahead of time so the first thing I want to do because I've got a lot of seeds and extra stuff I'm just going to strain off the extra juice and those seeds now what you can actually use that juice for don't waste it is if you're a baker you can make a simple syrup with it so add about half a cup of water a cup of sugar boil it for two or three minutes and and that's it letter B and you've got a simple syrup that you can then use on your cakes to cope your cakes with you know those Decorah the american bakers and all that stuff hot they're always putting those things on youtube can do the thing so I'm just getting a little off that excess juice here well obvious I'm not going to get the seeds that I'll get those out after when we when we mush it down when we purify it so I'm going to add a quarter cup of sugar to that get my spatula and we're going to turn our heat on to medium high and you're just gonna mix that around we're just going to bring this to a boil for about two minutes my berries are coming to a boil here don't have better angles so you're just gonna continue mixing that like I said we're just gonna boil that for about two minutes and then we want to get our hand blender ready all right so my little berries and then boiling here for a couple of minutes this is just a soft in the month so that we can purify them puree them not purify puree them a lot easier and if you're using fresh fruit you may need to go for about five minutes and you're going to get your hand blender be very careful cuz it's gonna be hot and be careful if anything splashes up so we are going to puree okay so you're going to continue to blend that until it is completely purified all your fruit is completely blended and there's no major chunks and I'm just going to strain our puree to catch all the seeds and any fruit chunks that did not that did not get liquefied pureed [Music] and then you're just gonna work your puree through your strainer takes a little while just scrape off the bottom a little bit of a pain but you inside necessary to catch like I said if you're definitely using berries or fruits with seeds and also to make sure like I said any fruit that doesn't get purified if you don't want any chunks in your candies so just continue that until you can't get anything nothing else is uh working its way through the mesh and you're just gonna have kind of a puppy puppy mutt mush left okay then once you've got all that we want to measure out about it we're going to measure a cup of our fruit puree a lot worked out pretty even all right okay so now clean this off quickly it's a rinse off your blender because you're going to need it again and we are going to take our pure heart root puree put her back in the pot and we are going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid citric acids help key things to help bring out the fruit flavors the tartness and the fruit flavors as well as it helps prevent crystallization just mix that in and now we are going to you're going to premix up here our clear gel so we're taking a quarter cup of granulated sugar and we're going to take one tablespoon our cereal and it needs to be the instant clear gel the cook you have to cook it for five minutes boil it at a vigorous boil for five minutes and we can't really do that with our fruit so you wouldn't want to use the instant if you are using it they're gonna cut together we're gonna set that we'll just leave that there for a moment so now we are going to add our can of butter to our puree work fruit puree say that ten times quick so first drop in your melted can of butter let make sure to get a roll and sprinkle in a half a teaspoon of gorgeo and you want to try and get that kind of mixed all around not mix like sprinkled even kind of evenly around like so can't really see there that doesn't help sorry and I'm gonna actually angle the camera because I want you to see the emulsification okay so we're just gonna kind of just stir that in a little bit to begin with make sure it's not stuck to the sides and we are going to get our a hand blender [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] now this can happen sometimes because I let that gourd sit for a minute or two while I was setting stuff up it started it started to clump if that does that you end up with any lumps in your mixture don't worry about it just run it through a strainer and it will catch those lumps and you're always good [Music] which I am going to have to do here so watch doesn't always happen if you actually mix your gore and your guar gum into a little bit of your butter first it will melt and you won't ever have that issue I kind of forgot that step okay now if you're using the clear gel you need to do this last step if you're not using clear gel just set your puree aside and we'll be moving on to our candy syrup so you're gonna put your pureed back into the pot on medium low heat after you can turn it up to medium we just need to get it keep it up and get it started boiling now this see what an emulsifier does you can see that there's no oil separation between your water and your and your oils the sudden it makes them friends and yes you can use soy or sunflower lecithin you could use about a teaspoon of that I'm just gonna get my wrist candy and once our mixture comes to a boil turn off your heat take it off the heat and we are going to whisk in our sugar and clear gel mixture so I just do a little bit at first get that way now let's get the rest of it in so that what this creates is a softer texture to your candy versus that being more of a gelatin okay so we are going to let this we're going to set this off to the side and now we're going to cook up our candy syrup all right so to our pot we are going to add our half a cup of sugar 3/4 of a cup of corn syrup and our 1/4 cup of water you can just stir that together and turn your heat on to medium high but you're going to stir this until it comes to a boil once it starts to come once it comes to a boil we'll have our candy thermometer and cook it to 275 degrees and this one you're gonna want your cup of hot water and that pastry brush to clean down the sides of your pot Thanks so my search beginning to boil so at this point I'm going to stop stirring and we are going to cook this to 275 degrees now for those who will cook syrup for the first time yours your temperature will come up to around the two 2223 mark and it's gonna sit there for a few minutes this is when a large when your large majority of your water is starting to boil off so it is not uncommon for it to sit at that temperature for a while then once it does start passing that the temperature will start to increase fairly quickly so I've had a few people comment saying but it doesn't get higher than 220 you just got to be patient it will and again just wash down any sugar crystals that are from a farm on the side all right so we're getting there or almost a temperature all right so candies of temp I'm gonna move it put it on the stone here that will help take away the heat quickly so I'm just waiting for the bubbling to stop now we're gonna add in our few fruit puree okay so our bubbling is stopped or it's starting to subside there it's going to a syrup now when you do add to puree it is gonna bubble up again don't worry about that he may bubble up again and we are going to mix this stir it until everything is completely mixed together we're gonna stir this for a couple of minutes until our fruit and our syrup and everything gets combined and that extra sugar gets melted yeah if you find that the syrup is starting to solidify on the bottom no problem just put your heat on to low and we'll get that get that melted and you just want to eat it up and Toba candy from the candy syrup is melted and become syrup again we don't want to start it boiling and I'm gonna use the hand blender on that so that we can get every leave emulsified because we do have the oil you've just dyed it in some more water to that we're gonna use the hand butter to get that all also 5 now have a look if you see you can see it butter any butter rising at the top so you'll see like a little bit of an oil slick I'm gonna add in a little bit more gore gum to get that most of Isis what will happen is that will rise to the top of your candies and you won't have a nice mixture okay so what I'm going to do this time is I'm adding a little bit of oil and I'm adding about a quarter teaspoon of the Gorgo to it just mix it together I see how it dissolved this will avoid any lumping and now we're just gonna add that on to into our candy we get our handy-dandy blender now our last step is we are going to add in our gelatin so we've got our bloomed gelatin this will be warm enough for it to melt we don't want to have it on heat because gelatin will break very easily if it is too high it melts at a warm water bath temperature she's gonna break that up into smaller chunks and you're just gonna can stir that until it is all melted I'm just gonna give it one final mix here with our hand next blender and there we go now I'm just gonna let this sit for a little bit so that we can go so the air bubble isn't that can work out and we can have a clearer syrup mixture so instead of having it like this it'll become clearer so we're just gonna let it sit probably about 15-20 minutes or so and if it does stiffen up too much you can just turn it on low heat to remelt it and then bring the right on one nuke them then when the air bubbles rise up to the top settle at the top here you can just use a little small strainer just as scoop them off or you can also stir gently kind of break them but they're a little hard then as it cools if you help remove some more of those air bubbles is just going circular motion gentle circular motion and see how it'll pull with bubbles kind of all together in the middle then you can just take your scoop and just skim it off the top yeah I'm gonna get my bottles fill up my large one and I use a strainer to help to catch anything else or any extra seeds that mean snuck through or if it's gum if it's become a little too solidified you can just put it up back on the heat low heat or just a couple of minutes just to warm it up a little bit now half of this I'm gonna do is the translucent and the other half I'm gonna add a couple of drops of white to give create a solid background but with the same kind of color so it looks really cool gives you a nice contrast I'm just gonna give this a real quick heat up here so I just heated it up just a little bit you don't want to go heat it too much because you'll break the gelatin so just enough to make it a little bit more syrupy I live my technical terms so I'm just gonna add a couple of drops of the white food coloring mix that in and so see how I create that solid background alright so I just took my molds out of the freezer nice and cold chilled and I'm gonna get my two colors my solid and my clear and just pour yeahjust both together and you can kind of do any design you want what let me get that in a minute or just go half in half or a little marble effect and that's it just fill up your cavities and then you're gonna pop these into the fridge for about two hours and then we'll come back and take them out you can see what they look like alright so it's time to pop these puppies out let's have a look-see there we go nice and easy they pop out now these guys do not get sugar or sour coated these are just the plane the plane kind their regular fruit snacks with a little kick alright it's gonna get the rest of these guys out here you go haven't got clothes so check that out yeah I got the two-tone solid with the translucent they look pretty cool eh let's check out a dinosaur there we go whoa check that one out whoo-hoo all right so I'm just gonna pop the rest of these guys out and yeah so I hope you enjoyed this no sorry so what you're gonna do is if you have used the mold and immature you can let these dry out on the counter for a couple of days if you have not used the mold inhibitor you're going to put them into the fridge for about 24 24 or 48 hours to dry in the fridge then take them out for 24 hours but for the pretty much you'll want to keep them in the fridge in a sealed airtight airtight container I would not keep these out exposed if you haven't used the inhibitor for more than three or four days yeah because you don't want anybody getting sick and because you're using the real fruit and if they will likely get mold on them very quickly all right so that's everything if you have any questions at all or any comments that you'd like to leave please don't hesitate and thank you guys so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "mz_rNORTEbU": "Hola FG.

Start with a box of Jell-O, some corn syrup,\nand a few packets of unflavored gelatin. The small boxes like this have 4 packets inside,\nand for this recipe, you\u2019ll actually only need 2 of them. Get started by measuring out 1/2 cup of very\ncold water, then squirt in 1/4 cup of corn syrup. Cold water will help the gelatin separate\nproperly, and the corn syrup is going to give our gummies a nice smooth texture. Now we need the corn syrup fully dissolved,\nso give it a good stirring until the water turns completely clear. Then go ahead and\npour the sugary liquid into a pot. But don\u2019t turn on the stove just yet. I\u2019ll show you\nwhat happens if you do in just a minute. Go ahead and add both packets of unflavored\ngelatin to the pot, then pour in the entire packet of Jell-O.  Now it\u2019s going to take a minute or two for\nthe gelatin to absorb into the water, but take your time and be patient so you don\u2019t\nmake a mess. And keep stirring it slowly, until you can see all the gelatin is mixed\nin. Alright, it\u2019s time to heat things up, and\nturn this sugary soup, into a delicious candy syrup. Set your stove to medium-low heat, for around\n5-10 minutes, making sure to stir the candy mix every minute or two, to keep it from burning. While that\u2019s warming, it\u2019s a good idea\nto find something you can use as a candy mold, like these ice cube trays, I found at the\nLEGO store. When you see the gelatin has completely liquified,\nthe syrup is ready for pouring. And you should be able to pour it straight into the molds.\nBut be careful not to spill, because the syrup\u2019s extremely hot, and will burn you. Now if you see little lumps, clumps or bubbles\nfloating to the top, it\u2019s probably because you didn\u2019t start with cold water, or you\nheated up the mixture too fast for the gelatin to fully separate. But don\u2019t worry. There\u2019s a really easy\nway to fix it. Pour all of the syrup into a tall and narrow,\nheat-resistant container, like a large drinking glass. As you do, you\u2019ll immediately notice\nall the bubbles and gelatin lumps, start rising to the top. Let it sit for around 10 minutes\nto give it all a good chance to settle and cool a bit, and you\u2019ll soon see all the\nimpurities collect together at the top, and separate into a layer of gummy foam. Now check this out. All you have to do is\nreach in with a spoon or a spatula and scrape this newly formed skin away. Just like that,\nyou\u2019ve got yourself a beautiful, and impressively clean gummy syrup, ready for casting. And\nto make the next steps as easy as possible, I\u2019m collecting the magical syrup, in a condiment\ncontainer. These kinds of containers are perfect for\nfilling up your molds. They\u2019re super easy to control, and you can squirt the syrup exactly\nwhere you need it, which helps avoid spilling, or overflowing the molds with too much gummy. I gave these candies a few hours to cool,\nso you can see just how much of a difference it makes, to take the extra step and skim\nthe bubbles off the top, before making your candies. Alright, let\u2019s see how our gummy mix does\nwith a much more intricate, and detailed ice cube mold, like this one. And you might have\nnoticed that this time, the syrup, is impressively clear. 5 hours later, we\u2019ve got ourselves a batch\nof really cool, LEGO gummy guys. Which apparently, are balanced enough, that they can stand up\non their own. That\u2019s kind of cool. Now just for fun, I made a silicone mold from\nactual LEGO bricks, and a 2 part silicone mix from a special effects supply store.. Now you should know that when the syrup cools\ndown, it\u2019s going to shrink a little. So to compensate for that, try filling the molds\njust a tiny bit higher than the top. For one finishing touch, I got a clean LEGO\nbaseplate, and brushed it lightly with vegetable oil, then carefully placed it down on top\nof the mold. You can see the edges have little dimples, to help keep all the studs perfectly\naligned. So all it needs now is something like a heavy book to give it some weight,\nand hold it in place. I let these ones cool on the counter for around\n6 hours, and you can see that if we carefully remove the baseplate now, our little LEGO\ngummies, have small divots on the bottom, which means they\u2019re connectable. Let\u2019s take one of the bricks out out of\nthe mold, and take a good look up close. You can see there\u2019s a surprising amount of detail\ncaptured in the gummy snack, and they\u2019re not sticky at all, but actually quite firm,\nand they smell delicious. You probably also noticed they\u2019re completely\ntransparent, which puts their level of awesomeness on a completely different scale. Alright let\u2019s take this idea to the next\nlevel with different colors and different flavors. I tripled the recipes and made 7 different\nbatches. Then let them cool overnight so they\u2019d all be crystal clear. Now if you try doing\nthis yourself, you might find that getting them out of the cups is pretty tricky. When you do get them out though, you\u2019ll\nhave a gob of gummy, that way too big to eat on it\u2019s own. But that\u2019s ok because what\nwe\u2019re really after here is the white layer of gummy foam at the top. Now if you\u2019re really careful, you can use\nsomething like a kitchen knife to slowly trim the top layer off, which will leave you with\na huge chunk of gummy goodness. And these transparent gummy blocks can be re-melted\non medium-low heat, and molded into any shape you want. I made a candy mountain, of LEGO gummy bricks,\nin all kinds of colors, shapes and sizes. And if you look closely, you can even see\nsome little gummy guys in there as well. In keeping with the LEGO theme, I went back\nto the store and picked up a bunch of containers, just so I could have a unique place, to store\nmy custom candies. Now you could keep all your LEGO gummies separate,\nbut I ended up mixing all mine together and filling the containers with all kinds of random\npieces. How awesome is that? The best part is, if you snap on the lid and\nkeep them in the fridge, they can stay good for up to a month. Now since the gummies are interlocking, you\nmight be wondering if you can build things with them as well. The answer is yes, as long\nas you can resist the temptation to snack on them first. For one last experiment, try finding a handful\nof chewable vitamin C tablets, and powderize them in a blender for about 30 seconds. I\nused 8 tablets, or 4,000 mg for this batch, and when you mix the powder into the gummy\nsyrup, you\u2019ve just made your candies, vitamin C enriched. Of course these are a slightly\nhealthier version, but more importantly, it gives them a slightly sour taste, making them\neven more delicious, and extremely addictive. Well now you know how to use a few simple\ningredients to make a bucketful, of colorful LEGO gummies. That are stackable, snack-able,\nand fun to share. By the way, you don\u2019t have to make your\ngummies into LEGOs. You can actually make any thing you can think of. I converted some\nof my left over syrup, into an assortment of AA, AAA, and D cell batteries. Well that\u2019s it for now. If you like this\nproject, perhaps you\u2019ll like some of my others.

three [Music] this is actually one of my favorite strains it's called the green crack the flower is super good it's a set to you but I think right now it's a whack so you can't see it sorry [Music] [Music] I think I'm gonna do one more because those last few hits sucked okay now I'm ready I just look like that meme have y'all seen yet the cat where they said that's how little kids cough because that's me that's how I cough anyways onto the hall so this is our little goodie bag actually this is a really big goodie bag and then we're actually gonna start on this cuz this didn't fit in the bag it's called give me some mores it is a marshmallow a chocolate-covered marshmallow with graham crackers on it it's by hon ooh there's ten pieces ten milligrams each so 100 milligrams total those are hopefully gonna be good I'm not a big fan of chocolate really or at least THC chocolate just because I feel like with like brownies cookies and chocolate you can taste the weight a lot more and when I eat an edible like of course I want weed in it like THC but I don't want to taste it I want to just be like I'm eating a snack I think that's the point of an edible or maybe not I don't know that's not the point of it but they're better to me when I really just taste like a regular food but then [Music] it's you hard anyways I wanted to try belts for so long I don't eat candy generally but I really love those sour airheads the belts are the strip's whatever the extremes I think is what it's called are having out of it forever but those are my favorite candies and I found these I don't want their sour but these are mango belts there's ten pieces two milligrams each oh they are sour sour ribbon candy and then I got the rainbow belts which hopefully are similar to the extremes lemon strawberry and Apple and these are by Flav I've never had this brand so I'm gonna have to look them up but excited and then I don't know if I mentioned the chips that I got from blue roots cannabis but they were nacho cheese and they were so good they taste a lime Doritos they were better than Doritos and I got him again they had four different flavors BBQ sour cream and onion ranch and nacho cheese and all four they were a 30% off they were only like four dollars I got yeah I got to barbecue these are a potato chip let me read what it says potato chips infused with barbecue seasoning sauce and a Southwestern mix of herbs and spices the nacho cheese ones tortilla chips seasoned with cheddar cheese and a zesty blend of Latin spices and herbs the reason I say that they're better than Doritos is because they have these little spices I don't know exactly because it just says Latin spices maybe it says yes chili pepper paprika and cayenne pepper is probably what makes them taste better like I said in my video about me I like spicy food so maybe that's why I like these more than regular Doritos these are the ranch these are don't eat chips seasoned with a blend of ranch seasoning paprika salt garlic and onion delish I bet these are like Ranch Doritos cuz they look just like it then the last ones are sour cream and onion potato chips with the dollop of sour cream and dusted with savory onion and garlic seasoning these all look pretty good the nacho ones like I said 10 out of 10 I keep talking about them but I can eat those as a regular snack and not know that they have lead in them [Music] they have a little kick whole bag is 10 milligrams so it's sort of a lower dosage because you got to eat like all the chips but they're good then the last atta boy I have in the sugar packets these are by hot sugar which is a fat Panda company fat Panda is pretty known over here they have like edibles flour all of that there are 10 packets 10 milligrams each the guy at the pawnshop said you can put it on peanut butter and jelly and your coffee and your juice really like anything so I'm excited to try these I don't know what I'm gonna use them with but I guess you'll see the retie about all of those edibles is because me and my husband are going to Cape Flattery which is the most northwestern part of the continental USA so that's exciting we have to take a ferry and everything it's going to take us about four or five hours to get there so as you can tell by the title of this video I am going to eat twenty ten milligram edibles I have ten packets of the sugar which I'm going to put in and then I'm going to taste test the other ten edibles that I got in that hole [Music] [Music] I actually just realized I forgot how [Music] [Music] they live [Music] [Music] [Laughter] crack cocaine [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] to collect you [Music] [Music] really excited to try these [Music] [Music] [Music] as I said before I took 20 edibles ten where the THC sugar packets to chips for of the rainbow sour belts two of the mango belts and two of the chocolate marshmallow things my honest opinion on them was that they were really good none of them really tasted like weed so that's a big thumbs up on them on all those brands both of the chips were really good because like I said before I would eat those just as normal snacks definitely recommend those as a lower dosage of edibles to start out with the sour bills were good the main goal lines in the video you probably saw me make a really funny face it has a weird aftertaste but the mango ones do taste like Mexican candy so that's good it might have just been the taste I was in my mouth at the moment but I don't know it was really bad the rainbow ones were good they tasted just like the extremes the chocolate-covered marshmallows were super chocolaty I had to wash my mouth out with a lemonade really good because it was a lot of chocolate which I personally don't like that much but it was pretty good the THC packets I really couldn't taste them I just felt like I was drinking a regular old toasted white chocolate mocha as far as like what I was doing we were in the car for almost five hours so I just played on my phone I played a fun run I talked to my husband I was really sleepy then once we got to Cape Flattery we did the trail which was about two or three miles I really don't remember but it was fine the view was really really pretty [Music]", "P8NREvioh94": "what's up I'm JD convertible J and I'm going to show you how to make vodka gummy bears [Music] all right I need a some vodka I was gonna get some Rockwood this the price tag it is was more attractive so it's actually pretty good I'm drink the gin gonna need some gelatin repackage whichever one rips the most is the one you take some sugar some food coloring and some measuring cups pots whatever main thing is some trays for your bears I want to give a shout out to mushiya I'm pretty cheap so she let me borrow them she got them from Amazon and she said she didn't do that great with them so I'm gonna see if I could degree with them okay so you take a cup of vodka make sure you wash your hands first smells great this out the way and pan hot whatever medium little heat it's gonna throw it back in hmm how were you gonna see that all right pull this out alright don't change my pot I hope I get him to click away I said it for Christmas girl don't we need that much this way so we don't put the sugar in it first I've got to bring over the wine okay forget that oh and the spatula a few moments later alright so the block is already sweetened so I'm not buying it that much it really doesn't need anything people can't handle vodka this is actually going to be my contribution for Thanksgiving so just just not crazy stir that in here until it dissolves I have the heat and medium low I didn't see that already you don't want to brown off the you don't want to bear it off the docket okay don't want to burn off the alcohol one packet series packet o3d packet three packets and you gonna stir you want to stir it before it becomes big I got it these nasty chunk you see this so I got this recipe from tipsy bartender they didn't mention how difficult it was working with this gelatin because soon as you put it in there it becomes a big chunk of gelatin I think one recipe online said to let it cool I'm gonna add some food coloring I'm not doing that I let it cool within the whole bottom of the job to make sure got really thick at the bottom those extraordinary doesn't match whatever chunks you see to mash it vodka probably should have been hotter but I'm not taking the chance like I'm taking the chance chumps ain't going away it's a good thing the bottom of this pot is scraped off a little bit because I could see the chunks better in those areas see that sweat chunk that you can't see them over there though use an old pack when you're making this JV tip they look good it does a little steam alright I'm not burning anymore this [ __ ] alright ah [ __ ] that all right back to my spot all right go ahead should I wait till it cools down just a little bit just a little bit I let it cool down all right time to open a row we have all right so since it's pineapple okay yeah okay so that tastes like yellow and a little bit of red all right all right all right I'm going to show you how many drops I use I'm not pulling out the phone again why does the yellow look red on we're gonna do one right now dan it looks like pineapple mmm kind of satisfied with that kind of satisfied with the one truck the yellow just one more yeah turns out right that's it yeah you know what no red no red okay that's crazy all right stir stir stir mike tipsy bartender says we're just gonna sit this on a cellphone

them in the bowl that's it we're done", "Aa2NwPvyInc": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan HOF key operating officer of honey stick as well as Gold Line CBD and in today's tutorial episode we are gonna be calling it CBD gummies for dummies why not because we're insulting anybody's intelligence but because we are gonna break down in a very simple fashion of exactly what the differences are between the different types of gummies available in the market one of the most common questions that we get to our Gold Line customer support is what I hear things like full-spectrum isolate coated infused gummies what's the difference what effect does that have on me and our CBD there's all these gummies out there and no real explanation on what the difference is they cost different they have milligrams so this episode is gonna break down the main categories and differences for gummies what does that mean for your CBD in a very simple to understand fashion and how does that affect your buying of your CBD your supplements whatever so basically we have a few major categories for CBD now a lot of the products you'll see out here if you're familiar Gold Line you will see from our website some of them are not offered on the website but they are prevalent in the market so I think it's important to have them out here so we can have a full discussion even outside of the things that our company is currently offering so you're properly educated on CBD so let's jump into it right away what are the major differences between gummies were the most common questions that I get is what is the difference between isolate gummies and full-spectrum gummies and it's really simple it's what type of CBD DEET is being used isolate gummies are generally made from biomass and it is synthesized off of different hemp products and the CBD is processed and extrapolated until it becomes basically a hundred percent pure a beedi and it's in almost a crystallized form and it's really easy to calculate it's very easy to make different solutions for your gummies it's a very good effective way to know how many milligrams you're gonna get and to make sure that there is absolutely zero THC within your gummies so for people who might necessarily get drug tested or not want to roll the dice on having even any traces of THC within their gummies or their CBD products that they're taking I select gummies are gonna be the way to go so when you're buying CBDs and you're asking your manufacturer like us questions then you would ask whether they have isolates or their full spectrum now what is full spectrum full spectrum is basically gonna have traces of THC however it's still gonna be below the legal limit which is 0.3% for hemp according to the US farm bill now that 0.3% is even below 1% so it is extremely small portion of THC however some people don't want any instead of being processed over the the full spectrum is actually taken from you know basically the live plants so generally when I select gummies are very high in CBD full spectrum and broad spectrum you know made based gummies that use that type of CBD they will have other things like CBN CBG CBC and different spectrums within the CBD category to give you a very complete form of all the different type of CBDs so let's say that you know full spectrum is more like a multivitamin if we're comparing the two different types of CBDs so our CBD is just specific you are getting your CBD and that's that so some people prefer the full and the broad spectrum for that reason and other people prefer the isolates because they don't want to roll the dice they just want to know exactly what they're getting and you are still getting the good effects the supplemental effects of CBD we won't go into what the different effects are people using gummies for different conditions or whatnot or CBD that's on you guys to research I'm not dr. Gupta I can give you medical advice or supplemental health advice but the differences are is full spectrum and isolate based the next large difference is is where the gummies are infused or whether they are coated some people use these terms not properly because they think that if it's infused with CBD that it is just CBD is on there so there's two ways of getting CBD within the gummies you can either coat them or you can actually infuse them to where it's like I like to compare to donut so I mean who doesn't love donuts coated gummy is like a glazed doughnut sort of flavoring and stuff it's put on the top and that's how those gummies are made is that they're made and they are basically sprayed or soaked with the CBD solutions and they get absorbed into the gummy and they're on the outside to infuse gummies they're more like a jelly doughnut to where the solution is on the inside the oil is on the inside and they've been either injected or it's been formulated into the actual compound of manufacturing the gelatin or the building block of the gummies so that is another key difference and between that people say were some of pluses and minuses pluses and minuses are as generally the ones that are coded on the outside those are generally less expensive so they're more budget-friendly however the ones are injected are usually a little bit more consistent so if you're buying a jar of 1500 milligram coated gummies some gummies might be a little bit stronger than the other depending on how they record or if they're touching the edges of the jar and some of the CBD mighta came off and beyond the jar so you might have to take one two more of the coded gummies - whereas some of them might be a little bit stronger so they kind of average out but if you're looking for super consistency then you want the infused got me the jelly donut because that is basically an exact amount that they put into the gummy so now with these examples let's go into you know what different types of gummies there are so outside of the full spectrum and isolate gummies and the coated and infused gummies now you have gummies in the categories of even flavoring so here we have our CBD Gold Line let's take a look at this half of the product line right here so here is basically our offering of CBD Gold Line now these are actually all isolate based gummies so these will have absolutely no traces of THC they have they have basically a total amount of milligrams that you will get per jar and we recommend that you take two to three gummies per serving so we have different textures for gummies our first one here is going to be our sour gummy which is going to be like I said these ones are an isolate based so they're gonna be the zero TAC you're gonna go ahead and open it here so these are gonna be like sour flavored gummies and they are coated with our Goldline CBD solution very clean job of openness let's get close-ups here you get several different colors and these are gonna be more sour and taste you're also gonna have a little outside sugar coating for a little bit of a little bit of extra flavor let's go ahead and take one out and get a real nice close-up if you're into the sour taste not just kind of a plain fruity taste this will definitely be up your Avenue and also sometimes the sour taste can offset any taste within to come with the CBD oils so even when you're dealing with full spectrum gummies and things like that if you have a sour bass gummy it can offset any type of you say I don't like the taste of natural CBD oil there's CBD solutions then a sour gummy might be or a sugar-coated gummy might be a good alternative for you to offset some of that taste so you get a more pleasant experience of Wired having your CBD then you have your natural gummy which is basically plain fruity flavor a lot of companies just in making gummies that aren't CBD infused make very similar gummies that your the taste will be familiar from any of the Albanese gummies and things that you can get from the supermarket except they have the added CBD and these have been coated not infused and they use isolates they have zero THC every once a while different isolate gummies have different solutions every once in a while you might get some type of you might think it's sugar it's crystal but actually the CBD isolates come in the form of CBD crystals so every once awhile it might not be uncommon to see crystals on the gummies it might not have gotten fully absorbed into the gummy or that might be on the outside when the CBDs are a hundred percent pure that they're like isolates it's not uncommon to see some crystals I don't see any on this gummy so everything was good but these are generally big fruity flavored gummies so they're there Jim a little bit more fluffy they have the fruity taste these aren't gonna be the sour gummies so let's go ahead and put this back and move along so on Goldline CBD we generally sell the gummies in two sizes we have a 12 ounce and an 8 ounce and also some smaller assortments generally it's you know more value driven to buy more but we have all the way down to I think 10 or 20 pack that you can buy or even a 5 pack that you can purchase on the website just a sample the gummy to see if you like it and then once you're a go we do all kinds of bundles and you can go up to 12 ounce which contains I think about a hundred and twenty gummies so here we did a limited run for the holiday season these are of our holiday gummies on top of being the large fluffier gummies and being you know of holiday colors which is a red white and green over here these are actually uh flavored also so they're gonna have the different a little bit more added fruity flavor into them so it is a little bit more of a premium gummy than your standard base gummy bears that uh that are used so it's gonna be a little bit of an upgrade but you're not gonna get any of the sour taste so you know what a lot of people and a lot of companies even outside of ours will do is they'll use different types of flavored gummies as their base so you can kind of know what gummy bears from going to the supermarket that you like or what type of tools you like when you're selecting your ideal CBD gummy and I hope it's a gold line but in the event that it's not look for that too when you're on the hunt for buying your gummies let's go a little close-up of these guys so you can see we have the red green and white give me a thumbs up that you got a good focus and other gummies so there you see we have the nicest Ortman they're a little bit fluffier in texture and they also have the added flavor infusion so you're gonna have a very flavorful experience with these holiday gummies and they're still available on our website I think for the whole month of January we continued producing them and once that goes away we'll probably still offer these gummies but they're not going to be holiday oriented maybe some Valentine's Day gummies so now moving right along to our full spectrum gummies these use a high quality of full spectrum oil and on top of that they are actually infused so they are injected into the gummy so each time you get a gummy these that we have here available in four flavors you're gonna get a very consistent 10 milligrams of CBD in each gummy now we used to offer a 25 milligram full spectrum going but a lot of people especially when it comes to full spectrum you can actually taste the CBD oil so taste a little bit more like a medical gummy so there's different things that you have to do to the gummy to offset the taste some people are really into it like the Colorado and California style gummies and that's kind of what it tastes like and some people would rather just have you know a flavorful experience as well so what we did was we realized is that instead of offering a 25 milligram gummy let's kick it down to a 10 so some of the oil taste is not as prevalent and we also have poor flavor so we flavor and fuse the gummies on top of it so let's go ahead and get a close-up of what's available here so we have cherry flavor fruit punch and also strawberry and an orange citrus I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to lay each one of these out here on the table so you can see they're actually fruit shaped and the different flavor is actually indicated by the different color these are really nice gummy very high qualities of very high quality full spectrum oil and they are also quality infused so you have very consistent flavoring taste and CBD oil quantity in between each one of these gummies and again like I said you can get them available in the four different flavors yeah so like we said these will actually be below the point three legal limit for according to the the hemp farm bill passed in 2018 so these are in accordance with that however they might have little traces of THC within the legal hemp limits but they're there is that there is that so people who don't want to roll the dice to get you know drug tested and things like that then generally you want to stick with the isolate based product because there is zero THC in there whatsoever those could be within the legal limits see would be fine and it's still very very small almost non-traceable but we do have to put that out there for you guys then there's also gummies that we're developing that are almost like gushers to where there are very soft and heavily infused with flavor so it's kind of like they melt in your mouth and then they have the the the flavor follows up afterwards and rolls them so it's different from kind of a chewable gummy this is this is an extremely soft chew if we could even classify that but I would say it to a gusher and we have them infused I just want to go ahead and show these because some companies I've seen are doing it we're gonna start offering it but we have not yet so these are in the shape of bear but they're extremely soft very fluffy and almost melts I even feel bad putting them putting them out here but they are and they are actually they're full-spectrum and they're infused we have some of these samples are 25 milligrams all the way down to 10 but you can see that these are more than fusion style soft to customized gummies tour these these gummy bases are actually custom made to really melt so these ones are gonna be more like a gusher and generally you can tell from how fluffy and how soft they look and if you get a real good close-up there you can you can see the difference between that and even a fluffy standard gummy you know so again those would be full-spectrum and infused and then for those people who are looking for positive hemp benefits possibly a multivitamin I've also seen we don't currently offer them but hemp will extract gummy chews that you can see here these actually have hemp oil they're CBD content isn't really confirmed but it does have 20 milligrams of a hemp extract and it's also infused with like a multivitamin tour it has like your vaults a mitten or a vitamin b-complex and also your vitamin C's and different vitamin E so if you're just looking for like a nutritional supplement and don't necessarily want CBD we don't offer it but these are starting to get really popular within the hemp community and something you probably will come across most of these because they also have the multivitamin they're not going to be coated they're gonna be infused so they are gonna be very consistent to take on a daily basis you won't each one is gonna be very consistent to the other and again sometimes with the coated stuff some of them might be a little bit strong and others but generally averaged out pretty good so in summary I hope that today's

be higher of our flower I'm using two ounces of measured flower here we're going to put it in the oven at 240 for 60 minutes this will activate the the flower and make it psychoactive there now we let it sit for 60 minutes 60 minutes is up have our D carb flower here this is shish kebab and big white Super Skunk we're gonna let this cool down before we put it into the magic butter machine with our alcohol right machine you don't need to break you up because the machine will do that for you and I'm using a little over two and a half cups of green alcohol this machine is a minimum of two cups the machine plug it in we're gonna set it for 1:30 and then we're gonna set it for 8 hours you can do it for 4 but we're gonna go for 8 to get the maximum out of our flower that what takes your all strained and ready to go we're just going to make our magical Gumby recipe first we're gonna be adding our four packages of jell-o ten packages are Knox gelatin 1 cup of chilled juice 1/4 cup of honey and a tablespoon of citric acid well we're getting this ready when we've done that we get the teacher reduced to down to oil now that we have all of our dry ingredients mixed we're going to be mixing in our cup of chilled juice and a quarter cup of honey or I guess and the secret ingredient last thing will be adding a teaspoon adapter every cup of tincture that we're gonna add so we're only using about one cup of teacher today we're going to use just over a cup of tablespoon of lecithin in here we're going to mix it all together that's going to go into the jello and it's going to season while we're reducing our tincture down to oil now over here is that our stove hello sorry dude don't trip me we're gonna just over a cup of tea sure and we'll let this reduce until it turns into an oil you now up now where we reduce down to oil we're gonna add our flavor and I like to add a little squirt of turned sour just to give the candies a little bit of the same mix this all together and then we're gonna mix in our seasoned candy mix we're gonna heat this for seven minutes I love stirring it until it all becomes one in the meantime you want to get some molds ready we already have ours here silicone molds make sure you have plenty on hand because you never know how much you're going to need to pour now that our candy mix has been heated and liquefied for seven minutes it's all ready now to be poured into the molds you kind of want to do it quick because it will set you", "B7WXjXs8L7U": "oh hey everybody we have another fun activity today what are we doing gummy candy that's right the giant gummy candy maker and what kind of stuff can we make we here make gummy bears gummy worms and gummy fish that is pretty cool so you guys have probably seen our gummy candy videos Evan did the giant gummy worm and Jillian ate a giant gummy bear how was that decoy you didn't even need any of it yeah she didn't really eat that whole thing I think that's kind of impossible especially for a four-year-old yeah you're for now you're 7 you might be able to eat an ear or something like that so now we are gonna make our own gummies look at all the cool things you can make you can make worms different color fish gummy bears and the giant gummy bear I don't think the giant gummy bears as big as the one that we showed in our other video but probably eat it it's pretty big okay guys so we're gonna get this open and show you guys what's inside so here's everything you get in the box what do we have over there gummy bear that looks like it's gonna be pretty big we also have some little heating containers where we're going to mix our gelatin over here we have our molds it kind of looks like Simon swipe their molds right here we have some gummy worms and the fish mold and over here we have our little ice tray that we have to fill up with ice and right here we have our heating bowl and you have to plug that in and Jillian's gonna get that ready and of course we have our instructions yeah you should always follow the instructions that are listed don't make up your own recipes unless you want a mess so there's a bunch of different gummies you can make you can make a sour gummy vitamins gummies or even energy gummies using an energy drink like redbull but I think we're just gonna make regular gummi bears today and we're gonna try something different too we have these molds and we also have our marble ice cube molds that we got in our loot crate box and we're gonna try and make some Marvel gummies - mmm so we have two of these heating trays because while you're pouring one thing of gelatin you can also be mixing up the second flavor right here or if you lose one but we're not losing these right so before we use any of this stuff we need to give it a good washing okay so the first thing we have to do is we have to assemble this Gillian's putting the tray together so it doesn't fall apart that would not be good okay did it before we put the molds on top we need ice to put into it because that's gonna act as our cooling agent and it's gonna cool whatever is on top let's press the tray with some ice okay so we filled up our tray with ice and now Evans going to put the molds on michey mob and you want to make sure you put enough ice but you also want the molds to lay flat because you are going to be pouring the gelatin into the molds and if it's slanted it might run out we're gonna put our little cauldron with the metal bottom because metal is a conductor and now we get to mix our ingredients so what do we need so we have a bunch of jell-o gelatin we actually need three ounces to make one batch we have mango here unflavored gelatin yes and you also need some unflavored gelatin you need four ounces and they come in this little package there's four envelopes that are one ounce each so you need to mix 4 ounces of unflavored gelatin with three ounces of flavored gelatin how much water do we have to put in the water half a cup of water okay put it in look at that nice and warm now this pot is hot so be careful so any goes the unflavored gelatin and now it's time for the flavored stuff I have to take a snip jefes always smell so good thank you now for the flavored gelatin it all looks the same stir it a little bit and then I'll let you stir them okay I've been stirring up the mixture in our gummy cauldron I smell gummy we don't want a lumpy gummy so we better stir this pretty good it says stir until mixture is runny get rid of that I've got some clumps in there you each like mommy's gravy hey now I always do it wouldn't be fun if it wasn't messy yeah Gillian's finishing up on the stirring so it has a little spout here to make it four easy pour now let's see if I could do it without spilling it'll be a miracle if I can there's a job on my table maybe I can't see what I'm doing oh we got a Siamese fish going on connect it up ahead doesn't matter yeah matters oh maybe we should let the kids board yes even decorated the bowl look at that it's not any different than my muffins I just clean up after all right so we got a mess going on here let me see if I can do this one okay I'm gonna fill up some of these oh sure take the big fat shape that's easy I had a choice to need that this stuff is pretty thick not just me but you made it okay so this is a little messy oh well you must be having a lot of fun then okay I think that's good for that one all right so I got our marble is cubed molds these might be a little better because they are bigger we've got orange so let's let's do the thing okay so I'm going to do these two and so Gillian's filling up the ice cubes and what we should be doing is making our second batch with our extra one which one you want a blue one okay blueberry on these boxes of jell-o they're actually six ounces so we need to cut that in half in order to get the three ounces that we need I'm gonna pour in the unflavored Wow Wow four at a time look at that that is called skilled Jillian's gonna put in two three ounces of blueberry and let's stir that sucker up time for mommy to that makes more messes good just don't aim well it's a little bit better in texture okay so this is a pretty messy but I'm gonna use the spoon this time and it might work a little better gotta get the little ear we've got a big mess going on here these worms working a little tail there to get that just gonna give them some blue paws we're mixing up our third badge with a resist there goes there's green Joe is stirring up the green stuff oh okay so something's going on with our mixture here it's pretty thick it's not really flowing into the mold smoothly so maybe we're not heating this up enough I let it sit here in the pot and it is getting more runny so I think we were taking it out before it really got high we're gonna have some clumpy bears and some clumpy fish okay let's see if this pours any better this time oh it's actually going in now oh no it's much better we'll make a green gummy face so when you mix colors you have to make sure that the previous color has already solidified otherwise when you mix the next color it's just gonna mix all together become a big dark mess so we have our green face and our blue paws this is too thick right now not quite there yet okay let's fill it an Ironman face this Iron Man doesn't have enough so I'm gonna add some red to it see how it looks so we got some bloody worms we got some chunky bears so these things are cooling now we filled all the molds this is our first try Wow it's kind of a failure but we're gonna see what comes out of this and see if they're edible these bears are not gonna have ears sorry they're mommy's trying to get his ear mommy's goal there perfect but he's gonna have one ready yeah all right so Evans going to karate you see you later buddy it's our bear and I'm gonna fill the rest of it with the rest of this read that we have make a red body it's going over the head too I guess the ears are gonna be red of a nice layer of red okay so I just poured in some yellow into our bear and now he's got several layers so Jillian's removing all the molds from our little ice tray the ice is still down there so they just come out and since the mold is nice and flexible they should just pop out everything's gonna be connected to each other yeah I think so we kind of overfilled them a years he's a ball bear that's got a violet and here are our conjoined bears this one has monkey hair no one's lumpy bear let's see the worms oh look at that it's a worm in slime Oh Julian killed it she dissected the worm mums got the good Bears pretty good eye man oh please I made these you made those you might do I didn't make the green we have some good ones over here the ones I made I'll show you what I made I made these guys Marvel well these ones are gonna be thick they were not meant to be candy they're meant to be ice this woman is look at that whole face that is the thing then we have fist we have an orange Iron Man and we have a red Iron Man and we have a couple shields so the thing we learned is you have to make sure your gelatin mixture is melted all the way before you pour it in and when you do pour it in you have to be very careful not to pour too much quality beer but I do actually like these bloody bears okay Joey is gonna try the worm what are your thoughts you did or where it is okay but the texture is a little weird all right I'm gonna try the red because that one we actually did right there's not enough flavor it's not as sweet as a gummy bear okay so we finished tasting these we're gonna wait for Evan to come home he'll try one of these and we're just gonna finish our giant bear from karate I was karate it was good he worked up an appetite for gummies I guess no would you recommend that he eats these Joe yeah he's gonna eat the bloody gummy bear know what it's like now is it no guys took my Javanese tastes more like jello than the gummy I would have to agree with that I think it doesn't have quite as much sugar okay but he likes it apparently because he just took another one so you got the big thick Iron Man head and instead of putting up I was gonna say instead of putting that whole thing in your mouth take a little bite but it looks like a Lego brick what are you eating you took it apart but before we go we have to go see how our giant gummy bear is doing the exact number okay so here's the giant gummy bear let's bring it over to the table we had it in the fridge to harden a little bit well bring it over to our messy candy workshop over here this thing has a bunch of different colors hopefully hopefully it comes out of here like it is nice smiling green face oh I just smashed the word Wow see let's press his face let's go bear CPR okay it's coming out I got the leg Oh it's a bear that they had I see the head coming there it is he's got a green round face but it actually says bear here on this chest in case you didn't know stay away from my gummies bear it looks messy but it actually comes off like Jillian's gonna try the bear out let's go take a big bite of the ear just like you did with that other one there it is oh it's bringing back memories ah let's see it we've got what is that lime cherry lemon orange and more cherry and some blueberry feet so why don't you bite the foot try that blueberry foot and you can even just pull his hand off like this and you can eat his hand look at that daddy - perfect gummy worm I could sell this on eBay so I think we're done with this gummy stuff we're gonna save this maybe we'll try this again later maybe I'll put some hot peppers in here do some surprise gummies yeah surprise gummy challenge okay guys so that was the Greek giant gummy candy maker it was a little bit messy if you guys want to make your own gummies you can get this candy maker or you can just buy gelatin and make jello thanks for watching and we'll see you guys next time", "x2GfI6yKgvM": "hello guys welcome back hope y'all

is how you're going to need a little bit of lemon juice you're going to need a weekly stocking or any kind of chili pepper that you want and the turmoil and a bowl and a spoon so first I usually just put in a little bit of the lemon juice when I squeeze a bunch of the Chum wing and then I put looky there then I give it a little stir but more of the chili give it a little stir do it - it gets a little a little bit not too thick because when you after you're done adding your snack st. and you put you're going to put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes and this gets hard like not super hard to get Louise that's good ye up in the feedback my mom's messing up my video very she's leaving after the gummi bears are in you mix it in again and I want some worms I already have the lemon juice I think I got this at the Family Dollar for like a dollar I am I got this at HEB I got this one at on na Michoacana and I got all the candies at Walmart as 98 cents a bag or you to go to the Family Dollar and get the candies also but third daughter I really I'd rather get the 98 cents I make myself laughs our people oh so you mix and the worms you should have a little texture like this I'm gonna

forget comment like and subscribe you", "z87xwoms6Os": "why are you all here no fingers don't eat me [Music] in today's video we're revisiting one of grant's most popular projects making gummy legos [Music] hey guys today we're here with the whole king of random family hey we're here because we wanted to make one of grant's most popular projects lego gummies so we thought it fitting to include all the kids and we wanted to make an appearance and say hi it's been a year and we wanted to enjoy one of grant's projects and commemorate this time that you guys have spent with us and give you a little insight into where we're at and have a little fun on camera here's the basic idea we're here with the king of random family to make some gummy legos that you can eat and build with okay so should we get pour in some legos guys yeah all right all right so we're gonna be following the recipe grant laid out previously which is made of jello some extra gelatin powder a little bit of water and then you can tinker with the colors with some food coloring if you like but for the most part jello of course has colors uh and one little twist we are gonna try is we're going to see if we can use some tonic water and maybe some b2 vitamin powder to see if we can get gummies that glow in a black light what do you guys think of glowing lego gummy should we try it oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah [Music] so each batch like i said doesn't have very many ingredients we have half a cup of water we'll do one quarter cup of corn syrup a small box of jello it comes in multiple sizes we're going for the three ounce boxes of jello and two packets of the unflavored gelatin one thing that i have learned in making this is that it's actually easier by a long shot to mix the gelatin in if you do it before the corn syrup so instead of watering corn syrup together and then adding the jello and stuff i'm just doing the water then i'll have the two packets of gelatin and the entire box of jello and then we're gonna add our quarter cup of corn syrup into it otherwise you get clumps and lumps and takes a long time to dissolve in just trying to make sure there's no big clumps or even little clumps of the gelatin left it's not going to well if we have clumps in it now then it's not going to evenly dissolve into the water and then we won't have enough gelatin and our jello gummy lego bricks will be like too weak they won't be strong enough to come out of the mold so we want the liquid to be nice and smooth and we want the clumps to dissolve evenly so we get a nice thick jello now when grant was testing this recipe we probably made it five to ten times before we got the perfect recipe so we'd open the gelatin he tried an extra teaspoon of gelatin didn't work then he tried two extra teaspoons of gelatin we got to the point where we found out these packets are perfectly proportionate that two packets was the ideal amount but then he tried three packets to see if that would work those were really gross lego gummies because you could barely not they were like really really like a gummy bear but worse yeah they were really like tough but gummy so they were gross because they were almost hard but they were still gummy so we had a good laugh about that so now we're just mixing in the corn syrup one quarter cup of corn syrup mixed into it so the corn syrup also allows the extra gelatin to make the texture of the gummy more smooth so that was another thing we had to learn because we tried just putting the extra gelatin in and like i said it was really like hard even though it was gummy but the corn syrup gives it that nice smooth texture and extra sugar yeah it's gonna smell let's see what flavor is this we're doing apricot we've got some apricot jello that's pretty well mixed in so now we're gonna throw this on the stove at medium low heat and just let it heat up until it gets clear everything gets perfectly well dissolved and melted into it and then we'll let it cool down a bit and pour it into our mold although if we have too much bubbles or foam we've got something we can do to get rid of some of that as well we have this tonic water and the tonic water in the black light actually glows kind of blue so i think this would be a good one to try mixing with the blue powder and see if it'll uh all right let's see so instead of just plain water we're going to be using the tonic water all right so you actually don't want quite all of it because this is a different brand and each packet is 3.94 so we want about three quarters of it so don't put all of it in [Music] there's no more in there perfect good job it's pretty loud it is all right all of it all of it okay you get on here and we'll make your red jello next okay all right i'm gonna open it okay perfect wow it's going to pour it right there just pour it all into the jar [Music] good man oh wow look that made some bubbles do we like bubbles in our lego gummies no no how are we gonna get rid of those bubbles does anybody know okay we've got our our apricot is about ready and you can see that there are some bubbles on the surface of it we're just gonna see if we can take all that off if it's not coming off super easily something you can definitely do as grant showed in the original is you can just pour everything into a tall cup and as it cools down this foam and gunk stuff is going to cool off and just be really easy to remove i want to feel it oh it's hot it's hot it's hot as you can see in the mold this is lego bricks sort of upside down and we want there to be interlocking bump shapes on the underside of the legos so that they can fit together so to do that we're going to use this base plate and we're going to sort of smoosh it down onto the mold after we've got all the stuff in there but we don't want it to stick too much it doesn't stick too much to silicone sticks a little bit but not excessively but to make sure it doesn't stick too much to our plate we're going to just add some oil and i'm just going to use some paper towel and sort of smear it around on there until it's got a good coating in the original lego gummies the first pours we did we just poured the lego gummies and brought them out so they had a flat bottom so they were not stackable and we were sitting there eating them and they were really good and grant was like hey wouldn't it be fun if we could stack these i was like yeah that'd be really cool how could we do that and we would like kind of it seems really obvious but at the time we hadn't come up with the idea of using this to put on there so the next mold we did we took the silicone and we were like how could we make bumps on the underside right so we're like could we get legos and put them on there and then we're like maybe we could get flat legos and put them on top and then we saw these bases and grant was like oh genius what if we took the base and put it on like that to make bottoms for the lego so that they would have those imprints coming up so then they became stackable after that so fun little story all right we've got our apricot mix about ready so i'm just gonna pour it off into a squeeze bottle here to try and get some of those bubbles out though i just have the lid on and i'm just going to spin it around and the centripetal force will get some of those bubbles out whoa well that's aggressive it is but it brings some of the bubbles up to the top so there's just a little bit less go ahead and pour it right in i want to do it good job jamie i wouldn't do it you'll get a chance too can i do it yeah you're going to get it turned up that one's perfect too do good pours i'm just going to help you squeeze that in maybe we'll okay and then on to the next one so at this point i'm going to put our base plate over the lego mold here to try and get the interior bumps all of these would be ready yep here we are we're back what's ready for us guys hey is that one of the ones that the two colors that was a two color i think you got a drip of the apricot so you might even be a three color technically this one i think it was red first and then blue that turned out really well i like it that's awesome you already would mix but it looks like it didn't yeah this one i think was the one that was too liquefied to have any separation so that one didn't this is totally but actually you can see the blue on the bottom but it's pretty mixed so just a couple of tips for anyone who's trying this out based on my experiences so i think i already talked about how i really recommend you add the gelatin before the corn syrup i would also recommend being sure to wash your mold with soap and water and rinse it well in between each batch i did a couple of badges off screen and the second batch i had a really hard time getting out of the mold i also think it's helping quite a bit that these are cold the second batch i did i just let cool sitting outside on the counter it wasn't in the fridge i think refrigerating it to cool it down and pulling it out while they're cold makes it a lot easier that and like i said i washed the mold i think all of those things helped because these you can see i'm just they just come out really nice and easily for the most part and my first batch came out easily my second batch was a little bit of a struggle this is a short layer of orange and blue and then riley's idea was to put them together and make them layered like this so now it almost looks like a fine delicacy you could find on a cruise ship a sam's definitely done or the world's weirdest sushi if you want to stack them and build with them they should work for that too okay let's see what you guys can stack and build everybody grab five these ones these ones will stack together these ones won't these ones could be the base though so if you're careful you can actually get the bricks to interlock what did you do is it sticking on your face the blue ones were made with tonic water and the yellow and green ones were made with a little bit of b2 vitamins so let's see how much glowing we got out of them under a [Music] the yellow ones glow quite a bit under a black light that's pretty intense and i think it's interesting so the orange ones we didn't add any powder to them but there was a fluorescent food coloring that i added that apparently glows just a little bit as well some of it's settled you can see that the v2 vitamin is like concentrated on the bottom of it thank you guys so much for joining us and our family for building one of grant's legacy videos lego gummies one of our favorite projects as a family and i hope you guys have a great time building it as well i hope you go home and do this project because it's loads of fun and the payoff you get to eat the product don't eat too many i'm back in the studio and we could not do a lego gummy video without putting a fun twist on it so i brought jared from gold yeller into the studio and we are going to be playing with these little lego gummy guys jared what are we going to be doing with these little lego gummy guys and these heads with all these fun facial expressions i think here's the basic idea okay here's the basics we're going to probably eat the heads off okay and then replace them with lego heads that makes it look like they're talking and then we switch them every single frame and that's what we're gonna do okay so i have taken over the studio i'm going to bring the kids back in we're going to let them play in the studio with these little lego gummy guys and what they're going to do is they get to bite the heads off jared has the courage to be here with us and we're doing lego stop-motion with the kids so he's really brave to be here in the description below there's a link to his channel go check it out there's also a link to my blog where you'll be able to find out what is really happening with these shenanigans in our life and especially kind of how things have been since grant has been gone i'm gonna let the kids go ahead and take one lego gummy guy each bite its head off and then put it back all right okay we bit their heads off we're ready to get started yeah jared needs to bite one off he ate the whole thing that's not biting the head off okay who's not following directions here sorry point at him i'm fired mom okay what do you want your lego gummy guy to say to dad did you see dad yeah in your dreams what do you say i love you what did dad do he makes some jello gummies for me and did you eat them all gone yeah and what do you want to say to dad um okay okay now move your hands out and then push that button right there perfect [Music] okay now push the button this one right here why are you all here no fingers don't eat me goodbye well we want to thank you guys again for joining us for this it's been a year since we lost grant and we just want to thank you for being on this journey with us and continuing to support our projects and the legacy that grant left us grant we really miss you but thanks for what you left us [Music] you", "uuGSQR_AsJ4": "hey guys when it comes to my kids lunchboxes I am always looking for healthy delicious alternatives to the processed stuff that's out there so today I'm going to show you guys how to make strawberry gummy snacks I'm Meg and I'm passionate about finding ways to make life with kids easier in the kitchen so here's what you'll need strawberries water honey lemon juice gelatin and silicone gummy molds so the first thing you're going to need to do is take your strawberries and turn them into your puree you can use frozen strawberries make sure they're thawed first you can use a blender or a food processor and then blend until smooth all right once your strawberries are pureed you can combine it with water and then head over to your stove start by putting your water and strawberry puree mixture into a saucepan add your lemon juice and your honey and turn on to a medium low heat and whisk once your mixture is combined add the gelatin continue mixing until the gelatin is completely dissolved and there are no big clumps once your gelatin is completely dissolved all you need to do is pour it into your gummy mold today I'm using these little gummy bear molds because they're really cute but they aren't insanely large so when I'm packing these for my kids that I usually use a smaller gummy mold if you can't find gummy molds you can also pour your mixture into a baking pan and continue on using a cookie cutter all right once your mixture is in your gummy molds you're going to put it in the freezer for 25 minutes my gummy bears are all done chilling all that's left to do is pop them out of their molds oh my gosh look how cute these are these gummy snacks are by far my kids favorite they ask for them all the time and I hope your kids enjoy them too thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe and I will see you guys next time bye guys [Music] [Music]", "TLs7u0vTCjI": "hey everyone awesome Disney toys here we got some corn syrup jello unflavored gelatin so if you had to guess what do you think we're making today we're making jello gummy bears whoo all right to start we'll need 1/2 a cup of water so I'll go ahead and do that we'll need 1/4 cup of corn syrup yes I like my gummy bears sweet but who doesn't now we'll use this fork or you could use any other stirring item and we'll just mix this until the corn syrup completely dissolves okay that should be good we'll take this to the awesome stove and pour it into this pot Willy to pouring 2 packets of unflavored gelatin go ahead and do that too and then we'll leave 85 grams of jello for this part you could pretty much use any flavor you want you don't have to follow ours but we'll be using strawberry mmm this is the good stuff now I'll just get our wooden spoon mix this thoroughly until all the powder dissolves keep stirring still need a stern a bit more we could filthy a few jugs okay once you get it to look like this you could stop stirring and then turn the stove on to low heat while we wait for that let's check out the gummy tray we'll be using this one's called the 50 cavity bear mold and if you're interested in making this after watching the video and I think you will be interested we got this mold off Amazon will post a link in the description below if you want to buy it here's our gummy tray it pretty much feels like one of those rubber ice cube trays this set also comes with this dropper tool but we'll actually be using this condom it squeeze bottle it'll be easier and faster to pour into the mold so after about five to 10 minutes on low heat your gummy syrup should be ready the texture should look something like this alright so at this point you're ready to pour but you may want to place your mold onto a plate or a cutting board it'll make it easier to transfer into your fridge you don't want to wobble your mold all the way over and accidentally spill it yeah that would be bad now that the gummy molds on the plates we'll pour the liquid into the condiment squeeze bottle dude we're pouring some sweet jelly hurry some sweet jelly catchy song right just made it up all right let's put the cap back on and we are ready to pour stir with this one on the bottom left if you guys are using a condom and squeeze bottle to be sure not to squeeze too hard it might overflow you want to just gently squeeze it and if you're using a dropper it might take a little longer but the gummies will still taste the same okay so I'm pretty much doing the same thing over and over again so let's fast-forward to near the end got a few more left three two and no one whoa we just made fifty gummi bears here's a closer look at her beautifully filled gummi bears I can't wait to try one ah some of you may be impatient like me putting a lot to leave this in the fridge overnight boo and it's the next day I'm sure you could already tell just by looking at it but the liquids have turned into a gummy texture let's take one out whoa I came out pretty easily and the mold stays pretty clean well I'm pretty impressed okay so this gummy bear came out in perfect detail you could see the arms the legs and if you really take a good look at the head you could see the eyes and the nose too all right so it looks good now let's see if it tastes good mmm that's pretty good it's sweet it's chewy but softer than the coming bears I usually buy at the store and I'm really liking this strawberry flavor let's take all the other gummies out that because there's one thing I have to say it is a little sticky though while I take this out so if you guys remember from before I used a quarter cup of corn syrup and it was pretty much the perfect sweetness for me I think if we add anymore it'll be too sweet but if you have a big sweet tooth feel free to put it more since these gummy bears are sticky at least they won't fall up the plate alright we're almost finished taking all the gummy bears out got one more and it wasn't just that first one check out how clean this mold is this is definitely not one of those messy do-it-yourself projects I guess one of the other problems with this being sticky is these bears are all kind of clumped up and they do not want to leave this plate - it being sticky everything else is pretty spot on so if you want to see more jelly videos give this video a thumbs up hello mr. gummy bear oh you brought a friend and another friend and another friend just how many bears are you whoa

okay we started with cherry but what was the last color but your answer below in the comments bye cookies", "uVrVyKUO5_c": "[Music] what's up friends welcome back today we have a little bit different video than you guys are used to so instead of giving you guys a exact follow the steps instructions this is gonna be more like you guys come along with me when i experiment so i like to try out different ways um that we can make different treats and a lot of times it turns out sometimes it doesn't um but i kind of just go with the flow and see what will happen i feel like no matter what you can always salvage your treats into something it may not be what you intended it to be but it'll always be delicious so for an example my intentions with this video was to create infused jolly ranchers and for them to be hard candy now that did not work out they ended up being a soft candy so i just kind of went with it and i thought it might be cool for you guys if you want to see my thought process and how i kind of decide to go with things when they go wrong so please let me know if you guys enjoyed this type of video or if you'd rather it be um here is like the guaranteed results from this step-by-step process [Music] all right let's get started here's what you're going to need some jolly ranchers or any hard candy that you enjoy some coconut oil or tincture citric acid and some infused sugar or regular sugar unwrap your jolly ranchers and then separate them into colors that you think would mix well once melted together i'm doing blue and green and the purple and reds now i'm setting up my double boiler and adding in my pink and red jolly ranchers they're mostly pink and i am using a total of 20 jolly ranchers now i'm adding in some lecithin and i'm just using my spatula because it is really hard to get off a spoon and then putting that back in and mixing it up now because i'm just doing a little experiment i decided that chamoy would taste really good with this jolly rancher mix since it's mostly all watermelon so i'm adding in two tablespoons of chamoy and then two tablespoons of infused sugar of course you could use regular sugar or you don't have to use chamoy i mean this is totally very flexible you can kind of flavor this to how you want you can put whatever creation you can come up with in there pretty much now i'm just waiting for this to melt over the double boiler it does take a long time i probably took about a half an hour to get to this point now that it's mostly melted i'm going to add in my coconut oil so i decided to add in three tablespoons there wasn't an exact reason for why i chose this amount it's just kind of like i said an experiment to see how it goes so we're going to mix that in and the oil is pretty tricky to combine with the mixture so i am going to use a whisk and just whisk that up really good just do it for a few minutes and it will come together very nicely and there is no problems getting this to emulsify just be persistent with stirring it until everything is nice and smooth like this so at this point it's pretty much ready to be refrigerated and like i said you guys can add whatever you like so if you want them to be very sour add some citric acid if you want them to have any sort of other flavor you know add it in anything is probably going to be just fine so then i now that this is all mixed together i'm going to pour it into a little dish because this is a smaller amount i'm just using a smaller dish so that i can get them to be thicker instead of very thin if they were spread out along a larger container this container had some grooves so i just filled it with some tinfoil so i could get the bottom to be flat and then place some wax paper inside of there um i had some issues with the wax paper if i was to do this again i would use parchment paper i just didn't have any on hand so then i'm going to pour this mixture into my little lined container and then i'm going to put it in the fridge to set i also just popped the little bubbles with a toothpick and then kind of just dropped it a bit to release any air bubbles um in the end because this turned out to be more like a starburst i didn't need to do that because i could have just squished it or molded it down with my finger okay so here it is after being in the fridge for probably about a half an hour and i was ready to score it because i was wanting these to be hard candy and you need to score these earlier on in the process so i'm just measuring it out and attempting to score it but it doesn't really hold my shape so i put it back in the fridge for another half an hour or so and then took it back out to score again and then i also sprayed my knife with some cooking spray so that it wouldn't stick now it's very malleable like i can reshape it really well and cutting it was fine but this was when i realized that this probably was no longer going to be a hard candy and it was going to be a soft candy so i cut all these shapes and then put them back in the fridge but they were kind of like they kept on molding back together so point being is that it needs to stay in the fridge a lot longer so i put them back in and then worked on making a coating for them so for these i thought they'd be absolutely delicious with a tahini coating so i started with one tablespoon of icing sugar one tablespoon of infused sugar and one tablespoon of tahini and then i tasted that and i felt like it needed more sugar so i added in some more sugar as well as some citric acid to make it more sour and then i tasted it again and it still felt like i wanted it to be quite a bit sweeter so i just added in the rest of my sugar and you guys there's no like exact measurements you just do this to what you think tastes good more sugar less sugar whatever you like and then i'm also going to grind this down in a food processor just to make it a little bit finer to coat my candies and then i poured it back into my container now these have been in the fridge for over an hour and while they were in there i'd go in with my knife and kind of just cut them so you can see they're still very squishy and like a soft candy nothing like a hard candy so that's a texture we're working with here now i'm just peeling them all off of this wax paper and you can see that it's stuck to the back of them quite a bit it was easy for me to get off but if i had used parchment paper there wouldn't have been that issue anyway so if you were to do this use parchment paper and not wax paper and then i separated them all and then put them into my tahin sour sugar coating and shook them all up then i put them back into the container as i was taking them out i could tell that they were very soft so i knew that these weren't going to be the type of gummies that were going to hold or not gummies the soft candies that were going to hold their shape outside of the fridge now that i've made these i've realized that in order to keep them out of the fridge we're going to need to add gelatin so let me know if you guys would like to see me do a recipe like that um but they look so good and of course i had to try one and they were so tasty like the watermelon jolly rancher chewiness with the sour sugary tahin coating and then the chamoy and the watermelon like i don't even know how i can explain how delicious that was but like so good now we're gonna do our batch of blue and greens using our tincture um these take forever to melt oh my goodness so yeah i left them on here for probably like a half an hour and then they finally were melting and make sure you guys are checking on the water in your double boiler i found that my water was going down fast and i constantly had to re-add it so just make sure you have enough water in there all the time okay so now after this has melted quite a bit i'm going to add in my tincture so we're doing one two three tablespoons and then to compensate for the extra liquid we're adding in three tablespoons of sugar i'm just using regular sugar because i don't know why i think i ran out of infused sugar anyways we're mixing that in and now we're going to add in some lecithin and i'm going to use my whisk to get that since we need to whisk this all together to get everything to emulsify so just stir that all up and get it to mix together and then i want these to be really sour because sour blue raspberry green apple like that's a good combination am i right okay so citric acid mix that in i had the candy thermometer in here because i was trying to make hard candy so we had to bring it to a certain temperature to allow that to happen um but in the end i realized it was not going to reach that temperature so i decided these are also going to be soft juice um which means i'm going to also add in some coconut oil so i'm just doing one tablespoon of this i could probably have added more but i just wanted to try using a little bit less since the three in the last recipe was a little bit soft now i'm adding in even more citric acid because i want these to be super sour like i've said before these recipes are extremely flexible if you're just making these for yourself it's not going to hurt if it's not exactly perfect every time if you're making these for other people then that's a different story but it's always fun to experiment um this is my favorite part of making all these treats okay now that we have the coconut oil in there we're mixing that all together and it's coming together very very nicely we just have to keep whisking it to make sure it's all mixed together you can see it looks nice and smooth and now we're pouring it into the same type of system the little container with the wax paper again because i don't have any parchment paper and then i'm putting it in the fridge i had intended to come back for this an hour or so later but it ended up sitting in the fridge for a couple of days because i got too busy to continue with them so now here we are with our refrigerated mixture slab i took it out of the fridge and then i let it sit for about 20 minutes to kind of soften it up so you can obviously tell the fact that it softens up at a warmer temperature means these need to stay in the fridge again it would u uh we would need to use gelatin to make them stay stable at um or to hold their shape at room temperature and if you guys are interested in me doing a video like that let me know this is just an experiment like i said a few times already so anyways so i just cut them up into these little shapes and then i put them in a container with some sugar and a little sprinkle of citric acid shook them up and then i put them back in the fridge so that was all we needed to make both of those and they were so good now let's talk about how they turned out taste wise okay so i'm just eating them while i'm talking so i can explain so first of all don't put them in the freezer because they'll get kind of wet on the outside just keep them in the fridge this green one it's sour green apple and blue raspberry the flavor is literally amazing they go so well together and the sourness is perfect [Music] that is really really good like i really like that it is very soft though it's not as chewy as like a starburst it's much much softer like very like your teeth just like go right into it so i mean maybe if you eat them in the fridge it'd be a little bit chewier but i let mine sit out um so i could see how well they would do i think it's about 24 degrees in my apartment so if the air conditioning was on i probably could get away with keeping them out of the fridge okay now we're going to try the watermelon cherry chun way one so it definitely is mostly watermelon only a little bit of cherry and we can really taste the watermelon chamois which one is really good i think the only thing i would change to the watermelon one is to do more of a sugar coating like i did for the green one um i just kind of want that like really like sour sugar to contrast the sweetness of the watermelon chamois um it is pretty oily but only on your fingers you can't really like taste the oiliness overall i rate the watermelon choi one seven out of ten and then the green one i would literally rate like a nine point five out of ten it was like so so so good i think it's gonna put some citric acid in it as well but both of them are good if i could do anything different aside from the sugar i would also add gelatin so they could be shelf stable but i don't mind keeping in the fridge anyways

box and one cup of wine of your choice and pour the wine in a pot just let it simmer for a bit then add the jello mixture if you stir until fully dissolved you should have something that looks like this and then just add the jello mixture to these cute little gummy bear molds that I got from Amazon and I will put the link in the description box [Music] and this was enough to fill three trays and from there just put them in the fridge and let chill for about 10 minutes and you would come out with these cute little gummy bears that are so full of flavor well thank you guys so much for watching don't forget to subscribe until the next video be well [Music]", "mAZXWAuWp6E": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make nerd ropes here's what you're going to need two boxes of nerds one cup of gummy bears and some tincture the first step is to fold some foil in an accordion shape and spread it along a baking sheet then you can pour your Nerds into each fold of the tin foil make sure you have enough because if you don't the gummy make sure we'll stick to the tin foil and it'll be harder to take them out after then you'll melt you're going bears in the microwave for about 40 seconds and if you like add 1 tablespoon of ginger and stir it in I'm gonna be pouring my gummy mixture into a squeeze bottle so it'll be easier to dispense be careful not to pour too much just like I did on that first one take it slow and just do a thin line now you can top the ropes with some more nerds once they've all been filled squish the tinfoil together to make them into a tighter more compact shape then put them into the fridge or freezer I still had some remaining mixture left and instead of making more ropes I'm just gonna make some little nerd bytes by using a mold that I had on hand I also added some more nerds on top before I put them into the fridge once they've solidified in the fridge or freezer shake off the excess nerds into a bowl and then peel them off the tinfoil now some of mine came off okay but some of them I had a little more difficulty with so I decided to leave them out for about 24 hours outside of the fridge or the freezer so that they could dry out a little bit more which made them a lot easier to peel off the nerd bites in the silicone mold came out really easily after letting them sit in the freezer for about an hour [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you guys they turned out so beautifully it did take an extra day for them to drive because they were sticking to the tinfoil but after I let them dry they turned out absolutely wonderful just make sure you put enough nerds on the bottom part of the tinfoil so that you're not having issues with the going mixture sticking I can't believe how fantastic they all came out I'm so excited and they're so delicious because I have already tried some and the little bites are so few I love them so much I could have made more ropes but I kind of liked having these little ones if you just grab I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you to the person who requested me to make this video because I'm absolutely in love with these and I'll be definitely making them again thank you guys so much for watching I hope you try these out have a wonderful day", "GAp0OB_ZI6c": "you marijuana is generally a misdemeanor offense however it can be elevated into a felony in a number of ways and one way is when you take the actual substance in marijuana which is THC and that is extracted in some way and used to create something else than that all this sudden becomes a felony offense it's the substance that THC is considered a penalty group to substance which is a felony and we see this most often in cases involving edibles you take gummy bears for example that seem to be popular especially you can buy them in Colorado and other states and a package of gummy bears may actually contain a very small amount of THC but it is a felony offense or even a couple of them so be aware that what is normally a misdemeanor offense that you may think it's not all that serious when it's turned into something else when it's turned into an edible or something else you can consume then you're looking at a felony offense and your misdemeanor marijuana possession all of a sudden becomes a felony that you're in district court for and facing serious

brought that THC lace gummy into the school and now that student is facing very serious charges now THC is the chemical found in marijuana that gets you high and that gummy it was supposed to have been broken apart into 10 pieces multiple students took the gummies five of them were taken to the hospital another student was picked up by a parent sheriff Grady Judd says the twelve-year-old who were not naming because he's a minor brought the Edible into his gym class and that's where the children eat it then they started showing signs of nausea stomachaches dizziness and one of them even

to get some clarification at the last video I showed a very detailed step-by-step was quite a long video I'll put a link to the video up here maybe appear somewhere up in the top somewhere here there'll be a link okay and then that you're gonna see the step-by-step on how to do it okay this is gonna be a quick and dirty one okay so what you got here is four boxes of jell-o these four boxes are the 85 down the small box four boxes okay in those four boxes I am then what we have is for every one box of those I have three packs of these okay or about that much in a shot glass not much okay just a little bit try one of those for every box so there is four of these in this container right here okay okay you have one cup of cannabis infused coconut oil mm-hmm and two cups I won't move it cuz it's pretty full two cups of water alright so what we're gonna do now is I'm gonna put this on pause we're going to come back and we're gonna do this quick and show you the steps and with which order I put them in alright so what you have here is 2 cups of water and 1 cup of already liquefied cannabis infused coconut oil add it in at medium to low heat and stir until it's consistently mixed alright so now that it's thoroughly mixed here and it's up to temperature what you're gonna want to do is going to add your twelve packs of unflavored gelatin right and you want to mix it in slowly to not make any clumps I'm gonna keep call of that once it's all in alright so now that the gelatin is nice and mixed in now I'm gonna add the four boxes of flavor gelatin it's cause I'm using blue berry berry blue but anyways that's it now mix thoroughly once mixed early I'll be back to fill your next step now that it's thoroughly mixed I'm going to increase the heat probably two notches on my stove okay what he's gonna do is gonna bring it to somewhat a while right back all right I've been stirring this whole time as I brought up the temperature and as you can see start in the bubble okay this is what you want you want to get a little bit more than this started a little bubble too much so I have to do is turn down the heat a little bit just pull it off all I can hear I don't want it to get too hot because what it'll do is it'll burn the sugar and stuff in here right stick to the bottom of the pan definitely I wanna do that so I backed it off one notch that's good so now it's blowing at this level and they keep stirring so it doesn't burn and what I'm gonna do is on the set of timer for five minutes protip you want to bring the stuff from the outside edge in see how I'm bringing that stuff in the color changes you want to make sure you're getting it nice and evenly stirred as you're doing this you can see the steam coming off I don't know you can see in the video but as you're doing it and your stove and your kitchen you're going to see the steam coming off that's why I do it for five minutes I'd boil off some of that water okay so if you want to do it for less than five minutes you're gonna have more material the less gummy stuff right so the more water you boil off a thicker it's going to get next step once this comes to a boil or once you're done your boiling off and you're ready to go then pour this into something you can pour into your molds I use the old glass or glittering top there and I go right into that it's easy to get out of that piece to put in all right there we go five minutes Rock turn that off right right off the stove turn that off and right into my measuring cup okay now what you're going to want to do is you want to get every little bit off and then what you're going to do is you want to take note of how much gelatin you have in your measuring cup so then you know hey this is this time when I boil it off for five minutes it turns in to be about X amount of company pay so for me that right there is three and a half cups of gelatin that's what it turned out to be okay guys so then into the mold in the way you go you'll want to do this fast because it's starting to harden already into your molds into the freezer and then take out and enjoy and there we go so these have been in the freezer for about a half an hour so now we can just kind of pop these out and enjoy so you'll see a Lincoln in in my in the description okay these these jello Lego blocks are are great for dosing right you can take four blocks I can take two blocks that can take six blocks or I can take all eight right so it's easier to dose when you have something like that okay you get these on Amazon and like I said there'll be a link in the description some of these other ones I've just bought locally at bulk Mart or whatever so but that's that's that's the start to finish guys so very quick recipe all the ingredients were at the start and you're good to go sometimes too when you get these Lego blocks I usually do a little bit of Pam spray in here cuz these little ones sometimes they get in here like these little itsy bitsy ones they get stuck in there so I just give them a little bit of Pam spray comes right out perfect these ones you don't need to they're a little bit sticky but they come out one piece right that's it so if you like my video give us a little thumbs up there subscribe do all that jazz got more stuff coming guys so be on the lookout", "cvjFAGNQswQ": "has the tincture flavor is obviously sitting on the outside but what i want to know is is it in the inside okay they're very firm and albany's are usually not firm they're very soft and as i bite through it i can kind of taste the tincture what's up guys welcome back today we're going to be doing a little experiment soaking gummy bears in tincture i know i have done this before so if you guys have seen that and i'll post a link for it it didn't work out very well and i think it was because of the gummies that i use i use gummy worms but i use great value like walmart brand and i don't remember what the ingredients were but i don't know i just i can't stop thinking about it i'm like i want to retry this and do it the right way so i got four different types of gummies or three different types of diet berries and then lifesaver gummies is like a bonus one just like i'm curious because i love those gummies um and i think that these two are going to work the best i'm not sure if these are going to work at all and these ones we'll see and the reason why is because these candies these gummies here don't have cornstarch in them and you don't want cornstarch or not i don't want to say you don't want i don't know if you don't want it i just i have a suspicion based on my experience with this stuff that the cornstarch ones are gonna not work as well but i don't know we're gonna find out um and the lifesaver gummies i don't know i read somewhere on reddit someone said they worked really well but then i read so many people saying it doesn't work for them but i want to try myself let's put these gummies in their bowls and then put some tincture on them these albanese gummies i could not find like regular albany's these are like the natural flavored ones um but they should work the same regardless and haribo i know everyone has access to these ones i feel like these are like a very common one and the main weird ones in the states you guys don't have many yards do you you guys well it's the same brand that makes all the sour patch kids and it makes um fuzzy peach and cereal shower blasters in canada they all say manyards on the package but in the states they don't say minions and do you guys have the gummies and like what does this say but anyways and then i like sugar gummies are so good my favorite is the um the dark green one i think it's watermelon so i'm just doing a few because i don't know how these are going to turn out i don't want to like have to waste all my tinctures if they don't turn out i mean i'm going to eat them for god bless but so now i just have my tincture here i store my tincture in the freezer um and i just took it out like half an hour before i don't really actually know if it's best for it to be cold or warm i try to look it up online i didn't really find an answer so i don't think it matters too much okay i'm using a dropper to pour it in oh my god i'm spilling it i don't want to sit down here make a mess okay i'm using a dropper to put it in because i don't want to pour it and then risk um wasting some and then you just want to fill them up to um kind of like you don't well i mean it probably would be best to fill them up completely but i'm not doing that just i don't know for this experiment um so i'm going to fill them so they're like mostly covered but if there's a little bit sticking out i'm not going to worry too much and any leftover tincture it's like i can just pour back into here i probably won't do that i'll just pour into a different container but it's like it's still usable right it's not like whatever's not used this has to get thrown away you can just put it back into a jar and if you notice any flecks of something in here just because i didn't do the best job filtering it because i made this tincture last night because i wanted to do this video today so like i was being a little bit lazy with my filtering okay so now we have our part one done we have our gummies and their bowls we're gonna leave them and i think it's gonna probably take about a day but i'll check in on them and see how they look after a few hours um so yeah i will see you guys in a bit once these have absorbed some more moisture oh and also it doesn't matter if you leave them um covered or uncovered or if it does let me know because again i researched this and it's mixed opinions whether it's better covered uncovered in the fridge there is not really a consensus on what's the best but what i what i was going with was i think it's better out of the fridge uncovered but don't i'm not the queen of soaking gummy so like i don't know um let me know in the comments i'm sure there's somebody who's an expert yeah so i will see you guys in a bit and we'll see how much these have absorbed okay i'm back it's not a day later it is a week later um they took a lot longer to soak than i thought they would so after like a day or two i was like this isn't going as easy as i expected so i threw them into a jar because i was like i don't know i just did so put them all in a jar and then i um let them sit for about a week and i like ship them every day now i'm going to take them out and we're going to compare them on with the sizes of the original see i was going crazy like every single day i'm like looking at them and seeing if the sizes change comparing and like honestly i couldn't see a size change i don't know so we're gonna take them out and see how it is and then i'm going to try each of them on different days without smoking or consuming any weed prior um to see if they work okay so let's first take these out and then compare them to their originals so i'm just gonna use um a fork here and i'm gonna take each of them out and lay them onto this plate okay so i took them all out and then i put um i separated them into their type and then on the bottom row i put unsoaked ones to compare them to and so far it looks like they barely even soaked up anything and i don't know i don't know if they're gonna work i hope they do um but visually i feel like i'm like a little bit disappointed i wanted to kind of see them swell and get larger um because that way you like for sure know that they absorbed it but we'll find out when i eat them so the lifesaver ones legitimately look like they got smaller i don't know how it's possible but they they do look smaller like i don't know i think it's kind of weird and then the elbow needs one keep in mind that the gummies are not a uniform size some are naturally bigger or smaller than others but the albany's like they look like you know what they look like they got a little bit bigger like maybe like a millimeter um on top that's these ones here and then our haribos over here don't look anything different at all they look exactly the same and then the main yards at the top these ones look like they absorb the most out of all of them but to be completely honest it looks they like all look very similar um i don't know uh let's taste them and let's see how i feel in a little bit another important thing to consider is that um the strength of them is all dependent on the strength of your tincture so if you have weak tincture you're going to need to eat more fibers if you have stronger tincture you can eat less so my effects or the strength that i have when i try these is not the same for it is it's not going to be the same for when you make it but um this way we can at least tell if it works and that it absorbed it even though visually it doesn't look like it did so today let's do the albanese ones okay i'm going to do the albanese ones now i'm going to have a um okay they're very firm and albanians are usually not firm they're very soft and as i bite through it i can kind of taste the t-shirt so this is a regular ebeneze and like it's very squishy and here's one of the ones that were soaked and it's much more firm it's kind of like hard for me to actually um squish it i don't know it just like almost like it's a different texture i'm trying to like get away so you guys can see what i'm talking about okay so here's here's regular and here's like they're pretty soft and this one has a tincture like i can't even like fold it like it was hard to pull i don't know if that was helpful but it's definitely firmer oh and i could taste the tincture it's totally in there i'm gonna eat the rest of the infused albanese gummies and then um i'll report back if it works and this will be the only thc i consumed today i haven't consumed any prior and um i'm not going to consume any while i'm waiting for this to kick in that way if i feel any effects we know definitely for sure it came from the gummies they're honestly significantly harder to treat which makes me like really excited because i feel like that means they probably absorbed it which is good and i also heard apparently like the alcohol flavor goes away the longer you soak it but they're like just as strong so be wary of that i can't taste the alcohol though okay it's a few hours later since i've taken the albanians and i do feel it working a little bit but i do have a very very high tolerance for edibles these days so it is what it is um but i definitely felt some of the effects so that's going to be a thumbs up for the albany's let's see how the other ones work okay i'm back today we're going to be doing the uh uh haribo i don't know why i couldn't remember that but yeah today we're gonna be eating the haribo ones and we're gonna see how they work okay it's like really hard but haribos are always kind of hard for me so let me taste the original one for comparison i can definitely taste the tincture i want to rinse my mouth up with the candy stoma sorry that's gross but um because the tincture flavor is obviously sitting on the outside but what i want to know is is it in the inside so when i keep chewing it i can taste it a little yeah it's not much firmer than the original i just tried it i'm soaked one and pretty much the same but the fuse one seems a little bit firmer i will keep doing these and then i'll see you guys in a bit okay it's a couple hours after the haribos and its same kind of thing small effect but that's not the fault of the gummies it's the fault of me for having a high tolerance so it did work um so thumbs up for the haribos okay it's really sunny so i'm sorry if like you guys can't see me i don't know okay today we're going to do the the lifesaver ones so here they are definitely very firm i have an original here to compare it yummy but um yeah they're very firm i almost hurt to chew on them but that's because i have invisalign i just took it out to eat these but it makes your teeth kind of sore because it's like having braces it definitely takes ting tree but again of course you're gonna have like a tincture taste because there's tincture on the outside so i'm gonna get water so i can do my i can see you know okay so i can taste a lot of tincture while i'm eating it but it's like is it from the outside or the inside so i'm going to put a hole in my mouth i'm going to like suck off the tincture and like try and get off with the water right i don't taste anything sure yet hmm maybe a little bit they definitely feel less tingy or taste less tinctury than the other ones do and here's the original one unsoaked very soft they're very easier to choose like the fact that they're firmer that has to mean something right some of them are like stronger than others i don't know they don't taste as tincture as the other ones did and then i'll see you guys in a bit and we'll see how these work i kind of don't think they're gonna work but we'll see okay now the main yards so i took the um here's like a regular one and then here's a infused one and you can like see they actually like look different like the color looks different i don't know if it's just because of the outside but and this one definitely soft and this one definitely not so soft so they don't taste as strong as the other ones did not the lifesaver ones but the [Music] yeah i don't taste very strong i will see you guys in a little bit uh you know these worked i don't know i don't i don't have a guess if they're gonna work or not we're gonna find out", "Ah-rj7hkHfQ": "[Music] you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

another science experiment yep it's called a gummy bear osmosis on experiment we did didn't we do this science experiment before princess Pam we sure did but it's a little different hello because this time we're testing out how is gonna change the size by using different types of coats or sodas oh yeah that's right laughs are we tired regular water salt water baking soda and dip liner it's soda mm-hmm so what are the supplies we need for this science experiment so what we're gonna need is we're gonna need some cups of course we're gonna need some yummy gummy bears we're also gonna need some Pepsi coca-cola sprite Diet Coke and water and also we're going to need a roller remember friends if you want to try this science experiment home make sure you ask a parent for help or permission and what about well they don't have to so does princess Pham or these dreams well you can use any coke or soda or drinks like you that you have a home so it you know I will juice orange juice water yeah that one we should do a version of juice next time yeah good one okay princess scram enough chatting how about we get started mm-hmm okay so let's go ahead and put our different sodas and our water in each I'm gonna start with the water so let's go ahead and pour it here next I'm going to do diet coke day I'm trying to get the same level as okay perfect and next I'm gonna do this bright right over here so let's go ahead and open it up and last but not least we're going to pour in our head see know what are we gonna eat some good meat no now we're gonna put the gummies inside of our sodas and inside uh okay I'm gonna start with my Pepsi and then in my coca-cola I'm gonna do my red I'm gonna go with this green one here and you go for a swim next up we have Diet Coke put a yellow one in here and last but not least what color should we do for the water princess fam we should do orange orange okay but bonus the gummies so now they're all swimming in the water whoa check it out all around me that looks super cool it doesn't this one does to be you can't really tell because it's like dark in there mmm-hmm and then the other two over here are very dark too the coca-cola and the Pepsi so we're just gonna have to wait and see Paulo should be ours okay so what do you want to do with our four hours that we're waiting well before before I was up we gotta make up our classes oh that's right mm-hmm now this one's kind of tricky because it's either in water or like soda mm-hmm so which ones you guys think and then this smallest mmm I think it's gonna be a close race but I think it's probably gonna get bigger versus getting smaller that's my thinking I hope so so much money think we'll get the biggest the one in water diet coke sprite coca-cola or Pepsi what do you think princess Pam I can't choose between any two cups so I'm just gonna go with the water oh yeah well I'm gonna go it's part okay okay so that's what we think will be the biggest the water in this price what is your guess and now we wait the four hours I say it's back to class in session okay I think it's been four hours okay let's take a look like me it's hard to see so how about we take it out and see all right good idea so here we have our regular size got me on this plate and now we're gonna take out gummies that been sucked in solution with the help of a utensil Oh Tesla brink so here we have it I took out the one in water and next let's take out the one in Diet Coke whoa it kind of changed colors purple BAM it soaked up the dynamic you wanna try sure okay I'm gonna take the one out in sprite mmm Wow that one grew too and next we have the coca-cola there it is and ooh that one change colors Joe and last but not least we have the one in Percy whoa I check all of those out so now what do we do now we need to measure to see which one is the biggest right yeah all right but first we must measure a regular sized government I don't really know how big it is mmm so according to my handy-dandy ruler here ooh it is exactly 2 and 1/2 centimeters we must write that down cuz we won't be fine since without collecting data ok so we have the regular gummy and you said it was two and a half two and a half cinema 2.5 centimeters okay go ahead princess Sam all right moving on we're gonna measure our gummy and Diet Coke and it's at two point seven centimeters all right let's move on over to the sprites and from toe to ears it is a whopping two point nine centimeters and look at this one in Coke let's see this one's a little tricky we have this one act oh it has one ear that's I'm gonna go in between and say it's two point seven centimeters let's go on to this one which is the one in Pepsi hmm this one's only about 2.6 and last but not least we have the one in water hmm let's see this one's close whoa this one is only 2.7 so here we have our data my favor make a graph oh let's do it I started up bar breath while we were waiting here we go we have gummy osmosis we have our measurements on this line in the centimeter we have our solutions diet coke sprite coke pepsi and water the bar graph that's in black is our regular gummy which princess Pham confirmed is 2.5 centimeters no let's go ahead and fill this pit so I'm gonna go ahead and fill in yellow for Diet Coke Princess Anne can you help me read this chart yep for Diet Coke it is okay good read the workforce right and sports right it's gonna be a whopping two point nine centimeters close to three so about right here okay and for Coke let's see two point seven two point seven very similar to our diet coke but right here what about Pepsi four Pepsi two point six two points sick okay and what about water two points right here according to our scientific experiments the one that got the biggest is the sprite as you can tell compared to all the other ones it groups two point nine it is the winner hey princess bamboo buffalos that will be the biggest and my hypothesis that's right and you know what you get for being right what it you can eat the gummy right you should eat it I mean it's just so inspiring it's not bad but good texture [Music] although super fun you guys that's the end of today's video maybe like more signs experiments give you a big thumbs up and subscribe bye remember this is fine", "CYHTDnsuZGY": "ready for a fun simple treat for you and the family let's get started today we're going to be making one of my favorites gummy bears but wait we can't have gummy bears on keto correct not so fast today we're going to make something that is super simple and it really only requires three simple ingredients all right so the ingredients we're going to need real simple today i went down to walmart and picked up four of the sugar-free flavors of jell-o it's really all you need when we make this recipe keep in mind i'll put the macros at the end but 20 calories absolutely zero carbs three proteins per and that's going to give you about 25 gummy bears per serving you can get the molds and amazon i also picked up an additional mold for the gummy worms those are just a little bit extra fun so all right to get started we're going to go with a quarter cup of water in the pot we're going to bring it to a slow boil now one of the things i told you is that this is super simple we're going to go with two simple ingredients i'm going to start off with a little bit of the sugar-free orange and just pick you up a packet of unflavored gelatin that's really about all you need bring it down a little bit so we don't we don't burn it out but that's really all you need i'm going to bring this in and let's get started start by putting in our one packet of our gelatin and then we'll put in our one packet of orange stir this in and you're going to want to go until everything is fully dissolved okay now that we've got our jello completely melted we're simply going to take an eye dropper that we we got with our molds and we're going to start filling the molds it's that simple [Music] okay so as you can see the one box gave us about 35 gummy bears and gave us an additional three of the gummy worms now keep in mind we said a little bit earlier and we'll put the macros out uh shortly after this but for all that we just made for the 35 or so gummy bears and the and the worms you're talking uh pretty much zero carbs on any of this stuff it's a great fantastic substitute for when you have that sweet tooth or for when you're just wanting to have something a little bit different like a gummy bear we're gonna go ahead and fill up the rest of these and once we're done i'll be right back [Music] as you can see we're starting to wrap up what we have um and we've made quite the load of uh quite a load of gummy bears um this is going to be an actually a fantastic treat to have but i'll tell you what so we talked a little bit about um what we can do for these and how we can snack now it's time for the real talk okay guys so we've finished our first recipe we've got some good gummy bears now the part that we're going to talk about here is going to be the real talk about keto so you're going to see a ton of recipes and a lot of them are going to sit there and say that they taste just like the real thing i don't want to break your heart they don't taste like the real thing and so many of you noticed it's just gelatin and jell-o sugar-free jell-o and so many people want to look at that and say well what you basically made is you've made jell-o shots or jell-o bears or jell-o gummy bears or whatever you want to call it just sugar-free and you're not wrong and so this kind of goes into the keto mindset about how you've got to look at your food a lot of the things you'll see on the keto diet are going to be very similar to some of the foods that you eat but not exactly the same and the reason being is that we don't use a lot of the same ingredients that are in a lot of the foods and i give a really good example what we make today has literally zero carbs you can eat these things until your heart's content you're talking about 20 calories per serving of about 25 that's an entire handful and by comparison i'm going to show you something that i think is very interesting [Music] that right there when i went to go pick up our gelatin and the jell-o sugar-free jell-o at the store today i ran across as i was getting some himalayan salt which is another great keto staple there was a a little container of sugar-free gummy bears and it was kind of unique because that's what we were making today now as part of that one of the things that we had seen was that a single serving um 200 i'm sorry a single serving is 47 carbs 47. and out of that 170 calories and 5 protein but 47 carbs if you're really starting to look at it and this is where the the uh the product type and the serving size start to come into play this container was literally maybe a little bit bigger than a tuna can for some comparison and it said that in that container there was nine servings so i can tell you that before i started keto i could eat the entire container not a problem it's not that much it was probably three handfuls of gummy bears now what they did say on the label was a serving size was eight gummy bears so for eight gummy bears you've got 47 carbs 5 protein and 170 calories and so i look at that and i go okay so what am i really getting in real life food and so what you're really looking at is if you break it down you are getting about 211 carbs 765 calories and 22 protein that's what you're going to get if you eat just half of it and that's really kind of typical of the standard american diet and so when we start looking at things for keto and you start looking at how you revise the way you think about food the jello gummy bears make perfect sense you can have them they taste pretty similar to gummy bears your taste buds are going to change and they're going to acclimate to some different things but you're going to be able to go in and actually have something that you can take to the movie theaters when they open again um you're going to be able to take them outside you're going to be able to give them to your kids for snacks they are sugar-free and they're just a great alternative for when you really want something for the sweet tooth so really look at the gummy bears as something that is an alternative to what you used to eat and that's what's really important about this recipe it's not that it's a simple two ingredient recipe where you're using a little bit of water some gelatin and some jello and that's not what it's really about what it's really about is revising the way we think and revising the way we eat and how we view how we view food and so if i can have an option of having 50 i'm talking a big old bowl of gummy bears that taste like it and i hit and run the refrigerator sometimes i'll grab a handful of these things out of a ziploc bag or container and i know that i'm only getting 20 calories and zero carbs it's perfect i hope you enjoyed this video hope you enjoy the real talk it's the honest talk i'm still fairly new at keto we've been doing it now for about five six months and so we're learning every day and i hope you continue to stick with us and i hope you do the journey with us take care", "SF1A9cTl7mE": "- Can I have more of the tequila ones? (laughing) That's my final thought. - Yeah, are we allowed to eat more? - We are here to taste\ntest some different gummies and the alcohol that it\nmay or may not taste like. - I like gummy candy, because it is delicious, and it's the best kind of candy. - Candy with alcohol, I think, is just genius. - Everyone needs a little bit\nof drinking during the day to get them through it, and might as well try it with the gummies. - I'm hoping that these are more sugary than alcoholic, that they\nhave a whisper of alcohol. - Are you ready to try the candies? - I'm ready. - Okay, let's do it. (jazz music) - That is very sugary. - I can take the bourbon.\n- Mm-hmm. - But --\n- That's not bad. - How many do you need\nto have a shot of this? - Cheers.\n- Yup, cheers. - Mm-mm. I'm done, nope. - Ooh, man.\n- Gummy bears. - I'm gonna chase it with a gummy bear. - Uh-huh.\n- Is that okay? - These gummy bears are more of a treat for me to have during the day at work. This will make me die. - Yeah, the gummy bear's\nbetter than the alcohol there. - Agree. - Yeah, the gummy doesn't make you feel like the warm bourbon feeling. - Yeah.\n- You normally get. (salsa music) - Oh my God. I'm so about it. - Can't taste the tequila. - Mm-mm. It doesn't taste anything like tequila. If tequila tasted like this, I would drink it all the time. - I may have to steal them for later. - I can eat like, I'm not kidding, like a ton of these. - Can I throw one in your mouth? (salsa music) (laughing) - I was curious if that\nwas like, salt, but. - What if we eat a gummy,\nand then take the shot? - Yeah, let it absorb. - Cheers.\n- Mm-mm-hmm. Cheers. - Yes.\n- Mm-mm-mm-mm. - Tequila with a gummy chaser, yup. - It's closer than the bourbon was. - If they turned this\nflavor into a margarita, I would drink that real fast. But the shot itself? You took the whole thing? - Yeah, I told you, I love tequila. (soft, mellow music) - I think this is a good,\nguess all right snack. - These are delicious. - I feel like these have the perfect blend of they taste like a gummy bear the way a gummy bear's\nsupposed to taste like, and they also taste like champagne. - Oh, no, those are really\nlike tart in flavor. - I'd almost be scared to have them, because I feel like I'd have 20 of them, and I might end up wasted, if there is alcohol content. - That did its job. That is alcoholic candy. - Cheers.\n- Cheers. - I like the champagne more. - This is so good. I'll finish this. - We have to work. - We do have to work. I feel flushed. Am I like going red? Am I sweaty? - I know, right? I haven't had lunch yet. Am I little tipsy? I might be a little tipsy. Is that sad? (whimsical music)", "QqGWuQXJbcI": "hello [Music] um uh [Music] um [Music]", "6geM4Q9pPkw": "they have become infamous sugarfree gummy bears uh seem like an innocuous treat but if you'll check the Amazon reviews which we will they are actually more like super laxative so what turned these innocuous cute little gummy bears into um the diarrhea it's called maltitol blame maltitol which is a sugar alcohol it's why it can be sweet but not actually made of sugar is this what's we're seeing a lot in sugar-free like sodas and candies and it's a version of it you know and and they specifically used it in this case and it basically messes with your digestive tract on the way down it kind of confusing because most of the time as sugars are going through your intestines they're getting taken out into your bloodstream right but these sugars stay inside your intestines and through this power of osmosis basically you're trying to it's a little complicated but basically the liquids are trying to equalize and get equal amount of this of the sugar on both sides so all the liquids flood into your intestines and then they need to go somewhere so they uh they exit and which is really cool it's really unfortunate what this deli it's really unfortunate for the people who have eaten too many gummy bears but the fact that this was this was initially meant to be you know a good thing you want less sugar and less sugar is in some ways a good thing but it's sitting there in your stomach cuz your saliva hasn't broken it down and it's forcing all this extra water into your sort of digestive system and that's how you get diarrhea too much water in your digestive system so these reviews are out of control if you want to read them there are hundreds if not maybe a thousand what's weirdest made they vary between being five stars and one star because on one hand it's a great cleanse y'all on the other hand oh my god there's one I have here let's see I'm just gonna skip right to the juicy part Jimmy no pun intended okay a little intended what came out of me felt like someone tried to funnel Niagara Falls through a cop straw I swear oh my god I'm gonna skip that line 100% liquid flammable liquid napalm and it went on for hours I had five pounds of these innocent-looking delicious tasting hell bear so I told my friend about what happened to me and thinking it had to be some type of sensitivity I had to sugar substitute and in spite of my warnings a graphic description she decided to take her chances take them off silly woman all the same for her and a phone call from her while on the toy you telling me shed wish she had listened I think she she probably was crying yes so much of this is safe for a person if teen gummy bears 15 not five pounds so if you have more than 15 gummy bears like have like the safe dose is something like a third of a gram of maltitol per kilogram of your weight right so on average for the average adult it's 15 gummy bears for kids it's obviously less you think you can eat more because they're sugar-free but you need to eat less who eats 15 gummy bears gummy bears I usually like 25 or 30 I don't know you're twice as many as you awesome that's why I'm sticking to the sugar ones I'll take the sugar over the other but do you know what this reminds me of do you guys remember olestra the olena potato chips potato chips yeah Wow chip 20 years ago which kind of dating us yeah those wild potato chips were yeah those Doritos that basically it was this artificial fat called olestra and the idea was you don't get any fat but what it did was cause diarrhea really bad and they actually had to put a warning label on it saying this will cause loose stools and when you see those words together loose stools you just don't really feel in the mood for potato chips Oh on the plus side if you ever want to dress up like for Halloween as a sea cucumber all you have to do is eat a whole bunch of these and then like a sea cucumber you too can expel your entire insides it expels its guts out of its very own Ring of Fire so do you think the problem here is what's inherent with a lot of diet foods is like oh well if it's low I can eat more I think the problem is that scientific illiteracy basic you know nutritional illiteracy people need to know more about what they're putting in their bodies and and and some basics about how they work and sugar-free seems like a good sell and like I said sometimes it is a good sell especially if you're like diabetic um but you need to know how many you're eating it's not that you should stay away from sugarfree gummy bears oh I think you should always it's that if you're going to eat them you need to eat fewer than the amount that will make you turn into a sea cucumber this is a it's a dangerous path you walk my friend so I think the lesson here is either keep your portions of the control or avoid multi tall and that is why those gummy bears are the worst sight in hell bears

love it but we'll get into this like I said we get a ton of messages I don't answer them all personally thank you for everything but we're gonna go over some of the most common questions that we get excuse me eating a lot of food these days so snacks all right first one gummy bears why do I eat the gummy bears just like them there is no physiological benefit that I am trying to attain from eating the gummy bears like I'm not like hot I can't wait for that [ __ ] Moonie 5 gummy bears and get like an insulin spike no gummy bears are not good for you there if you eat too many of them [ __ ] your [ __ ] up in there you'll be [ __ ] for days and all this and people were talking about it and I don't eat that many gummy bears ain't like a handful of them go get like a handful like eight put like five in my pre-workout like eat three that's it I eat my gummy bears around pre-workout time I love it they make me smile they make me feel good about myself they doing my favorite candy since I was a kid my mom you know whenever like Christmas and Easter and all that [ __ ] gummi bears whenever candy stores like still exist you don't see them too often now at least around here like you be would go into the gummy bears store they'd have like the [ __ ] the wall of like things you flip up and pull out and put in the bag and all that [ __ ] yeah I haven't seen those in a while but always got a ton of gummies it's my [ __ ] and to this day you know being a pro bar being a bodybuilder in general you deprive themselves of the things you like gummy bears whenever I died it was one thing I didn't need a lot of does it's not good for you also making my coffee away like no sugar no creamer just black [ __ ] that [ __ ] sucks but those are the things you take out of your life so that you can look good naked so now that I'm not doing that season setting getting jacked and tan looking that's much tan I need the gummi bears no physiological benefit zero none don't care what it does just like to eat them if you're looking for insulin spike or some type of benefit from a carbohydrate you can drink [ __ ] Gatorade you can get a rapid glycogen loader car power drink your pre-workout I take those drink the Gatorade might mix it with [ __ ] Gatorade and it's still the gummy bears in why because like the taste they make me feel good so that's it also the deadlifts and gummy bears sure so that shirt big sellin shirt for us we love it that came from time whenever the deadlifts and gummy bears thing whenever I was going through a pretty rough time in my life whenever I was going through the divorce with my ex and me you know having full custody of kids and being super dad and having to do all this stuff it was really rough it sucked and had a lot of crazy emotions [ __ ] with my head and I thought you know I needed to I needed to go to a place that would like let all my aggression out let all my [ __ ] anxiety let all my let all my emotions pour out and I was like I'm gonna go to the gym I'm gonna eat gummy bears train back the deadlifts and pull-ups and all the hardship sweat my [ __ ] balls off and left listen him out so that's what I did that's where that shirt came from that shirt that is just such a wild success and everybody loves it because if they go eat gummy bears and do deadlifts and listen to metal and do hard [ __ ] and make you sweat bro that's good [ __ ] makes bill glad that came from a really shitty time so you know how if you hear those things that like good can come from really bad places and really bad situations that it did and that was where it came from I was able to go to the gym just eat handful gummy bears do set it deadlifts we put up and put on more weight and for gummy bears do deadlifts that's my [ __ ] loved it so that's where it came from the gummy bears do not eat gummy bears thinking you're going to like get some great grand [ __ ] effect from them they don't hold a whole lot of good nutritional value they don't anything they're pure [ __ ] sugar their [ __ ] will [ __ ] your teeth up after belly up I don't care I like on ah so I hope we can close the case on that situation I mean I think I think [ __ ] flex magazine was like oh like after I started saying this [ __ ] they were like oh like you can eat gummy bears and like post-workout and it's like good cuz it's sugar and this now it's like Jesus Christ no it doesn't know how it works like there's way better things you could be [ __ ] eating post-workout then shitty gummy bears okay maybe drink water I might be a good starter not [ __ ] gummy bears is that it been [ __ ] or better than she [ __ ] protein bars dick after selling oh man gummy bears I just like them Oh what else snacks that's another question snacks what do I personally like because I always talk about snacks [ __ ] love them and what are also good bodybuilder snacks too that you can have in your program that can help add weight and do good for you so start number one me personally I love salty snacks [ __ ] extra salty pretzels Doritos cheez-its get snacks that's my [ __ ] I don't the gummy bear thing the sweet thing that's only pre-workout I just like those but from like the snackin standpoint like it high would've baked and sitting there got a couple beers in me yep yep extra salty pretzels they're in there there's Doritos in there I like nacho cheese the kids like Cool Ranch that's good cheese it's in there too so moving on to snacks that benefit protein that benefit you as a bodybuilder [ __ ] peanut butter and jelly rice cakes those are my go-to I usually have two or three of them before I hit the gym right now my calories are up I eat the Smuckers all-natural creamy I like crunchy but I go through I go through about 16 ounce through our peanut butter in about three days yeah maybe sooner depends on what I'm training calories are crazy high right now I've never eaten this much fat I am right now it's working out well I like it I feel better I think more clear I think more clearly or clearer however you want to term that but yeah peanut butter and jelly rice cakes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches the sandwiches in the middle of the night I'll have like I'll have a cup of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches if I had big training day I usually do like a large cup of almond milk or I'll mix up a protein shake like one scoop of protein with 8 to 12 ounces of almond milk with my - peanut butter jelly sandwiches yeah snack wise I also so in the truck I also will have trail mix but something so if I'm behind on a meal and I need to keep my calories high or in between meals mean - you know peanuts almonds dried fruit I love that [ __ ] peanut butter bean butter pretzels they're not really greatest for you it's like that's not salty fat guy thing that if you notice there's a lot of peanuts and peanut butter involved with my with my snacking fruit I eat a banana or two a day apples if we got them yeah I do a good bit of fruit too right now my meals are quite large you know a meeting about 40 to 50 grams of protein along with 70 to 100 grams of carbohydrates at each meal five solid meals a day so the snacking is limited and it's like I said it's usually higher calorie snacking as well so that's also why look at the my training sessions need to be [ __ ] intense they need to be optimized they need to be really [ __ ] hard so I sweat I burn those calories I need to eat that type of food if you are not training like that you will get fat from eating all of that [ __ ] for [ __ ] sure other good snacking for dieting that's another question people go out to snack and while dieting the fruit has sugar in it even though it's unprocessed processed on processed sugar natural sugars I it depends on how far you are into a prep some people don't like it I'm still fine with some fruit here and there probably up until like six eight weeks out maybe seven weeks somewhere on there cut it out other people have their own decisions about that I'm talking about everyday snacking uh cucumbers celery greens those are good snack and thins while you're dieting problem is with those is whenever you start adding [ __ ] to it like peanut butter dressings things like that I usually stick to like if I need to I'll add a little bit of salt to it nice and tasty tastes like salt with water and like crunch that's pretty much what it is about peanut butter jelly sandwich but no those those are pretty much my daily snacks that's it yeah I like salty pretzels ice cream unlike that [ __ ] with my belly and lactose-intolerant so I got to be careful with that yep pretty much it locked peanut butter my jelly I think when I go to the store I typically buy like four or five jars at a time but hey what's do yeah no I don't think yo Girt back to us yogurt would be a good snack for people candy you can eat candy too little [ __ ] your [ __ ] all up being sarcastic don't do that late night snacks cereal I do that raisin bran with fruity pebbles in there protein shake is the milk fuckin'-a right that's my [ __ ] take a nice dump in the morning from it all right moving on how much protein should I eat per day oh boy along with this people also get a lot of digestion I get a lot of digestive questions how much protein should be today what depends on how much lean body mass you have right the next thing is is what are you training like how are you training what what are you doing what what physical exertion are you putting out what are you putting out that you need food for how are you training like I said me when I'm going in to Train I'm training like a [ __ ] animal I am going nuts I'm going to put myself through the [ __ ] hardest workout I possibly can for that day and I'm not gonna settle for anything less I'm going to push myself so that I'm gonna push myself further than I thought I could go before whenever I started when I started I'm like I'm gonna [ __ ] work today as I'm doing it I'm searching for ways for that workout to get harder I want to find it so it can be harder so I can challenge myself then I need to eat because the [ __ ] that I just did to challenge myself I was [ __ ] pouring sweat I was shaking I was pushing myself way past what my body actually wanted to do so therefore now I need to refuel my body so that it can grow so that it can rebuild it so that it can recover how much protein do I need to do that see some people be like oh you need 1.5 grams of protein per lean body mass so if you're - if you have 200 pounds of lean body mass you need 300 grams of protein it's a good way to gauge it but if you are working if you are doing the workouts that I've been doing that I do [ __ ] 300 grams ain't enough will it work yes will it suffice yes but in order to grow need more in my opinion you also need a fuckload of carbohydrates because actually meeting right now you're also getting a good bit fast I probably take in per day in protein I probably take in like 350 grams of protein per day that's you know I'm eight weeks in almost nine and a half weeks into my into a program so I'm in the thick of it I got seven and a half weeks left of this program so I'm in the middle of it and I'm [ __ ] working hard my body is burning so therefore that 350 grams of protein probably around for 425 on like cheat days were very very high calorie days my body can utilize all of those and I know that through a couple things one being my digestion I'm not when I'm not pushing out as much gas I'm not gasps I'm not bloated with gas and I'm my elimination schedule is now the same every day so now I am utilizing all of the food that I'm eating okay one thing in the beginning of a program when people start out and they just started training either like in week 1 2 3 and they're eating this food and they are just [ __ ] farting like a fiend they're farting all [ __ ] day long and it smells like [ __ ] bro you are your body it is overload for your body you're [ __ ] it out you're not absorbing it all and you are just gaseous [ __ ] your body doesn't like what's going on so that's why in the beginning you have to start with a little bit lower like I was eatin in the beginning I was even like 275 grams of protein and I was still with my body was becoming acclimated to us part and I was my shed schedule was out of control was also eating a lot of carbohydrates and fats but the protein standpoint with one and a half grams of protein per per pound of lean body mass is a great place to start if you are feeling uncomfortable because that's too much then it's too much you need to back down a little bit maybe 1 1 in a quarter of grams or put two five grams then as you progress into your program you can increase it so the protein thing like I said that's a great place to start that's that's a well-known fact but just also take into consideration all of the other food that you're eating as well my macros for the day broccoli protein 350 grams of protein like I said over for on my on my cheat days with my high calorie days carbohydrates 550 to 750 average per day than on my high calorie days thousand more possibly fats you know probably safe fats roughly yeah 100 to 150 a day pretty pretty pretty religiously every day and I attest that type of eating to the way I'm trained I haven't trained this hard like I happen since years ago years ago and Mikan a lot of 236 pounds when I wake up I'm like 239 when I go to bed and then just keep on training so from a protein standpoint that digestion part pay attention to your digestion digestion absorption elimination if your elimination process is going wrong or your fart a lot and [ __ ] spraying the toilet when you're taking a dump or you're not being absorbed it's just a mess your fart a lot crazy gassy body's having a hard time digesting digesting all of that so back off the protein a little bit like your body become acclimated and as you continue to train harder and harder and the body becomes acclimated and you start working into it all start increasing your food that's how you grow that's how your body has a smooth transition into your your progress your goals it's my opinion [ __ ] do I know next ah here's a good one this is it should I take steroids yes no should I smoke meth sure no that would not be a good idea should I smoke cigarettes if you want to a really good idea that question is a personal [ __ ] choice it's up to you should you do it my opinion no there's pot calling the kettle black however that's saying goes no III don't you though you better have a purpose but I have a purpose you better have researched it and you better have an understanding of what's going to occur if you're asking me should you take steroids what do you know about them have you done research are you educated do you know what the side effects are do you know what can occur do you know if the answer is no then my answer is [ __ ] no if your answer is yes and you can explain to me all those things I just asked all right then now it's personal choice it's up to you you're you're educated you know things are gonna go wrong you know the consequences that you're gonna have to live with possibly for the rest of your life it's all up to you that means that you can't come crying like a little [ __ ] victim that this happened to me because I did this well [ __ ] yeah did would you expect your stupid [ __ ] that's real [ __ ] saying a [ __ ] joke you know these I hear [ __ ] crazy stories from people with the Jemez crazy stories people [ __ ] taking a thousand digs at rent a week that's it thousand makes a trend a week no tests no nothing just the trend are you a [ __ ] [ __ ] yep you are and then after they're done they want to say uh it didn't work out for me I had all these problems no [ __ ] [ __ ] you had problems like most people don't even know what the [ __ ] that what their supplements are supposed to do and then they're also taking a bunch of gear and wondering why the dick doesn't get hard after they stop taking [ __ ] or I don't understand the whole process of testicular atrophy or anything like that holy [ __ ] don't be that goddamn stupid some people are and if you are one of those people I'm gonna highly recommend you change your ways so my next recommendation would be to go watch two steroids drugs and light videos that we put out we put out I think you tell you well five of them thus far the first ones where you should start part one it's really good but overall like I said in those videos it's all personal choice don't do dumb [ __ ] that's like my [ __ ] blanket statement for everything I've done dumb [ __ ] I'll probably continue to do some dumb [ __ ] here and there but make sure that that type of such that type of thing right there should I take steroids take that seriously do your research don't think that you can take steroids for six weeks and everything will be okay and then you'll stop and everything will be okay no [ __ ] these are hormones that you are injecting or putting into your body they are going to affect you everything in this [ __ ] because if I can take something that makes me bigger faster and stronger if I eat train hydrate work harder leave wadd some crazy [ __ ] take it serious don't be a [ __ ] don't be dumb I mean how am i able to sit here and say all this [ __ ] because I did do a lot of dumb [ __ ] he did that's how I learned I'm stubborn bullheaded I'm a risk taker I'll continue to be that and everything that I do in life because that's my personality but I'm recognizing that it's myself and that's how I operate I also am taking full accountability for my decisions in my actions you don't hear me crying nobody so whenever you do these things you're not allowed to cry like a little [ __ ] victim well this happened to me I can't believe I don't want it yeah dude what the [ __ ] do you expect of course that's what's gonna happen [ __ ] off job I hope this was fun I have

fridge every day you're supposed to mix it so they don't stick all together so now we're supposed to let the soap for five days then after five days you're supposed to add the fruit punch concentrate actually I chose fruit punch but you can choose any kind of juice she's like it's supposed to make the taste of the gummy bears not be so vodka like we'll see if it works we're supposed to soak it in the punch for about two days so I'll see you guys the seven days and see if it worked well it's been a long seven days waiting for these babies to get ready so we're going to dump them in the strainer

new DIY season eyes I am going to make my first giant gummy bear but not just any giant gummy bear oh cool a gummy bear made of cooling and flavored of kool-aid because kool-aid is iconic I thought I need to do something with cool a hypothesis and if I'm sweaty it's because it's really hot in here I've been cooking a lot of fun socks these intros are films after I cook so my gummy bear is sitting right there I'm not going to show you till the end two things don't forget to turn on the notifications it's the little bells symbol click it so you get notified whenever I post a video it'll get sent to your phone and be like being up series under video well and once I go almost if you have a really cool phone also follow me on Twitter snapchat Instagram all the names will be below I'm going to get so much love talkin to you so go problem in there so we can communicate more oh also follow me on you now I'm going to be doing a lot of broadcast next month this month is a little busy so next month I'm going to full swing of things so all the links to those will be below they got my heart okay and so in the yellow young wait I thought I held on to awkward no it's too much I thought the frame was going to be less on just like I said a little bit I just lit out for too long too much okay y'all so to make this gummy bear I took a big pot and I started filling up with a lot of agua aka water they can a art human gasoline it's what we live on google it science amen thank you lord for water so then I took this huge thing of kool-aid and I just poured it in a taupe beautiful honestly it looks like the Aurora lights in Alaska you know I'm talking about like the lights in the sky the aliens me also aliens have made me I'm a conspiracy myself I'm an alien King what I didn't say that you didn't hear in here that was a Mandela effect so I'm adding tons of unflavored gelatin I'm just pouring in a lot of packets like a lot like y'all that is 20 times sped up no joke literally 20 times I just kept adding and adding and then anymore and then also some more cow bones and then I mixed it up and then okay this is a long mixing part why why why is it so long I don't know why did I make it so long oh my golly am I still mixing my Narnia what's happening so I finally finished mixing and now it is time to cook it so I basically just cook the gelatin until it was dissolved so I'm mixing it and I cooked it and until it's steaming like that I see it steaming you see the steam rising from the car in Titanic so then I got my gummy bear mold and I just basically poured in my kool-aid jello mixture into the gummy bear slowly but surely it's almost full and y'all I know the gummy bear was so much bigger in the thumbnail but guess what guess what I felt like yeah I felt like making it big that's the answer bigger is better when it comes to candy so for the third gummy bear what I did was I added in some frosting just to make it more of a less see-through color and just to you know experiment make them a little different I made three so that in case of one messed up I would have two backups I'm a genius now thank God on one of them I put Pam like first before I like comporting the stuff cuz though in the head Pam and the other two I forgot to put Pam on them so they completely got stuck I know gelatin could even get stuck well I don't know these things so that's my final gummy bears the one with Pam on it Pamela always saves the day and that's me dancing with it and now I'm tasting it and it it's okay it tasted really good by added way too much gelatin like always I need to add less it's just I always always want to be on the safe side you know I'm saying but yeah I don't need that much gelatin and it's probably not good for you to eat that much anyways so um now is the video thank you guys so much for watching don't forget to watch my last DIY where I made a giant cheese ik and also I made a giant Oreo recently so go check that out as well I love you guys so much I'll see you next video ooh boo boo they fill a few seconds okay oh boo boo wait there's still five more boo boo", "E3aJKfETuaQ": "who wants to talk CBD this guy does and let me tell

stuff alright guys so here you got it just a nice bag it almost looks like it's recycled um it's like a waxy paper bag kind of nice uh in here you'll see CBD FX hemp gummy bears you got an 8 count this is just like the little fun size snack pack it does contain full spectrum CBD it is gluten free it is non-gmo and it is vegan oh yeah that's right so for all you've eaten out there you can eat these yes you can let's flip it over and on the back the supplement facts serving size 2 gummy bears servings per container you four so obviously you got to eat to to match what's on the label no fat 16 calories sugar 2 grams not bad not bad at all did we cover carbs nope I don't think we did carbs 3.6 grams whew so there's really no carbs here 20 milligrams a hip extract and 10 milligrams of CBD per gummy bear remember you got to take two ingredients organic cane sugar organic tapioca syrup water organic seaweed extract natural flavors and colors organically grown CBD rich hemp oil gummy bears contain no corn syrup no animal gelatin no artificial sweeteners so that makes them what guilt-free indulging never tasted better that's right and it's true these things are delicious on 19min a lot these statements have not been evaluated by the FDA or not intended to diagnose treat cure any disease they have to say that because the FDA you know doesn't really regulate any of this hasn't really looked into it yadda yadda but trust me trust me Kenna pity all in CBD is naturally occurring in the industrial hemp plant and legally imported and produced that's important I do have a fact sheet over here that I'm going to go over with you to tell you why these are legal these are legal you are allowed to have these product and design our trademark cba dfx does not sell or distribute any products that are a violation of the u.s. control substance act the u.s csa made in the USA alright so now that we covered the packaging let's get into what's actually in these things I do have a fact sheet so allow me to read you some of the facts all right CBD FX premium CBD oil has been meticulously sourced from natural organic hemp plants grown in Europe that's very important that they have been grown in Europe we'll get into that in a minute and then shipped directly to their lab in Southern California the cannabinoid oil offered through CBD FX is always substandard sustainably sourced from the highest quality plants which ensures that you reap the benefits of all the cannabinoids terpenes and amino acids fatty acids and vitamins & merrill's it's got all of that stuff in here guys we're proud to offer our customers the most traceable organic CBD oil for sale anywhere cool so they can trace ok so you get this bag in particular they can trace this back back to the plant that it came from which is nice so why is it legal alright it is non psychoactive hemp and it was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 the hemp biomass okay which means the big crop of where the CBD comes from the hemp that is sourced from comes with an import certificate signed off on by Homeland Security and they only use CBD derived from the stalks of European grown hemp plants their products meet the standards of 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp must be industrial hemp and contain less than 0.3 percent THC hmm products are exempt from the CSA and the DEA s drug scheduling practices which classify whole hemp extracts as schedule 1 drugs extracts and here's the important part extracts from the stalks of EU grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice so there you have it now we will put the facts to the side tear this open and try one right guys so here we go that's terrible to try I'm telling you these things are freaking delicious so I do rip off the top there we go they are resealable ok as you can see that the little ziplock and they are pretty sugary too but they do come in my favorite flavor red alright it's kind of like a cherry fruit punchy but yeah uh-huh like I said it's like a cherry fruit punch you get the sugar obviously because they are coated in sugar um but it does take like that earthy taste away that you get in regular CBD don't get me wrong it's still there but it's not bad at all and you know I mean you know it's not bad it's actually quite tasty I've been using these for a couple weeks now the next video I'm going to do on these will be the big the big bottle and I've been eating those at night now when your first pop them in your mouth and chew them up like I said you're gonna get the sugar you're gonna get like that little fruit punch cherry type flavor and then at the very end when you swallow and kind of let everything chill out that's when you're gonna get that little earthy tint of the CBD in there so you know it's in there but it's good by all means trust me it's good it doesn't make you make faces or anything it's good stuff if you want some and again I do suggest you

until next time it needs your boy big J for VAP code TV where you watch decide invade get you some gummy bears and until then I am out [Music]", "D7xYWUnC8UE": "hi everybody this is Jen from cookies cupcakes and cardio comm today I'm going to be showing you how to make gummy candy we're going to be using the nostalgia electrics gummy candy maker and I'm going to be showing you how to make the little tiny gummy bears and this giant one so let's get started so when I opened the nostalgia electrics gummy candy maker what I found inside were four individual trays like this and then four of these silicone liners so we've got worms fish and then two gummy bear components it comes with two of these heating pots and then this is the heating machine part that and that all the heat comes from that metal part in the center there it also came with a large gummy bear mold and a set of fairly exploit Ori instructions so I'm going to go through my recipe on how to make the gummy bears using this machine so the first thing we want to do before we start making our gelatin mix is we need to fill up the each of the trays with a layer of ice so I'm going to put about half of the container in make sure you want to make sure that your ice is level so it doesn't make any indents into your gummies so I've filled up the other ones already and now I'm going to turn my machine on the my one thing about this kit is that this machine does take quite a while to heat up that's my one complaint but I'm going to give you an alternative when I show you how to make the Jumbo gummy bear so into this pot is going to go 1/2 a cup of water and that's about its maximum capacity as well and then I have one container of a for serving amount of jello which is 85 grams and it's going in and in with it as well is three envelopes of gelatin which equal about 21 grams so you just put all that into the pot give it a stir and then you have to wait so the waiting is going to take probably about 10 minutes and it's going to start to thicken up right away and don't worry I started worrying right away that it will I'd ruined it but just you have to wait till it gets the pot gets really hot and it will get hot so be careful that you don't hurt yourself and you want to make sure that all the gelatin has dissolved in the water so when that has happened I'll be back to show you what it should look like so my gelatin mixture has been heating now for about 10 minutes and I can tell it's ready to go because it's real iqua fide and also the gelatin is in here is dissolved completely so that tells me it's ready to be poured into the molds but it's gonna take that off now another slight complaint here is that the little heating pot is a little bit unstable so I don't want to be pouring this hot liquid while the heating pot is kind of a sided so I'm just gonna turn it off and take it and put it over to the side now really handy are the little spouts on the side here so I can just gently pour them into the molds and fill them up so it takes about 15 minutes for these smaller ones to set so I'm gonna fill up all of my molds here and then I'm going to show you in the meantime while these ones are setting I'm gonna show you how to make the Jumbo Teddy the Jumbo gummi mold to make the giant gummy bear we're going to be using berry blue jello you can use any flavor that you'd like to and it takes two packages and these are for serving packages and they equal a hundred and seventy grams in total we're going to be using six packages of the Knox gelatin unflavored and that equals 42 grams 1 cup of water and the Jumbo mold that's included in the machine kit so let's put this together and make the giant gummy bear so in this one I'm going to show you a different way to make the gelatin and you can do the same for the smaller jellies that I showed you previously if you don't have the machine so all you have to do is pour your unflavored gelatin and your flavored gelatin into a microwaveable dish or a bowl or one like this I like this one just because it has a pouring spout then taking a whisk just whisk it up together and then you're going to put this mixture into the microwave for between a minute and two minutes and what you're going to be looking for is a nice liquid consistent seikhs that's going to start to gel up again like it did previously and making sure that all the little crystals have just melted into the liquid so I'm going to do that now and then I will be back now that my mixture has mixed together completely I'm going to pour it into my gummy bear mold and then once I've got it all in my mold it's going to go into the freezer for the quickest solidification you can leave it on the counter that's just fine but putting it into the freezer will take about half an hour to 45 minutes so I'm gonna pop that in and then I'll be back to show you how to unmold your little ones which are probably going to be ready now once it's been about 15 minutes all you have to do to check to see whether or not your gummies are set it's just to give your mold a little wiggle and I can tell that they're nice and solid so to remove them from the silicone mold it's really quite easy you just can pick them up pop it out like that and then just pry away with your fingers like that so our final step is to remove the jumbo gummy bear from the mold so this is just like I did with the silicone molds so you're just going to pull back on the sides and then pull it out and it's as simple as that so I'll be right back to close the video so there you go everybody how to make a gummy candy using a gummy candy maker now what I liked about the gummy candy maker was the molds I thought they were really cute and I especially liked the Jumbo mold but what I found disappointing was that the maker didn't come with any gelatin and the length of time that heating up the gelatin using the machine than it comes with it just took a long time with what you can do in the microwave for 1/2 two minutes so that's my review of the gummy candy maker I hope you enjoyed the video remember to give it a thumbs up if you liked what you saw and if you'd like us to review a different product make sure you leave that in the comments I'd love to see what you guys are interested in buying so I will see you all again next time bye you"}
