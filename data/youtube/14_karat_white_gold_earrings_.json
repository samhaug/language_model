{"mWhfBAC6YkY": "what's going on everyone in spring which coach fine jewelry short personal jeweler in this video I want to compare 14 karat white gold verse 18 karat gold do a nice side-by-side and show you guys the difference I get a lot of questions on white gold so I think visually you want to kind of see the difference if there is a difference and with that being said a lot of questions come in about white gold so I'm gonna do my best to put those questions to rest with that being said let's get started now everyone has a different reason as to why they might go 14 karat gold over 10 karat gold 18 karat over 14 karat you guys get the point going up in purity the most common that I hear about and we should all know this the higher the gold purity the more gold that is in that piece of jewelry which equals the richer the gold color that is really directly applies with yellow gold with rose and white it gets a little bit different because white gold has rhodium over it so is it really worth to spend and go 18 karat on a heavier chain with more gold if you're going to get the same look as the 14 karat version with white gold and I want to show you guys the side-by-side and explain that and if we take a look at the side-by-sides between the 5 millimeter diamond-cut franco's the 5 millimeter 14 is on the left and the 5 millimeter 18 is on the right both from the same manufacturer both with the same rhodium process I try to get the variables as close as possible to show this review in person you definitely see the difference it parallels really to the yellow gold version the lighter or less purity that a train is like if you look at a 10 karat chain compared to a 14 karat gold chain the 10 karat chain is lighter in yellow color because there's less gold gold is yellow I get people all the time this is kind of a different talk for another video like hey if I buy a white gold chain is it going to be yellow my answer is hopefully over time it does kind of thing into yellow that means your chain Israel if it doesn't you need to get it tested because gold is yellow we don't mind white gold out of the ground it's all yellow so the more gold it is and tuned if you really look closely at an 18 karat white gold chain you kind of see that yellow starting to pierce through of course the road is a top layer over and it's nice it looks good but if you're going for that kind of disco ball that flashy look the 18 karat white gold is not really gonna do it as much it doesn't have a stronger white gold color it has more of a dull gray color compared to the last period of the 14 karat gold because it has more white alloys in there to really shine so it really depends on what you're looking for when you're going yellow it's like yeah you do want to go 18 karat yellow because it's more of a flex you get kind of a deeper richer gold color and you could really tell it's 18 karat gold but with the white gold not necessarily it's kind of opposite but it ain't the same at the same time now you might be thinking well why would I go 18 karat white gold a few reasons come out to me number one the most important for me when we're talking why do people go up in purity I simply like more gold around the neck for that speck oh that was a nice one but you guys get the point I think 18 karat gold you're gonna have it all show it on the scale here's a 14 same length on the scale the 14 karat version and then the 18 karat burn is sorry I'm still thinking about that bar just dropped the 18 karat do you guys see the difference there's more gold an 18 karat I hope we all know that by now by the end of this video so a lot of people just want more gold around their chain for that side they don't want to go up and with they'd rather just have that style chain but more gold more value around the neck I think that's great that's a very mature gold train thought right there also in my opinion I know a lot of people are weird about white gold because they think people think it looks like silver the white 18 karat doesn't look as like sterling silver ish it's more dull and has kind of its own unique look so you don't when I see sterling silver it's like bleached white like just silver I mean a lot of people say I can't really tell the difference between white and silver I can it's very like white looking so and that's kind of the same with a 14 karat or 10 karat white gold has that bright look to me you still see the difference between a 14-karat white gold chain and a sterling silver chain but it just looks less like that more dull just kind of has a little more of a masculine classy look if you ask me so those are the other difference mainly the gram weight difference between the 18 karat and teen carry all in all guys it is all preference on what you want to do I showed the side-by-sides I gave my little review now it is up to you to go to WWE comm and pick yourself up a chain and thank you guys for watching that's it for today's video and we will see you on our next julie video", "dHbWS5TluWs": "hi I'm Aaron Galligan and I'm the founder and designer behind MMR jewelry welcome to our FAQ videos the common alloys that we work with in the US are 22 karat 18 karat 14 karat and 10 karat the higher you go in karat like 22 karat the more pure gold you're going to have so it's going to be richer and more yellow in color it's going to have a lot more of those gold properties so it's more resistant to tarnishing it's more hypoallergenic it's also going to still be very soft so as you go down in the carats you're going to have a metal that is harder and more durable not more likely to tarnish and change color and less hypoallergenic so 18 karat is great for somebody that wants a more yellowy or richer color or possibly has a lot of allergies or skin sensitivity so they want something that's a little bit more hypoallergenic some people can only really wear high karat gold but with 18 karat it is going to be more soft so for a ring it's going to show a lot more wear than a lower karat gold so 14 karat gold is going to have more of that pure gold and the alloy than other metals it has enough other metals to make it harder so it's really great for everyday wear but because it has more of that pure gold it's still more resistant to tarnishing or changing color there is a reason that 14 karat gold is as popular as it is in the US it just got that happy medium between having enough of the pure gold in it to have those really great properties of pure gold but enough of other metals to increase that hardness and reduce the price of it so a 10 karat gold you now have more of those other metals in the alloy than the pure gold so it is going to be more likely to tarnish and change color and it's also going to be less hypoallergenic but 10 karat gold is great for somebody who's looking for a ring and they're really hard on their hands it's going to be the hardest of those alloys or if you're on a tight budget you might be able to get a 10 karat gold frame where you wouldn't be able to get 18 karat gold thanks for watching I hope you found this video helpful for more answers

tony tony with super jewelry co let's go oh yeah today bro you gonna learn today today i'ma spit some knowledge yes quick question for you brother what is the difference between 10k and 14k gold chains oh and one more thing brother which chain would you get 10k or 14k let's go go starting with the easiest cause i like it easy brother easy hey you already know you like it easy too don't you dare lie to me but hey if you do not like it easy hey i'm sorry my bad all right brother now the first difference that i'm going to be sharing with you is the amount of gold like pure 24 karat gold that is in 10k and 14k gold so if you don't know now you know brother 10k gold specifically 10k gold chains is made partly of 10 parts 24 karat gold or 41.7 percent of the whole 10k gold chain is pure 24k gold whereas the other 14 parts you know other metals like alloys nickel copper sometimes like depending on what type of gold like if you want yellow gold rose gold or white gold different other metals will be used to mix in with the pure gold and of course for 14k gold or gold chains that one is 14 parts pure 24 karat gold or percentage-wise 58.3 yeah boy i'm asian i know my math and what does that mean the other 10 parts is other metals but but but tony what does this really mean it's simple and easy brother don't even trip relax peace pee it just means that 14k gold chains have more pure gold in them compared to 10k gold and hey tony how does this play into the strength and durability of 10k and 14k gold chains or any real fine gold chains well i'm happy that jazz brother because that is the second difference that i'm gonna be sharing with you between 10k and 14k gold chains and uh if you don't mind i have a question for you brother which do you think is stronger 10k or 14k gold chains comment down below three two one let's go you already know brother i'm already feeling myself yes oh sorry bro oh so uh if you answer 10k gold chains as being the stronger between 10k and 14k you alright brother let's go whoa whoa chill bro chill i already know that you're excited but uh let's take it down a notch or two or a million all right but on the serious serious note which i really don't like going there but i have to you feel me the reason why 10k gold chains are a lot stronger and like it doesn't really scratch as much compared to 14k very durable the reason for that is because less 24 karat gold is used to make 10k gold remember that and also brother remember that pure 24 karat gold is very soft it's a precious metal but it's a very soft soft element so that's why you'll see a lot of scratch or scuff marks in 24 karat gold chains or jewelry and even 18k gold i know i'm not there yet but hey just wanted to give you guys a heads up but between 10 and 14 10 is gonna be more durable and stronger and just more resistant to scratches than 14k gold chains and if you didn't know now you know brother finger moving on to our third difference between 10k and 14k gold chains which one weighs more oh wait where my chains at all right brother so again if you weigh the same type of width and length chain for example these are the 4.5 millimeter 24 inch gold chains now which one is 10 which one is 14 let's get into this bro okay check this out this one right here on my right is 14k gold and the chains here on the left are 10k so bro let's just make it quick and simple and sweet again remember guys although 24 karat gold is a very soft precious metal keep in mind it's so dense it's so heavy like pounds per pound ounce per ounce gram for gram 24 karat gold or just pure gold and so given that 14k gold chains or 14k gold jewelry will always weigh more whether it's hollow or solid it's always gonna weigh more than 10k gold chains or jewelry oh and bro just want to let you know the same plated like if it's 14k gold plated like if you do 14k gold plated like 4.5 24 inch right if you do side by side trust me it's not even gonna come close to the weight this is still gonna be heavier than because you gotta remember go play this stuff or gold plate accessories yeah it may have the look of it however the base metal is either stainless steel or brass or even silver so that's why it's not really gonna weigh the same as a fine real 14k gold or even 10k gold uh chain it's just completely different metals but bro before i you know get too deep into all that stuff if you do want me to make a video on that i'd be more than honored to help you out with that but comment down below let me see if you really want it bro and here we are brother it's time to crown the winner which one is it gonna be 10k gold chains or 14k gold chains who's the winner are you ready and the winner is oh yes 14k gold chains say what what why why why tony why whoa whoa easy easy brother let me give you some more details on asked why i personally think 14k gold chains are the winner one there has to be a winner okay there has to be and look bro i'm very open if you don't agree with my decision as to why 14k gold chains are the better of the two please comment down below i want to know why here's my personal like real recommendation for you between 10k and 14k the reason why i highly recommend 14k if money is not an issue of course is that mentally emotionally i just feel better knowing that i have a lot more gold on me i know it's not that much more like 41.7 compared to 58.3 but at the same time i personally like knowing that it's like above 50 like pure 24k gold in there i don't care if it's hollow or solid just knowing that real gold there's a lot of it a lot more in there between 10k and 14k and trust me bro like these feelings like when you're emotionally mentally like good yo it's just gonna really like just gonna come out more you're gonna have a little pep to your step you know you're gonna feel good and that energy is just gonna come shooting out and i know that 10k gold is a lot stronger than 14k gold chains but not too much 14k gold chains they're still very strong still very durable you can wear them every day in terms of getting scratches you don't have to worry about that as much as 18 22 or 24 10 and 14 they're still very strong and still very durable so that's why even between the two between 10 and 14 if they're still like very strong and like scratch resistant of course i'm going to recommend the 14k cool to you but bro like i understand you know like especially during this time that we're in money can be an issue let's be real and if that's the case for you brother it's okay 10k gold chains are still real gold like there's 41.7 percent of pure 24 karat gold in this bro seriously this is real gold this ain't plated bro this is real you can always take pride in that and remember strictly from just a price standpoint 10k gold chains the the lure the the most like value you get from 10k gold chains that is real but it's the most affordable like out of 10 14 18 22 24 10 is the most affordable which is why there's still a lot of people that get it but again personally i recommend the 14. thank you thank you thank you so much brother for seriously connecting with me staying tuned this is my fourth

are going to be doing my top favorite jewelry pieces slash my most worn jewelry pieces that I love in this video I'm not gonna have any kind of like bracelets I have a few necklaces to show you but for the most part this is just gonna be rings and earrings if you guys know my vibe with what I go for you guys know I love gold hoops I wear all sorts of hoops I wear expensive jewelry to least expensive jewelry to really affordable stuff like it just really depends you're not someone that likes gold jewelry this is not the video for you I literally only wear gold with the exception of like two or three pieces that have silver in them but a lot of the times it's gold also gonna have everything linked down below for you guys in this video so it's really easy for you to shop if you click the description box I will also have discount codes for some of these brands not all of them but I will do my best to try to find discount codes for you guys and I'll list all that information for you guys down below so let's go ahead and get started alright so the first shop that I want to talk about is Maggiore this is where I get most of my gold jewelry their vibe is everything to me sizing works really well for me that's another thing with me is I have really tiny fingers and I either wear a size 5 or a size 3 depending if we're doing like the pinky ring I can you do a 2 or 3 but I'm mainly a 5 for the most part so I have really narrow little fingers the first piece I want to talk about is this beautiful or just pinky ring so they're considered their signet sig sig net signet ring Signet rings I don't know how to say it are basically they're little pinky rings I really like this one cuz it has a really cute little bee on it and I just I don't know I love the look of a cute little pinky ring and it just like adds another element of cool and like I feel like it's very chic the other ring I want to talk about is this is just their dome shape ring I'll have all the names listed down for you in the description box below but it is just a really cute ring really like this ring because it's so simple and sometimes you know I don't always wear all these rings on my finger on my fingers it's not anything crazy it's very like subdued but I really like it okay come on welcome so these ones I actually got in very recently and I love them so much they are this croissant styled earring I'm pretty sure it's what they called this is the large version and I love them think that these retail for maybe $80 but they are just stunning they are really great quality like when you hold them they don't feel light and cheap like some of money like fast fashion jewelry does which I do still have here but I just like to have some great quality pieces as well because I just feel like the style is stunning and I want them to last a really long time hey guys sorry I just realized while I wrapped up the video and now I'm doing close-ups of everything prior to mention this all cuff this little cuff is also from Missouri so I'll link this one down below I don't actually have this pierced you can literally just take it on and off but I love it I just think it looks kind of cool a little different just wanted to let you guys know about this cuff before I forget and all of you guys asked me because I'm wearing it into his videos so yeah can you tell everybody hello oh we're gonna go play outside oh okay okay changed I also wanted to show you another pair of earrings from them that I really like these are my small little dome shape huggies which they're not actually Huggies but I call them Huggies because so pretty as you can see they kind of look like my ring here these earrings just look so gorgeous on I feel like this is a great layering piece if you have more than one piercing I only have one hole on each ear but these are really great to start off with and then kind of go smaller as you go up if you have more than one hole that's just really pretty and just layered hoop earrings look really great I really love these ones sorry the lighting is getting very strange all of a sudden another ring I really like also that dome shape is very cute and I absolutely love the dome shape is this ring right here it's their large dome shape ring and I where this either on my pointer finger just really depends like I said have really thin fingers so I can't wear these on every finger they're smaller version so as you can see this one's the bigger one and this one's the thinner one which is also really cute and dainty but I love the thick one as well so that's it from a jury that I have and then on to these earrings that I really wanted to quickly talk about these ones are from Amazon I share them all the time on Instagram and I just love them they are so great they haven't tarnished on me yet these are the 30 millimeter of gold hoop earrings are $13.32 Abebe oh I literally found them on Instagram which is where I pretty much find like all these brands but my favorite ring from Argenta vivo that I wear all the time they get so many questions about it's this one I call this the eternity ring that I wear all the time but it's just so beautiful it has this gold trimming it kind of reminds me of like a crown it's got a little bit of like a jagged eNOS and it's just really cool it's like kind of on you know formed but it's so nice and it just fits my finger so well and honestly such a great ring I wear it all the time you guys have seen it a million times another ring from Argenta vivo is this one and it's another one of those signet style rings but this one is not a pinky ring obviously this one has a an A on it for Alya and a little rhinestone right there and I love this ring because it's just so cute on I love a little good rhinestone look another brand I really like is a brand called layered my mom actually turns me on to this brand they're like a very new company such beautiful things like literally if you go to their social media that's why I like wanted to get this that was because the way that it was modeled and the picture was just so beautiful and I was like oh my god this is so stunning they're one of those eternity rings a lot of people will wear these in place of their wedding bands and stuff but also just such a stunning so much shine to this it has that gold setting which I also really love anywhere I can get some gold I love it I will honestly wear out in the evenings or if I have an event to go to I will stack some of these rings I have part of like three of this exact ring just to kind of layer and I'll put two on one finger one here and one here it just really depends I will literally stack them but my favorite one right now to stack together is this green one because I feel like it's just so different and it's so beautiful this is a really great set to wear I love wearing this in the evening this is so stunning I've gotten so many compliments on this my only big pair of gold earrings are these ones and these ones are from Nasty Gal boo who also has the similar ones but these ones seem to sell out really quickly on Nasty Gal they are very affordable they actually come in like a set I think these two came together but I love the different option I obviously like these ones way more it's just way more wearable the size works for me and just my style but sometimes I want to wear a much bigger hoop and this is the one I will wear I don't really have big hoops this is probably as big as it'll go yet again this is a fast fashion brand so it's probably not gonna last you as long but it does give you that same vibe for a very affordable price and pretty sure these are like less than ten dollars but I love these very much and I wear them often so if you are wanting something very affordable or maybe you're an influencer that just wants to get that same kind of look but on a budget these are really great as well I found HL collection on Etsy years ago I think it was like in 2016 or 17 I found a child collection one piece that I've always worn I bought many of these and gifted them to people as gift because it's just one of those pieces that everybody can layer with the gold coin is definitely something I love a lot it's just so beautiful it has never tarnished I'm pretty sure this is the 16 inch length or 17 I'm not sure like I said check out the description box below but yeah just a really pretty look like just I love this with the swimsuits especially with summer coming up just glaring golds necklaces always look so beautiful and they're also pretty affordable another brand Miranda Frey is another really great one very affordable the only piece that I really have from her is this pinky ring I wear this one all the time actually gifted my friend the same piece as well so it's just this beautiful pinky ring I just like it I think it's very simple and it fits my finger really well it's probably the best pinkie ring because like I said I really thin fingers and this one really fits my finger well so I love this ring and it just like ties everything together you know what I mean like the pinky ring just does something a brand called ELISA ante oh my gosh love Alesi ante they are definitely a more on the expensive side but just beautiful beautiful beautiful stuff it's really really pretty hoops and they fit really well they're also really good quality these are 14k gold there are one of those pieces that I feel like you will have forever they're timeless so that's why I always like to go for a good hoop and I like different sizes ones just a really great one and the color is just it's just so beautiful also from Alesi on Tay I love this one the a their fonts that they use for their pieces are just stunning this like beautiful cursive ish calligraphy is just so beautiful obviously the a stands for my daughter's name Alya this one also just so pretty on just layered with all these other pieces it's just one of those things you know what I mean I call this their angel baby one but I don't know what it's really called but I think I put my own chain because the link that I bought was too short but this one's really really long I really like wearing longer necklaces during the hotter months because I'll show my trust more or like if I'm at the beach or laying out I love a good long gold necklace and it's so well made and the quality is just amazing I'll put the name of the brand right here but I just love this one as well it's just a different style of a hoop you know what I mean it just changes it up a little bit but also a very wearable earring to wear last one I want to talk about is the ring that I wear all the time these two rings this ring right here is this tiny little band right here it's from the brand called Aran fader they also look kind of like a wedding band ish style but it the only thing I don't like is that it doesn't go all the way around I wish it wrapped all the way around the little rhinestones so let me know if you guys have any brands that have good like wedding band tight be very similar to this that's in that go all the way around cuz I've been looking to find one that'll work really well with this because I love to layer it on top of my Cartier ring which this is a love ring I don't know if you guys can see it I've had this for years was passed down from my like great grandma because Cartier has been around for forever and this was one of their first ones and they've kind of changed the style and the look of them over the years now they're a little bit flatter and a little bit wider but this one is just a little different and this one's been around forever like it's literally passed out in generations through generations and I love it and so I wear all the time just because it's been in the family for a while and it's just one of my favorite things to wear so this one obviously I will link the cartier love ring down below but like I said never bought it though at some point in life I will give it to Alya but yeah I really love this ring it's really really really old like I probably should get it cleaned to be honest so yeah that's pretty much it for today's video I hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did give this video a thumbs up though now that you guys know my vibe and the style of jewelry I like leave me some brands down below that you think I should try out and if I end up expanding my collection I'll share more I'm sure a lot more on mr. Graham's so follow me there if you aren't already I hope all of you guys are keeping safe and keeping well during this time all my love to you and your families thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you guys in my next one bye", "E8MtruVE7-E": "[Music]", "XJ0WbgS_iQo": "did you know 24 karat gold is so soft you can bend it with your fingers my name is sarolta blessing and the goldsmith and designer for barrels jewelers all gold that comes from the earth is a really rich yellow color we then have to harden it to be strong enough to wear as jewelry 18 karat has got a 75 percent purity and 25 percent other alloys so if you wanted yellow gold then you you'll mix it with a bit of copper and a bit of brass and a bit of silver with white gold it is palladium that's added to create 75 percent purity we keep the metal separate so when you cost yellow you'll always use your yellow crucible when you cost white to always cost with your 18 karat white gold yellow will always leave a slight tinge in the metal and therefore all white gold jewellery will have a rhodium coating the properties are virtually the same the same malleability they've got the same hardeners they melt roughly at the same temperature [Music] just in the alleyway that's added to the white gold quite often the best alloy to use as palladium so when that's mixed together with the gold it does increase the melting they will be a difference in price due to the alloy of palladium that's added to the gold to make it white due to the fluctuating price of palladium that could have quite a big impact on the price of 18 karat white gold the copper or the brass that's added is quite low it doesn't really have much of an impact to the to the cost of 18 karat yellow gold I think lady M has always had an a higher value yellow gold all it needs is to be cleaned and polished every now and again that never gets any any plating or coatings added to it it's difficult to say how regularly you have to have your white gold radium plated we have people that want to have it done every six months which we don't really recommend we do also have a lot of people that actually quite like the warmer feel of a natural white gold [Music] so we have 18 karat white gold unpolished and 18 karat yellow gold unpublished I personally like the yellow and I have 22 karat yellow gold metal I just like the pure gold then their warmth of the cut so this is quite a popular width for a Jane's wedding band normally anything between 3 and 6 millimeters is probably our my son regularly sold with so that is just about four and a half millimeters wide once you've decided on yellow gold jewelry or white gold jewelry you will you will normally stick to that that color the only time that we would use a little bit of both is when they are diamonds or other precious stones involved in the design most commonly stones are mounted in a white gold setting with perhaps a yellow gold band you'll quite often see emeralds or rubies are accompanied with yellow gold if you are intrigued by the different alloys and the different metals please come and see me here and Barros and I will be very happy to get some raw materials out to show you what the exact difference in colors are please click the link below to come and speak to me [Music]", "66pRi5Za1UI": "thinking about these fashion earrings a new look for

bezel-set necklace has the effect of over 3 carats of diamonds our model is wearing three different lengths for a layered look and the cz studs they shimmer and shine like four carat diamonds designed in genuine 14 karat white gold so only you will know their faux", "i8GPM4iPD40": "what's going on everyone it's Britton with Dakota fine jewelry your personal jeweler in this video we're gonna talk about white gold and white rhodium mainly the rhodium now with rhodium 99.9% okay that might be a little too high but most jewelry especially here in America in the state if it's white gold it has the rhodium finish why because it shines it up and makes it nice and shiny and protects it it's like the shiny car in the showroom will sell manufacturers that manufacture chain the shiny the more yellow it is the higher percentage it's going to jump out in that showcase and sell so that is the trick now the rhodium what is rhodium it's not a bad thing it's actually a really expensive alloy it's in the same family as platinum and it's used again to make a piece nice and shiny and it also is hard and protects those pieces resistance from scratches so it's a very good thing and I want to show you guys a few pieces for example so you can look at it and I'll showcase my five and a half flat curb just to kind of see the wear and tear of a white gold rhodium piece over years because I also get questions about that with that being said let's get started there are a few white gold pieces that I have laid out first one being a finish to code to Jesus piece and it has diamonds in the crown because I deserve it and that it has the rhodium finish you can see how nice and shiny it is here's another this is a custom shield medallion that I made for my client bar we work together on this masterpiece now the interesting thing with this one is it's two separate has a yellow gold plate on top soldered on to a white gold plate so it's not like we did a rhodium finish on all yellow gold it actually is casted white gold you could see there in the back solid and then for the top of the yellow gold we just lasered his crest design and then you could see like the two-tone different laser colors there it's really cool let me get closer there and this smaller piece about I'd say half dollar size is 14 grams so it is made with integrity it is made well it's a jacoti piece so you guys know and just look how completely clean that is really awesome job thanks barb for letting me borrow this an extra day to put it on this video and then here is a a raw casting of a 14k white gold diamond flat ring this is for Michael he ordered it on the Black Friday sale so if you notice here it has a like a gunmetal color to it that is the natural color of 14k white gold before the rhodium polish and the rhodium plating I should say and then the polish so it really shines it up so here you have more of a natural organic color and then here's my five and a half black curb and I wanted to include this because people ask me all the time what's gonna happen to my white gold over time this is eight years old I wear it 24/7 365 days out of the year and as you can see it's still holding up nice if you look in between these links there's a slight yellow where that where that yellow gold is showing through the rhodium wears off and these are white gold casted pieces but over time with that friction that yellow gold might show through especially be high friction with like the link chains they rub together so all you really need is just a rhodium plating but again eight years and I'm still not even thinking about rhodium this chain because it looks good if I put my Jesus piece next to it it looks the same so that is the benefit of the rhodium plating is it's almost like an armor over your white gold it keeps it shiny it resists the scratches it's a very good thing to have as you can see the proof is actually in the pudding here because it's all nice stuff so there you guys have it we looked at the the raw cast of 14k white gold we looked at rhodium finish pieces as well as my flat curb so you can kind of see the differences you know if you didn't really know better you might be wary of buying a white gold piece with rhodium because you would think well you know six months down the road I'm just gonna have like a terrible looking chain with a yellow gold showing underneath that's not the case and from my experience when I look at rhodium pieces they hold up for a while just just that's why I want to show the five and a half black herd that I have because I don't want to just tell you guys I want to show you and the best is from experience and that chain is old and it's been through everything and it still looks really good the rhodium is on there it shines it's very nice so if that's a good option a good route to have it's not a bad thing to have rhodium like I said it's really expensive and it's very useful as well when it comes to white gold jewelry they use it for silver if it for higher-end silver pieces you'll use rhodium so it's everywhere do some more research if you have more questions but again it's a safe thing to have and it really does make a difference on a piece of white gold jewelry that's it for today's video and we will see you on our next jewelry video", "KpXq12KZFt4": "hi friends welcome back to my channel so ero

"MzB9HdFbe38": "so today's video is review of my Costco diamond jewelry I have three pieces to share with you today the first being my engagement ring which I actually did a video on that prior and as well as two pairs of earrings both of those earrings are wedding gifts for my husband on our wedding day and I actually wore one of those earrings for my wedding day fucking-a photographed really well and I highly recommend that piece every diamond PC buy from Costco includes an article of description the clarity of Costco diamonds are always be s2 or greater and the color it's always I or greater so at least you're going to get that standard of quality from Costco so here we have a 14-karat white gold and diamond cluster earrings each earring set was one round brilliant cut diamond weighing approximately 0.14 it's surrounded by six smaller round brilliant cut diamonds the total diamond weight of the earrings is 1.25 carats so I'm currently wearing the larger earrings right here so these earrings retail for 1800 which is not too bad considering that you'd get a total carat count of 1.25 carats next we have the 14-karat white gold and diamond floral earring each earring set with 11 round brilliant cut diamonds the total diamond weight of the earrings is 0.45 carats or greater so I actually wear these earrings on a daily basis because they're nice and small and I don't feel them and I also like the fact that they are kind of flat so they don't stick out on your ear so when you're sleeping at night you don't have like this big diamond stud kind of poking into you so I really like that about these earrings these earrings retail for 650 and purchase them in store I'm not sure if we still have them online I'll try to find them online but yeah definitely check out your local Costco if you're interested it got these somewhat recently within the past year or so so they may still have it next we have 14-karat white gold and diamond ring the ring is set with two round brilliant cut diamonds each weighing approximately 0.48 carats and 54 smaller round brilliant cut diamond the total diamond weight is 1.5 carats or greater so this ring retails for $3,400 and you can reference my previous video on this ring as well if you want more information on that but my husband actually picked it up from me in Portland Oregon where they don't have sales tax so he was able to save even more so this is actually my second wedding ring my first wedding rings are actually a Tiffany ring which I also have a video on that as well if you're interested so here's a size comparison between these two now your Costco earring or ring purchase will come in one of these boxes so this is the protective outer layer and inside as your standard mahogany Brown tone wooden jewelry box so I actually have three of these boxes because both my ring animal pairs of earrings in one of these boxes and yeah it looks just like this and of course also and not yellow box would be the article of description as I showed you previously now that Costco jewelry boxes differ quite a bit in comparison to the Tiffany jewelry box as you can see the Tiffany one it's a nice suede material it's much smaller in fact and the hinge is a lot smoother right here so yeah all the others the Tiffany box is much more compact and easy to hold there's no jagged edges as of recently the past year Tiffany has rebranded their jewelry boxes to become this iconic Tiffany blue color and right now we just have a push closure that will open up your box like such and here's the Costco box in comparison honestly I think the packaging is kind of cheap for Costco I know it's Costco and you are trying to save a buck however I mean this situation is just not that classy if you're trying to give someone a gift because my box is already broken right here as you can see and yeah it's very cheaply made and this box if you look on the bottom and occu says Made in China not surprisingly so yeah I would say got in one drawback to purchasing jewelry from Costco and that the presentation is not the greatest", "7KBHX4s9VDg": "welcome to certified jewelry Justin from our consignor is this pair of top gems

And here we're talking karat with a K, and karat\nwith a K is how many parts out of 24 karat. Pure gold is 24 karat gold, and\nwhile it sounds like it would be wonderful to have a pure gold piece of\njewelry, the fact is you could scratch it with\nyour fingernail. You could just take a ring and bend it. It's very soft and\nmalleable. And so we alloy it with other metals meaning we we melt it and mix it\nwith other metals to make it stronger. So when you hear karat that's how many\nparts out of 24 karats. So 18 karat is 18 parts gold out of 24 karats. The other\nsix is another metal or combination of metals. 14 karat is 14 parts out of 24. 14\nparts gold out of 24. And similarly 12 and 10 karat are the same. They're 12\nkarats out of 24 and 10 karats out of 24. So 10 karat gold is actually more other\nmetals than it is gold. It is 10 parts gold and 14 parts other metals. So that\nis karats. Always when you hear karats with a k, think \"out of 24\". Now sometimes\nyou'll see 18 karat gold marked 750, and that's because the Europeans do it\ndifferently. They'll say 750 parts gold out of a thousand, and that's how they\nmark it. You might see a piece that's marked both. It could be 18 karat and 750,\nor it may just say 18k, or it may just say 750. And similarly 14 karat gold will\nbe marked 585 sometimes because it is 585 parts out of a thousand. So there you\ngo. That is the difference between 14 karat and 18 karat gold.

talking about Italian gold hoop earrings in your choice of sizes in your choice of styles in your choice of gold and this is Dino Lenovo he comes to Milano yes accepted from an analyst and now I pay Stacy yeah because is my English teacher oh she is yes cherub cherub yes you got it okay you've got but I like kettle better he's wrong you can say cherub but it it is it is he was presenting a cherub before and he says he said it with the Italian flair let me share with you what we're looking at right now so we have your choice of the high polished hoop the twisted hoop or the diamond cut hoop in your choice of sizes so we have it for you in a one inch as we go over here in yellow or white one inch one and a half inch or two inch so in each one of these sizes you can pick which kind of finish you want that's the overall story here here's the yellow just showing you this in the one inch your choice of high polish that's and you can get in any one of the three sizes the twisted in any one of the three sizes or the diamond cut in any one of the three sizes so maybe you choose your metal first you say I want yellow gold Rachel that's fine then tell us what your finish is high polish twist or diamond cut and then tell us what size that's how easy it is so the one inch just to let you know is gonna be six easy payments of 20 to 32 and then one and a half inch is six easy payments of thirty five forty nine and then when when you go to the two inch it's six easy payments of forty six 65 that's how easy it is but tell us why did you want to make a hoop in three different sizes and then three different kind of textures as well because hoop earring is a must-have in every jewelry box I think so we try to do to do something new and evolution on the classic appearance we have a classy very polished but then we try to catch the lights in the new way with diamond cutter hoop earrings with a twisted hoop earrings the diamond cut is right up my alley anything that has more Sparkle keep going the secret of the jewels is how they catch the light yeah yeah so and reflect the lights yeah and you know honestly so which one would be the most reflective yeah the most reflective is the diamond if you want to go out with Luke you can choose the diamond cut hoop earrings right so the diamond cut is gonna be the most reflective because it's got more surface area yes yeah so you've got all these different you know this all this different type of surface area for the light to bounce off of and that diamond cutting allows it to be really really sparkly now why why would I choose maybe a twist twist as it's an organic shape so create a create a movement on the earring but it's a different movement respect in is you know it's it's it's a kind of continuous you know twist or a spiral if you will yeah there is a fluidity to it it feels like it's moving because it's twisted and then we also have your high polish why high polish this is my step polish is the simple and elegant it's good for everyday also each one of these readings are and with the tubing process are made with a tubing process so inside are a low so it's are very comfortable in the air yeah they're very lightweight I can share with you that the one inches across the board are very very popular so again you're gonna choose and I put actually the diamond cut in my ear because I love sparkles so the diamond cut I also love they're very lightweight as you said so it's tubing so that what's nice is that it is that tubing so it's not heavy it's not pulling my lobe down I like the fact that it is a snap bar closed so that it they sit well you know if you've ever had a pair of earrings where there's not enough room for your earlobe really and you're kind of going this doesn't really work they sit well on your ears and so that's the one inch we have one and a half inch and two inches as well I feel like if you've never tried a to a jeering go for it you know seriously because a two inch earring is really really fun you know when we talk about sizes who wears to which earrings in Italy my friend the common size now yeah cuz change every year the trend changes now isn't trend the smaller smaller okay yeah but maybe next year it would be the larger section so yeah fashion is in continuous Changeling yeah always always change it you're looking at just synth and just simply has the two inch on and she's got the two inch I think of the she's got I think they're the twists they look like they're the twist to me and they're really really gorgeous and you can see them you know from afar I feel like there's always extra drama and I was right the twist so you are looking at the twisted you know detail there look how pretty that is that sculptural nature of that twist is really pretty it catches the eye it draws the eye it continues to to to intrigue for sure we're looking at any pair of these earrings under two hundred and eighty dollars so the one-inch will always regardless of what you know you do you side the high-polish the twist or the diamond-cut $22.32 like that's for gold for 14 karat gold and your choice of yellow or white period get a pair of home like at this price cuz it's only 1:30 392 this is a steal this and they're made in Italy these aren't made around the corner at Bob's shop around the corner where who makes these it's difficult to make these earrings because this we have to do to make strong the hearing for mixed around the earrings we bake in the particular temperature yeah when finished to two toward the heels to get more strong you may have an example when you show this because maybe if I show is better than there then pretty if I told Commission okay I want to show this yeah okay it's wrong yeah you can move this it's not flabby right when you work on it is flabby but yeah this is strong so when you don't like it's yeah it gives you confidence okay yeah it's know if it if it was flabby when you want to close the hearings yeah this move right it's difficult to close yeah you're getting stuck stop here yeah so you put like this yeah and you and that's had to go and then you and you can hear actually a little snap when you know when it closes you can hear a little snap which is what you know it's just angled perfectly and you'll hear it go click and then you know it's nice and secure and that's how you open it so this is the diamond-cut one and just I mean wow look at the diamond cutting on here it's crazy and again you're seeing those kind of like making of light and the way that it flickers because of the diamond cutting cuz it gives you more surface area for the light to dance and to bounce off of so it just is like rolling across that that's the diamond-cut one and then the twisted one comparison the twisted one is just quieter but it's like that bread twist that you might get at the bread shop where someone gives you a twisted roll or you go to the donut shop and they give you a twisted roll it is twisted so that's what you're seeing and you know the high polish but then twist it and then finally you know for everybody here is the high polish this is your high polish you know exquisite always have it in your purse always have this pair of your handbags because I always have a pair of earrings in my handbag right now because if I forget I forgot to put any on who knows I'm caught somewhere I need a different pair always a different pair of jeans I'm doing a simple and elegant always do you prefer I understand that you prefer to diamond cut I always cut sparkle and shine yeah do you know there is many kind of diamond cut but the first ever is the disco ball diamond cut oh that makes sense yeah that's why I love it so you've got your choice of finishes being at the solid high polish the twisted or the diamond cut and then as we keep on going this way in either the yellow 14 karat yellow gold or the 14 karat white gold and then in choice of sizes the one inch the one and a half inch or the two inch we have all of these sizes in all of these finishes available so to think about it really easily what size you want do you want a one inch one and a half two inch what metal do you want do you want yellow gold or white gold and then what size do you want do you want it to be two inches one and a half inches or one inch just let us know and tell us that you want to put this on six months of easy pay and we gotcha and we'll send it to the house Deedle in Iowa if there was a pleasure standing behind you thank you so much thank you here is my pick of the show so we love", "jtGDH9a1yUY": "what is going on everybody this morning I got an email from one of my clients discussing a custom piece that they wanted to make and they basically had a bunch of questions regarding 10-carat verse 14 karat gold and in this video I get these questions a lot so in this video I want to address basically my opinion on whether going with 14 karat 10-karat and just talking about both of them all my information will be down below visit my website feel free to contact me if you have any questions and let's get talking about gold now 24 karat is pure gold for 14 karat gold it's 14 parts pure gold 10 parts mixed alloys they do that for price and just everyday wear abdullah we they add always to make that jewelry stronger too for everyday wear now that percentage comes down to 58.5% the four 10 karat it's opposite it's only ten parts pure gold 14 parts mixed alloys that percentage is 41.7% pure gold it's hard for me personally to label something gold when less than half of it is actually gold in itself the minimum in America is 10 karat so anything below 10 karat is not going to be labeled as gold in other countries it dips even lower than that so that's just something to know durability wise 10 karat is more durable as far as scratches if you look at your piece and you have some scratches there I mean that's just happens you know for the everyday where it happens gold is soft it's going to scratch now 10 karat that will not scratch is easy because obviously there's more alloys in it but there's a flip side to that is the the allergic reactions to those to that high amount of alloys mixed in there so some people do get skin irritation rashes to that to those alloys so that's something to look out for as well if you know you don't have that if you worn 10 karat you're fine that's okay but if you don't I would just play safe and go a 14-karat gold because it has more gold less chance to get a logic reaction to those alloys now I think 10 karat gold is more of a price point thing for people but to me it's there's not a huge difference for instance today gold is at $24.95 per gram for 14 karat gold for 10 karat gold it's at 17 dollars and 82 cents per gram the difference there is 7 dollars and 13 cents so it's not a huge difference I think people want when they you know say a 14 karat gold chain is $1000 they think a 10 karat gold is gonna be like 400 but it's not the case it's not that much per gram so I personally think yellow gold looks better I believe that yellow gold has better materials diamonds gemstones typically used in 14 karat gold and it's manufactured a little better than 10 karat gold would be when I look at 10 karat gold pieces they have the worst clarity of diamonds the worst you know grade of gemstones so I think price point it's worth it to save up and buy invest in the 14 karat gold save the extra 100 to $500 you know depending on how many grams you're going to buy and buy the 14-karat gold I do think that you know the durability issue between the 14 and 10 isn't as great as you know people would say I think you should always repolished or rear odium your pieces every one to two years and get them looking like new but with 10 karat gold there are issues with possibly tarnishing or getting dull or the wear on it over time because of the gold content is pretty low so 14k gold will hold up a little longer you could still have those issues with 14 karat gold but more times than not you won't so the durability is a big key for 10 karat gold other than that I don't see a whole lot other pros I could think of as to why I would recommend you going with 10 karat gold I think spending the extra couple hundred dollars to invest in the 14 karat gold it's going to be your best bet as far as value everything goes I recommend 14-karat gold I personally don't sell ten karat gold chains I can manufacture ten karat gold I don't though I've made I did one project where I did five ten karat gold pieces for somebody but ever since then you know I just do stick with 14 karat gold but yeah that's my recommendation is always go with the 14 karat gold 10 karat you might save a little but over time you know you're gonna have more problems with 10 karat gold down the road and for for gold Julie finds really the whole purpose of it is to wear it and possibly hand it down to kids loved ones and generation after generation that's what I feel gold and fine jewellery represents so go with the better quality always and that's pretty much it if you have any questions comments leave them down

earrings me as my thoughts on them now this right here is besides six millimeter and just to let everyone know if you are purchasing them for yourself as a dolt are for another adult or even a teenager I highly highly do recommend that you at least get six millimeter or up even five might might be okay but the reason I say that is because if you get four millimeter you might be very upset just because they are very small unless of course you know you know what size the four is and that's really what you're going for but if you want a advertise earrings out the definitely Bailey's get six or seven millimeter but with that says they're very very pretty and the gold is very light in color they're not really really dark my experience with gold jewelry this real I'm at 14 karat are 10 karat or whatever I've always noticed that the gold is usually a little bit lighter than something to say 24 karat gold I do have a necklace is 24 karat gold and it's a lot darker and golds and these are and that's just my experience with gold jewelry itself but they're very very lightweight very comfortable and keep in mind is the ball of the studs here the ball itself is hollow it is not just completely solid I mean it is gold but the ball itself is hollow it's not just filled with gold on the inside as they worked out look gold on the inside they will actually probably be a lot more a lot more in price and a lot more heavier but considering the ball is hollow they're very lightweight I actually did forget that I was wearing them when I had them on and I even slept in them I showered in them and I did not find a gold itself to chip off or peel or anything like that or discolor so very very nice and pretty and I do have some other ones to compare them to they actually look identical to to them how to actually try not to get them mixed up so this is another one from a different brand they're both six millimeters but as you see they look pretty much exactly the same even the Pope's I didn't notice the post from the other brand is a tad bit smaller let's see then this right here I'm not sure if you guys can tell or not sorry but one does not want to stay up but anyways um one of the backs here it's actually a little bit smaller the one the back from the other company is a little bit small in the back from here but again they're still very discreet very little and tiny um and keep in mind that whenever you are putting them on you do have to secure them I did read some reviews from other customers on here on the reviews that pretty much data it you know that they lost the earrings or the backs not staying on and they fill out just keep in mind that you do have to hear it click and you do have to secure the earrings um and I'll show you guys how to do that here in a second sorry my throat is dry but I guess that you do have to make sure that you hear a click you have to make sure that they are secure and they are in place but like I said I have showered in them I have slept in them and I didn't not have him get moved at all whatsoever and I have very very curly hair so when I shower my hair tends to get rattled in my earrings no matter what earrings am wearing it always does that and sometimes it pulls that my earring and my earrings and sometimes I have found not these airings in particular that I did have found other earrings in the past that uh you know pretty much would get uh I guess make my earrings loose so keep in mind it you know when you're washing your hair if you're drying your hair off if you get your hair rabbit around your earrings just please keep in mind to make sure that they are secure they don't get loose because I'm that can happen that you might lose them and like I said you do have to make sure that that bag is secure and it is clicked in place so I'm going to show you guys on what they look like on and how to secure it alright guys I'm so I do to get the back here stable here on my hand but as you see the one the back to the right here on the camera that back is from the one here from the company for the listing that you're looking at and the back to the left that one as you see the one is a little bit smaller it's from the other company but nothing lasts like is that they're both still very small and very comfortable alright guys sorry about that now I'm just going to show you guys that pretty much you know whenever you do have the earrings I'm not sure if you can tell or not but it does have like the little ridges there I have got one or two and you put the backs on you know you can put them you know rellis well it's up to your earlobe you know if you don't need a little bit tighter a little bit more loose but since our mobility and the I can't say the postal with it shorter than most earrings at half but I'll talk about that here in a second but when you put it on you do have to like hear a little click and you can't hear it as you see the backs are pretty much to the end as you see they're pretty much on to the end right here and pretty much that's where one of the ridges is here on the post itself and it kind of just locks it in place so make sure that they are like that and they are secure okay and lastly before I go and I show you guys what they look like on for the six millimeter I just wanted and like I just mentioned while ago when I was showing you guys how to make sure that it is cure I might want to talk about the post really quick and it looks particles in your ear I will be completely honest it is a little bit kind of short it also depends also on the size of your earlobe so if you have a really thick earlobe you might not be the earrings for you but I mean I'll show you guys my earlobe here in a second and I'll show you earrings in my ears in my ear but I'm a dolt and I'm gonna adult and you know they fit my ear little pretty well they do not feel too tight not too uncomfortable at all whatsoever with that said I think they're really great for children consider the post a little bit more short compared to standard size earrings I'm are you know then the earrings were to say buy one more bright and collectibles these are bright and collectibles if you know the brand but um I would say most of my I had a few different earrings that I looked at the post and pretty much all the posts were longer than these but I can say from the other company as well if you look at them the post is pretty much exactly the same pretty much exactly the same you know it's not short or not longer a pretty much identical exactly the same with that said I notice with most real fine jewelry the posts are usually always shorter than say jewelry that you know sterling slow bars it's not realize that you can just get you know out on the streets kind of really cheap that's my experience I don't know what everyone else's experiences but like I said with my experience you know the posts on real jewelry that fine jewelry it's usually always shorter but like I said even though it is a little bit shorter I did still find them very comfortable that makes a really great for a child or adult and like I showed you guys how the back was on the earrings themselves I didn't have to put it all the way at the back but they did not leave infants in my ears they did not feel uncomfortable or too tight or anything whatsoever and again like I said with the other brand it's really great as well pretty much identical for this brand I mean the back pretty much like I said the post is pretty much the same length so let me show you guys something to click on okay guys sorry for keep stopping it but there you have it this is like a six millimeter and as you see I mean I consider my ellipse not your lobe more Melora whatever you consider normal is um it's not too thick not too thin I mean I have a ear lobe of an adult so as you see they're not too big not too little it's actually really that honestly the perfect size um I mean like I said before what I went I thought would have went for they would have been too tiny and this is actually the size of the military size if you are in the military the biggest you can go is six millimeter so if you are in the military and looking to purchase some earrings that are sweet and simple cute I would definitely say go ahead and get this six do not get 5 or 4 you might be disappointed but like I said this is a six and the size is pretty good here is the back as you see as I mentioned the post the back of stuff goes all the way to the back of post but like I said it's not too tight at all whatsoever very very comfortable and I'm not sure if I mentioned but this is the little box that it came in very nice for packaging if you do receive your earrings and like I said they are hollow so if you do receive them when they are damaged caved-in anything like that be sure that you do come to contact the company or Amazon just because they should not be like that I mean I have not had any issues with mine like that but if you do receive them they are like that be sure that you do contact the company itself or Amazon but they do come in the little red box to protect them so please let me ask you any questions thank you", "qT9g30oBrac": "welcome to certified jewelry up for auction today is a very unique pair of fancy canary yellow diamond stud earrings the diamonds total 1.4 hate carrots and the

need to do okay all right come on over here looks like some paperwork you", "_ZsXUwTQDmA": "hey everybody at silver seeker and today we are talking about gold we are actually talking about the difference in value and purity of all the primary carats of gold some 10 14 and 18 and what I mean by that guys as in gold jewelry generally it's going to be either 10 14 or 18 karat now also in this video we're gonna teach you how to calculate the value of each one of these as well as figure out the value for any carrot of gold whether it's 22 or 8 or any of the other carats out there all the way down to even 1 and additionally after this video is over you're gonna know exactly how to tell how much the goal than anything is worth as long as you know exactly what the carat is it's actually pretty darn simple so let's get into it and guys really quickly before we get started I do want to say if you like this video and you want to see more like this make sure you subscribe so you don't miss out in the future okay so in front of us guys we have 10 14 and 18 karat gold this is a gold and these are gold wedding bands right here and this is a pair of 18 karat gold earrings so to figure out what exactly the carrot of gold value is is actually pretty darn simple because all you have to actually know is that 24 karat is pure gold and I think most people that know anything about gold know that 24 karat is pure that's as pure as it gets and because of that it's actually really simple to find out the value of any other carat of gold so what we did is we actually got the calculator here and we're gonna show you very very simply so if we know that 24 karat is pure we can use one to represent a whole or in other words a 24 karat piece now if we divide this number by 24 you will see that each karat is point zero four one six six six six six percent pure or in other words point zero four one seven percent pure so now that we know that we can say okay well I have a 10 carat ring so this number times 10 there is the purity of 10 karat gold 0.41 7 do you see what I'm saying very very simple or we can take this number we'll take 1 divided by 24 again and then we can multiply it by 14 for 14-karat and now we know that 14-karat is 0.58 3% P R or in other words 50 8.33% peer and we can do the same for 18 karat and actually 18 karats pretty simple math but if you take one divided by 24 and then multiply it by 18 you can see that 18 carat is 75% pure which makes sense if you were to say you know divide 24 into four parts 18 carat would be three of those parts so you get the idea is 75% so knowing that you can actually calculate how much gold is in anything so if we take 1 divided by 24 let's say we have an 8 carat ring so we'll multiply that number by 8 we know that 8 carat is 33.33% pure now knowing that math makes it very very simple to find out the value of gold so all we have to do now is get a scale so we're gonna get our scale out we're going to turn it on so we're gonna go ahead and start with this 10 carat gold ring right here this is actually my own wedding ring and it is 10 karat gold and the reason I have a 10 carat gold wedding ring is because you know I work with my hands sometimes and I wanted something strong and since 10 carat gold there's only 41.7% pure as we now know it must be filled with other metals that are much more strong than gold is so it can resist a little bit more damage a little bit more wear and tear so knowing the math that we have we're gonna go ahead and put this on the scale and we can see that this ring weighs 0.26 ounces Troy so we'll go ahead and clear out our calculator and now let's do the math and figure out what the value of this ring is so today gold is sitting at 17 hundred and thirty dollars an ounce now ten karat gold is 41 point seven percent pure so we just take 17 30 and we multiply it by 0.4 one seven and that tells us that 10 karat gold is worth seven hundred and twenty one dollars and forty-one cents per troy ounce now we can simply multiply that by 0.26 because we have 0.26 ounces and as you can see our ring is worth one hundred and eighty-seven dollars and 57 cents now you might be curious how that relates in grams since jewelry as we know is generally winning grams and so I'm gonna show you that the math is actually the same it just takes an extra step so we'll go ahead and switch our scale mode to grams and as you can see the ring weighs 8.1 so to get this number it's actually just as easy you just need one extra step we know that a gram there it takes 30 1.1 grams to get one ounce a troy so all we have to do is take r1 and then we're gonna divide it by 24 and then we're gonna multiply that by 10 for 10 karat now we're gonna multiply that by spot so 1700 and 30 and we get to our 720 dollars and eighty three cents now we just divide that number by 31 point one and now we know that 10 karat gold melts for twenty three dollars and almost 18 cents per gram now we just multiply that by eight point one and as you can see again we have one hundred and eighty-seven dollars and this time 74 cents it's slightly more precise because it's weight on grams instead of ounces troy and other than that it's the same it's within cents of the other way of doing it so this math can be applied to anything so without getting into the ten and fourteen carat ring here let's go ahead we'll get our scale back on because it's shut off for being timeout let's imagine that this ring is 14 karat gold well the math can be applied the same way so we're gonna take 1 divided by 24 we're going to multiply that by 14 now we're gonna multiply that by spot so 1700 and 30 and now we know that 14-karat gold melts for one thousand and nine dollars and seventeen cents now we just divide that by 31 point one and then we multiply that by what it weighs in grams eight point one and as you can see two hundred and sixty two dollars and eighty three cents so in 10 carat this ring is worth one hundred and eighty-seven dollars and fourteen carat it's worth two hundred and sixty two dollars because 14-karat obviously is more pure so the beauty of doing the math is that it can be applied to literally any care to gold so knowing simply that 24 karat gold is pure and if you divide one by 24 and then multiply it by the carat you get the exact percentage purity of gold you can literally use this math for anything in fact let's do one more example will say that our ring is now eight carat so and United States something you may or may not know in the United States for something to be marketed as gold jewelry it has to be at least 40 percent pure so 10 karat is the minimum basically for us gold marketed as jewelry 9 karat goes below 40 percent so 10 karat is basically the number it has to be in the United States for it to be marketed as gold jewelry but let's say we have a European 8 karat gold ring those things do exist so let's go ahead and do the math again so we're going to it's very simple we're gonna take 1 divided by 24 BAM point four one six times eight multiply that by spot seventeen hundred and thirty now we're gonna take that number divided by thirty one point one we're gonna multiply that number by eight point one very quickly we know at eight carat this is 150 dollars and nineteen cents worth of gold so as you can see it can be applied to any gold ring if you know the carat you can easily figure out what the value is with very very simple math so 10 carat 14-karat 18-karat eight carat 22 carat 24 carat it doesn't really matter this method right here makes it very very simple to figure out the value of any carrot of gold so guys that is what I had for you today and as the scale just said it's set by and I will say buy as well but I do want to say thank you very much for watching the video and we hope to see you next time thank you so much for watching the video guys I just want to quickly give a huge shout out to my awesome

between platinum and white gold my name is sarolta Percy I'm a goldsmith he had barrels jewelers I have been working for the company for the last 16 years and I get to deal with all the respect designs and remodelings for the company and customers Platinum is a natural silver colored metal and will never change color where 18 karat white gold actually originates being a really rich yellow color we have to then add alloys to the yellow gold to be able to make it white platinum is actually 33% denser and heavier than white gold due to that reason due to the difference in densities platinum wears slower than 18 karat white gold I've got two pieces of metal here one is 18 karat white gold and the other one is platinum and when I hold it in my hand even they they are cut exactly the same size and length I can feel the difference between the two metals the platinum and my right is definitely lot heavier if you are making a pair of earrings we always advise that you go with white gold as it'll be lighter when you wear it in your ears rather than a heavy platinum earring if you weigh ring for example it is actually quite nice to have a little bit of an extra white in the ring because it feel you can feel the difference in the quality of the metals Platinum is 30 times more rare and less mind than gold so that's the first main reason for the price difference there's also a difference in the cost of manufacturing platinum due to the higher melting points of it will occur more manufacturing costs and therefore it's another reason of the higher price all white gold jewelry gets the coating on rhodium this coating is electroplated and they fall wears off over the years so if you go to our website and you look at all our white gold and platinum jewelry you will not be able to see the difference between platinum and white gold they look exactly the same due to the fact that white gold is rhodium plated so I hope this brief explanation between the difference between eighteen carat white gold and platinum has answered some of your questions about the two metals we will have some more videos that explain in more detail what the actual differences are between the different metals if you have any more questions you very welcome to book an appointment or email us at the address on the screen [Music]", "fFIA5nt6KGc": "diamonds all right the it's no secret these are some of our favorites it seems that a lot of people want to start here in the diamond couture collection this is that million-dollar look this is that princess feel this is that true highest of high straight out of the pages of a magazine look that is available and affordable for a hundred and fifty nine dollars if you use your HSN credit card I mean even less over the 12 months you can choose today to own solid 14 karat gold in the yellow or in the white if you can I would buy this in a heartbeat I would hasten to say that most people who are shopping in this hour we'll buy this collection so you have your earrings and we have it i just want to share with you right out of the gate dependent because the pendant which comes to the 18 inch necklace is that same price so if we were to look anywhere seamer from the biggest name stores boutiques galleries in the world we would see this type of design but we wouldn't see the lock does she have sheer magnificence of the size of these diamonds anywhere near this price you will not find this I can guarantee that personally and I say it over and over take it to your jeweler when you buy it take it to the person you trust the most I do have a jeweler also that I trust the most so you take it to them and you tell them what you paid for this and I want to hear back from you what they told you so this is over here is half a charachter where you have a look of a two-character I'm talking about the earring right now the earrings are a double halo look at the beauty about this now I'm gonna tell you many things about this you will never ever lose my earrings look at the pushback it's called French push back their special pushbacks that they hold the earring so tight so secure that you will never ever lose a pair of earring again because I lose earrings all the time and that word worries me so I design around what I love and what worries me and what I need to do to the piece for everybody else you also have to look at the devil halo that i'm talking about that it's in fashion right now everyone talks about halo now if you're wondering what we talked number when we say halo we're talking about a solitaire in the middle right with a circle around it that that circle is also with diamonds that's what halo is this is a double halo this has a show later in the middle with two rows of diamond going around you have hundred and fifteen diamonds your ladies hundred and fifteen diamonds handset under a microscope now I'm going to tell you a little bit about this patented technology that we're doing so we're taking all of these diamonds and four prongs holds these diamonds together there is no air there is nothing going in between those diamonds and magically these diamonds are being held together and giving you the look of a two character or three character that's what this collection is about so can I just reiterate what you just said how many diamonds did you say 116 on the earrings folks in these earrings there are 116 stones why don't I see them why don't I see all of those times why do I just see one beautiful big bold solitaire in the center well it's because of the setting that Cena said this is revolutionary people have never seen anything like this plot I never seen anything like until December this is an invisible setting so there's no space as no gap there's no air there's nothing in between single cut and full cut diamonds together that create an absolute spectacle these earrings yes they do look so much more than the half carat that they are because of that and it's no I mean I know see what mom is saying but the response has been through the roof but there's a lot of intrigue docena people want to see them themselves with their own eyes yes and that's why the reviews have been through the roof because you see it on TV and it looks incredible but when you see it yourself that's when you're really fall when you open that box when you look at that diamond earrings or pendant I want you to write to me I want you to tell me how you felt you feel a twinkle in your heart that's what you're gonna feel you feel that brightness the shine is coming out of that box the the patented is about my darling we just sold out the yellow gold so yellow gold has officially gone folks I now have the solid 14 karat white gold in the earrings and the pendant we will spend a few moments on the pendant of course you can buy them together or just x by itself I just want to reiterate that VIP financing if you have your HSN credit card $66 65 cents that's all you will pay today $66 and 65 cents if you apply to your HSN credit card right now you can also take twenty dollars off any single item purchase see me you were mid flow please I'm sorry continue that's okay so I want you to also i want to keep talking about the patented the idea of the Diamonds together I have here two large diamonds for us actually they're not diamonds but we made them look like a show absolutely and you can talk about them and you can explain as I as I explained you you can he gonna model it from you I will do my best for you seen him so look at that one of the stones is a full cart and one of the stones is a single card so you will bring in these two stones together in this patented technology and that's why the brilliancy comes like a fire you have 58 facets on the folk art you have maintained facets on the single card and once these two merge and come and get married that's the outlook that's the look of you you get that large look that no one no one until they take microscope can tell that this is many stones creating the cluster for us so you know naked I can tell this right right this is magic and a lot of you called me magician after you saw this yes I read I read every review i want you to know i read every review i pay attention to their reviews i love when you write whether it's good or bad both i love them most thank God most of it is good but I'll read them I take it to my heart and and I do this from heart I am very passionate about what I do I think on one of the few designers that when we sell out I actually feel bad because it's like my babies are leaving me and they're dead they're they're gone and she gets very emotional about it it's true I to know so if you're looking at it you told me to remind you if you don't mention their praise holes I liked it I liked it seemed escaping me a check all right this is the icing on the cake we have wowed you and romanced you with the amazing design the spectacle of this patented setting now I want to wow you with the price and we have to talk about it is a it's an integral part of this purchase I would want to know this the earrings that you're about to buy and have for a lifetime were valued they were appraised by three appraisers nothing to do with HSN we send them out we do this with everything we send them to three individual appraisers one appraisal comes in it's the highest obviously one comes in at the middle of one comes in at the lowest by very nature the lowest appraisal is always the one we put on the screen we're very conservative the lowest appraisal was

to compare white gold to sterling silver and I happen to have those pieces and we're gonna end the dispute if white gold looks like sterling silver and if it does why am i buying this let's roll my  music so I can put you onto this comparison and let's finally determine if these shits look alike I'm kind of a big deal [Applause] listen morning my beautiful people's you know how it is this see a boy see through to the beater a white gold and sterling silver two tones that I really wear alone sometimes I wear my sterling silver joint but my pasty ass vitamin D deficient lack of Sun skin does not like white gold or sterling silver on my skin it just doesn't look right it looks kind of me but a lot of people and I mean a lot of people like that white gold tone they like the white go away ice some people like sterling silver obviously is more cost effective but still has that similar look or does it so I happen to have in my hand two Miami Cuban Linx both from Daniel jewelry Inc of course I'm not gonna tell you which is which I'm gonna put them right in front of the camera and you guys determine which one it is and then I'll tell you what it is kind of like a weird game that I can't understand anyway because you're not commenting and this is in live so bear with me so here we go so when looking at it through the camera I think we can tell which one is white gold and which one is sterling clearly this one is the white gold one and you can tell by its freshly polish and it has that shine to it as opposed to the sterling silver where this isn't freshly polished its kind of worn but it is clean but it doesn't have that gleam or that shine factor that this one has can this one get to this shine I personally don't know I'm not a jeweler but maybe it can kind of get to that maybe it'll have to be what rhodium dipped I think it is and then shine to this appeal maybe I mean do they look super off yeah kind of you do see the differences personally yeah I'll put the sterling one on this white gold one has the sleek box lock fully iced out it is very nice it's about 26 inches in length I'll put this on so you guys can see the comparison with the two and we can do a neck profile the white gold one just feels more substantial it feels like gold the sterling silver one I don't know it just feels completely different when you have them side-by-side visually if you're just walking by maybe you can pull off this was educational for me because I just considered all white metals to look pretty much the same but in this case it doesn't it there is a good good amount of difference between them this one has its darker its richer it's more polished this one is kind of bland and just looks very different it definitely looks very very different so comparatively speaking I think this is something that you can kindly try to play off as white gold it's like the old Katt Williams joke that Chrysler 300 back in the day used to look like a rolls-royce phantom until the phantom pulls up next to you then you're like I gotta get the out of here this looks like this one until this rolls up and then you just like goodbye the age-old question sterling silver kind of looks like white gold for me you know it was busted for me I I even got an education on this because personally looking at them up close they're just not the same at all I love y'all  from the

"Lgz6w7CFdC8": "[Music] [Music] [Music] you", "v5Kb6LZJzZs": "[Music] hi I'm Josh Fishman president and owner of a Fishman and some diamonds in New York welcome back to our ultimate diamond education series today I would like to discuss a question that I'm often asked and it has to do with what metal should your engagement ring be made out of it should be made out of white gold or should it be made out of platinum the option is also to have it made in yellow gold but there there's nothing to discuss because if it was yellow we would make it in yellow gold but if we gonna make it in white the color white which is a much more requested color today then the question comes up should it be made in white gold or platinum there are a number of differences which are not necessarily visual which I would like to describe to you as to why you should choose either white gold or platinum at the end I will give you my advice so let's start with what the differences are between white gold and platinum let's talk about the intrinsic color of platinum versus white gold and the process called rhodium plating both white gold and platinum are white in color however there are significant differences the intrinsic color of white gold is actually a little grayish and yellowish that's because of the alloys that go in to make white gold usable because you cannot work with 24 karat gold the finished process called rhodium plating enables a white gold ring to look equally as shiny and bright as platinum rhodium is a hard shiny tarnish proof metal which is used to coat through an electrolysis process the ring that is made in white gold it is also used to finish off a ring in platinum so from a visual perspective both a white gold ring and a platinum ring finished with a rhodium plating process will look the same however over time rhodium plating wears away in both white gold and platinum the duration depends on the where and the number of years etc but it can be replated to look exactly like it did before however when a white gold rings rhodium plating wears away you get to see the base color of the white gold which is going to be tinted grayish yellowish when a platinum ring which is rhodium plating wears off with the rhodium plating you will see still a white ring although it will not look as shiny as it did with rhodium plating so that is one aspect of the difference between platinum and white gold which should be considered and that is what is the intrinsic color of the metal but there are more important issues than that and let me turn to the second one now what is the difference in the weight of the two metals although rhodium-plated white gold and rhodium plated platinum jewelry are virtually indistinguishable to the casual observer there is a significant difference in the weight of the jewelry item due to the density of platinum versus white gold a platinum item of jewelry will weigh approximately two times what that item will weigh in white gold and there will be a significant difference in the feel of the ring that will factor in to the issues of cost and desirability as I go to the next difference which is cost what is the price difference between white gold and platinum let's see if I can describe the differences in the price of platinum versus gold rings without too much myth historically the price of platinum was more expensive than the price of gold in the intrinsic metal because platinum is rarer and also had industrial uses but today it's actually the reverse as of today September 14th 2018 an ounce of platinum is $800 and an ounce of gold is 50% more $1200 now that is not the only difference of course the metal used in jewelry for platinum is 95% pure while the purity of the white gold that is used in jewelry is fifty eight and a half percent pure about a third less if you take the fact that platinum is twice as heavy and you take the difference in the purity you end up today with an intrinsic cost of platinum at about twice the cost of white gold for the same piece of jewelry but that is not the only factor that goes into manufacturing a piece of jewelry you had the labor which is approximately the same well a little bit more expensive for platinum because it is a little less malleable and the cost of any diamonds that accent the ring so in the end if you have just a plain platinum ring versus a plain white gold ring you'll have a ring that costs about twice as much as it does in white gold versus platinum and if you have some diamonds on the accents on the ring the platinum ring will not cost as much as the difference without diamonds because you're adding other costs into it which level out a little bit of the difference between platinum and white gold next I'd like to discuss what it is that you should do in your choice and what my advice is so what should you do in your making your choice I strongly believe that your decision should be based on your overall budget if you have a more limited budget I would strongly recommend that you use 14 carat white gold here are the advantages one a lower cost to a beautiful ring which looks identical to a ring in platinum that will be finished with rhodium plating and three the ability to put more of your budget into the major diamond of your ring which is not an insignificant amount let's say for example you have a budget of three or four thousand dollars to spend $400 extra of that budget in the making a platinum ring will severely limit the quality or size of the diamond you can buy within your budget so I strongly recommend 14 white gold because I think in the end the long-term value of your purchase is in the diamond and that's what you should focus most on on the other hand if you have a more generous budget let's say eight or ten thousand dollars or more I would strongly recommend that you use platinum you have a heavier better feeling ring on your hand you have not a significant price difference in white gold versus platinum within your overall budget to the point that I would say that if you can't afford the extra $500 maybe you're in the world budget and you have ultimately a better value because you're able to stick with the larger better quality diamond that you've selected so in the end I really think it comes down to your personal budget if you select a 14-karat white gold ring because of your more limited budget you can always upgrade that to platinum for not that much more money in the future so that's it on this differences between platinum and white gold you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me either by phone or by email until next time this is Josh Fishman saying so long [Music] you", "y_B4GhNKGXI": "thinking about

of course cats gonna jump uh and in today's video I'm going to be talking a little bit about marks on jewelry and if they say they're gold does that mean that they are always going to be gold and these are basically words of caution too especially new sellers or seasoned sellers that it is a really good idea for you to get your very own gold and silver testing kit to have at home so this is the kit that I bought there are multiples of certain acids because I did buy some fresh acids because I think they might have been getting old of had this kit for a while and basically what you're gonna need is a testing stone I'll link the kit that I bought because the kid I bought came with all the acid the testing stone it came up I think it came with this diamond tester too and a lot of other things that you can use so you'll need a testing kit you'll need this stone it comes with the one I got came with a littler stone but I ordered a big one and you'll also need a magnet you don't have to get this big mammoth JAMA but a nice strong magnet I'm something to protect your hands with rubber gloves or if you're allergic to latex some other way to protect your hands and I think that's pretty much it so Anna loop a loop is always good so basically the reason I wanted to do this video is because I got this necklace and these two earrings in my last thread up box and they looked really good I'm gonna zoom in for you to the so these are the ones that I got this one looked really good it it is marked 925 and you can't see that because I don't have it focused correctly let me take these off real fast so let me zoom in a little bit more so you can see this a little bit better so the first one is this little earring it was a solo earring but as you can see it looks gold and it looks really well-made it's got a nice click to get it put on and there are little teeny stones set into it you can see and it is marked 9 to 5 in there and I think I actually might see another mark not just 95 so that that was really interesting because it does have perhaps a gold plating over it because it does look gold so I'm gonna show you how to test that because we'll test it I'll show you all tested for gold but then we'll also test it for silver so that you can see that even if it is gold-plated that it should still test positive for silver so we'll do that one and then the second solo earring was this little hoop that has a little gold heart on it what I look for is that this part of the earring is also gold the post that goes into your ear so it doesn't always true but you when I find gold earrings they generally have a gold post like that and I didn't originally see them work but now I'm seeing some little scratch marks on the post there I might go get my loop and double check it and so this this earring has got three pieces so want the chest all three parts it's got the back it's got the earring and it's got the charm on it so we'll need to test all three of those I'm gonna get my loop and see if I see what that little scratching is there and then finally there is this necklace which initially I thought oh my gosh this is a score if it is gold it looked really good these parts looked really legit along the edges and like the finish on the end of the the chain then the clasp looks really good for it to be gold and it is marked 14k so I was pretty excited until bum bum we pulled out the magnet and as you don't see it is ever slightly it is ever so slightly magnetic it's not usually magnetic but it is a little bit and for it to be gold it's not gonna have magnetism to it now I know there are exceptions I was gonna comment but I have never come across it where it did test positive so if just one does and I get to eat my words because really it is very well made and if I was a new seller and I didn't have a kit this might you know I might list this because it's marked 14k and looks really like a nice quality another place to look are is on these rings hope you can see that the little rings connecting the pieces generally on a gold piece it will be soldered closed this one actually looks like it might not be I can't tell for sure I'd have to get my loop again but it might be like keep pulling it out then look at the camera so these little leaps jump rings will be soldered closed usually if it's really really high-quality one because they don't want it to pull apart or break you know so let me grab my bleep real quick so when I look at it close I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to see it is not but this is another really good tip I'm not we thinking Alana's looking is that when you're looking at gold or silver pieces and you're not sure if they are real then another place to look when you got your loop out is in these spots where the jump like the jump ring connects to these other pieces or the hook that the moving parts basically because these parts that are moving all the time if it is plated or if it's fake then you're gonna see where you're gonna see that the gold has rubbed off if it's you know just coated and they're trying to trick you know trick you so let's take a look at that and see I keep moving it out of screen now focus sorry but so as I'm looking in here I I don't see that it it doesn't look like there's any gold rubbing off let's look on the other end as well so if you are if you can see and try to ignore those crazy lights there it doesn't look like there any is any of the gold that's rubbed off I'm trying to look at the inside of it as well like inside of the the looping part in here like it's what would get rubbed a lot and it looks from really good so if I didn't have a testing kit you know it'd be super tempting just to go ahead and lift it this is ring up already tested and I know that it is gold so we will just use that for our gold to testing all right gloves on ladies and gentlemen because those acids will burn your hands the first thing I do is I line up the pieces so since this is probably gonna test for silver I'm probably not going to test all of the pieces of it so I line them all up one two three and four and so that I know the order in which my scratches are in and I'm gonna take first this necklace and I'm gonna find an inconspicuous spot I'm gonna scratch on this end of this piece here what's gonna not really be very noticeable so that's my first piece and a lot of times with gold and silver you'll see a difference in the scratch marks too so sometimes when you get really good at this you'll start to be able to tell even with a scratching like it because it's a different color so there's that one you can see this one's a little more goldish this one's lit already a little more silver ish and for our next piece I'm gonna scratch I'm gonna open it up and scratch um from the the post part that goes into the ear okay so there's that one and then finally my gold ring and this has got this kind of a sizer piece in it so I'm gonna scratch on the bottom of the sizer piece going down okay so first things first its marked 14k so I'm pulling out my 14k acid I don't wanna get my number one out so I'm gonna get my 14k acid and I'm just gonna make a little line I'm gonna go ahead and go across the silver to so you can see what happens so straight down the line like so and when you look at them let me zoom it in if the mark underneath disappears that means that the acid has eaten away at it and that it is not that carat so as you can see the acid has eaten away pretty much all of them except for my gold ring so not one that said that it was gold marked gold is not you can still see the asset there or the Goldmark there okay so what we're gonna do now for the the silver mark so this one that we that was marked 14k it's not 14 K so the other ones what we're gonna do to find out if they are silver is we're going to use our 18 K solution and what will happen is when you put 18 karat solution on silver it'll turn like a silvery white so here we go okay right there hmm right there so you can see that it turns like this silvery whitish kind of great color I'm gonna do it on this one too just for funsies just to see what happens to see you're like maybe they've got like silver that they've played it or something nope it isn't vanishing away these two earrings that were marked 95 silver are in fact silver and my necklace which was marked 14k was a complete and utter fake so I would not even list it for obviously obvious reasons because it's not really gold these solo earrings I'll probably either put into a lot or sell them as solo sterling silver you know vorm a which is another name for gold plated silver earrings so those ones might get sold solo and then this one's already listed so you bring you gets back of it in this necklace is still really cool it's a really well made it's really pretty the chain is unusual but I just won't list it as a gold necklace so it definitely won't have as big of a value because of it not being actually gold but I will put you know it is marked 14k but did not test positive for gold so I won't be deceptive in any way but whoever may like the chain somebody may like you know that it looks really nice and get a gold looking necklace for a really good price let me know what you think and if you have any other tips for new sellers of jewelry and I will link a gold and silver testing kit down in the description box below so that you can pick one up for yourself so that if you come across any pieces of gold or silver that you think might be fake or even if you think they're real so that you can be confident in listing them on eBay Etsy or wherever you happen to be selling them I hope you enjoyed this video everybody and I will talk to you on the next one bye bye

see now it's a white collar and I was worried girl ass it that's the electric in this room liquids rodeo so this was regularly why cult but um the color was fading on it so my jeweler ended up

that means so much to me you guys have been leaving at such nice comments on all my videos I'm just feeling really like grateful and inspired and just like I don't know I'm just like really happy lately and it's all because of you guys I just finish I'm in like a really good place but anyway that has nothing to do with this video today's video I just want to sit down and talk about my jewelry collection where I got all my jewelry the pieces that I wear every single day my favorite pieces like all of that because one of my most asked questions on my Instagram and like in my DMS and the comments on my videos is always where I get the jewelry pieces because I never change any my jewelry I just wear the same pieces in every single video all the time every single day I never take these pieces off so I just wanted to sit down and share with you guys in case every anybody who ever has any questions about my jewelry you can watch this video find out where it's from just to make it super easy for you guys so without further ado let's get started so first I'm gonna start off with the pieces that I wear every single day and I wear the same bracelet necklaces and rings all the time I never take them off so to start off with the Rings they are just these gold of cartier love rings and I have the small one which just looks like this it is like the wedding band and it's just like the thin one and then I also have the thicker version and I just stack them on my middle finger I got these in June 2018 I bought them for myself after I hit hundred thousand subscribers on YouTube so that was kind of like a big milestone in my life I was really proud of myself and I thought that I would just treat myself and buy myself these rings just because they're so timeless I will wear them forever I wear them every single day I never take them off so a trend that you guys will see like with all the jewelry that I wear is I get pieces that are quality and are gonna last me a long time that are going to be meaningful to me and not just like pieces that are like less quality that kind of just like tarnish and I have to take off and we'll break these ones are like very reliable they're very good quality they're very I don't know I just think they're really nice pieces and for me I really like like quality over quantity and I'd rather have like a few nice pieces that I wear every single day rather than just like a bunch of random items I don't really care about so the first thing is these rings yes I do have the Big Love ring and then the smaller Lovering but I just have them and at the yellow-gold just because I love gold jewelry and I really really love these rings they mean so much to me maybe one day I will get the bracelet but I don't think so in the near future but I love the bracelet as well it's just super timeless and they will never go out of style and the next items that I get so many questions about are my necklace and matching bracelet so this is the bracelet right here and it is just a solid 14 karat gold beaded bracelet and it like shimmers I don't know if you guys can see yeah look at that it shimmers in the light I just think that's absolutely gorgeous that has a little clasp and then I also have the matching necklace right here just looks like that and I got the bracelet and necklace in Venice Italy it was my first time leaving the country and going to like somewhere where I've always dreamed of going so I saw this necklace and bracelet and I was like I need half of them and I just think that they're so gorgeous I've never seen anything like it I wear them every single day I got so many compliments on them they just really mean so much to me and you can wear them in the water you can wear them in the shower and you never have to take them off just because they're solid gold so I got these in Italy I got them in st. Mark's Square I don't know the exact little shop that I got them from but if you guys are wondering it thought is where I bought them and I will try to have like a dupe link down below just so you guys can like get this look for less just because these are 14 karat gold pieces and they were more expensive just because I wanted them to last me a long time and yeah and the next necklace I get a lot of questions about is this little mini Scorpio necklace and it's just a gold chain with my zodiac written out on it and it's just really tiny writing I got this on Etsy I'm actually gonna go back through my emails to last year and try to find the exact shot that I got it from cuz I know it got shipped from Europe over to the United States it took like a month and a half from when I ordered it to when I received it and it's just a little mini 14 karat gold solid name necklace and I will find the Etsy shop I got it from a link down below for you guys just in case you guys want to get the same thing I know I get a lot of questions about this necklace and I don't know I just like thought that it was different because I'm really like into my zodiac and horoscope and that type of stuff so instead of just getting like my name on a necklace I decided to get my zodiac just because cuz it was something different so I really really loved it and layering these two necklaces together just like looks so good and I just I don't know I really love them a lot so that is basically the jewelry I wear every single day now I'm gonna go into a few pieces that I wear kind of like switch off throughout the weeks and just like whenever I feel like it these items are not like 14 karat gold they're not real these are more affordable pieces that I bought just because I like them and I like to like accessorize with them but the first items are these earrings right now I've been wearing these ones a lot and I have my like ear pierced with the double piercing so I just wear a little gold hoop and then I wear these little earrings that have like a peace sign and then like a love sign on them and so these are the earrings I've been wearing recently every single day and then right here I just have all of my chunky hoops and like fun earrings and accessories that I wear or have been wearing all the time recently so I just want to share with you guys where they're from just because I get so many questions on them and the first pair of earrings are just these gold chunky hoops then I got from Target they're super cute I will have them linked down below they were only six dollars but they're just like the perfect small chunky hoop and the next pair of junk you have they're my absolute favorite lately and they are just these solid gold hoops from Madewell and they don't go all the way around which I really like and they're just really really big I know that they also come in a smaller size so I will have both of them linked to down below just in case you guys don't want to get them me or my favorite hoops right now at the moment I love them so much I just think that they're like literally the perfect pair of Hoops and they're not like that shiny they're kind of a more like a distressed metal gold hoop and I really really like them I think they're gorgeous and very timeless and then inside this little marble like jewelry container I just have a bunch of Hoops that I either got from Urban Outfitters or forever 21 so in the first pair that I have are just these tortoise ones these are from urban these are so cute and just like a nice little accessory to have I know earrings are my favorite accessory just to just have any outfit so these ones are super cute from Urban just for the days where I'm not really feeling a gold hoop it's nice to like to switch it up and wear like a tortoise one and the next pair from urban are just these kind of like oval rectangular hoops and these are just plain little gold shaped hoops kind of self-explanatory these rooms are just super fun they're really lightweight and then my last pair hoops from urban I wore a town over the summer I haven't worn them a lot recently just because I've been into more of like a bigger more chunky OOP but they're these little dainty gold like half circle hoops these are super cute if you're not really into wearing big earrings I think that these ones are absolutely perfect and then I have two pairs of like bigger fun more chunky hoops to wear like when I go out in the first pair are just these twisted ones from forever 21 and they just look like that these are so fun I love the detailing on them like when you wear a plain bodysuit I feel like it really dresses up your outfit because of like the twisted detailing and then the next pair are these ones from Zara they're super thick and they are kind of like a hammered gold it's like detail hammered gold I almost have material hammered gold detail and they're just these little half Hoops got these firms are in Canada these are amazing I love these obviously you guys know I love a good chunky hoop if you couldn't tell already it by the video but my laughs pair that I own are just these little small ones from made well and I got these I think last spring and they're just little mini gold chunky hoops and these ones actually go like halfway around and then like the part where you put in your ear it's like up there at the top so they kind of look full circle but they're not and these ones are super cute just again like little small ones if you don't like wearing big hoops you it definitely can wear little tiny ones like this but these are just my favorite hoops that I've been wearing recently that I own and all of them I usually get from like urban or like Madewell Zara places like that where they just have like good accessories even Free People has really good runs too but I will have all that hoops that I just mentioned link to down below for you guys I actually forgot to talk about these two bracelets right here just because I haven't been wearing them recently since it's not summer I took them off but I have the double ball kpop bracelet and then the single ball just the silver bracelet with the gold ball detailing and they are from Eden in East Dennis on Cape Cod they are just the original authentic kpop bracelets and they actually weren't my mom's but I have been wearing them for a couple years now they're just beautiful sterling silver and 14 karat gold bracelets and that concludes today's video I hope that it was helpful for you guys just sharing my favorite jewelry pieces where I get my everyday jewelry and all of that again it will have all the links down below so it's very easy for you to find them if you guys want to check out any of these pieces and thank you guys so much for watching this video I love you guys so much and I will see you in my next one bye guys", "JgxQc_KuM_4": "hello my name is Brett Bharat I'm a jewelry buyer with jewelry tak\u00e1cs comm based in San Diego California today I'm going to be talking to you about how to identify white gold jewelry the first thing that you will want to do is to have a jeweler's loupe handy with this you can take a look at the items that you possess to try to determine if they are gold silver platinum or perhaps none of the above what I do with the loupe is I'll take the loop and I'll look at the item very closely and I'm looking for markings in the United States there are common markings on most of the jewelry which will either be 10 carat 14 karat or 18 carat but we don't want to trust that especially now with the price of gold being so high it's very common to find items that may be marked as gold but might not necessarily be made of gold so the first step we'll do is we'll take the white gold and we will rub it on this stone here this is called a jeweler's rubbing stone when we rub the metal onto the stone applying with firm pressure a small micron layer of the material will remain on the stone interestingly when using white gold the material that's rubbed on the stone is not exactly white in appearance it's not quite yellow it's kind of an in-between that's because there's no such thing as white gold other alloys are added to yellow gold to make it white when we apply the acid to the material on the stone it should remain the same color and often that color with the acid will remain a more yellow color because what that acid is doing is it removing some of the other alloys but it's the yellow gold which is remaining we want to make sure that color is still the same not changing if it starts turning a little bit red it's probably a weaker karat gold if it disappears completely most likely it's not gold also if you have an item and you're not exactly sure what it is you want to remember about different markings I've shown you the different markings that are typical in the United States 10 carat 14-karat 18-karat also represented by their approximate purities 4 1 7 5 8 5 or 7 5 o silver for example is typically marked with a 9 to 5 or sterling which the 925 means 92.5 percent pure platinum items will be marked PLA T or the word platinum or they'll have the 900 or 9 5 o markings that is a quick way to know right away if the item could potentially be white gold so basically I've showed you what you need to look for when trying to determine if you have white gold jewelry look for the marks use your loop apply acid to a marking that you left on the rubbing stone and that will get you about 9/10 of the way there if you're still in doubt I recommend taking your items to a professional jeweler or appraiser who will be able to tell you 100% but if you follow the steps that I provided you're pretty much be on your way again my name is Brett rod jewelry

beautiful Biddy gonna be doing a derby haul for you today actually I just purchased these products about two weeks ago from Walmart I know so I was really reluctant about buying jury from Walmart because typically I do not normally I buy jewelry online from Ross Simon so yeah but you know Ross Simon is very pricey it's very expensive I have spent way too much money on Ross Simon jewelry over the last several years and yeah it just adds up it gets very costly gets very expensive so I decided to go out on a limb and make some online purchases from Walmart and actually buy real jury from Walmart so I got this order about two weeks ago and I bought a few pairs here anyhow I want to share some of them with you okay let's start out the first one these are called these are simply gold oval hoop earrings and ten karat gold so I really like these I do think you know they're decent quality they're very lightweight there's you know there's not much to them but it is becoming increasingly more difficult to find solid gold jewelry for sale these days jewelry excuse me gold is obviously in sketchiest scarce demand and it's not as abundant as gold used to be whether it's 10 karat or 14 karat or even 18 karat gold depending on whatever it does not make no difference it is becoming increasingly more difficult to find real jury if you know what I mean an actual gold because go up the prices of gold of just skyrocketed unbelievably so anyhow I thought I'd go ahead and give Walmart jury a try I'm very pleasantly surprised with their juries so far really no complaints it's very decently priced yeah so I really do like these these are the simply gold 10 carat oval hoop earrings yeah I really love those so yes move on to the next product here next Juri Adam here I'm so used to doing product reviews I know so I really love these these are gold balls and once again these are 10 karat these are 10 karat gold balls and I just love them I think they're fantastic you they're not too big they're not too small they're not overdramatic they're not you know they're not less dressy or more dressy you can dress them up you can dress them down you can wear these with blue jeans and a t-shirt blue jeans and a sweater you can wear this with pair of shorts and a tank top it makes no difference but I think they're so cute just the same I really do like these and I'm very pleasantly surprised I think the quality is fairly decent and I wanted to share that so me show you that other one here that's what they look like there they are very cute if I can get a if I can get a hold of them here so yeah you know Walmart jury is what it is and obviously you can find some good pieces at Walmart at a you know fraction of the price because like I said just the price of gold has been driven up and it's so scarce lately and it's just expensive so I thought I would get in on some deals here for some real gold Sheree and what better place to look than Walmart so yeah I'm joy Z's and here's another pair I really liked this is part of the simply listening nice let me see let me see Missy this is the simply gold kids these are very small but I wanted a very tiny very small pair of hoop style earrings because on my double piercings I want to wear them in my upper whole of my double piercings and wear the bigger earrings down in the bottom hole if you know what I mean so yeah these are fantastic these are the simply gold kids collection these are 10 and karat gold simply gold and they are really small hearts there are hoops that are shaped in the shape of hearts I think they're very cute I think they're very awesome I love wearing these in the top hole of my ears they look fantastic I love them very decent quality once again being that they are for kids I would think they would be fantastic for children these would be absolutely fantastic for a little girl they would be such a treasure okay let's move on here to the next pair we got some more children's product here these are let's see these are 14 karat gold so they these are unlike the other pairs that are 10-carat these are 14 let me look at my receipt here and see if I can figure out which pair I'm looking at so I can give you accurate information these are these are also simply these are simply gold this are let's see these are okay these are simply gold kids and I can't find it on my receipt okay but anyhow I bought them whatever I don't know I think my receipt had a second page to it I can't find my second page but anyhow these are also simply gold the simply simply gold kids collection these are children's very small these are oval ribbed rib style hoops oval-shaped and these are 14 karat gold I love these once again I love wearing these in the top hole I could dress them up dress them down I love them and for children these would be awesomely fantastic for a little girl they come in such a cute little box here so yeah that would be such a treasure I would have absolutely loved to have had those when I was a little girl growing up I mean I was so girly girly and I just I loved anything girly girly your girlish and I would have just idol of those so much I absolutely would have those would make a fantastic children's gift they really would okay and the last pair I have here is let's see these are these are what I'm looking at my receipt here but obviously I left the second page out to my receipt okay so these are going to be these are mache with the earth these are going to be simply gold 10 karat scalloped hoop earrings okay I love these these are absolutely fantastic as well I have worn every pair that I've showed you I have worn within the last two weeks I have just circulated through them I love them these are the scalloped oval hoops and a 10 karat gold fantastic absolutely love these they're very lightweight they're not heavy they won't weigh your ears down and yeah once again like I said it's a joy getting in on some real gold jury because if you notice all the jury stores whether it's online or a physical actual jewelry store notice that everything for sale is sterling silver and it's set in sterling silver or it's spray sterling silver or spray gold or it's gold overlay or it's a rota dime or it's gold-tone it's very difficult lightly to really get in on real gold or solid gold pieces so I thought I'd jump on it and I am very pleasantly surprised with my Walmart jury haul I hope you enjoy it hopefully it enlightened you and if you're interested just check out Walmart online where I bought all my items from or go see what your actual Walmart store has so yeah here's just a recap of all them and I love them I just say they were there economically priced and I'm glad I bought all them I'll show you the little balls that are hiding out there they're so adorable I love these I think these are my favorite out of the hall here the jury hall these are my favorite of favorites here I love the gold balls I think they're so adorable okay so yeah hope you enjoyed the gold jury Walmart haul take care beauties be sure to give me a like give me a subscribe as always give me a thumbs up and check out all my other product reviews I love you guys so much mmm bye now", "p8TQSyDuk1A": "welcome to the national jewelry liquidation center located in Las Vegas I'm Tracy and I'm here to share with you this week

going to talk about what's the difference between 10 karat 14-karat 18-karat 22 karat and 24 karat gold and how to test for each one what's the most accurate way and what are all the ways to test for if your build is real fake rhodium plated stainless steel whatever it is I'm gonna teach you how to test for so what is 10 karat 10-karat is 41.7% pure gold 14 karat is 58.5% pure gold and 18 karat is 75% pure gold 22 karat is 91.6% pure gold and pure gold is 99.999% pure gold which is 24 karat that's what everybody wants but almost nothing is manufactured in 24 karat because of how fragile is if you wanna Cuban link in 24 care we could probably do it that's no problem 22 karat humanly we can do it no problem anything else and 22 to 24 karat gets really hard to deal with but special occasions if you really want something for the right price you can make the most commercial gold or ten care and fourteen care that's what most people buy a few people buy 18 karats or if you want to be an exclusive class you get 18 care now how to test the dip TennCare 14-karat 18-karat 22 karat we currently use thermo scientific I taught myself to x-ray analyzer thus analyzer is to analyze gold so putting on the piece of gold this is the most accurate way to test gold everywhere so people who use and then it tells you it's 14 care this is fourteen point three two carat and fifty nine point six nine percent of gold so this piece right here is a little over the fifty eight point five percent of gold that has to be same thing will be with 10 karat so 10 karat chain this was coming out a loving care so as stamp ten carats coming out of loving care which is forty five point eight nine percent gold anything above and better it's a little less what I would say if your piece of gold once you tested with the x-ray machine if it's nine point nine zero or nine point eight five it's still passable s 10 karat well we try and do everything above so if it's 10 ish if it's 10 karat it should be 1001 or 10:02 should go above should never be less but it could happen it's all about the mixture and where you're testing it let's say you test it right here it could give 1025 so you test it over here you could give 995 and it's all how long you put it on there so if you put it on with the x-ray machine you put it on 10 seconds to do a 10-second test on it on a pave finger [Music] on an 11-second test they gave 41.5% nine point nine seven percent so it's point two off of ten care I mean if you test it anywhere else it will give the 10k and right there gave 41.96 so this is the most accurate way to test it it tells you exactly what it is now a lot of jewelers still use acid and rock method where you stretch a piece of jewelry before a little bit of acid on and it's got 10 karat 14-karat 18-karat gold acid and the if it goes away it's not girls at all if it smokes a little bit it's a little under care or it still could be the carrot with the acid you never know acid is the least accurate way to test a piece of jewelry sometimes they even throw the acid on top of the jewelry and if the jewelry even has a gold plating on it they'll be like oh it's not real and not true because every piece of doing is go play it if you see this piece right here has a completely different color than this this one's they're both solid gold which I just proved to you is completely different color than this but this one before I left the factory they play today this one is not plated listen they're not plated and there's also the gel pen method where it's like you put a little tablet you put gel on it and you press a button and it should type it as 10 or 14 karat sounds a little more accurate than the current acid method which everyone uses the reason people use if the rock and acid method is because it's cheapest way this is the most expensive way there's a way I recommend you get your jewelry tested if you have a Cuban link or any other piece of jewelry be it a $100 item to a $10,000 get it tough do it the next year machine somebody in your town has to have an x-ray machine they're not everywhere just yet because they still are expensive pieces they run about 20 to 25,000 dollars depending on the model that you get there's a thermo scientific there's olympus you can look them up online but check check your jewelry out if you have if your I know we got videos of other jewelry stores in the local area they they bring their jewelry over here to get it tested but they don't want to their cut their customers bring their jewelry over here to get a tested and it usually goes down to about 12 carat and is 14 we even have a video of one that's stamped 14 carat then it came out of levy care so yeah beware when you buy jewelry busts do it from somebody you trust somebody that can respond to any of the problems because if you spend money for a 14-karat piece and you get a 10 karat piece it's not nice or if you get a 12 carat piece it's not nice because you did pay that extra money for the 14-karat they'll be aware when you buy make sure it's everything's 100% guaranteed if not you can return it and get your money back I know a lot of jewelers started to knock it so stay tuned give us a like share and subscribe and let us know what you think [Music]", "qLYErkJTlWA": "what is going on everyone in spring which could you find jewelry your personal jeweler in today's video I'm doing a complete breakdown it's very special for a few reasons up 10 carat all the way to 22 carat and what better chain to use then my most popular Franko and the 3 millimeter diamond-cut so all things considered equal pretty much on this video I want to break it down to you guys color and weight and durability with that being said let's get started don't forget to follow me on Instagram add to code you find jewelry visit my website www.jfn.co.jp/toho you've got to look at the coloring the main thing is it's hard to match coloring these chains are all from the same manufacturer in Italy it's hard to compare these chains compared to rope chains that are made in Peru from someone else so I want to level the playing field and just use all the same width lengths and manufactured chain so you guys could get the best idea possible now the more gold in a chain the richer of gold color and it'll be obviously that's the 18 to 22 compared to like the 10 karat under 50% pure gold there's just not enough gold in that chain or piece of jewelry to really give it that rich gold coloring and of course when you do side by side going up from 10 to 14 there's a slight more richer gold color and same with 18 and then you see the big jump with 22 carat so looking at them the higher purity has the more gold coloring next we have to talk about the weight because there is a pretty big difference I have 4 scales I weighed the 10 carat on the left 14 18 and in the 22 carat on the right and as you guys could see these are the same diamond cut 3 millimeter franco's all 20 inches and you could see the gram weight climbs up with more gold Gold is heavier than the other alloys used in that chain so when you're shopping for a higher period you got to know one you're gonna pay for more gold in that chain as well as far as the price goes as well as the weight goes as well so a 3 millimeter 20 inch 18 carat franco is going to weigh more than a 3 millimeter 14 karat gold franco the same thing just because that gold weigh in that Payne itself is heavier the last thing is the durability test the best way I found is take a hammer and just bang that train and see what happens if that chain is durable that's a joke don't try that at home just a little comedy for this clip the best thing that I think is it really is circumstantial is up to you you could always reach out to me and ask for advice I'll give you my honest advice as far as if you should go 14 18 or 22 karat the general thing is more experienced people that wear gold for a longer time use you're ready for the higher purities and rightfully so if you're just starting into it then I would go lower purity the most popular and the most really that I wear is 14 karat gold I feel like it has a great blend of coloring weight and also wear to it I wear all my chains all the time I got four chains on now my Franco might go are 14 karat gold as well I do like 18 karat I don't really wear 22 karat as much but 14 karat works for me and a lot of my clients so that's my general advice but it really just depends on you and your circumstance I don't like to think bad on one or the other it just depends on who's buying it and what you're looking for in that gold piece of jewelry at the other day guys just do your research see which purity is right for you there's so many options out there just make sure you're shopping juco G for your gold I really only sell 14 karat and up but reach out to me if you need any advice and recommendations it's what I do and I do it very

so we're going to keep a good thing going i'm actually super excited about these earrings because i unfortunately misplaced one of my love knot earrings i had obviously two of them and they were 14 karat gold one of my favorite pieces of jewelry and i lost one and i kept thinking surely on gold day we'll have a love knot earring right here she is all right so it's from italy so what do we have iconic design classic design durability genuine 14 karat gold these are the mini love not stud earrings look at your price i mean on gold day honestly that isn't always what i drive your eyes to because it's like all right let's talk about it first because we've got an investment in front of us no no we have one of the most affordable items on gold day in front of you right now 82 dollars and 40 cents my friends now's the time to start shopping because i don't think this is going to last 16.04 cents is your easy pay i feel like i'm presenting like dominique or something like at these price points but this is still 14 karat gold okay so great news three colors in the gold and on a gold event day often we are fortunate to have yellow gold and stop there really lucky when we have yellow gold and white gold when we have all three then know that you've got something that our buyers truly believe you're going to want multiples of all right so obviously there's your yellow gold in front of you it's already very popular not surprised white gold in the middle five dozen to go around in its first look that could be the price for silver earrings and here it is in white gold fewer than 200 what in total or in the rows oh in the tritone okay so here is your tritone which features the yellow the rose and the white so you get the best of every world in one i think there are maybe a handful of tri-color gold items in our entire assortment at qvc so it's j37137 patricia costra joins us again you're going to see her a lot in this show because obviously we have the today's special value but this features one of the most rich selections in italian jewelry than i've seen in recent years so patricia thank you so much for working with our italian designers to bring us these beautiful pieces but here's one that i mean it's a classic italians a lot of we're seeing innovative designs and trendy looks and diamond cutting and here we kind of go to something that frankly has been around for centuries it's the love knot yeah absolutely i think when you think about those classic pieces and you're able i was lucky enough to go to a little workshop in larezzo where i see the artist that make something that his father made that his grandfather made an artistry that has been passed down it's really special to see the the workmanship that the time that comes into something like this and then to be able to bring it across these two qvc at you know an unbelievable uh day like this it's really special and something that you can wear every day like we want those pieces that you're able to wear uh you know by himself running your errands you're around the house and like you said chad like this is the time really where you wear jewelry for yourself to love it and enjoy it exactly and i also want to call out a couple things hey dionna your makeup is amazing today i mean you always look great but like i saw you on the couch like dang girl okay gold day bringing it yeah b getting back to the actual product um i almost don't like i understand why it is but i almost don't like the fact that minnie is right there in the descriptor because i'm afraid you're going to think it's like invisible you know or that you won't even see it and hopefully seeing it on diana really drove that point home in fact gorgeous shot you're about to see of the lift that this love knot has the dimension it looks like three eternity bands rings that you would wear on your finger that constantly roll and revolve around each other so while technically when i get in there with my ruler and you're gonna see you know that it's just barely at a quarter of an inch that height and that amount of gold and the width of the bands gives it presence because we do multiple sizes and love knots but this one absolutely is one that i would argue is probably most wearable even in a second or third piercing two so keep that in mind and then um patricia we can't ignore the fact that i'm looking at a tritone i mean we never see this yeah no it's again something that we love to do when we get a chance to showcase it in its finest form i like in the tri-color the rolling over style this is really where that tri-color takes center stage you get that gorgeous richness of the butter yellow gold that beautiful not gray but that white white gold and then of course that perfect for every skin tone for every outfit that rose gold but i love jen how you said that that volume is there yeah you're not just getting a regular stud you're getting beautiful artistry and a lot of presents yeah and that's that's the key because the price tag is one thing but i mean 82 can get you like what are you wearing this is something that you definitely see now you probably noticed if you got the kenai i started with three choices i'm down to two the white is sold out tritone four dozen the last update i got was seven dozen and that was about 30 seconds ago so a lot of you loving this tritone we never see it fewer than 200 now in the yellow gold and that i could i mean come on patricia when you get down to it we could order 5 000 love not earrings and just kind of always have them living in our warehouse because they are never going to go out of style and then also let's think about what it even symbolizes there's a reason why it's called the love knot right true love is eternal love it has no break it is infinite and you know we're talking about that a lot today especially with our today's special value and what it signifies but um here's another update tritone sold out by my lonely little yellow gold there um but if i'm gonna be left with one i'm glad it's this one yeah but it looks so beautiful there on its own too doesn't it i mean this has kind of been my my job for the last hour and ten minutes is just removing items from the table because you all are loving our jewelry sale so much yes the prices are amazing but maybe it's time um here's just personally where i'm at i'm going through my jewelry and really i'm editing right you know what are the pieces that really make me smile what are the pieces that i look forward to wearing because yes we have this feeling like oh i got to fill the jewelry box but does it really matter if you're not wearing it and this is one of the pieces that i think edit after edit after edit it continues to make the cut think of it like a gold stud earring but with a lot more interest and certainly a super affordable price tag so last look there your 82 dollar price tag one of the most affordable items of the entire day j37 j371137

"KPntPMP6-sU": "back inside out top to bottom left to right the amount of design and a hoop like this it's really quite remarkable but we have it available here as you're looking at it aren't those gorgeous here in 14 karat yellow gold but that's not your only choice we also have this earring in 14 karat white gold those are so pretty I love this earring the white code looks platinum enough wrists and white and it's all of that channel style design and then the twist we'll talk about it one more choice here it is in the rose gold these are new sell priced at $104 40 cents for easy pay though 26:10 get some home and your choice of either the Rose the white or the yellow you chose to wear the ease I'm wondering why I did I just love for me I don't tend to go for those huge bold leap hoops which I know look great on people but I still want presence in my hoops I might go a little more gentle than you know the big two inch I still want presents to me these hoops are so elevated I love the unique design like you said there's a lot going on with these that make the interest so special and just an elevated hoop to what you may already have so when we look at these you spoke to that channel setting these are oval so they're they're a little elevated hoop they're not that round style they're gonna sit really beautiful on the ear as Mary's turning it around you're seeing there's almost this twisted wave design when you see the profile of it so every angle when you're looking at that hoop is beautiful when we go back to the front you're seeing a little bit on the rows there you have these almost striated lines so the front angle has this juxtaposition between these beautiful lines and then you even get that subtle twist design peeking through on that on the face forward look so like I said every angle is super interesting super beautiful super flattering near the face and to me very different than that hoop you may already own but still it works so well with any other gold piece absolutely wearing the eternal gold shimmer rope chain absolutely great I don't it doesn't have to match to go gold plays well with any thing I mix your metals if you tend to be classic gold and you're looking at the rose to it with this piece because they'll all you can mix your metals you can lay with your golds and this is a beautiful way to do it it's it's unlike any hoop you've probably ever seen before almost an inch the 7/8 of an inch in the drop which means that you can wear it almost anywhere any day anytime it is up to you so ball cap and a t-shirt or the black sheath dress that that you sort of look in your jewelry box and think oh heavens you know I'm going to this fundraiser tonight what am I going to wear you'll reach for these beautiful 14-karat gold

giving in mind with the sale prices and those easy pay offers will go away coat up real soon here at the top of the hour well here comes my gift from the crew you guys are so generous to get this for me really sweet that's really happening but that'd be great if I went back to the dressing room when this show was over there was a beautiful I'll take blue topaz bracelet waiting for me listen this is a real collector's piece freedom inspired could be a fashion piece it feels like jewelry from the fifth century I think but these coins were minted in the United States it's item number J five zero five twenty seven sale price and depending on the choice that you're making here we have six and three-quarter seven and a quarter and eight inches on easy pay starting at three hundred nine dollars and fifty cents substantial savings with this piece and I'll let you know early that eighteen months special financing is available here only about 100 of this bracelet to go around for all of these United States which brings us to the coins themselves the gemstones are gorgeous so we have your choice here of either the blue topaz so pretty and you see all of your links there too and then also available here in the garnet available in all sizes but I'm wondering if you wouldn't mind Stacy to talk to us about these coins and love because as gorgeous as those gemstone stations are if you're purchasing a Liberty coin bracelet that's where you want to begin I think yeah cuz it's just so classic and regal and you're buying it because the point is so beautiful what you're seeing there is Lady Liberty and I just love how you see the detail so beautifully she has 50 stars that represent our 50 states there's beautiful like scalloped design around the texture around the coin when we turn it over if you can do that shot for me Mary you're going to see a family of eagles and that just represents family and tradition and unity so like you said", "7BpSIObxSO8": "all right you're looking at a beautiful 14 karat gold semi-hollow Miami semi-hollow means that it's a lighter link so you're getting more chain per gram that's really all it means it's still a heavy chain it weighs about twenty four point four grams it's 26 inches long six millimeters it's coming right out of the diamond district but its original a place of manufacturing is actually Italy we get these chains from Italy this one I particularly like you could fit it over your head real easy if you want to where it hangs down you can hang a piece on it pretty simply so if you're looking at this particular chain I highly recommend it I'm a big fan of this one it's 14 karat you always get your gold weight in it so when you spend your money on it after several years it's gonna pay for itself as far as its appreciation is concerned so what does that mean that basically means that you'll be able to melt it down and get all your money out and they'll the reason why I'm working on these gold chains that I'm explaining this fact is I've had this experience personally I bought this little franco when gold was about $700 an ounce and up to this point it cost me about negative $400 so basically if I melt this chain now I've been wearing it for for over ten years but if I melt it down now I'll be able to turn a profit I'm wearing it and that's a very rare product that's not something you're gonna get with anything else so if you're looking at this chain lay it away it's highly recommended here tracks and I see in the diamond district only from us and we got 200%", "8u0hG3y4OKo": "[Music] [Music]

is the difference\nbetween white and yellow gold? Gold itself is an element. It is the color gold. There's actually a color\nnamed after this metal. It is what it is. It is no other color,\nand it doesn't tarnish, but gold is also very soft and malleable. It's a beautiful metal. You can do a lot with it to decorate it, and it's been used in\njewelry throughout history, but we don't generally\nwear just pure gold, because it is too soft. We alloy it with other metals, meaning we melt it down and\nmix it with other metals to make it stronger, and these other metals can\naffect the color of the gold. They can make it greener. They can make it rosier. And if we want it too, they\ncan even make it white. We can alloy it with certain metals that will get it really, very\nclose to the color white. And if it's not close\nenough to the color white, we'll even rhodium plate it. So, we'll put a white metal\ncoating on the outside to make it white, and that is what white gold is. Yellow gold is gold that\nhas been melted down and alloyed with other\nmetals to make it stronger, but it still keeps that yellow color. That is what we call yellow gold. So, that is the difference between yellow gold and white gold. This has been Your Jewelry Minute. If you have a jewelry-related\nquestion for me, just ask me in the comments below. Until next time. (upbeat music)", "YS1JQNHnWrU": "I I wanted to jump to her ears because I thought wow look at these hoop earrings stunning so we're gonna go ahead and give you the presentation now these are amazing I always love to offer hoop earrings in a Jewelry Show and I'll tell you what we've got the granddaddy for you this is one of the largest size hoops we offer in 14-karat gold it's two and a quarter inches if you are a hoop girl you gotta grab these because you know the bigger the better when it comes to hoops for easy payments forty one dollars and 69 cents for these all 14-karat gold hoops first day that we offer it with easy pay and I'm happy to say I can offer you some color choices here in your gold these are big these are sexy these are great I mean long hair fabulous I'm going to throw a pair on of course because I love big hoops to just show you how beautiful they look and look at how they catch the light I absolutely love them to me these are the equivalent of stiletto heels don't you think cuz they're sleek they're long and they just have this big sexy impact love it okay so we're starting off here with our rose gold 14 karat rose gold look at that color that champagne peachy pink blush beautiful there's nothing murky drab brown or rusty about them incredible and again sometimes when that catches the light just right it becomes a flash of lightening even with that rose gold like a lightning on a hot summer day gorgeous then here in the middle I have your 14 karat white gold limited I'm very limited in the Rose limited as well in the white there's not many to go around and then finally here we have it in the 14 karat yellow gold these are big but lightweight because there's not a lot to it you have the size there for your presence for your impact but that sleek design is beautiful now you may be wondering well what's this hanging from it this is a bridge bar and what that does it gives it an added stability so that's simply an arch to give the earring a little bit more durability it makes it easy to get on and off and when you put it on the ear it will disappear see how I just slightly turn this this one right here there you see the arch and now you don't so that's how it's gonna sit on your ear and I'll go ahead and put one on so you can see for you very very clean very modern here it is a little bit close-up it's a snap bar closure so these are for pierced ears only there you have it you just snap that up that stability bar stays there this is where you could press on the earring and you can see I know sometimes Antoinetta does I said she said always tells you to check to see if her fingers get white mine really don't do that but I am pressing on that and that just makes this a little bit stronger for you so wear this with confidence but that just snaps right in so really nice look at that gorgeous look at that shine again hoops classic they never go away always in style always in perfect taste for you maybe you do the best selling the size that everybody likes that classic one-inch and we'll have some of those coming up in the show but for date night for girls night out for the big gala when you're really gonna wear that amazing gown and you just want to throw on a pair of hoop earrings cuz you know you're gonna have on a great necklace as well do I have that snapped and I just wanted there I heard the snap make sure that in that's in this could be that go-to earring look at that gorgeous you know huggy hoops I love this one coming up very very appropriate has its place but Wow for big impact for fun and feeling you know just completely like out of the box maybe you're wearing some leather maybe you're wearing some dennis basso faux fur maybe you're wearing that animal print towards Simonton top just you know you're doing your H by Halston which is a very clean modern line of clothes that we brought here to QVC you want a clean earring to go with it but big impact because you're wearing maybe a really long duster cardigan this would be so fabulous if you work in a very if you work in retail if you work in fashion this would be a perfect work earring I love it great for long hair no brainer but Annie has her hair pulled back in a ponytail and I think wow incredibly perfect for her for short hair as well but just lots of gold they're not heavy so if you have trouble and you kind of annoyed by earrings that pull down on your on your earlobes not the case with these so let me give you an update in the rose gold a few fewer than one dozen remaining in the white gold only two dozen and in the yellow only about 100 remain that is it to go around please if you want this get it now I hate to put out that urgency but these might not be coming back I don't know if they're gonna have a reorder it's a special size you don't see something like this in the jewelry stores if you do it's costume jewelry it's either plated and then your gold rubs off it tarnishes it doesn't have the high shine and the rich look of real gold because those aren't not in this size these are two and a quarter inch something special something fun and it's four easy payments of 41 dollars and 60 cents and hey you get them home try them on and you know what if you don't love it if you don't feel sexy as soon as you put them on you have until the end of January of next year to return them because we have our extended holiday return policy it's item J three to zero four zero one all right so I mentioned I'm going to have some investment pieces in the show for you", "3nTN8R1C_DU": "legacy is jewelry is it not yeah you know which is a wonderful family legacy to grow up and yes it really my love of jewelry came from my grandma Doris she had the longest-running boutique in the Waldorf Astoria in New York City the longest-running jewelry boutique 53 years plus her in any free moment I had that's where I was living I mean that's my whole world was jewelry and then I married into a whole jewelry family generations and generations of jewelers so I mean what a great way to start your finally legacy that's why Stacey is with us with our beautiful gold and I was telling her I'm so predictable but when the buyers say to me do you want to pick something for a gold day it's always a choice of Hoops because Rick Domeier put me on the spot one time and he said why do women like hoops and I'm like and I said well I think because younger women feel more sophisticated in hoops okay and older women feel a little bit younger and hipper in hoops and I said I just made that up on the spur of the moment but I think it's true so good i 100% so what we have now is the Goldilocks the perfect is something for everybody and it's lots of choices so you're gonna choose high polished or twist you can also choose whether you want 14 karat yellow gold or the beautiful white hoops so your sizes are gonna be one inch one and a half inches or two inches and we're gonna play with these there you see in the yellow gold in the high polish we just popped right next to it one of the twists so that you can see again if with this EasyPay oh my gosh I mean the smallest ones are nineteen dollars and eighty three cents a month on easy pay up to the boldest and shipping and handling is free you may want to do your hoop wardrobe today then we go over to the icy white metal more reflective than yellow gold and all the sizes are available you're gonna choose those again in your choice of the high polished or the twist so I think this is a kind of more than one moment I really do yeah I really do let me see what's in your ear and what did you pick so I went for what I call the Goldilocks okay so we have one we have one and a half we have two inches for me I like a little bit of a bolder earring but then or did I two different sometimes I do two different sizes I want to see that do that okay so if you want to go to the biggest and then you also want to see I think I might have the one inch in yep I have the one inch and I have the two inch just so that you can see the difference and wait let's look at beautiful Stacy while I give this in my ear because in the minute I know I am indecisive James yo to me well I go right in the middle right because sometimes I feel I like a little more presence I wanted to do something different I tend towards small I think I'm petite I don't always go for the boldest cuff so that this to me is the perfect hoop because it gives me a lot of presence and I wanted to do it in the classic polished but I love that you did the texture right I mean if you have if you're a hoop collector and you have a lot of that classic look Jane's look with the texture though it's diamond cut extra Sparkle extra shine and that texture just really elevates it well here is our beautiful Monica and she's actually now wearing the only options right Bry in the two inch okay so the two inch is completely sold out in both yellow gold choices in the white we have it three dozen in the Polish and three dozen in the texture or the twisted so what Monica is wearing is the twisted version of the white gold so if you want the big in the bold that's the only one that we have now I'm gonna put the one inch on one side and the one on the half inch on the other because I'm with you Stacy I really love the one and a half inch I really call it the Goldilocks it's not too big it's not too small it's just right and is wearing the one and a half in the smooth yellow gold and all of this is brand-new all of this is a one-day only price item so I mean you're getting beautiful 14 karat gold hoops and you know these are the the hoops that aren't too big in terms of their width so if you want to go bigger in terms of the diameter like in the yellow gold maybe the one and a half it's not what you normally wear but you want to try it and then you put it on easy pay and then Stacy these prices these are going up at the end of the day so this is a don't wait moment I mean we're in the grand finale we only have a few was left and if you want to pick these up on that beautiful one-day only price item do it so I felt Stacy it was gonna do it if you have to decide here's a one inch so I look at this one inch and I think it's kind of like you know go to the office or like do you like to wear turtlenecks you know you don't want a hope to sit on that so those little neck so that's a nice way to go and then there's the one and a half inch which is a little bit sassy and a little bit more heading out because I don't be right and I love them both I'm the worst that this is because I really can appreciate both of them the other one to me like you said it's classic it's almost like tailored it really just you know works I like a little more bolder on you I think it's funky and fun and especially with that texture you get a lot of look right without being too bold and too overpowering and there never ever ever ever going out of style these are timeless classic I mean and comfortable they're made in Italy we don't want them pulling your ear hanging these are weightless to me and just like we said the diameter beautiful it's a little over a sixteenth of an inch so don't be afraid to go a little bolder but maybe you just need those I call them the bedside earrings you know how you'd like you get in bed at night you say oh I still have my favorite bracelet on yes and then I always put it in a little Lord Grenier jewelry box that sits next to my bed so I have to remember to put the right size back on it so if you're somebody that's looking at these earrings and thinking but I want something I'm going to wear every single day I think that one inch and whatever color or texture you choose would be perfect to be that kind of back to school good boring day agree yes or if you're getting it for a gift you know and maybe for a niece or someone who's starting their jewelry collection you want to introduce to it I think that one it is very special it look at that I mean I just think that that gives you so much presents you really can't go wrong you have to think about what look you're going for what's going to work for you but you know you're getting comfortable Italian beautiful gold earrings and I just love that we've given it to you in the polished or the twisted right so here's what we've got for you in the yellow gold we have two sizes now and two choices so we have the smooth that you see on an in the one and the one and a half inch and then we have the twisted that you saw on me and that you saw on Monica in the yellow and the white gold also just in the one and the one and a half the two inch is completely sold out if you want the white that's available in all three sizes but the largest is super limited and you know Stacy is going to be back with me throughout the show but this is the only choice of Hoops we have for the whole night yes is it this is it there's no more hoops and choice of sizes or choice of colors so if you're interested in these don't wait because they're gorgeous they are gorgeous this is I mean easy choice you're looking for hoops here they are all ready for you and then Stacy is gonna be back in just a little bit with this beautiful eternal gold bangle it's the only eternal gold we have in the finale it is your choice of white or yellow gold and the cool thing is is we also have your choice of patterns in that gold so if you're somebody that's saying you know I want high polished or I want that beautiful stark cut or I want a different texture guess what again we got it sale price 298 to 339 for an eternal gold bangle and I couldn't decide so I went for all four yes arm load of bangles Jack Mosley is here we'll try not to get into too much trouble which is always difficult when we're", "czp7RjTYDKY": "earrings that are the love not love nots I don't know if you know much about love knots but they have a lot of different kind of stories behind them but for me being Swedish and Norwegian the love knots are used at weddings for the big no beginning no end you can't tell where it starts you can't tell where it ends so this to me takes me back to my heritage you'll have your choice of 14-karat white gold or we have the 14 karat yellow gold or we also offer you the 14 karat rose gold they're just a beautiful stud earring that is more than you know larger than like a single little diamond Ecore diamond earring would be but it doesn't dangle it actually stays right in place I want to show this to the from the side so you see the dimension as well it's like two beautiful loops of gold kind of keep wrapping and wrapping so it wraps around and creates this love knot there is a post in the back with a butterfly backing to it and then it is also as you see customer top-rated when it's customer top-rated that's always a good sign and so if you want to get these another great gift idea how about for payments of $18.45 of an inch wide so more than a quarter of an inch and they really are pretty if you have people getting married or bridesmaids or anything like that and you would love to give them something that's going to less than a lifetime unlike the dress that you have made them by but last them a lifetime just ask them what color of metal do you like do you like yellow white rose etc and then for you to be able to give them 14 care golde that's pretty incredible they would not expect that because you go out and try to buy 14-karat gold and it's expensive it's I just saw the other day it's around $1200 an ounce in gold so it's still up there at a higher price when I first started in this business gold was trading at like $300 I might not have even been quite $300 an ounce it's $1200 now so you really have some great value in these and take a look what people are writing these are a good size well-constructed and comfortable I love to wear these as a basic everyday earring I think especially for summertime that's so true these love knot earrings just arrived and they are absolutely perfect my husband bought them for me for Valentine's Day and I adore them especially with the love knot I love you I love you and I don't even remember when I started to love you I will never stop loving you it's always constant this one said these are just what I was looking for excellent price terrific quality the knot shape is a classic style and it really truly is it's tying the knot you know we always say when you're going to get married you tie the knot and we always say tie it tight so it doesn't come apart right so you're tying it tight with this this would be a wonderful gift for Mother's Day but also for an anniversary to say honey I love you and I'm tying that night knot tighter than ever before we mark and I just had our 34th wedding anniversary and to this day I'm like how in the world did we get here that is a long time and yet I still look forward to the next 34 years I really do and so it's nice to have something that maybe this is that just maybe it's two sisters and you get each a pair for yourselves or you give you know buy a pair for yourself and buy a pair for your sister and that ties the two of you together maybe it's for best friends if you would want to tie yourselves together I just think these can be really special earrings being love nuts and when we bring you 14 karat gold we bring you high-quality 14 karat gold we use some of the same manufacturers we have used for 25 to 30 years coming out of Italy and Turkey and Israel and the United States and Germany all these and Peru all these different places that make gold jewelry we go and find the very best manufacturer so when you saw those customer top-rated reviews and they're saying they're well-constructed they're high-quality but they're just the right size you know they really are take a look at them once again on Katia and how pretty they are and don't forget you have white gold here 14 karat white gold 14 karat yellow gold 14 karat rose gold your choice if we can go in a little closer I want to show you that it doesn't cover the entire earlobe but at the same time if you had a stone that size it would seem like it was maybe not the real thing so now when you have 14 karat gold covering that size it's dimensional it's beautiful it just has a richness and a smoothness to it that I think you'll really appreciate when you see it in person all right if you want that $18 a month with your credit card go ahead and give us a call we'd love to be able to get those out to you quickly by the way Oh still to come and I'm going to keep those earrings for a moment this is a beautiful necklace coming up it is the 14 karat gold 18 inch textured circle necklace a fun necklace easy pay and all and you get that opportunity to have something that has a little texture to it but at the same time is going to give you a lot of eyeballs looking at you I like that no not always if my hair and makeup is done that I don't mind oh by the way", "9lypzgBkWBI": "earrings all right actually own these earrings they're customer top-rated I love them you love them yay over on five easy monthly payments of $14 and 40 cents they are the love knot studs so you get more bang for your buck right than just a traditional ball stud earring $72 is the feature price what I love that we're taking these into because remember all the gold right now is on four or more easy monthly payments and that goes for the more affordable pieces too so we get to do this at a 14 dollar easy pay your choice of three colors of gold here it is in rose this is the most limited usually that's the case when we talk about rose gold it's often the one that we have the least in and it's also rare to find . like sometimes we'll do white and yellow but rose we don't see as often and i love our rose gold i'll explain why in a moment so there it is in the rose here's the white actually i could say the same for white how much i love our white gold why because it's actually white like it's BETT bright icy clean not gray or murky or dull white gold in that love knot design now here are the ones that I own because for me it was kind of a no-brainer to at least start here and I wear them all the time I mean almost embarrassingly so because I'm just like item2 I'm rushed I'll grab these I'll grab these because they're elegant but they're also easy they're going to go with whatever it is that I'm wearing so if we stay there for a second we give you a little bit of a measure because from top to bottom they're just a quarter of an inch almost like your traditional ball stud earring the WoW really is in the dimension the WoW is in the design so you take these two tubing bands of gold and you knot them together and they'll always and forever stay that way by doing so you create not just lift and dimension you get more visual Wow will see them on uni in a second as opposed to a ball stud which I also own and default too frequently as well but you get more energy you get more mystique you get it's something different right we can talk about what the love knot signifies or item it's right there in the name and it's that whole concept of eternal love infinity energy that cannot be created or destroyed there's a romantic story to it yellow is to no one surprise I'm sure the most popular choice right now but in general this is popular right out the gate it really is every time we present it but now that we've got five easy monthly payments holy cow it's kind of that grab and go don't even think about it situation even for those of you who generally don't do a lot of jewelry because you know I'm going to do the twist hoops later you know I've got some more statement pieces but if you go can't you know what times I just wear earrings cuz I feel like I need to go ahead but do something that's different and unique and fresh and jewelry that is customer top-rated I always make a big deal out of that because jewelry is tricky everybody has different tastes different aesthetic but this please is just about everybody not just from a value standpoint but from a beauty standpoint as well so I'm going to grab the yellow out of here - I know we're touring around but and we only have like a minute but I just want to show it to you like up and down so here we go you see how it actually has that ball stud it has that dimension and that cushion like design but it's also very strong here's that little pinch test that we talked about right post and clutch design and there's that beauty I don't know something very feminine about that really really pretty and like I said it's just your grab and go oh by the way if you're shopping for graduation gifts come on you know she wants jewelry especially if she's going out job hunting soon this is something I don't know very elegant very mature but not stuffy right and beautiful even without the presence of gemstones so there it is in your rows 130 remaining in the rows about the same amount there in the white and remember the yellow is the most popular I mean again in gold I say this infrequently but with a $14 easy pay maybe you go wow look how yellow and warm that gold is but with easy pay going away at the end of the day maybe you go I mean I can always use the white gold right because I wear a lot of silver too so maybe you take advantage of the easy pay turn that into less than what $29 a month and pick up a couple of sets or pick up one for you and one is a gift as well knowing that it has the backing of that customer top rating I think is a huge advantage knowing that you have the 30 days to try it out and it only cost you 1440 to get those 30 days is a great way to dive in to 14 karat gold at QVC but remember your easy pay will vanish in just a few hours rose white limited yellow most popular here's your item number J 3 3 4 5 4 2 so we have 2 hours together in our second hour you will see my pick of the show I'm wearing it now there's actually a running joke around the building about how long jen COFF you can talk about a shimmer rope necklace and I get another chance today this is the rope chain necklace diamond cut gives it that sparkle it comes in 16 inch 18 inch 20 24 30 and the always popular 36 inch on 6 easy pace but we are at last call already huh on the 20th does somebody else get to present this earlier J 5 5 5 8 1 is my pick of the show and it's coming up shortly I'll get the gram weights to when it's time to show always a time for the tap fine I told you it was coming up early okay here we go from Italy sometimes you'll hear reference as Potenza gold here we just make it really easy for you understand it's Italian gold it's from", "479DGKuv5nA": "[Music] hello friends
