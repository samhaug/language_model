{"n1peqoYmihg": "good morning everyone today i have a plant profile for you and we're actually over here in the chicken run portion of the food forest if you've been following along you may recall when i planted this grapevine here which had a lot of growth this year it did tremendous for us produced some nice large clusters of grapes we were quite impressed with this [Music] variety [Music] and i really just wanted to shine a spotlight on it because i had never heard of it until a couple years ago when i picked one up at my local nursery and this variety is called ruby seedless grape it's a table grape highly productive heavy fruit sets and so the way that i've been growing these for the last couple years is i planted them on either side of this section of carport here which i turned into part of my chicken coop so i just got a tarp shading the area and we've got the actual coop and the nesting boxes right back there in the corner but on each post here we put one of these ruby seedless now you only need one it's a self-fruitful plant another benefit to this variety and if you aren't aware grapes are one of the easiest things in the world to propagate when they do go dormant they're deciduous they lose all their leaves and you're left with some wood that looks like this so to propagate all you're going to do is take some of that dormant wood and you want it if you can to get it at about the diameter of a pencil so not too thick not too thin and if you can take an entire vine off about six feet in length or longer that's going to be best then all you're going to do is go around starting from the base of that cutting and you're going to take several cuttings making sure that each one has four of these nodes it can be helpful too to make a diagonal cut on the top of all your cuttings so you can distinguish what's the top from the bottom if you put this in inverted it's not going to grow so flat cuts on the bottom and diagonal cuts on top now this wood is old it's a bit crispy you don't want to do this with old dormant wood you want to do this with wood that has recently lost its leaves and it's still fresh when you prune it you don't want to wait and let it dry out like this but a one to two year old plant you could get dozens and dozens of cuttings like this then what you want to do is get yourself a larger pot like a five gallon pot is good something that's deep enough to facilitate this cutting going down three nodes deep and you can take the bottom of that cutting dipping in some sort of a rooting hormone to help it to root that's gonna really help to increase your odds of success and then before you stick the cutting with the rooting hormone in go ahead and make a hole that way you're not rubbing all that hormone off and stick it down again three nodes deep cover it up and you can put several cuttings in a larger pot like this and separate them later once you start to get some new growth and you've got some root development you can separate those out make multiple plants so you can see a vine like this one could be a prime candidate for propagation but it's not dormant yet so we're going to wait till later in the season once you've got those cuttings stuck just make sure you keep the soil moist now prior to growing the ruby we had another popular variety the red flame seedless it's another table grape and we've always been happy with that as well you can see we got some nice mature red flame varieties back here there's two vines growing on this trellis and we got a nice little harvest again this year but they are a much smaller grape [Music] we leave some of these little grapes just dangling for the birds and you can see how some of these here are turning into raisins right on the vine that's another use for these grapes you can dry them out turn them into raisins [Music] [Music] do [Music] so the ruby variety of table grape will grow in usda climate zones seven through nine without any issues it does like some summer heat and prefers full sun to part sun this area actually gets a decent amount of shade later in the day and these vines have done well for us so far but you can see i'm growing these all along the frame of the car canopy but grapes are very versatile and they're fun to grow ornamental you can grow them up a wall an arbor some posts any type of trellis just be creative they can also create a nice privacy screen and shade throughout the summer months they are deciduous they will lose their leaves in the winter time some other tips would be to start out with some good soil when you're planting something that drains well has some nutrients in there and also keep these watered throughout the summer months you're going to have a higher productivity if you do so if you enjoyed today's video do me a favor just quickly hit that like button if you haven't already consider subscribing to the channel we're going to be doing more plant profile videos just like this showcasing some of the different plants that have the highest production out here in the plant abundance backyard food forest we're year nine for those of you new to the channel we started with a typical backyard lawn a lot of debris a lot of weeds nothing growing that was edible and we've turned it into our own little backyard paradise just full of edible crops and you can do the same thing it's really quite easy if you want to learn more about that get inspired then stay tuned we've got plenty more to come", "kqzagRlI5Ws": "We are going to be teaching you how to make blessed grapes for times when you may not have enough food. This is a gift given to us through Catholic mystics, including Luz de Maria de Bonilla. First, you're going to wash the grapes to make sure they're clean. Then you're going to want to cut the grape sand make sure there's a stem remaining. Then put it in the bowl and repeat. One grape is going to be chosen to be blessed by a priest and used to bless all the other grapes. We're going to call this the mother grape. You're going to want to take the mother grape and the grape that is inside the bowl with stem and bless it. Make the sign of the cross and say these words, \"In the name of Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, and then take this grape and put it in there and repeat. Then you're going to want to take a grape that you blessed and count, \"One. . .\" Once you've filled up the jar of grapes, then you make a note and write how many and the date. Now you're going to want to take the brandy and fill it up to the top, That's good. One half of one of these blessed grapes will last you an entire day. God bless you.  ", "WRnjvY31aUw": "[Applause] all right good afternoon everybody so today I'm going to do a little video on on grapes and the problems with grapes because grapes are one of those plants where if you want good grapes you have to be really really into grapes like they're not just one of those plants that's just like a byproduct of your food forests and they'll kind of just do their own thing the grapes have a lot of issues and in fact last last year this year I was going to give up on grapes completely because of the issues with them but I decided to leave these more or less than in the in the back just so I'd have them as part of my part of my test card and so I left all these grapes this year but I do want to talk about these because I've seen a lot of great plants in the valley lately and they just don't look that great because of like I said the issues with them so I'll go over a few things with the grapes so first of all everything wants to eat your grapes everything wants to eat your grapes and everything wants to kill your grape plants okay so that includes birds so of course if you get grapes make sure you get at least two colored grapes get a green grape light skinned grape and get a dark green because that way at least you'll get all the all the green grapes because the birds are always waiting for those to turn dark like the other ones and they don't turn because they're green so you'll get all of those grapes whereas you might not get very many of the of the purple ones or the red ones the key also the key is to just have so many just like anything else that it really doesn't matter if the birds eat what they want I mean there's probably there has to be probably 500 clusters of grapes on these vines I mean because they're just every everywhere everywhere you look they're hiding and so you know the guest house is just full of them barn just completely everywhere you can look there's grapes so the birds love them but if you have so many of them just like everything else you'll get a really good harvest of grapes we are never going to get the size grapes that you see commercially unless you spray them with hormones or you thin them then the bunches there's a couple of ways to thin these you can either thin the clusters like take off some of the actual whole clusters or you can trim the the actual cluster itself and take off half of them and leave the top half which are usually the bigger ones anyway and just reduce the actual size of the cluster these are already starting to turn but I just I don't have time to do either one of those things so I just leave them and let them do their own thing and then just come out here and and eat what I eat what I want off of them okay so birds birds are after them insects of all kinds so you've got the leaf skeleton Iser which is a little black moth it's about an inch long and it lays eggs on the underside of the leaf and then a whole bunch of little caterpillars hatch out and they start to eat their way across that leaf like an army they kind of move like an army and they skeletonize the the leaf so basically you can hold it up to the light it looks like a piece of lace and then they just move on to the next leaf and move on to the next leaf and they really don't do a whole lot of damage because they only eat about 9 leaves and when you have per army but then of course that army all becomes more moths and then they go eat more and more and more so the problem is when they become an infestation obviously it's not just a couple of them now what I do find as an infestation which is something that probably most of you have is these is the leaf hoppers the grape leaf hoppers and what those do is those just suck the life out of the leaves so let me see if I can find a good example of one because I'm sure well I'll go to the front here in a little bit this leaf like has a little bit of it do you see that kind of like little whitish sunken areas and there'll be kind of little specks of black sometimes well that's from them those things live on the bottom of the leaf and they suck the the leaves dry basically so they kill the leaf and just make it look horrible and mangled see this is kind of one that's kind of medium ly affected I mean I don't get them too bad they're they're really small there's one right there real tiny little guys and they're on the bottom of the see it there that is a grape leaf hopper and they do a lot of damage they can kill the plant or knock it back so far that you don't get good grapes because your leaves are your solar panels on your grapes and if they're being sucked dry then they can't do what they're supposed to do and so you're not going to get good grapes so yeah they become an infestation in my opinion it's not so much the skeleton either so you got those two that are after the leaves which are after your solar panels basically and if you don't lock those back then you're not going to get good grapes thinning and then of course water like that's what grapes are they're pretty much 99% water so if you want bigger inflated grapes then if the pump extra water to these and with all these clusters that are around here like I'm surprised any of these who there's to come here I'm surprised that any of these are even as big as they are so you see with so many of these clusters if you guys have left less that's good clusters then your guys's grapes should be much bigger than all these anyway this is just two plants these two vines that up oh whoa persimmon whoo-hoo persimmon it's cool you like you don't really notice everything till you walk through a couple times and then you're always noticing new new things in the yard okay where was I grapes Oh mangos whoa guys getting good so yeah all those things you have to do to those guys and then I don't I there a full Sun plant like if you expect any kind of production off of grapes the majority of the plant has to be in the full Sun now the way I have these planted is the two grape plants themselves are down over here in the shade because this used to be different and I didn't have that shade screen up and so they were in the full Sun and so the this plant is attached to this pole and then it vines out out into the Sun please see all of it and then the other one is actually over here on this pole and so it goes up up some pretty gnarly vines it goes up and that one goes up over the guest house and does all the vines that are up above us me Wow look at all those grapes and then it just vines out here into the Sun so it's taking all that solar power in even though it's in the shade so that is a little video there on grapes you guys have any questions post them in the comments below thanks for watching", "71dMd71p0ag": "[Music] hi welcome back to another episode of grapefruit presents i'm cyrus and i'm dino and today we're going to try food from wow so what are we having today okay today obviously we're going to have nasi lemakos so what's google's like i've heard of normal nasi lemak but glucose means steamed so traditionally it's cooked in a rice cooker however for this one it's cooked in a steamer so that the rice will taste more softer this fragrant yeah then the next one we have is the champagne gouren looks good this smells a bit oh you have to try it make sure yeah it's good so for those who don't know what champa da is tripura is something like a jackfruit but smaller can't wait to dig in okay let's try let's start off with the maze [Music] all right it's actually fluffier yeah because if you cook the rice in the rice because it tends to overcook and become very dry i know i say like chili but i'm gonna try this the main stuff all nasi lemak is the sambal it's actually not that spicy i can take it it's pretty sweet not as salty as the previous videos some about 10 out of 10 again for nfl it's not really spicy but more on the sweeter side thank you for me is that a glam way to eat chicken however you want it obviously not posture so i'm using this plastic cutlery yeah that's how you eat i feel like with your fingers [Music] i've tasted better chicken there isn't enough taste in this i feel okay next we shall try the [Music] product so should i go for a big piece of smoke do you like it big uh i don't know [Music] if you haven't tried it before try the big piece i'll trust you it's like a one-time thing i don't have a bike one time that's cool just be careful there's some seats inside so yeah three two one just swallow it one eternity later i did it guys congrats congrats yeah what do you think of it that's pretty good it's like sweet enough but not too sweet it like overpowers like everything there's enough flavor in the batter the fruit itself it actually has sugar into the batter i know it's fit because of the jupiter itself yeah but for me because i i do love eating this but i prefer it to be crisp there for our food our production team actually got got it like an hour before i guess it's like going to be something in a way but yeah after a while it gets stiff not really still but it's soggy yeah yeah yeah okay so we have tried the food what do you think and how would you rate it i think that the last amount glucose yes it was really like what you said it was fluffier lighter and yeah the sample is really great too yesterday yeah the chicken okay so what we think would you give a five two and a half to three grapes out of five well for me i would actually rate it a three right yeah three because the rice is amazing the summer is amazing just the chicken is just it's a downside yeah if it's crispier and more seasoned it'll be perfect so the next one is the chocolate itself what do you think i would say a four and a half very high rating but i really enjoy this even though i said the smell is a bit iffy but it actually tastes really really great it's really sweet and yeah like what i mentioned before the better just good stuff for me i'll retail 4.5 as well if it's crispy and hot it'll be five percent yes that's very true we've come to end of another episode and i do hope you enjoyed this video if you have any suggestion of what food we should try next do write it down in the comments below don't forget to like share and subscribe the details for all these food you can find down in the description box below thank you thank you see you next time for more food", "RzuVkrz3Yvs": "to help cover the costs of these venues and to bring excellent progression and speakers to you all so if we can and that is nothing that's totally okay to last note is that this is an opportunity to gain knowledge and learns but not to source hear me know hmm so it's a great way to enter spring with this cactus because this is a cactus of transformation just as spring in air is a great time of transformation my name is Teresa Ulrich and I discovered San Pedro around 1996 I was living in California and it was after doing peyote with some friends I became very curious about this medicine and started researching it and came across San Pedro so I ended up at a cacti nursery being a young girl in a cactus nursery I'm sure the guy who cultivates questioned what I was purchasing but yeah I purchased two beautiful San Pedro plants and brought them home and just for the novelty of having the plant is magical just having it in your home is magical it wasn't until 2002 when I was going through our time that I consumed it I've read books about it you know but people only got us to a certain level of energetically to the goal they reached so all the reports are that it was really weak or I had just a few visions but I wasn't there and the reason why is because you have to eat a lot of cactus to get to the level for the full journey essentially so a foot long piece so I was jobless I you know it was after 9/11 I was researching medicinal plants looking you know because I'm just drawn to plants and one day a friend and I ordered some cuttings that I thought I would continue planting and I just had a really bad day and I decided you know f it I'm gonna eat this thing and I cut it up I ate like a foot and a half of a 4-inch cactus because I was like I'm gonna if you know if it doesn't happen then it's false I ended up tripping for 15 hours but what I came out of it it was like such a lightness such a loss of worries and I felt renewed that I could like start seeking you know I made space that oh I need to start a new career I need to find a new a new a new skill where am I to go on what direction in this plant opened up space for me so Aldous Huxley there's a really good interesting so in the English novelist Aldous Huxley was given mescaline by the English physician dr. Humphrey Osmond in 1953 he said that it allowed man access to mystical states by overriding the brains reducing valve actually was a proponent of the ideas of the French philosopher Henri Bergson who had in the previous century suppose that the brain acted as a filter of memory and sensory experience so that our conscious awareness wasn't overwhelmed with a massive largely useless information a revelant to the survival the organism so they're sitting that there may be a filter in us or else it would be overwhelming so then Burson suggested that if these filters were bypassed man would be capable of remembering everything he had ever experienced and of perceiving everything that is happening everywhere in the universe which would equal clairvoyance so Huxley then applied this theory to mescaline and other similar substances we she and Osman called psychedelic meaning mind manifesting and suggested that they override the reducing valve of the brain by passing the filters that stop us from potentially and perceiving everything there's a quote by William Blake if the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is infinite after a reported this study in 1953 peyote was put on Schedule one and made it legal today's presentation we all go over legality quick tips on the cactus we'll go over history how to grow how to prep and extract mescaline how to micro dose we'll talk a little bit about medications and how it affects and conflicts with other medications ceremony and journeying will be the finale and then we'll listen to the song of they watch um uh cacti well I take questions so legality federal and state laws outlaw the possession of mescaline and peyote this means that they are on a schedule 1 controlled substance act meaning that just about any act involving them can lead to prison time the only exception our indigenous people of the Native American church it used to be that Native Americans had to be signed up with the Native American church in order to take in the mescaline plants but in 1994 they expanded it to reach out to all native blood people so they don't have to be part of the Native American church so non-native of religious peyote users have approached the government asking if they can also have an exemption but they've been denied but there are four states so state laws allow in Arizona Colorado New Mexico and Oregon allow the religious practice and use of these plants San Pedro and peyote the only exception is that you have to be in a very safe place they expect you to be very responsible not to have anybody in your environment that you can harm and even though these states they may be illegal there is a case that a cactus nursery owner was raided by the police and only you'll stay and all his cacti were destroyed they found him because he was advertising on drug sites so it's very important to be very careful and responsible because we don't want to cause any more laws to prevent us from even growing it so there are over 20 species of cacti I have mescaline and about 79 individual plants and okay so you can grow it you can own it that's legal it's just when you extract it that it becomes illegal so anyone who harvest their cacti for ingestion is moving from one side of the legal line to the other and so if you're prepping capsules teas dried powder don't prep too much in advance just in case so always keep be discreet and keep it small no San Pedro rows at a very high altitude up to 9,000 feet so it's native to the Andes Mountains 9,000 feet so it's really susceptible I mean it's not such that all cold and frost can handle it it's found also in Argentina Bolivia Chile Ecuador Peru and also cultivated in my greenhouse down the street the species so it displays a light dark green stem as Chiefs like a diameter two and a half inches my green outside these ones are pretty small about two and half inches up to six inches when they're in a sunny environment and dry the the aerials are the bumps where the spines come out and it grows up to 20 feet but the tallest on record is 40 feet tall it grows fast really grow a fast-growing plant and its most popular for its psychoactive properties the alkaloids in the plant most well-known are mescaline and the alkaloids that are in here are the three four five trip methoxy Feeny beneath Allah means it's a psychedelic aqua alkaloid that belongs to the Finnish looming class so there the effects are compared to psilocybin in LSD what's interesting is that these psychedelic properties of mescaline are related to its structural similarities with the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin in the brain so the molecule works in a similar way to other psychedelic compounds by activating that serotonin 5 h28 receptor now it's not always been called san pedro the indigenous names were Jumma chumma watch Yuma and watch Amon it carries a very masculine energy but the soft masculine energy that's why it's called the grandfather medicine sitting with this cactus is like sitting with a grandfather who has infinite love and compassion could see all your all your traits that are beautiful and wonderful and wants to show you a direction and how to use them so we call it grandfather medicine in comparison ayahuasca is grandmother medicine grandmother moon so I would say grandmother medicine is like tough love and she teaches you to face your fears and it's really good to work with grandmother she'll make you eat your broccoli if you don't like it and you know just push through it and then several retreats to ayahuasca ceremonies followed by San Pedro as part of the end of the ceremony to integrate everything you've learned with ayahuasca this is a glyph it's a very popular glyph and there's a piece of art somebody replicated it in this is this is a lot of animal symbolism here we have serpents for fertility and water and vitality the Condor on his as a feminine energy and teaches us to fly above our trials and tribulations picture of things then the Puma the Puma coat this is a shadow animal it's a medicine that teaches you to walk into your fears to face the unknown and to do with grace this is a replica of what used to be a temple in Peru called in the chopping Valley ravine Dave want are so it lasted roughly from 1200 BCE to 500 BC and this is around the same time as the Olmecs these were our ancestors that came before the Aztecs and the Incas they lived in my Andes and in the foothills and they tended to fish out in the seas they they sourced shells and a lot of sea life for their food versus our major river valley so as you can see there's super high coastal mountains and those are the Andes another model and replica so there's a temple here a sunken Plaza we have an old temple in a new temple people from villages from miles and miles would come to the chopping temple and trade and sell and sit and religious rituals it was spawned by San Pedro or what Juma so they say it may have been actually inspired the complex civilization to develop in the first place how San Pedro was discovered and for its effects I don't know and I haven't found anyone who knows yeah I just assumed that somebody was hungry and then they were thirsty and they had a lot of practice and then there was an awakening so the so watchman may have been actually inspired it actually may have inspired this complex civilization to develop in the first place how do we bring people together at the heart of the entire societies religious and political organization was an elaborate question my ritual which was performed at the main temple and there's only one of these heads this is a a puma head the Jaguar medicine that they used to have tons of animal Jaguar heads along the walls and the me is they built the tunnels under the ground and throughout the temples and would take their visitors in the dark through a maze while they're on some of the wat u-mong and they would blow poo to boost gel shells I believe they're called they blew these shells and then there was water rivers of water running through these walls so you'd have this incredible sensory experience face your fears purchase participants under the influence spent hours wandering the stark maze what's interesting about notice any signs of smoke in these mazes so it's kind of assumed that people were high and they had their night vision on to walk these mesas so until they rounded a corner and saw the sun shining through one hole in the roof and onto a 15-foot high monolith called the Ln song these mazes were the inspiration for Indiana Jones Temple of Doom so simultaneously pointing up and down in the classic as above so below so this is a 15-foot monolith and it must have been stunning after being in the dark for so long and it represents the merging of heaven and earth and seeing it was the culmination of the psychedelic watching machine right it served to instill in people a fearlessness of death as they realized they were immortal souls in a mortal ball in mortal bodies which is the essence of San Pedro this is the land zone and it's like a serpent covered God that they sculptured out but they were hoping to open up a common high inhabitant to a sacred worldview that served to hold together their society so this was a community they built together and the priest that ran the temple there was no hierarchy they would pick San Pedro and they knew what their duties there was no war they knew what they had to contribute to keep the community all together so after the Spanish conquest indigenous people were still taking San Pedro mm-hmm and the missionaries and the priests weren't too happy and but the indigenous people wanted to keep taking it so they're like well but when we take this we meet st. Peter it opens the gates of heaven he holds the keys to heaven missionaries are like what are you talking about so they leaving the missionaries tried and they're like oh if they're right this is like heaven on earth this is st. Peter and that's how the name San Pedro came about oh yeah and they gradually accepted so the missionary started studying the medicine - and they said that you know the juice is good against burning the kidneys and in small amounts is also good against high fever hepatitis and Bernie in the bladder I'm going to go over three major cacti varieties within the Trico serious group trucko series pack annoy is the most popular and those are the darker green ones here and it's the most common the most available and it grows fast up to one foot a year if it's in a sunny dry environment in my greenhouse it grows about 4 to 5 inches a year when I keep 10 hours of light on it it has 60 ribs but some have had even up to 10 the mescaline content is around 0.32 1.2 percent but for easier memory remembrance if you have powder just assume there's 1% mescaline within the powder by weight because if you start to weigh cactus depends don't want any water at how heavy or how light it will be so for a full journey a 4 inch diameter at 12 inches long provides enough masculine but make sure it's healthy in green I've had some that are a bit yellow or lime green and don't get the same effect try Coast areas prove Yanis is the blue torch these the fatter ones and they got the blue here at you on top and these are cool they're a little more rare and they have a little more mescaline they've also been known to the rumor is that it's good to do more shadow work with these when you're willing to face more of your fears and I haven't tried these yet but maybe next year so mescaline concentrations can vary even with specimens of the same species factors which can affect the mescaline content include the temperature and water availability studies have reported dried Peruvian torch cactus contains approximately 2.4 percent mescaline so it's about two or two-and-a-half times more than the Trico syria's pack annoying and then there's Trico serious pre Jessie this one is really rare also and this one you know I'm still new to it sort of them but the worst I can they get access to you and I thought I bought some here I'm looking online photos they don't look like that but they do tend to have long spikes they can they're the tallest actually they grow up to 52 feet in height and they're their natural environment two and two and a half inch long spines they hold in between the amount of the Trico series pack enoy and the blue torch mmm let me ask whoever tried Sampedro before do you raise your hands alright so how to grow this it's great this is a legal plant to grow and it's easy I just buy cactus oil from Portland nursery and make sure it's aerated there is a cactus soil out there there's quite a dense but you want to make sure there's you know a nice amount of perlite in there so one part pea gravel on part pearlite one part peat moss and and the key is not too much nitrogen Sun so I have several cacti in the summer they've burned if they get direct Sun they do this they get they soften and they create a scab over their edge and the best thing to prevent this is a screen just like gives some shade to it but as well as you did like half sunlight coming cuttings cuttings are the easiest way to cultivate and propagate the cacti make a cut at an aerial so find a spine maybe if you can find a couple of those that you cut along and cut it in angle so the water runs off of it because if it's flat and you water it that top surface will start to mold they have very shallow roots they grow a bit widespread but very shallow so you want to be able to plant your cactus about at least 2 inches down into the potting soil when you cut your cactus lay it out dip it in some rooting powder right away and let it dry out for three days to a week and then put it in soil so what we're trying to do is allow the end to dry to cauterize all that rooting hormone powder goes in there and encourages root growth once you plant it in the soil so yeah three days to one week let it call us up I've had some I had two weeks and they started to get really squishy so definitely squish if they didn't squish you too soon you know make sure you plant them a little bit earlier again two inches deep in a pot and the pot doesn't have to be that big pots up here they're not huge and they get some really amazing growth out of them also you don't want to have a big pot where you overwater it and the cactus keeps drinking the water and and get some rot and over watering grafting is fun this is um this in San Pedro with peyote grafted on top of it so a lot of people there's tons of this out there San Pedro supposed to be a really good mother planted for grafting that you can grab several different varieties of cactus partner I've done it once I've been able to graft a one successfully just making a cut putting it right on the center in the core and using toothpicks to hold it together popping is the natural way to grow new San Pedro branches so like right now my greenhouse my cacti are dormant they're not growing very much if I almost wanted to buy some new cuttings for this presentation but because it's till the end of winter early spring I'm worried that it won't root very well when I plan to it'll just get wet and moist because I have not made much success in the winter so I'm saving it up for spring and summer plantings I do poke for pupping I do poke holes in the aerials and I'm hoping the spring I'll see some new growth and had happened and was really helpful last year because I wasn't getting any pupping new growth so I found out it was a little you know end of a thermometer just poked some holes in there and so yeah I'll wait and see you hopefully I'll have several more little baby pups but they're really exciting you see a little baby the flower is amazing so it's a huge flower it's really unexpected to see such a beautiful flower in this plant when I was doing full journey once before I even knew what the flower looked like I had I saw visions and then later that week I saw the flower for the first time online and wow that's cool it's just a gorgeous flower I'm like of course why of course so the flowers they put out white flowers and they bloom at night so what the flowers are about 7 1/2 inches in length and 4 4 inches in diameter they come out at night once fertilized and they produce fruits which are about 2 inches long it's a self sterile species which means it needs another pollen donor like bees or you know hand pollination so they bloom near summer time and apparently they smell really good someday I'll be able to get out there to smell a live one but together they're supposed to have a really beautiful aromatic quality and these are the fruits if you're ever lucky to get a cactus that fruits this is how it looks and once it pops if you're collecting seeds for growing new cacti do it immediately because at this point the seeds can be affected by a fungus or other diseases that are introduced by pests so find a reputable source for seedlings that the seeds must be hand pollinated seeds yeah again like I just repeated it was pets can introduce fungus can introduce disease and you might buy seeds and maybe only a few will sprout so there are a lot of seed providers that do all their pollination by hand and you can have a successful sprouting and this is you know it just needs a lot of humanity some people sprout and sandwich bags and it's only the biggest issue is fungicide so you got to have a fungicide for the first four months because they're so susceptible to the fungus if you're concerned about ingesting the cactus with the fungus just wait a month don't apply the fungus and the plant will absorb it and release it for seed soil one third fine washed silica sand and that's similar to beach sand one third screened peat and one third perlite mixed that together in small pots three and a half by four inches leave about half an inch of space at the top and then the soil will be a natural food provider so you don't need to add more food at this point so the soil will provide food for the first four to five months then the seeds can be sown year round so you want to add a little bit of sand on the top of the seedlings just a light dosing of the sand then set it in a bowl of really shallow room-temperature water the important part is keeping it warm really warm I need to grease by day and sixty degrees at night and it needs lots of light sixteen to eighteen hours then maintain the humidity at sixty to ninety percent so that's why you can use a terrarium perforated sandwich bags are popular for small growth misting is needed and after three to ten days they will germinate it says to grow this like about for about six months you know you want those roots to develop and it become hearty then you can adjust the environment by making it brighter and hotter and dryer watering can be tricky it's not too labor-intensive which is nice so I choose like I do have some plastic pots here but I preferred the terra cotta pots or a clay pot because you want to water it you want it to dry up pretty fairly quickly and not sit in the water for too long so it shouldn't be allowed to rest for in water the pot should be it should not be allowed to rest in water for too long I water mine once a month in the summer months if there's a huge heat wave I had water twice a month you know you're over watering when they start to puff up the spines you don't see as many spines they kind of swell and they get a bit squishy and then you know okay I had to pull back on this watering so feed your San Pedro cactus and all-purpose cactus fertilizer monthly I do that I like cactus juice from Portland nursery and always make sure the soil is completely dry before you water again again temperature they grow at 9,000 feet they're really frost Hardy to deal with cold weather very well ideally this ideal to keep it warm above 50 degrees next we will go into preparing and extracting I've tried several methods just so I'm curious curious and I have to try different methods that I hear about but first we'll talk about dosage now if you will get to micro dosing after this if you want to go on a full journey this is a good chart to get you on how much how many milligrams you would want so a low dose is 100 to 200 milligrams which is a mild buzz it's a good trip moderate dose 200 and 300 milligrams of mescaline high dose 300 to 500 milligrams and that's intense visuals and ego disassociation an extreme dose 500 to 800 milligrams of mescaline it says only for experienced people do you want to go there so work your way up here we go the trek Oh series pack annoy the 300 milligram dose of masculine contain is contained in 100 grams of the dry material so 300 milligrams of mescaline is contained in 100 grams of dry try Co serious pack annoying the the blue tours The Pianist 300 milligrams of mescaline is contained in 37 point 5 grams of dry material that's 300 milligrams of mescaline is contained in 37 point 5 grams of the dry blue torch and the bridge I see I'm like that's still vague it's somewhere in between the above and as a comparison the peyote contains 300 milligrams of mescaline in 27 grams of dry material now some people say the ribs have an effect on your journey the number of ribs can affect the experience I've normally do 6 pointed stars and this is for balancing the masculine and feminine energy within it's good medicine to find equilibrium which I find youbut true and it's it says I am a divine expression of unity I am whole which I agree with I've always had that experience the seven pointed star is supposed to be a little bit a little better I've only had one cactus size 7 pointed it's a good all-around medicine it connects people's hearts on a deep level and brings joy into their lives and this is wonderful for healing emotional wounds the eight pointed star is more balanced than other cacti it's a mellow journey connecting the mind with the physical body the most contemplative of the stars it's unstoppable strong and single-minded like a plow through the mind so it's kind of like it's a message is like it's gonna repeat it and make sure you understand what the download is and what it's trying to tell you that you get it and it's grounded with it 9:42 star 9 is the number of initiation the vibration is high and allows the body to release toxins for days following it raises your vibration of the highest possible level and help you put help put you on a new track where life rapidly unfolds in a lighter way that serves your highest good and the ten points are supposed to be very subtle also so shamans like to combine it with other stars to get a maximum benefit like one-third ten pointed to two-thirds of nine to bridge the physical and celestial body as a good platform to connect with connect with the Creator so drying I think this is the most common drying and making a tea drying is easy to cut out the core of the cactus you include the white part just not the very center cut it up put it in a food dryer or an oven on low heat and make sure it's fully fully and completely dried you can even cut it in slices then when it's dried pull off the outside from the center and then pulverize it in a food processor tea is similar you start the same way it's just disregard the core cut everything up I then blend it in a food processor and put it into a big stockpot and slowly simmer it and reduce it I blend it again in the food processor and I run it through a cheesecloth and you catch the last of the fibers and I've done some research online and they say these fibers just throw them away which I didn't I dry it and there are still alkaloids in the fibers so every little bit is usable inning is another popular one that's where you just source the greenest part of the cactus that contains the strongest alkaloids and people eat it raw or they also dry it this is what I do when I'm doing full journey is turning into a cactus smoothie and it's very bitter I don't suggest it for anyone who can handle bitterness it's hard to get down and it's very mucousy it's like a mucus smoothie but like these ones aren't so bad they're from the charming Valley they're not I got some that are really snotty and gross but mmm first you harvest the plant and I recommend saying a blessing to the cactus this is a very sacred medicine connect with the cactus before you cut it you know get his permission and explain to it what you would like to do and that you're not going to kill it you want to take a cutting you never kill the cactus you just take a cutting so that lower base can pup or you take a cutting on top and replant that and once you explain that to the plant they then to be they're more receptive and willing to offer themselves so once the I cut the cactus I didn't cut the spines out and cut it into some thin slices cut the core out the reason we cut the core out is I once I didn't cut the core out and there was this huge root cleansing so if you want a lot of fiber and that experience go for it you know ever since I stopped using the core eating the core I've been fine so then I process it in the food processor and it gets really foamy because again it's mucus it's trapping a lot of air and then blend it with some water once you blend it I recommend letting it sit out for a little bit because the air the bubbles will come to the surface if you drink it right away or just drinking air it'll settle and then you can drink it and I recommend taking it with some acidic fruit like grapes pineapple it helps cleanse the palate so what I like to do for a full journey is 20 grams of dried San Pedro and that helps develop a body highest that and then when I want to get more spiritual I want more vision experience I want to go deep into the universe then because there are codes in there that through drawing and through reducing in a tea that are lost next is micro dosing and there isn't much information out there for micro dosing so I decided to try it myself how do I figure how do I do this so first let's talk about medications if your are 90 depressants it reduces the effect of San Pedro by about a third and I used to be on antidepressants and I've journeyed while on antidepressants and I had to take about an extra third I got off antidepressants through using through ayahuasca and San Pedro and it was a time in my life that I got over a really hard place and now I want to do these medicine journeys but if you're on antidepressants SSRIs or MAOI inhibitors you can get very sick and San Pedro you'll go into a serotonin syndrome so you don't have that risk with San Pedro which is really nice it is recommended that if you are planning a full journey to maybe cut back slightly two weeks before but check with your doctor because sometimes that can be dangerous the difference on any depressants it was a bit more numbing I didn't get as many nuances than before and that now when a journey I do it's more hard opening it's a deeper feeling antihistamines are fine blood pressure meds there's an alkaloid called tyramine that increases heart rate to be careful with but at the same time there's information saying it calms the nervous system so I've noticed hi hi heart beat be careful if you have a high blood pressure day and you're aware of it not take into too much San Pedro I do not recommend San Pedro with anybody with mental illness but to be with the professional who can work with you one-on-one moderate depression is wonderful because you know I get these bouts of depression once in a while and these are these are repressed feelings and taking these journeys helps my emotions to come up and it feels so good it's like being reborn like oh that was there what was I you know and you get so much information about why were you repressing these emotions back stories on it and given the okay to express it and to cry and their to be angry it's important Asperger's people with Asperger's find it's they like it because it creates a sense of unity people with Asperger's tend to isolate themselves or feel like nobody likes them and when they have this experience with San Pedro they are connected with you know the collective whole so again SSRIs be careful ayahuasca definitely do not go there if you're on any depressants when I first started on microdose I one day I was a weekend I took three grams way too much I was you know I was gardening but I was just staring at the roses and playing this knows not so then I took it down to one gram and still it was a little bit much so now I take zero point 50 grams in the morning every other day at first I did it every day cuz I wanted to understand what that feeling was how was it affecting my nervous system and such occasionally I've done the 0.25 grams in the morning in the afternoon but I recommend I have a strong system that people are sensitive to start with 0.25 grams and then through the week and start to increase it slightly to see until they can feel the effects and what you'll notice is a tingling sensation in the fingers like hardness humor I get more energy but some people say they get tired so it depends on your system awareness of the environment sensitivity to others energy and it's not like you're absorbing other people's energy you're just yet there's a roundabout awareness of where people are in perspective and empathy ceremonial journey who has journeyed with San Pedro here anybody so I recommend if you don't know how sensitive you are to start with fifteen to thirty grams of dried San Pedro and then upping it by 10 grams every 45 minutes it takes about 45 minutes before it comes on and it's taken me up to three hours before I like to start earlier in the morning around 9:00 10:00 a.m. because it takes several hours to get the feel of it you know is this the right place I'm supposed to be do I want to go further so set a timer excuse you might forget you know it's like I was only min 15 minutes you're eating more and you're eating more and you're eating more until it's too late so definitely don't take too much too soon and how to prep diet is really important before a journey so like with ayahuasca there's dieta that through eating certain foods and taking sugars salts meats fats out of your diet any citrus anything it's a very bland diet it allows a lot of your inner problems to come to the surface so when you go into ceremony with a shaman the shaman can work with you it's right there in front it's easy to access because in life we are stuffing it down with alcohol you know sugary foods whatever other drugs and that's all fun but we got to work through that if we want to evolve and become a better version of ourselves so this is really strict Yetta but step pedro doesn't have quite the strict data I have done a full Dido a San Pedro before and I do have a cleaner experience the nuances are more detailed I get more communication but you don't you know it's only about three to seven days before just don't eat processed foods avoid alcohol drugs and meat ate meat once the night before and I had to take extra and that wasn't good always said an intention so about a week or so before ponder questions what you'd like to work on with yourself I choose three and when I journey the plant usually picks two to focus on and usually ones like you already worked on that so let's just focus on this it's a focus point on your journey to bring you back to why you were there otherwise you're like this is fun and that's what it is just callers enjoyment a good body feel but your worth there with the purpose to do the work and to get some wisdom back from this plant so definitely set your intentions be clear about them throughout your journey and you may forget just go oh yeah it was oh yeah let's think about that again and then you'll get more information throughout the whole journey definitely clear space before you start your journey and you can just create a little ceremony on your home I call on the elements of water and fire and air and earth my spirit guides and a goddess I call him punch of mama she is like an auntie in terms of an ecosystem she's our mother earth and everything that works and energetically intertwining Pachamama blessings are wonderful and what's interesting about this planet is it's really amazing with music audio is incredible so have your music set up you know you can have as make sure you have it available soon you're not fumbling around in the middle of a journey trying to find a song it's the worst you lose you lose your focus so definitely setting is important I use candles just make sure you have you know set the house on fire if what no matter what form you use the San Pedro make a little offering if you have dried powder I put fruit around it I like to offer tequila actually is the choice and bond with your cactus you're developing a relationship and you're calling on this cactus to bring you wisdom offer that you will protect the cactus you ask for protection for this this energy and offered that cactus protection also that you are here to create a safe space and just be grateful and through that bond there's an opening up of soft energy in a safe protected circle I don't approve there are many retreats if you just go online there are so many retreats they all sound lovely but make sure you find a good shaman the ones who focus on San Pedro ceremonies are called watch Romero's and when you meet with their shaman they will get to know you and they'll talk about your intentions they will sit and listen to you but the shamans duty is not really to be kind or be your friend the best part of a good shamanism calling you out on your it's yeah it's so there you're there to get some tough love and they're there to send the message from spirit on how you can evolve so we always have to make sure you always have tell you what is my place in the situation what is my place with this intention why instead of blaming others what is my how did I contribute to this so the shamans will focus on you first how did you let this happen you know what is the pattern how do we stop this pattern from happening again and that comes from within so and coming from within like I spoke to you about what if we didn't have filters what if we didn't have filters a good shaman is not somebody you gave your power to that's the wrong way and I see in this culture recently people go to others for healing and they give away their own power but you know without that filter we have the infinite wisdom within and it's so infinite now when good shaman will help you to locate your own inner wisdom and the capacity it has to love the hope to have faith so once you go to Peru and have a subpage of experience you need a shaman that's going to awaken your inner wisdom and it's it never ends it's like lifetimes and lifetimes and lifetimes of learning and hard opening wisdom that we all have so when you go home you you don't have a shaman there you got to keep working on that your own inner self it's there every day to access so good shaman will guide you and open you up to that experience expansive universe that is your inner infinite wisdom the dew clearings lots of beautiful clearings here the clearings are great for getting rid of nervous energy when I did a clearing it's either sage or a Palo Santo wood its calms the energy it's really nice you know when you go to a firstrow ceremony I'm nervous a little jumpy then it clears that energy field so we can all then sit down and bond in a circle and we connect in an energetic way shamans who work with the Mesa and Mesa is a traveling altar and they can have tokens like just stones crystals bones little pieces of wood they create their own messes by what is given as an offering for them going for a walk in the forest you know bending over and finding a piece of bone and picking it up and having a spirit say you're supposed to work with this and then through time they learn how to work with it there's another Mesa they also work with floral waters when they do a water blessing you might have seen shamans when they blow the water on people and they spit it out that's a water blessing they used some really amazing floral waters that somewhere for exorcisms which I've witnessed some exorcisms and clearings of you know some really dark entities that attach to people and it's an incredible experience to witness and then the shaman will use these floral waters to clear the energy after this exorcism and it changes the minds and the hearts and then they what's interesting also is that they bring their Catholic religion into their work so here you see a Jesus on a crucifix and saints and angels they have extracted the essence out of what they were taught through the Spanish Inquisition they recognize the stories for their word the beauty of Jesus the prophet the message of loving each other so they carry that on in their work and combine their ancestry magic and shamanism with the new Catholic religion here they are blessing despachos despachos our prayer bundles that you can create you probably pick flowers I'm put money in it and you wish over it you pray over it then tie it up into a bundle you know they burn it and bury into the earth it's a beautiful offering stuff to say it's some of the most powerful ever witnessed and this book is wonderful masters of the Living energy this doesn't necessarily go into ayahuasca or San Pedro but it goes into the mentality of the shamans improve and Andean spirituality it's masters of the living energy by author's last name is Wilcox the mystical world of the kiero of Peru and they have amazing capabilities of transmuting energy so that's something new I'm working on is surrendering transmuting an energy where I used to if somebody unloaded on me my cells would hurt I'd absorb it I'd carry this energy around for a long time and now I can just kind of hold space for them just be there in a non-judgmental way breathe in that pain and transmute it breathe it out breathe love out and then Buddhist ways it's also called like a tonglen and a good way to do it's like breathing it in from your belly you know being willing to breathe in that negative energy and it's not good or bad it's just something that this person has heavy energy but wait a minute you're in place that you don't have every energy you can take in that heavy energy breathing in and just lighten the load on that person and this breathe it out and imagine a light coming from the universe and the sky is connected to down below and do that several times and you can do it very gently it doesn't have to be a big theatrical breathe breath and that's transmuting energy that's taking in something that's heavy for somebody else and if you hold on to it it'll be heavy for you but if you breathe it in breathe that light in and out like three times and think of love positivity you'll notice that the person in front of you is unloaded has lightened up and this book masters the living energy goes into several more practices like that so there are animal guys that are very associated with San Pedro and the deer is one of them of a dear my dear medicine they have the ability to see through illusion there we go oh it's associated with gentleness caring love sensitivity and graceful beauty because of their well-developed senses it is said deer can see through illusions and guide through chaotic situations and people with deer medicine can also learn to detect subtle movements here are things unspoken and to use their intuition to avoid dangers this is medicine that will show up in a full journey the deer will come the deer also teaches us how to listen well just to be aware another very sacred animal is the hummingbird hummingbird there's a whole Andean story about a fire that breaks out in the forest it's about to consume the whole forest and all the animals get together trying to now the meeting what do we do how do we stop this fire and there's one little hummingbird going into a creek picking up a drop of water going back to the fire repeating that the fire and the animals are just like what's he doing what are you doing and the hummingbird says anything I can and right now on this day and age we're forced to work very fast you know how come we can achieve this quickly almost even like how come I can't evolve as fast as I want to you know find joy in the little things you know if you're feeling depressed if you're in a really hard every little thing you do counts find something you know piece with that and that's okay I also like hummingbird because it has such little wings the little body and it goes on such long journeys and it represents how far we can go our little hummingbird spirits inside you can go much climb much further than then we allow ourselves to and more hummingbird helps us to connect more strongly and to create a space for our souls essence to be expressed by releasing the emotional or physical blocks holding us back in the ancestral realms and that's a key sentence for full journeying is the goal is to remove those blockages that we put in front of us and some of that's for safety some of that just habit the more you work on changing those patterns the more the ego will keep trying to pull you back into that habit and there's a resistance there and that's something has got to keep working through and it takes time it doesn't happen the first time but when you keep working through it the easier it gets I was in a peyote ceremony we worked on our mother wounds and somebody was like how come it always comes back you know we do these ceremonies in the first week you're like yeah this is wonderful a couple weeks later you you're a few bad habits are coming back or bad thoughts and in the peyote ceremony somebody said the more you work on it the easier it gets the more you work on it each time you work on it you have healed one of your ancestors and a full line of ancestors so keep working on it Puma energy is very very powerful energy the Puma represents our shadow it's used a lot in ayahuasca ceremonies as symbolism and if you don't work with your shadow it'll show up at the worst times so I like to think of there's a white wolf and a dark wolf and you must play with both and there's a time and place to play with either the Jaguar medicine includes seeing the roads within chaos and understanding the patterns of chaos moving without fear in the darkness moving in unknown places shape-shifting psychic vision facilitating soul work and empowering oneself reclaiming power so it's finding you know it's walking into darkness walking into the unknown you know finding a center finding a place of groundedness so it's a very powerful medicine to work with and a lot of shamans tend to in people work with them in ceremony they tend to start to shape-shift into the jaguars it's fascinating so towards the end of your personal ceremony definitely have food pre-prepped and have cozy food available because as you come towards the end of your journey you need some nourishment and before eating your food say prayer offer a gift of thanks and once you do so and take that first bite it's the beginning of the entrance into sleepy time so I like to do day journeys so it's allowing that changeover to happen once you start eating the food definitely drink plenty of water and fruit tastes amazing now integration is a huge part so some shamans say after the ceremony is ended then the work really begins integration is huge make sure you either take a nice walk the next few days journal you can create some art write some poetry move some energy through your body through yoga do not drink I did that once after two days and I lost a lot of download wisdom I lost about half of what I learned I just dropped a lower energy vibration do not drink alcohol don't waste that time and all that information now through ceremony there are so many there aren't even words to express what you'll be learning because it's all within the heart too while you're doing in ceremony definitely you'll start pondering things you might get information and you start trying to store it you're like I got to remember this I gotta remember this go into your heart feel into it go from here and connect it into here that's where you'll have the memory of it because you will forget it if you just keep it in your mind topics that um I mean that can help you evolve you know focus on are you do you consider yourself a victim in anything are you holding on to shame grief and trauma humility emotional repression anger forgiveness is huge with this medicine what I found is incredible amount of compassion to forgive what I would consider my enemies and it wasn't I always thought was like well they're just human to what was my part in it and letting it go forgiveness is about like I need to make space I can't hold onto this grudge anymore and letting it go and letting it be when you go you know all this information you get is not about I'm learning a new skill on how to improve myself it's more about surrendering and letting go letting go letting go and through that then your own intern essence starts to shine and come through as your authentic self and that's always there let's just remove the layers especially addiction this is really wonderful for addiction and handling it you know when are you getting out of control and sitting with that medicine fear of death there's a certain essence of like ayahuasca there's been already been a study that comparing it to people who had near-death experiences and versus ayahuasca experiences and they're super similar the only difference is that the people who had then actually had the near-death experience had a choice whether to go on and die or come back into their body the San Pedro is somewhat similar to that so you learned that you know we your spirits gonna live on this is just a vessel that's carrying us what are we gonna do with this time on earth are we gonna waste it or do you want to even though this work is hard to like work through the e code do you want to work and explore and be curious about it what do what gifts do you have to offer and that's what grandfather medicine will show you you know these are your own gifts and it's different for each and every person so surrender I've been focusing on a lot too you go up day in and day out with work and hold on to certain dramas that happen in our lives but to wake up and surrender to each day and to forgive everyone from the day before - and forgive yourself is super important and having a balanced life and a happy life and going onto locating shamans there's plenty of Internet information but I recommend hopefully if you know somebody you can get a testimonial it's important not to show up and Prue and just pick any shaman because if you prey on Americans but there are plenty of lovely lodging situations meeting you know blogs are really good reading about blogs and then contacting the writer to the blog to find out oh yeah your mate calm me or mate Tom calm was a really good blog and he does some podcasts to talking about psychedelics I learned more about what Tom watch human learning from Aubrey Marcus Aubrey Marcus calm and he has some podcasts in his history that talks about his watch him travels to Peru unimproved they like to do watch human medicine walks with San Pedro barefoot so it's connecting with the earth and I hear it's amazing energetic vibrationally and my friend Patrick is here who has been on one of these walks to Machu Picchu he's going to share with us his experience five years ago I was lucky enough to be able to go down to Peru with a group of people I've been working with ayahuasca and when we got to Peru we were introduced to the shaman of Machu Picchu which right away made me think yeah right that shaman Machu Picchu he turned out to be the real deal we went to Machu Picchu and the mountain behind it is called weina Picchu and he took us up into these little mountains here and we drank watch him and then started up to the top of this mountain then down all the way down the backside down to the river and of course every half an hour he's stopping us and going here drink some more and at one point somebody I'm very close to on the flat spot with the incredibly high on mikuma with about a two thousand foot drop right behind her and just like please but for me what you have is it's not for me it's not a very visionary medicine it's just I get connected very deeply with the nature everything you can feel the life in plants and animals and things and if you ever get a chance to do what to me it is a wonderful wonderful plant thank you that's the end any questions asked about again please what's your view about it's the same thing as San Pedro it's just a native indigenous name of it before I became the name of st. Peter so in the 70s there was that I detector test that was committed to plants I understand you with you with fire made the planet leave that there like addiction starts bad now don't do that so this machines based on collaboration that turned it into music [Music] so you said that you like the beach and you expect additionally people taking at night in ceremony instead of mine thank you some people do it and I won't you say because I've heard a lot about a lot about day ceremonies in Peru originally they were done during the day but they moved tonight during the Spanish Inquisition so they wouldn't be killed there's a couple of people working but San Pedro that are doing mostly daytime I noticed a lot of books around planets there are there any reservoir of ayahuasca and this goes into no shame victimhood really into detail about what he's learned and it's very vulnerable book what he's expressing about his life and I learned tongues on this book that I wish I could just put North he's already got it so this is Sam bedroom opening the pathways of the heart [Music] over being at do you get a little nauseous with Sanford room mirror you get more nauseous some people do vomit and purged in San Pedro I don't like it what they're shaking that happened he's crying Curtis crying it's not as likewise not similar to that i watch the Packers what's the nativist device that [Applause] you got one the foods that you only affect dosage are foods that have a lot of fat in and so you don't know slightly the medicine that's quickly but when we started the leading questions um in Orion definitely don't put it outside too much rain California yeah it's time to you go those areas it just takes off temperatures tolerant it's just though the water [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] like stage [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah I mean it is said that we need to wait a generation and not take up too many peyote in which move and work with San Pedro VOD I find there's more astral traveling and peyote is more crossing across the sky there's more of a grounded feeling with San Pedro there are more approaches from your shadow cacti spirits that guide you with courage you know how to take little baby slips that you didn't think you know how to take a risk that you never thought you take before it created a sense of peace more of a sense of peace that you can move around in the world without any limitations less fear peyote there was more definitely more astral traveling the spirit realm or definitely more like Eagle related when you catch him this is one thing I always get and it's also very audio receptive cactus - it's interesting it's like the bar I go attempt a do I get more visuals versus peyote but I haven't done a it would be very often the only thing just like oh yeah and now I understand how Native Americans did this medicine and communicated across the stars in the skies yeah yes when you cut them do you have to do something to the top so it doesn't catch it just keeps growing and don't overwater them I know no I don't have anything available right now but I can give you my card and I can email you that information I was thinking about uploading it to maps I know they're taking in a lot of information about my third Oh see you're not may be full of your Sampedro so I thought I should upload that to them and explain what I have gone through so others can learn from that [Applause]", "xMpI2WXPGbs": "[Music] [Music] welcome to growing your own food in

eight years old and it's time for harvesting but before i start harvesting my grapes i want to talk a little bit about why i have a mesh covering over this grapevine so i'm going to step aside so you can see how much of this grapevine has been covered although the eastern concord grape is suitable for growing in colorado earlier in growing this particular cultivar i discovered that colorado's climate and high altitude brought challenges to growing this type of cultivar the two issues i had with this cultivar is our climate is very the climate for concord grapevines excuse me is very susceptible to leaf rust and uneven ripening so i'm gonna go ahead and start taking the covers off the grapevine the training system i'm using on this particular grapevine it's called the spur training system and so you have your base right here and then i have an arm going out this way and then i have an arm going out this way so this is the spur training system now the grapevine is eight years old and over time as you can see the grapevine has weighed down the wire considerably so i'm gonna have to do some maintenancing and once i harvest the grapevine and once the foliage dies back and i start pruning the vine i am going to go ahead and replace the wire so i want to go ahead and start pruning this grapevine also i covered the grapevines because colorado has extremely high temperatures and because we're 5 200 feet above sea level this particular cultivar does not do very good when the temperature gets really hot so i have to cover it with a mesh covering and i have no rust mites whatsoever so this was one of the problems i had earlier so i have been able to combat that problem so no rust mites in addition it keeps the birds the squirrels and the pests off your grape vine so as you can see i've got plenty of grapes and a lot of them have been dropping and falling because of the heat so there are challenges growing a concord grapevine it is very um they're very conducive to cool climate type um environments but unfortunately you know we're going through climate change and we experienced a drought all summer during during 2020 and um but the grapes vines are doing very good and i'm happy to see that i don't have a whole lot of uneven grapes which is another issue with the concord grapevine especially when there's a lot of heat and again there's no issues with uneven ripening so overall i'm very very happy with my grapevine eight years old i successfully have been able to keep the rust mites off i don't have any unevening colors on the grapes the only thing is is this wire has sunken over time and so i'm going to have to restructure the entire system and again it's a spur system so let's go ahead and start harvesting two other things i want to bring up that i didn't bring up earlier is you really want to pay attention to your environment to determine what can impact this cultivar now this cultivar is a cool season vine but keep in mind the leaf rust is a result of rust fungus which mainly occurs in warm temperature which is wind-borne spores this problem typically occurs in july when the temperatures start climbing above 90 degrees so this is the first sign of the problem so you want to immediately remove the affected foliage organically sprayed with neem oil and then start covering the vine and start shading it right here the other thing that's really important another tip is you want to make sure you're pruning your vines it's okay to give it a hard pruning because pruning your vines does help stimulate growth and it also helps keep the foliage from being crowded so if i had not [Music] pruned these flicks it would have been a lot lot thicker i wouldn't had any air circulation no sun to the grapes and then um it would have caused a lot of problems so now keep this mind look how thick this foliage is and this grapevine got pruned back really heavy you could also see that the grapes are dropping because of the heat so i got a lot of grapes right below here that's dropping dropping because of the heat so this was an unusually hot summer 80 days of 90 degree straight 90 degrees and above straight temperatures this is labor day saturday was 101 yesterday was 98 today is 94. so typically this is a cool season grapevine but we have climate change and and i have to adjust it adjust my um growing the vine along the way but so far it's so good so i'm gonna go ahead and start harvesting these grapes there's just so many look at this i'll just go ahead and move these back and as you can see quite a bit got lost down here at the bottom because of the heat and the heat is causing these grapes to drop oops i did keep the grape the grapevine watered although they don't require heavy watering but it was a drought and i had to keep the grapevines watered i have quite a bit but the heat caused these grapes to drop so this was an unusual year with just straight drought and high heat it did [Music] oh it's quite a bit of grapes [Music] i have a few more to harvest and i'll be almost through but i'm going to continue harvesting these grapes until i get them all and why because it's supposed to be 32 degrees or or lower tomorrow so i won't be able to leave these grapes on the vine so here's my harvest right here and so i will continue harvesting i may have to get another bowl and finish harvesting so thank you for watching and don't forget to hit the like button [Music] foreign", "3nvb9mioIUs": "[Music] ah hi welcome back to the second episode of great food presents i'm dino and i'm cyrus and today we are trying the food from anna bappa muslim restaurant cyrus tell us what we're having today so over here we have guantanamo roads we have chakri and we have hao bakuti wow nice i'm excited so what do you wanna try first let's try the chocolate yeah all right chocolate that's like my absolutely favorite food i do i miss malicious chocolate just use life yeah you should shirt more authentic whoops maybe a seafood one whoops it is such a cute little tiny problem the thing about porn is his peel is my favorite it's not peeled i don't know i'm a legit performer all right [Music] yeah what was that called the what a chocolate dough needs to have the wok plate without this it's not it's just paper yeah i think it could be like a bit sweeter it's quite spicy as well yeah yes as a person cannot take spicy yeah it's actually very spicy okay now we will try the swanton noodle yeah reminds me of like the typical kind of dumping soup like traditionally what's the filling of the one time if i'm not wrong it's actually made of like there's chestnut inside there's pork and sometimes mushrooms too just buy a preferred mine without any of those i just prefer it ah i think this one's from a muslim restaurant so the filling might be different it does taste very similar to like those typical chinese kind of dumplings pretty good [Music] i know i i know that traditionally cha chu is my opponent yeah but what's this made out of i think it's chicken beef i think it's beef i tried chashi in hong kong before and it was pretty tough because i think it was because of the cut of the meat so this is similar to that but i don't know the taste is actually very good and sweet enough i'm sorry i keep saying sweet but i love sweet stuff well he is with him [Music] can we try the the chilly i'm scared but i'll try it for the views sorry but it's not that spicy as compared to the first one and it's sweet as well i think i can tolerate this chili better than black chili get more of this food about cooking it's the herbal type of bakuti because i don't understand there is like the horrible and the peppery or peppery one i can't do the pepperoni why why not it hurts my heart just like the last girl that i was with oh man being alone is better i'm forever alone unique about this is that the rice doesn't look like it's the normal like plain rice it's more like the oily rice or the chinese people call it you fun yeah or what does you fund me it just means oil rice [Music] that's what we suspected yeah chicken rice chicken i would say that it actually doesn't matter what the rice is because the soup overpowers the taste of the rice so if you want to put plain rice you'll taste the same thing what do you think i mean to be honest this is my first time eating bakuti so it's actually quite nice right yeah let's try the the soup right it's actually very very similar to the real one it's yeah it's up there guys you should go try it you got it it's too big it's quite tender though like i could just like poke it with my spoon quite easily my piece was really tough i quite like it though that's pretty good mm-hmm so let's wait overall on the restaurant itself how many grapes would you give him i think about a 3.5 grams 3.5 wow nice i would give it around 3.5 as well yeah overall it's a really good place i'm pretty sure if it's hot would be way better i agree i really love this best you can fight with malaysia you're gonna get one from the malaysian cancer cancer we love you malaysia yeah they've come to the end of the second episode and i do hope you enjoyed this video and if you have any suggestions on what we should win next do hit our comment section down below don't forget to like share and subscribe the details for

vine Growing grapes in containers is not very complicated though it requires slight care and maintenance Soil Don\u2019t use heavy garden soil when growing grapes in containers Instead, use a light potting mix that is loose, rich in organic matter and most importantly drains well Choosing a Pot For growing grapes in containers, choose a large and sturdy container that can support this vigorous vine A 15-20 gallon pot that is at least 16-18 inches deep and 18-24 inches wide is sufficient Start with a smaller sized pot and then repot the plant in a larger one Choosing varieties The best option is to go to a garden center and ask for a variety that can grow well in pots and in your climate There are many varieties of grapevine you can choose from Choosing a variety that is resistant to diseases and can grow well in your zone is most essential However, you can grow almost any variety in the container but growing a dwarf grape cultivar like \u2018pixie\u2019 can save you from the hassle of training a grape vine in a pot Planting The best time to plant grapevine is spring or early summer Planting on this time helps the plant to grow all season without the exposure to frost But if you live in a frost-free hot tropical climate the best time for planting grape vine is winters Position Choose a location that is sunny, warm and dry If your spot receives shade in an afternoon the plant will still do well but at least 6 hours of sunlight is required Support and Training Grapevine needs training and support to grow When growing grapes in a pot it is best to opt for a tall lightweight trellis of wood or plastic Watering Water regularly and deeply to keep the soil slightly moist but avoid overwatering Soggy, damp soil can be detrimental to the plant Fertilization Side dress the plant periodically with aged manure or compost In the first year, you can fertilize the plant with a general purpose fertilizer in spring and summer From the next year, start to fertilize the plant with the fertilizer that is low in nitrogen but high in potassium and phosphorus from the spring when flower buds appear", "GU5KDx5rEN8": "[Music] for that wonderful introduction as you heard my name is uh dr onegai and this whole week we've had a wonderful time um discussing various health nuggets and secrets that you not have known um we have been talking on the theme and those who may have questions okay for those who need to at youtube currently youtube you know and i'll be able to answer some of them towards the end of this broadcast today's topic that we'll be talking about is guarding your heart subtitle debunking the myth about cancer as we've been noticing we've been focusing on the verse proverbs chapter 4 verse 23 which says guard your heart with all diligence why for from it flow springs of life and indeed the springs of life that flow out of their heart contained in the blood but what if the blood has cancer what if there are dangerous daddies that are flowing in the blood the blood will now transmit disease to to the whole body as you can see so what is cancer what is cancer let us understand this and follow it as a of a cancer cell now if you look right at the top left of the screen you can see a normal cell and cells usually divide two the second cell divides the two and another cell divides into another that's how the god created us and how a small baby gets to grow into a big man because of cells normally dividing however times because of because we live in an imperfect situation in an imperfect world some cells may become damaged and unfortunately when these cells the body has to find a way to kill them because damaged cells are not good for the body so god has created a certain mechanism through certain genes that take these damaged cells okay and inspire these damaged cells to perform what we call cell suicide so these cells that are damaged the body takes them and kills them all right that's what happens in a normal system however in cancer we have damaged cells that somehow escape the body's natural mechanism of self-suicide so these cancer cells escape [Music] and continue to divide so instead of it's being nipped in the bud these cells again into two again those two into two so you end up having a whole huge mass of damaged cells and these damaged cells continue replicating and replicating at an enormous rate the end result is that where you have normal cells the normal cells are fine they're intact but the damaged cells which somehow escape the body's cleaning mechanism continue to grow and divide and divide and divide and what eventually happens is these cancers cancerous cells end up going into the blood the moment you have a damaged cancer cell into your blood we call that term malignant have you ever heard of anyone saying oh i have a cancer that is malignant all that means is that the damaged cells have somehow found their way into the blood system and they're circulating throughout your whole body now these damaged cells can spread from as somewhere as far away as your toe or somewhere as far as way as you knee and this damaged cells when the blood system they move all over the body and can spread all the way to your brain and spread all the way to your liver remember for the life of the body is in the blood and if the blood carries death death cells inside it then you're finished these are just some of the pictures to see how cancer looks right inside the body once we take autopsies from dead people who have lived with cancer it just shows a picture of lung cancer as you can see on your screen this shows a picture on this other side so that's not lung cancer but you can see right here this is a uterus and these are two ovaries that have just been eaten up by cancer that's how cancer is today we want to talk about the ugly truth i hope you have a a strong stomach for today's session we'll go through it quite quickly but we really need to discuss and discover what exactly is true about cancer and what is false myth number one today we are trying to debunk the most common myths that kenyans have about cancer and number one number one is cancer a death sentence myth number one people tend to believe cancer once i get diagnosed with cancer i'm gone i'm dead no as you can see cancer is not a death sentence over 40 000 new cases are diagnosed every day people living with cancer 14 youth cases on a daily basis in kenya however 27 000 of these people will die by the end of the year so why do people tend to die or why is the probability of dying from cancer higher in african countries one because of poverty because of coming to hospital when it is too late and when you reach the hospital many of our facilities do not have inadequate instruments and adequate personnel they don't have adequate health care facilities to take care of these people so what determines if a cancer patient lives or dies one it could be the type of a cancer so some cancers are more aggressive than the others others tend to grow very fast and spread very fast where others tend to really be very slow in their progression sometimes some cancers do not spread to other parts of the body they just stick where they were initially formed other cancers have very effective treatment others do not so the various various reasons why a cancer patient may live or die it's not that easy however it is not a death sentence why because four in ten cancers can be easily prevented very easily preventable how as you can see there's various ways to prevent cancer one be smoke free so no smoking keeping a healthy weight okay remember we talked about being 1gb yesterday yes sunlight all right preventing our protecting yourself against certain infections drinking less alcohol eating a high-fiber high plant-based diet all right avoiding radiation so there are various various ways to prevent oneself from getting cancer myth number two cancer is contagious true or false okay someone says false and yes as you can see cancer is not contagious just like you can see this gentleman here on this picture who is coughing if this guy had lung cancer would you get it by being on the other side of his cough no however we need to realize that actually there are some ways that you can transmit a cancer okay and some of these transmissible risk factors include the hpv virus or human papillomavirus it is known that human papilloma virus can be spread from one person to the other mainly through sexual intercourse and developing into cancers of the cervix cancer of the anus and cancer of the mouth i'll leave that to you to find out how you can get cancer of the mouth from someone else all right myth number three all chemotherapy once i'm diagnosed with cancer and i get chemotherapy my hair must fall off true or false actually it is true that many chemotherapies make our hair fall off okay however there are some types of chemotherapy as well that do not have any association with hair loss myth number four cell phones my mobile phone can cause cancer is that true or is that false now facts of fiction there's some things that have been postulated to cause cancer but unfortunately they remain to be myths and some of these things are one mobile phones two some cosmetics and plastics they still remain all these remain in the myth category whereas those that have proven risk include smoking alcohol diet obesity and if you've been listening to the talks that we've been going through this week i'm just repeating the same same old risk factors okay so indeed we do not have any strong evidence right now that mobile phones have any causation with risk of cancer as you can see in this picture just demonstrating many people think that the radio waves that are emitted by the cell towers and the mobile phones can enter into the brain and cause cancer however most of the studies that have been done so far show that the energy in the radiation is so so so low and very weak and non-ionizing and this energy does not contain enough potential to damage your dna and hence cause cancer so the answer is no but what do we know are some of the risk factors that do cause cancer these are the same things that i've talked about you know as the risk factors for cardiovascular disease same same thing tobacco alcohol you know having a bad diet obesity raise blood pressure raise blood sugar as you can see these are some of the things that indeed cause death attributable to to cancer same stories that we've been talking about even obesity or being overweight can that cause cancer yes why because fat cells or the cells that have a lot of fat and cholesterol indeed produce certain hormones and growth factors that indeed cause extra extra extra extra extra multiplication of cells remember how we talked about at the very beginning cancer is just an abnormal growth abnormal multiplication of body cells that escape the body's cleaning mechanism so yes being overweight can cause cancer what kind of cancers does being overweight what kind of cancers can be associated with being overweight as you can see in this slide cancer of the esophagus cancer of the throat cancer of the breast cancer of the liver cancer of the stomach cancer of the pancreas cancer of the gallbladder cancer of the kidney cancer of the bowel cancer of the ovary cancer of the uterus there's so 13 different types of cancer have been associated with obesity and so what do i need to do i need to make sure i lose weight i need to make sure that i take my vegetables and my fruits i need to exercise yesterday we talked about being yes exercise very important way of preventing cancer tobacco avoiding tobacco alcohol and many other things that we have talked about which somehow end up being the same same same risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease cardiovascular disease and cancer have the same risk factors number five myth number five eating sugar and many kenyans by the way somehow believe this for one reason or the other eating sugar makes my cancer grow and makes it worse is that true or is that false now sugar may not cause cancer directly however it may displace other nutrient-rich foods that help to protect against cancer being excess weight of course which is associated with a lot of sugar intake can cause obesity which causes cancer but is there any direct link between sugar and a cancer cell not really it is very very in direct all right however we know that there are certain things that we can eat to fight cancer and what are some of these things one we need to realize we need to fight cancer by the platform so as you can see in this slide have a very balanced portion of various nutrients on your plate okay so strike a balance between your plant-based foods and your proteins so fighting cancer by the platform how else can we fight cancer we can fight cancer with color so the colorful foods contain certain chemicals that can be able to prevent you against kinds of the colon cancer vesophagus cancer of the kidney so eating a variety of vegetables that are very rich in color the dark green the red the orange vegetables those indeed help to fight against cancer having a cancer-fighting breakfast is important so what does this cancer-fighting breakfast include cereals and wheat products orange juice melons and strawberries help to protect against cancer of the colon cancer the rectum cancer of the breast i hope you're writing all these things down okay so tomorrow breakfast i need to see what's on your plate having foods that are rich in folate such as beans sunflower seeds leafy green vegetables like spinach and lettuce indeed help you to fight cancer through the foliage mechanism tomatoes which are rich in a chemical called lycopene could actually help prevent prostate cancer very interesting what about meat we talked about meat a bit a bit about meat yesterday right now the data we have about meat is that it has a direct direct correlation a direct causation towards certain cancers especially of the gastrointestinal tract so cancers of the colon cancer of the stomach has been directly linked to meat especially processed meats like ham like hot dogs this is what we call level one evidence so level one evidence means that this cancer is directly caused by eating this type of meat okay so processed meats have a level one or group one evidence now other red meats such as pork beef lamb have a level two evidence okay that they can cause cancer level two means that eating definitely increases your risk many many many many many many many many many times very interesting turn with me to this slide you can see that in the year 2015 there's some beautiful data that came out from where adventist scientists now these adventist scientists in the loma linda university in california in the united states actually followed over 77 000 church members over a period of seven years and what did they find they found that cancer of the colon and cancer of the rectum could be avoided how just by eating a plant-based vegetarian diet and what did they find they found that red meat and other forms of processed meats were actually directly linked to 380 cases of colon cancer and 110 cases of rectal cancer amongst the people that they followed very very interesting you can look this up it's in the journal of the american medical association which is one of the biggest biggest medical journals worldwide now the following program on the following slides are rated parental guidance pg because they may contain some mild thematic elements if you do not have a strong stomach please do not watch this i just wanted to show you some of the things that could happen by eating the meat and the other cancerous things that we put into our mouth this just shows a picture of a rectal cancer and a colon cancer this just shows how cancer of your large intestine looks can you see the red very dark red stuff that is looking very gooey oh no that's how it looks like that's how another part of colon cancer looks like from some of the patients that indeed that we've been seeing okay right in surgery you open up and try and remove parts of the cancers materials that you find in the large intestine and you can see all this is just cancer all that is just cancer cancer of the colon cancer the intestine do you see why it is important to watch what we put into our mouths because what comes out later we end up regretting it's all these are just photos of you know just cancerous materials and and and cancer of the intestines kinds of colon cancer this stomach that's cancer of the intestine again kind of you get the drift you get the drift i'm sure you see myth number six a little wine is good for the stomach is that true or is that false now very interesting is that wine contains most wine is actually collected or manufactured from grapes now grapes themselves have a chemical that has strong antioxidant and strong anti-inflammatory properties so this chemical that is found in the grape is actually protective against certain types of cancer but the alcohol or the ethanol component in wine and in beer and you know all other alcoholic drinks has a direct link to certain types of cancer so if there's a way to take my wine and remove the alcohol in it sieve it out and just drink the fresh grape juice i would be protecting myself from cancer but when i mix that grape juice with alcoholic content you can see the type of corn cancers that come out of alcohol counts of the mouth plants of the larynx which is the voice box cancer of the esophagus which is a which is the food pipe cancer of the breast cancer of the bowel the large bowel so over 115 000 people have been tested in this study and they actually showed that heavy drinking increased the risk of death by up to 54 the various studies that we can talk about that just show the various associations between alcohol and liver cancer alcohol and the intestines alcohol and various parts of the body as we've just seen that shows you how liver cancer looks like all these funny blobs all these blobs blobs blobs blobs are cancerous cells that are just eating up into into the liver and what happens eventually cancer from the liver can also spread to the brain as you can see so this is a cross-section of the brain and as you can see the brain is affected by the cancer the pancreas as well can be affected by the cancer so as we wind up today what kind of things can i look at can i see in my body that point or give a fortist or indeed can be a sign that i should not ignore remember we said that many kenyans die from cancer why because they ignored certain signs and signals they saw in their bodies they decided to stay home and eventually came to hospital when it was too late we run through these 15 cancer signs that you should never ignore number one any changes in your skin so sometimes you may find you have some spots some pimples that keep growing that somehow are not going away you should not ignore that that could be a sign of skin cancer you could be coughing coughing coughing coughing for months on end and think ah this is just an allergy this is just tb this is just pneumonia nope it could be a sign of lung cancer number three for women and also men any changes or any tumors or any lumps in your breasts could be a sign of breast cancer okay any unusual bloating that stays for a long period of time do not dismiss it as having acidity that could be an early sign of ovarian cancer for the men especially when you have problems with your plumbing okay you know you're no longer shooting like a young boy when you used to be a young boy you know you your urine goes all the way there instead when you struggle to pee that could be a sign of prostate cancer again any swollen lymph nodes or you know people some people call them guy all right on your neck your armpits could be a sign an early sign of cancer when you pee and you see blood when you're going to the bathroom that could be a sign of cancer of your urinary tract any changes in your testicles for men could be a sign of testicular cancer sometimes you may have trouble swallowing okay you're trying to swallow but you find something is getting stuck that could be an early sign of esophageal cancer any unusual vaginal bleeding that comes off your period any extra excessive amounts of bleeding could be a sign of cancer any issues in your mouth any unexplained weight loss any unexplained fever any unexplained heartburn in digestion fatigue all those are signs that indeed if very persistent over a long period of time could be an early warning of cancer so go get checked by a doctor tomorrow's episode will feature a very very special guest okay and we will discuss how to live victoriously with kovid19 do we have any questions today thank you thank you for that presentation we don't have any questions but a quick one maybe you can answer do microwaves cause cancer then the second question is do animals like cows also suffer from cancer those are the questions we have so far okay that's a very interesting one must be a farmer who asked that about about cows well yes cows just like any other animal can fall sick from cancer remember how we talked about cancer cancer basically starts by cells that are replicating out of control so yes cows can get cancer the other question indeed about microwaves remember microwaves and mobile phones all of them have radiomagnetic waves all right electromagnetic waves and radio waves we do not have too much evidence that can directly link these microwaves and radio waves to cancer so right now i would say no we do not have any scientific evidence that having a microwave in your kitchen will cause cancer of your throat cancer of your lungs cancer of your ears or kind of any part of the body thank you for joining us tomorrow be sure to join us again at 5 20. shall we pray dear lord we thank you once again for another session that has been and indeed father we pray that you indeed may be our great physician may we always put our trust in you for you are stronger you are even stronger than cancerous cells themselves we pray all this in jesus name amen [Music] you", "cOkJUVEriVw": ">> So now we'll\nget to Dr. Dervay. Dr. Joe Dervay has been a flight\nsurgeon at NASA for the past 20 years and currently serves\nas the lead of the medical operations group. He graduated from Cornell\nUniversity and Syracuse Upstate Medical University. Entering the US Navy and\ncompleting training as a naval flight surgeon, he served aboard\ntheir aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy. That one's been decommissioned, right? >> Dr. Joe Dervay: Yes indeed. >> Dr. Dervay has completed\nresidences in emergency medicine and aerospace medicine,\nfellowship training in space medicine, research and clinical\nwork undersea medicine, received a master's in public health and\na masters of medical science with a focus on nitrogen\nbubble nucleation. Prior to JSC included working\nthree years at NASA headquarters and since being at JSC beginning\nwith STS-77 he has served as crew or deputy crew surgeon\nfor numerous shuttle and ISS missions. He serves as co-chair of the\nmulti-medical operations panel MMOP and is chair of the\nMMOP EVA working group. Dr. Dervay holds the rank of\ncaptain in the US Navy with over 30 years of active duty and\nreserve service with numerous Navy and Marine Corps\nunits worldwide. Thank you for your service. >> Dr. Joe Dervay: Thank you. >> And so we now introduce Dr. Dervay. >> Dr. Joe Dervay:\nThank you [applause]. Well good afternoon and Janice\nI'd like to thank you and your team for the invite to come\nhere and speak to this group. We're going to have a little fun\nthis afternoon and I also want to welcome the clerks that are\nin town for the month that are going to be working with\nus primarily in the medical operations arena. So today we're going to have a\nchance to talk with you a little bit about spaceflight\nmedical operations. Some of you in this room are\nexperts in given areas and I'm just going to kind of give you\nthe broad-brush perspective from the flight surgeon's vantage\npoint to give you a sense of how we deal with our crewmembers\npre-flight, during flight, and post-flight. And Dr. Blake Chamberlain, one\nof my flights surgeon colleagues is in the audience so Blake\nplease pipe in if there's anything else you want to\nadd to the conversation. So for those folks that are\nvisiting from out of town what's the first word said from\nthe surface of the moon for all you Jeopardy folks out there? [ Inaudible Comment ] Houston exactly, Houston\ntranquility base, the eagle has landed. So we're very proud of our space\ncity here and hopefully during your time here you'll have an\nopportunity to see Houston and Kemah and our entire area. The space center is grand place\nobviously, our big Apollo rocket is now covered down here in the\ncorner, but hopefully you'll have an opportunity to see a\nvariety of things, I know Aliska [assumed spelling] is going to\nhave some great tours, as well as some of the academics that\nare going to take place for you here. If you brought your own car be\ncareful going down route 146 Officer Starsky\nwith the radar gun has caught some of our clerks in the\npast, so be a little careful as you go zipping by\nthis area here. So some of the objectives is\nto give you a perspective and a scope of the NASA medical\noperations, highlight some of the unique medical,\nphysiological and behavioral aspects of spaceflight that we\ndeal with, and review some of the challenges for remote care. Our primary responsibility is\nto ensure the health, safety and well-being of the astronaut core\nduring all phases of the flight. So it's a very broad\nresponsibility and we'll tease some of those areas out. Our docs come from a variety of\nbackgrounds, we have about 20 physicians or so, almost\neverybody is clinically trained, as well as aerospace trained. We have a number of folks that\ncome from the military as well and so for many of us our\nmedical care began -- our learning of how to take care\nof folks in high-performance operations. And the as mentioned earlier,\nI spent two and a half years on the John F. Kennedy and we had a -- it's a\ncity unto itself 5,000 sailors and Marines on board. We had about 85 aircraft and it\nwas a very impressive operation. Obviously, we've retired the\nshuttle, how many folks have been to a shuttle launch? So it really is\nsad to see it go. Obviously, a beautiful vehicle\nand so for those that have been done there I think you'll attest\nto the fact that every launch was unique, the acoustics, the\nlighting parameters were all different and it still amazes\nme to think that you can take something that's 18 stories and\nby the time it's clearing the launch pad it's going over a\nhundred miles an hour, so it's very impressive. Some of the physiological\nissues, you've had some experts already come and chat with you,\nbut I'm giving you a look how we break down a couple of our\nkey physiological areas. One of them is our space\nmotion sickness, cardiovascular neurovestibular, musculoskeletal\nand behavioral psychosocial and we'll kind of talk through a\nfew of these different ones. So there are some differences\nwhen we take a pretty normal human being and put them up\nin an environment of space. As I'm standing here right now\nthere's obviously blood going down to my legs, there's various\nmuscles and also the vessels are pushing the blood more cephalad. As soon as you hit the space\narena what happens, you get that cephalad fluid shift. And we're also seeing changes\nwith all these different components here, many of which\nyou'll have some specific lectures on and I know you've\nreceived some bone lectures already. So as I mentioned, the fluid\nin space comes up cephalad, the receptors your aortic receptors,\nyour carotid receptors sense that extra fluid load and\nwhat typically happens? You want to unload\nsome of that fluid. So the astronauts actually the\nfirst few days they diurese, they urinate a lot more\nthe first few days. And there's overall about a 12\nto 15% redistribution, we lose some plasma volume, there's a\ndecrease in red cell mass as we try to adjust for\nthat relative anemia. So when you see the crewmembers'\nfaces initially they're rounder, more cherubic type looking and\nthey also will maybe have more of a nasal congestion type of\nsound that will abate over a period of time. So that cardiovascular\nrebalancing which the body is brilliant at doing is an\nissue for us when we bring our crewmembers home. So we have to adjust various\nissues when they're coming back, we use various fluid treatment\nprotocols, things like we call astro raid or various salt\ntablets and water solutions the period of time before they come\nhome to try to rebuild up that 12 to 15% plasma volume. On orbit exercise has been very\nbeneficial to our cardiovascular system. We've also looked at\nvarious medications. We had a study in midodrine\nfor example, which is used for autonomic dysfunction\nfor folks on the ground. That study went for a little\nwhile and terminated because of some issues regarding things\nin the literature with a QT duration. But medications may have some\nrole as well down the road. From a neurosensory perspective\nit's pretty amazing to think what happens. The computer in the brain is\ngetting all these different inputs because you think about\nhow long does it take to get into space from the pad, anybody\nknow, about how many minutes? About eight and a half minutes. So eight and a half minutes\nyou're on orbit and particularly taken for example the shuttle,\neight and a half minutes they're getting out of their seats\npretty promptly, they're often getting their cameras out to\ntake various pictures of the external tank, setting up\nlaptops, getting out of their gear and it can often be\na very provocative time. So all those different inputs\nthe window's over here you see the sun coming in at a different\nangle, the earth's down there, your crewmember might be upside\ndown and you're trying to get your bearings and the computer\nin your brain is getting all these various inputs, as well as\nyour elbows in your joints the proprioceptive aspects. I know where my body knows where\nmy elbow is right now, but all of a sudden in that environment\neverything is very different. So we have this sensory\noverload that causes some of our crewmembers to get ill. It affects about 70%\nof our crewmembers. Interestingly though in the\nGemini, Apollo or Mercury, Gemini and Apollo program very\nfew astronauts got sick at all. Why is that, well they were in\nessence strapped in their seat? The Mercury and Gemini\ncrewmembers were in essence in their seats they never got out\nfor the most part unless they were going an EVA\nthrough the Gemini hatch. And so the body was able to\nadapt to those inputs versus what we experience\nin the shuttle. So about 70% of our\ncrewmembers get ill. The range of symptoms could be\nanything from just a little bit of stomach awareness to frank\nvomiting that is there's really no projem they don't really\nfeel nauseous all of a sudden boom they're setting up a\nlaptop and they get ill. So that's why sometimes you'll\nsee the photographs of the folks with a little vomit bag sticking\nin their pocket because we encourage them to be very\ncautious with their head movements, keeping their head on\na stick, trying to keep the 1G orientation. For example, in the shuttle when\nthey were going up the ladder not to go diving down to the mid\ndeck from the upper deck, but use the ladder as they\nnormally would until they could equilibrate. We also use various medications. For example, meclizine\noral meclizine, Phenergan intramuscular to help with\nthese various symptoms. A few of the astronauts actually\nhave a voracious appetite, so while some of their crewmembers\nare getting ill and not feeling too well a few of them are very\nhungry when they get up there. How does that translate, well\nwhen they pick their menu items out if you know you're someone\nwho feels pretty good the first day and you watch your friend\npick their menu you might go, you know, you really might want\nto go with the shrimp cocktail the first day or so because I'm\ngoing to end up eating it for you. So some value there. So the neurosensory responses\nthat eventually equilibrates and the crewmembers will say once\nthey break through that wall those first couple of days\neverything is fine and so, therefore, the sense of up and\ndown is really what you choose to define it. We have all this workspace now. The lighting is still set up\nto be on top and some of the footholds here they give you --\nstill have that sense of up and down. But the crewmembers once they\nequilibrate they do very, very well. Musculoskeletal system, I'll\njust cover this lightly, I think Dr. Sibonga was here recently\nand gave you some perspective on it. But the bone and muscles are\nconstantly remodeling due to physical loads and so we're\ntracking this, we're learning a tremendous amount from\nour colleagues in the bone community. And looking at how the different\nspongy bone and compact bone how they react with the balance\nbetween the osteoclast and osteoblasts are and this all\ndovetails into what we do for exercise. Exercise is a key component of\nour ability to maintain muscular strength and as well\nas our bony health. A couple shots here of Jerry\nLinenger back on the Mir space station with the Russians on a\ntreadmill and Bob Curbeam here is in the shuttle mid deck with\nan ergometer, a little cycler ergometer. So currently our crewmembers\nexercise on orbit about two hours a day, it might seem like\na lot of time to you, but for them it's something they look\nforward to, they're doing a balance of aerobic exercise,\nresistive exercise, and some of them are in better shape than\nwhen they left because their schedule is often very, very\nbusy before they left so for them to have a chance to focus. And they're often coming back\nand we're almost able to retire the risk of some of these bone\nlosses because we're really seeing some excellent muscular\nstrength when they come back. Dr. Shannon Lucid here she is on\nthe Mir and you'll notice she's on the treadmill, so\nparticularly for our new folks coming in you'll notice that\nshe has a harness on because obviously due to simple physics\nequal and opposite reactions as soon as you hit that treadmill\nshe's going the other direction. But the Mir was pretty it's\nlike being in the back of your garage, there was stuff\neverywhere and our inventory systems now are much more\ndesigned to help keep a cleaner environment and make sure\nwe know where things are. But she's working out and\nhaving a good old time. And now on the ISS with the\ntreadmill Dr. Thirsk, a Canadian physician and you'll see\nhim there with his bungies. Now Deitra I think you said that\nit should work on the next slide if I double-click it. >> Just double click. >> Okay, let's see how we get. We have a little video clip just\nof him running on that, which you may have seen with the\nexercise class, I'm not sure why this is not taking\non the wav file. And you get a little bit of a\nfeel for the advanced resistive exercise device, you\ngot a sense that. So this device again, if you\nwant to take a quick peek at this see if we can\nget that going. The exercise device the\nengineering behind it allows us to get loads up to 600 pounds. Now think about that for a\nmoment, the device doesn't weigh anything in space it has inertia\nof course, but the engineering is such that we're able to get\nup to 600 pounds for some of the squats, other work\nthat's necessary. So there we go. I might have you just do the\nother one and we'll go backwards for a second after\nthis one is done. But you can see that the motion\nof it this gentleman is working -- one of our Russian colleagues\nis working pretty hard here. But notice there has to be a\nsystem here vibration isolation system because you cannot impart\nthe loads into the vehicle for a couple reasons. You guys and ladies have been to\nthe gym you see people throwing weights down and just\nall that movement. So we don't want to impart the\nloads to a couple of different areas. One of them is where the modules\ncome together at the joints and secondarily and probably most\nimportant is to the big solar arrays. You don't want to get those\nsolar arrays wafting in the breeze from all these energies\nthat are imparted there. So we're were seeing some great\nwork with this gentleman and love the results. If we can go back to the\ntreadmill for just one second, two slides back. And here is the astronaut Ron\nGaran, you got it up I think it just needs to, there we go. You'll see him running and the\ncrewmembers will often watch a movie, listen to some music. How long does it take to go\naround the earth once, anybody know? Ninety minutes, so you can\nbasically -- we've had multiple folks in essence that was their\ngoal to run around the world. We've also had folks that\nhave -- Captain Sonny Williams actually did the Boston\nMarathon, while some of her friends were on the ground\nrunning the marathon she was on orbit performing that. But the bungees themselves and\nthe harnesses they impact some abrasions and some other issues -- thank you, I think we're in good shape. So we often have to deal\nwith some of those issues. So let's just talk about the\nbehavioral psychosocial, this is a big arena for us. The two limiting factors in\nmany respects to go to Mars for example are radiation and\nbehavioral psychosocial. You know, how do you pick six of\nyour best colleagues to spend a couple years with you, how do\nyou pick those people, how do we do that? There's so many factors involved with the personalities and habits. And as we're doing an\ninternational space station with 16 countries we've learned\na tremendous amount. Some cultures, some people when\nthey get very mad they get very quiet. There's other people that get\nvery demonstrative when they're upset about little things. And so the personalities are\nvery important for us to learn about. We have NOLS National Outdoor\nLeadership School where some of our crewmembers will go and some of our physicians Dr. Chamberlain and I have both\ngotten to do that with some of our flight directors. We actually go out in the field\neither on it could be a kayaking expedition or some kind of trek\nand the crew is put in various scenarios where they have to\nlearn how to work together, they learn a lot about their\nstrengths and weaknesses and various leadership styles that\nthey have very, very helpful. And as well as issues not\nhere with our family contact. The crewmembers now have\nwhat they call an IP internet protocol phone where they have\nthe opportunity to call their family up and talk\nto their families. We also have private family\nconferences once a week where they can actually have a video\nlinkup so they are able to see their families. So those elements are all very\nimportant as we try to maximize their health and performance. Anybody know who\nthis gentleman is? This is a shot from I believe\naround 1994 of the Mir Space Station that's Dr. Polyakov,\nhe spent 438 days in space. Now think about that. We're going to close the doors,\nwe're going to get you a little bathroom, a little galley, some\nexercise equipment, some good science, but you're going to\nstay here for 438 days, it's a long time. We have about four folks that\nhave had over a year-long space expeditions and obviously we're\nvery proud of Captain Scott Kelly going up here launching\nvery recently, so his year his clock is starting to\nwind down backgrounds. But I've met this gentleman,\na very interesting fellow. When you first met him you kind\nof were looking for that deer in the headlights look, I mean\nthat's a long time, but he's very engaging and wonderful. But it is a long time and we're\ngoing to obviously have to have a lot more experience in\nthis arena, as well as some ground-based studies to help us\nreally understand some of the cycles of behavioral aspects\nbefore we send folks far away. Another shot of Dr. Lucid here\nshe's got a big smile on her face, she's doing some\nhydroponics activity. Growing some wheat, at least\nI hope it's wheat on space station, but these activities\nare very, very good and very helpful. Fresh fruit is another one when\nthe little delivery truck came up or a visiting vehicle came\nup with some fresh carrots and grapes big smiles on our folks. So these things they may\nseem small, but they're very important to the behavioral\nsupport of our crewmembers. Some different medical events\nthat we've had in the program as I had mentioned earlier with\nMercury and Gemini where we didn't have any space motion\nsickness, we really didn't get anything until really around\nApollo 8 when the crewmembers started to move within the\nconfines of the capsule. We had some space motion\nsickness during EVA Apollo 9, as you recall just went around the\nearth it was to test the lunar lander in earth orbit. And we had a delay in one of\nthe EVAs because of some motion sickness. DCS stands for decompression\nsickness and for those of you -- any divers here you\nunderstand what the bends are. We never really had\ndecompression sickness during an EVA that's been reported,\nbut Mike Collins in his books reported some knee pain that\nexisted when the capsule went from 14 pounds per square inch\nto 5 pounds per square inch 100% percent oxygen, he had some knee\ndiscomfort that arose and that may have been attributed to\nsome kind of DCS for that knee. Urinary tract infection during\nApollo 13, you're all very familiar with the Apollo\n13 movie and how cold that environment got as they had to\npower things down and a urinary tract infection existed\nfor the crewmembers. There was some cardiac\ndysrhythmias that took place on the lunar surface that were\nnoted during one of the crewmembers. The fidelity and the ability\nfor us to look and evaluate cardiovascular issues with our\naeromedical boards is at a much higher capability now, so we\nspent a lot of time really looking at our crewmembers\n-- for all the international crewmembers in that capacity. And then the Apollo test project\nas you recall when the Americans and Russians shook hands and the\ntwo vehicles docked in orbit and when the Apollo capsule came\nback there was a little bit of a leak through one of the vents of\nnitrogen tetroxide and it caused some chemical pneumonitis and\nthe crewmembers ended up just spending a couple of days in\nthe hospital in Hawaii as they recovered and did quite well. So these things\nhave all happened. And in the Russian program\nissues that helped that result -- not resulting in mission\ntermination or early return, but as we looked at a couple of\nthese different areas these arose before our space\nstation was built. So what are the two worst\nthings you can think about in a confined closed environment,\nfire and decompression of the vehicle and those\nhappened in various ways. Some small fires with some\noxygen generating candles. For example, on the Mir we had\na decompression when a visiting vehicle came up and impacted\nit and caused some the pressurization. Kidney stones, we believe the\nRussians had one that they were able to treat on orbit without\nhaving to return the crew member with various medications\nand hydration. And there was a psychological\nstress reaction that took place that may be related to\ncarbon dioxide buildup or the crewmembers not\ngetting along well. A lot of this information we\nnever even were able to get from the Russians for years until we\nstarted to work with them much more closely and had good\nworking relationships with them. So obviously the hazards of\nspaceflight includes some of the issues we've already covered\nin terms of the physiological aspects, but just radiation,\ndebris and various other aspects and we're going to touch on\na few of these in terms of circadian and\ndecompression sickness. From the radiation perspective\nour workers are considered -- our astronauts are\nconsidered radiation workers. And the principle is the ALARA\nprincipal as low as reasonably achievable and so we try to\nprevent the radiation dose for their lifetime experience to\nresult in greater than 3% risk of developing cancer. So obviously, we have solar\nparticle events, cosmic galactic radiation coming in and once\nwe leave the Van Allen belts because currently we're within\nthat and our astronauts get a slightly higher\ndose of radiation. But it's when we start going\ninto deep space that that's going to be a big deal. So how do you develop the\nvehicle to protect them, I mean you can't fly led vehicles\nthat weighs a lot. Do you use water as an\ninsulator, water is known to be insulated for some radiation. We do we have a shield around\nthe vehicle of a certain thickness of water. What about some pharmaceuticals,\nwhat medications can we fly on board that are going to help\nthe DNA repair medications? What about ladies of\nchildbearing age, should we be going and harvesting some of\ntheir eggs so if they eventually finish their spaceflight and\nthey said it's time for me to be a mom or to be a mom again,\napproaching all those different issues. Looking at the genetics are\ncertain crewmembers predisposed because of their genetic makeup\nthat may have more implication due to the radiation\nthey may be exposed to. So some wonderful topics\nfor us to dive into. Anybody remember\nwhat this is here? >> The vomit comet The KC-135, an aircraft that we\nused to have we fly a DC-9, but it flies over the Gulf of Mexico\nabout 26,000 feet in parabolic flight and you get about two\nsecond or I'm sorry about 20, 30 seconds of microgravity and then\ndownhill you're kind of slammed down into the cabin\nunder a 2G load. But this is the vomit comet,\nweightless wonder and you can see some shots here of some\nprocedures that we have to do. For example, here is something\nwith some blood draw and IV. This guy's not having a\ngood day here obviously. And there's some airway\nwork being done here. So a lot of this is to test how\ndo you do these procedures and also to develop checklists. Everything has to have a\nchecklist and a procedure because for those of you that\nhave drawn just a simple thing -- have drawn blood, have done\nsome suturing, every time you touch something basically put it\ndown, but now you got to imagine this floating environment where\nthe alcohol pad you let it go it's going to corkscrew that\nlittle edge of the alcohol pad could easily hit you in the eye\nand cause a corneal abrasion. The end of your suture\nis going to wrap up. All those things have to\nbe taken into account. So a lot of work is done to\ndevelop the procedures that the crewmembers will utilize. ACLS procedures\nhad to be utilized. How do you do CPR? We talked earlier about running\non the treadmill as soon as you hit you're going the\nopposite direction. Well, the same thing when you're\nin this aircraft and you do a compression for your CPR on\nthe mannequin, which way do you think you're going,\nthe other way exactly. So we looked at various devices\nthat you can put compressors on, various belts that you\ncan be close in proximity. One of the best ways was\nactually this piston method where you actually had your feet\nup on top and you were able to get that that vertical push and\nkind of regulate how much force you put on. So very interesting trying to\nfind the simple solutions to problems. We've also flown -- this is some\nshots where we've actually flown this is a pig that we flew and\nwe were doing various procedures here on if we can do a\ndiagnostic peritoneal lavage, which really isn't done so much\nnow because we have ultrasound capability. But it was to look for blood\nin the abdominal cavity. Putting in chest tubes. We actually also fed the cameras\nthrough the urethra and up into the ureters to see if we can\ngo in and kind of snag a kidney stone if it existed here. So there's some great work that\nthat was done over a period of time. Very challenging because you got\nto imagine you're doing these parabolas and you're only\ngetting about 30 seconds and then you're pushed down and then\nyou're also trying to keep all the anesthesia and everything\nelse going with the pigs up there. And then once in a while you\nhave a little bit of fun and you get to spin around here. You can't do this your first\nfew parabolas because if you do you're going to be pretty\nworthless, but I wish everybody would have a chance to\nexperience it, it is an E ticket amusement park fun no doubt. This is to remind me about the\nsettling of dust and foreign body and injuries to the eyes. This is Steve Smith, one of our\nastronauts, who's showing how he had to get something\nout of the eye. The Russian colleagues would\nsqueeze some water and you kind of float in, put his eye in\nthere and kind of blink up and then take a towel\nand then dab it out. And that was how they got\nsomething out because as we're sitting and standing here dust,\ndebris, anything falls to the ground. But obviously when you're\nfloating all those little particulate matters which we\nhope gets pulled out through our filtration system still exists. And we've had occasion where\nfolks have opened a panel behind a -- near a locker and had a\nsmall little piece of metal that was there that got shaken during\nthe launch that corkscrewed out and get in somebody's eye. We've had foreign bodies\nthat we've had to remove. Now that could have a big impact\nif it happens a day or so before your spacewalk, of course. So those ocular issues\nare important for us. We have a device and this is one\nof our colleagues here, Chuck Lloyd, who's in the KC flight\nwith flying basically a little simple set of Speedo goggles. We're trying to figure out how\ndo you go about if you get a toxicological element in your\neye, how do you rinse your eye out? Do you just keep squirting\nthe water with a towel? And so a few folks came up with\na rather elegant way to do this and basically it was a $6.96\nset of goggles with some water hooked up which on the shuttle\nfor example was from the galley and the waste collection system\nwould be through the waste management system. And so basically it was a very\nelegant way to bring water in as opposed to goggles keeping the\nwater out we do the opposite. We put the goggles on, run\nthe water through and that way you're able to go\nahead and utilize it. And we've used it in space,\nwe've used it at least on a couple of occasions. I could think of two spacewalks\nwhere the visor on the inside of the visor you put a thin layer\nof the anti-fog, it's almost like dishwasher detergent\nto keep it from fogging up. And some it's a drink bag -- the\nwater from the drink bag leak got in there and it caused these\nthings to run off and it got in the crewmember's eyes. So when you're in a spacesuit\nyou can't rub your eyes sand so it was very uncomfortable\ntoward the end of their EVAs. And they came into the shuttle\nand put these goggles on and were able to\nirrigate their eyes. So 650 or whatever it is for\nthe goggles probably cost us a hundred grand just to do the\npaperwork and the certification. But it is nice to see that\nsometimes there's an elegant solution to a problem that\ncould be right in front you when you're sitting there watching\nyour kiddies in the pool. So anybody know who this and\nwhere this shot was taken? This is a shot from Skylab and\nthis is Dr. Joe Kerwin, Navy captain doc, first US physician\nin space and he's taking care of Pete Conrad. And this is how he had his\noffice set up, pretty ingenious way for him to go ahead\nand do some medical care. So this leads him to a little\nbit -- some specifics about the support of our medical cadre. And we have what we call private\nmedical conferences that take place with our crewmembers\nin essence, once a week. For the shuttle, for the short\nduration missions we used to do it every day. And everything that's said on\nthe loop, the communication loop is on open air to ground\nfor open consumption. Medical stuff is private, so we\nhave a private conference where we have an opportunity to\ndiscuss with the crewmember how they're doing, a whole variety\nof aspects on their sleep, their physical condition. Remember they're exercising, but\nthere's no showers on ISS, so you got to imagine that. Six months or a year without a\nshower, so they're using various sponge baths, baby wipes,\netcetera so we're monitoring their skin condition. We're talking to them about\ntheir sleep, their rest, any other physical problems that\nthey're having, the medications that we have up there for\nthem for a variety of reasons. So we work very closely with our\ncrewmembers and make sure that we try to maximize their health\nin every way that we can. We have various kits, I'm\nhighlighting this because I just like the way it's -- this is\nfrom the shuttle orbital kit and it's just going to give\nyou the same perspective. We have medical kits for the\ninternational space station, but you can see things are broken\nout by various subsystems. We've got a trauma sub pack,\near, nose and throat, an IV administration sub\npack, drug sub pack. How much it cost to send\n1 pound of gear uphill? If I was going to take 1 pound\nof something and send it uphill, it costs about $10,000 or more. So think about that, so you're\nin charge of designing a medical kid. How are you going to do that? Well you start looking at\nAntarctica, you start looking at the submarine community, prior\nspace experience, aircraft carriers and you try to find\nout what do you really need. Plus we have a pretty good sense\nof the hundred or so different medical conditions that we've\nidentified that really think could have an impact for us. Try to maximize what\nstuff we bring on orbit. So everything is laid out in\nkind of a kit formation and in this case the packs we don't\nhave a lot of room so everything has to be carefully packed. We have -- everything is also\nlabeled so when we open that procedure book that we talked\nabout before everything has a procedure, we tell a crewmember\nto go and get some dexamethasone in slot number 28 and everything\nis queued up so that they can go through and rather efficiently\ntake care of the medical work that they have to. We also have a medical checklist\nup there, so if you name the system whether it's foreign body\nin the eye, if it's diarrhea, whatever it is we also have all\nthose medical procedures listed out as well for them. We also support with -- we used\nto fly a defibrillator, we had a defibrillator for some of the\nspace shuttle missions where we did some science and that's now\nmoved over to an AED and we also have a respiratory support pack\nthat we utilize should there be any issues with maintaining an\nairway either through various serious problem with a\ndecompression hit, a type 2 neurological hit or some\ntoxicological exposure. CMRS, crew medical restraint\nsystem, we have to have a device that we can actually put a\ncrewmember on, strap them on and take care of them, and it also has to be electrically\nisolated so if we're delivering some type of a shock we don't\nwant that delivered to the entire vehicle. So this is designed and we run\nvarious simulations and on orbit training with the crewmembers\nutilizing some of the emergency procedures. What happens when you get things\nin your eye, some foreign bodies in your eye? We have the emergency eye wash\nthat we talked about, we also have a contamination cleanup\nkit because there's been various leaks that sometimes you'll be\nworking on replacing a battery for the spacesuit, the EMU\nbattery and there's compounds that come out and crewmembers\ngo what is this white material. And so we have a hazmat database\nwe can figure out what that is and do they need to put goggles\nor gloves on, what's the best manner for them to\nprotect themselves. So the international space\nstation, how long has this been up on orbit, anybody\nhave an idea? This is a shot from 1998,\nNovember 1998 when the FTB, the Russian FTB functional cargo\nblock and the node 1 unity were put together for the first time. And subsequently, the space\nstation was put together over time until we get\nto where we are now. So just to think this is pretty\namazing to think that we've had permanent human presence,\ncontinuous presence I should say since November of 2000. Think about that for a second. I think most of the public\ndoesn't realize that it's been that long. Who's in space right now, well\nyou know Captain Kelly is in space, but a lot of\npeople don't know. Sometimes that's good that means\nwe are up there, we are doing the work, we are\ndoing the science. And the flipside of it is\nsometimes we're not lighting the fire for some of our young\npeople to really pay attention to some of the unique things\nthat are going on and look at some of the great work\nthat's being done. So the space station as you\nknow, it's about the size of a football field and for our\nclerks here if you haven't had a chance to see this at night you\ncan go on wherever you live type in international ISS sighting and usually just after sunset or just before sunrise as the sun\nangles hitting it you'll see it coming across your area. And it is pretty remarkable,\nit says you'll see it for five minutes and then it comes south\nsouthwest and north northeast and it tells you how many\ndegrees off the horizon and it's pretty accurate. So you go outside and you look\nand it's the brightest object moving it's hauling and\nit really is remarkable. And for us that work closely\nwith the crewmembers to realize that there's human heartbeats\non board is pretty incredible. In particular, if a spacewalk\nis going on and then you scoot outside and you look at that and\nyou think that these folks are hanging off the side of this\nvehicle it's really impressive. So it's over 800,000 pounds of\npieces and equipment and gear were hauled up there over the\nconstruction phase, that's pretty incredible. This is to me is one of the most\nangelic photos of the entire space program, it's Captain\nBruce McCandless in the man maneuvering unit. I just think it's phenomenal,\nwhich I want to lead into the section about spacewalks. So when we look at the spacesuit\nin this case he's on the man maneuvering unit we don't\nutilize this anymore, we use it during a shuttle for\na couple missions. But our crewmembers now are all\ntethered so they can't float away from the space station\nwhen they're doing their various work. But it really just makes me stop\nto realize that this is a space vehicle unto itself. It's got cooling and heating,\nit's got -- they wear a diaper so there's some ability\nto collect fluids. We have a drink bag in there,\nwe have multiple layers of protection from the environment,\nfrom the hot, cold, and also from the micrometeorite. We have a communication system\nin, we have cameras, lights, it really is a remarkable --\nCO2 scrubbing, things of that nature, oxygen delivery. This shot is from the Hubble,\nso this is about 310 nautical miles, you can definitely see a\nlittle bit more curvature of the earth. So we call it spacewalking,\nbut really it's very upper body intensive, very shoulder, arm\nintensive and our crewmembers unless you're on a planetary\nsurface is when you're walking you can see the various\nhandholds here as the crewmembers are going on and\nalso the various tethers so they can't get out of\nreach of the vehicle. And the crewmembers also tell\nyou when they first open that hatch it's pretty breathtaking. They know they're not going to\nfall, intellectually you know you're not going to fall, but\nwhen you open it up and you're looking down 220 miles it's\nquite energizing for them. So during the mission control\naspect of it we are -- the circuit control we're monitoring\nvarious -- we're monitoring the CO2, the 02, the\nbio-environmental such as like the metabolic rate. We know when they're underwater\ndoing their training what their normal metabolic load should\nbe to do a given task. So we're monitoring this and\nkeeping in touch with the EVA officer and the flight director\nbecause if they're doing something and you say man, their\nmetabolic rate doesn't look right, why is that, are they\nworking too hard on a given task, is this going to impact\ntheir ability to continue to work for a few more hours. And so we carefully follow that\nand in conjunction with any medications that they may be on. For example, say if someone\nwas on a decongestant or pseudoephedrine for example, it\nmight impact their heart rate a little bit. So we know that so when we look\nat their metabolic rate and their heart rate we\nbalance all that out. So we have a pretty good\nunderstanding of the physiology. Folks been out to the Sunny\nCarter Training Facility? Even for our folks that work\nhere sometimes we see JSC colleagues that have never\nhad a chance to go out there. Please go out and take a peek at\nthat, it's a tremendous national asset and it's the\nworld's largest pool. It's 100 feet by 200 feet by\n40 feet, 6.2 million gallons. So how much is 6.2 million\ngallons, imagine going out to you corner where you live and\ntaking the fire hydrant and opening it up full-bore January\n1st and letting it run 24 hours a day, 31 days later\nyou can turn it off. That's about how much water,\nit's an incredible amount there. And obviously, we have various\ncranes that we can take pieces in, we don't have the space\nshuttle component in like we used to. But various aspects of the\ninternational space station where our crewmembers\ncan go and work. Dr. Scott Parazynski you see him\ngetting ready to go, he's got various tools set up on his\nworkstation there and he's going to be lowered into\nthe water here. You can see some weights\nthat are put here to make him neutrally buoyant once he's in\nthe water and being lowered in. These are all our control rooms,\nwe have some medical monitors out there. And we have one of our\nphysicians that works there is a hyperbaric trained doc. We have a hyperbaric chamber out\nthere should there be any issues with the astronauts or\nthe folks that are diving. Can't swim in the spacesuit so\nthese divers basically have to move them from one workstation\nto the next workstation. There's also cameras down there\nmonitoring, filming, so folks can see. And the crewmembers when they're\nunderwater there is a certain inertial drive, the water has\na certain resistance to it and also when they're upside down\nthey still have that sense of blood rushing to their head. So we don't keep them upside\ndown for an extended period of time. But the crewmembers will tell\nyou it's the next best thing to being in space and they operate\nabout 10 hours of training for every one hour that they're\ngoing to be doing a spacewalk. Just take a little mental\nsnapshot of this picture and this is on the edge of the\nsill of the payload bay of the shuttle and compare that to what\nit looks like in space and the blackness of space. And the crewmembers will\nsay this is really excellent fidelity training. And here's another picture of a\ncrew member on the -- an arm, a foot restraint being moved\nunderwater and then take a look at this image in space. So that the training, the\nfidelity is really quite wonderful. The spacesuit beats\nyou up though. You're in there and you're\nkind of like the Michelin man, Michelin lady in there the suit\nis there to protect you, but you got to work against the\nresistance of it sometimes. In of our crewmembers we have a\nfew injuries that come up from time to time and for example,\nin this one we have some issues within the fingernails. The nails get banged up and\nthere's some demyelination. So the design of the\ngloves are very important. You think about when you put\nyour hand up what's the longest finger, it's the middle finger. But when you close your hand\nergonomically what's the longest finger now, it's\nyour ring finger. And so it's a little different\nthan just wearing a pair of gloves that keep your hand warm\nbecause you're having to do work against the resistance. So what we're learning is that the design obviously is very important. So some of our crewmembers\nhave these issues not everyone, sometimes it may be due to the\nmoisture component, it could be due to the fact that the length\nof the fingers compared to the depth of the webs. So we try to manage this. We looked at things like\nphenols, Retin-A, various creams. We also for some crewmembers\nwe actually put bandages and Dermabond on there to give them\na little protection and there's other crewmembers that don't\nhave any issues at all. But it's important because if\nyou've ever had a fingernail start to come off it could\nbe a real painful thing. And if you had a few more EVAs\nto do that would not be a real pleasant experience. Here's a shot of the first\nmetacarpal getting banged up over here, MCP joint getting\nbanged up because of the nature of the glove and the\nmetal ring there. Here we have somewhat of a\nlittle bit of a suit pressure on the shoulder, we've had some\nshoulder injuries that take place in the training facility. So we're very careful\nto monitor that. But these things are all\nimportant to highlight because for those divers decompression\nsickness can often result in a joint pain or a discomfort\nin a shoulder or a knee. So we want our astronauts when\nthey're in the tank to really understand what they're feeling\nso if that happens on orbit they go this is very similar to\nwhat I feel in the pool or I'm getting this kind of knee or\njoint pain that I've never had before and maybe a clue that\nwe're having some decompression issues. And you can see some folks\nputting some moleskin on their anterior shins for\nsome discomfort. And here you see that the\nbladder inside the suit was causing some hot red spots and\nwe've had that happen on orbit where a piece of the fold of\nbladder felt like somebody said like a knife was being driven\ninto the top of their foot. And they're out there doing a\nspacewalk and the suit was being pressurized and they were\nout there it was very, very uncomfortable. So we really try to work closely\nwith our suit folks to make sure we get a good fit and look at\nall these different aspects that can impact them. Anybody know where\nthis picture is from? This is the shot from Russia,\nthis is the Russian hydro lab, the equivalent of our neutral\nbuoyance lab and this is the strela arm and you can see there\nthe crewmember is in an Orlan spacesuit outfit. This is a hydro lab and\nit's round as opposed to our rectangular one. And here's an Air Force Colonel\nMike Fink ready to get into the Orlan suit and you can see him\nin this thermal garment and there's various little plastic\ntubes here which carry the heat and cooling through a liquid\nto maintain a comfortable environment for him. And this suit is basically\nunlike our US suit which has a lower torso harness, upper,\nthe gloves, the helmet. This is sort of basically a\none-size fit all you kind of slide in, grab a handle here\nand close the door on it. And basically you do have some\ngloves that are more custom fit. This is a good suit for big\nbulkier tasks, our US suit is much better for some of the fine\nthings that we've done like for example with the Hubble\nrepair, things of that nature. Our suit is 4.3 pounds per\nsquare inch like being at 30,000 feet and the Russian suit is\n5.8 pounds per square inch. So it isn't as much\nof a custom fit. We've had some smaller\ndiminutive ladies in this suit who actually have to pull their\narms up and almost kind of scratch themselves a little bit\nwhereas you could never do that in our suit because it's\na different type of fit. And whereas we have the big\ncranes that come in and pull our equipment out of the bottom,\nhere's a picture of the hydro lab the floor is like a sieve. So the floor kind of comes up,\nthe water drains out, a guy pulls up in his little golf cart\ntype of device and pulls the equipment off and\nchanges it out. So an elegant way to handle a\nproblem in a different manner. At the neutral buoyancy lab\nwe also have a hyperbaric capability there should we ever\nhave to do any treatments in there. We really don't use it for\nresearch per se, but it is out there to treat any of the divers\nor crewmembers that get injured or hurt. We also have an altitude\nchamber out there. Altitude chamber is utilized\nfor us to go ahead and do our physiological testing. So when folks are flying in the\nT-38 or another aircraft we can go up and take them up to 25,000\nfeet or so and get them off the mat so that they understand what\nthe symptoms of hypoxia are and that's very important. To understand what it feels like\nto be a little hypoxic and also important we train them\nseparately on what their carbon dioxide symptoms are. And those are two different\nthings and why that's important is if they're doing inside their\nspacesuit and the sensor goes out of the spacesuit and the\ncarbon dioxide is building up we want them to know what\ndoes it actually feel like. And there are often different\ntype of physiological systems or sensations. Our prebreathe programs, I'm\njust going to highlight this a little bit to give you a sense. When we put folks in those\nspacesuits there is a risk of decompression sickness. Decompression sickness arises\nbecause of nitrogen that's mobilized that comes out in\nsolution and causes impacts either in the capillaries, it\ncan put pressure on nerves, it can get into your brain,\nspinal cord, and so we try to mitigate that. Well one of the simplest ways to\ndo that is to breathe oxygen for four hours before you\nget in your spacesuit. So now think about that we'll\nput you an oxygen mask and you're going to sit\nhere for four hours. That's kind of you're using a\nlot of resources and astronaut's time is very valuable, the\nteam's time on the ground as well. So we look for variously\nstrategies to how we mobilize that nitrogen and get it out\nof your system a little bit quicker. Well, you can't take people\nup into the vomit comet and do those kind of research. So we do various things in\nchambers, hyperbaric chambers and in order to do that we have\nvarious ways that we try to use some elegant solution, things\nwe've learned from the Air Force and other researchers to try\nto get this nitrogen mobilized. So it's along the theory of that\nif you go out and you run, you do some exercise and then you go\nright to the gym and you start to lift some weights your\ncardiovascular system cardiac output I is still going,\nyou're still mobilizing blood. And in our case we want to\nmobilize that liter of nitrogen or so to start getting\nit out of your system. So we come up with little\nelegant ways to simulate microgravity. Well, in this particular case\nwe put people in chambers and we used to have them do various\ntasks like they would utilize their EVA tools, but\nthey're walking around. Well that's not really a good\nrepresentation because now you're loading your\njoints, your hips. And so what we did is we came up\nwith this solution here, we put people in the semi recumbent\nposition, we had various tasks they had to do to simulate\nthings they would do in the suit, we had bungee cords kind\nof giving them a little sense a resistance of the suit. We had a no kidding bathroom\nscale here, we knew exactly how many found pounds of force it\nas if you were locking your feet into the foot restraint\nbefore you were moved. So we would put all this\ntogether, we would choreograph it, we had the astronauts get\nin they go yeah, it's pretty fidelity for\nsomething like this. And then we would put folks in\nthe altitude chamber after we would utilize this to test\nour various protocols. And we also did a lot of\nmonitoring with the heart. When you put somebody in the\nchamber and you want to listen if they're developing bubbles,\nyou listen to the right outflow tract with a Doppler and you\nhear this chirping sound [making chirping sound]. And if you hear those little\nbubble sounds that means you're starting to generate\nthis nitrogen gas. We want, of course, minimize\nthat and we also are trying to make sure that we don't see\nthrough any hole in the heart, patent foramen ovale or any\nother intrapulmonary shunts. We don't want to see bubbles\ngoing from the right side to the left side of the heart. So this is one of our techniques\nas we study EVA bubbles. I'm going to talk to you just\nthe sense -- I just to focus on a couple key things to talk\nto you about our pre-breathe protocol. So if you're watching NASA TV\nand a spacewalk is ready to begin and they say they're doing\ntheir pre-breathe protocols. So what does that actually mean,\nwhat are they actually doing? Well there's a program that we\ndon't utilize right now, but this was the key program that\nallowed us to help build the space station initially and\nit was the CEVIS, the cycle exercise vibration\nisolation system protocol. So what does this actually mean? Well, what would happen on the\nday of EVA you would get up in the morning, you and your\ncolleagues would dawn a mask and you start breathing oxygen. And where these little green\nareas are we'd put you on a cycle ergometer, an exercise\nbike in the space station and you'd start to pedal for about\n10 minutes and you'd ramp up to about 75% of your VO2 max. The purpose of which was to\nkind start of mobilizing that nitrogen, get it moving, get\nit going and this was all predicated on a lot of things\nthat we had done with the Air Force. When that was done you stayed on\nyour mask and then we would take the airlock where you were going\nto put your equipment on, take that to 10.2 pounds per square\ninch, 10,000 feet and then you'd put your spacesuit on. And one of your colleagues would\nhelp two of you put your gear on. Once you're all buttoned in we\ntake you back up to 14.7, we open the hatch and the\ncrewmember who's not going on a spacewalk that day will go back\ninto the cabin and then you'd sit and you'd breathe oxygen for\nanother hour before you'd go out the doors. So instead of four hours\nyou're breathing an hour. And this we utilized as 21 times\nand this was really the crux of how we initially\nbuilt space station and it was very, very valuable. So after a while we realized\nthat there were 21 single point failures that can happen with\nthis and NASA always likes to minimize things\nthat can go wrong. So 21 point failures everything\nfrom the way the ergometer worked to the settings to the\nshoes that you had to the mask, all that stuff added up. So we went to something a little\nbit different and what we came up with this is what we call --\nwe utilized that were campout. Because what the campout\nprotocol was that eliminated that bicycle and it basically,\nthis little yellow line here represents eight hours and 40\nminutes sleeping overnight in an airlock with your EVA partner\nat 10,000 feet to off gas that nitrogen. So imagine you finish up your\nwork day, you grab some urine collection bags and some other\nthings, some food, some tools, some last-minute study you go\nand close the hatch, do a little study, get your sleep. And the next morning you get up\nand we put you on a hose, you go out and get some food, use the\nlavatory, come back in, button up on your suit\nand then you have a 50 minute final prebreathe. So we used this 73 times and it\nwas beautiful because it really was the crux of so many of our\nspacewalks and we've never had a reported decompression hit. Now does that mean it didn't\nhappen, well by and large we try to educate our astronauts that\nif you've got a problem you need to be pretty forthcoming\nbecause nobody wants to be bad protoplasm, nobody wants to say\nwell you know I think I had some DCS. But what's happening is your\nsetting yourself or your buddy to have a problem down the road. So we think we've been pretty\nforthcoming, I think the crewmembers have as well, I\ndon't think they've been hiding a lot of things. We know the suit beats you up\nand there's certain aches and pains you get from that, but we\nreally don't think we've had -- we think we've got some\nreal safe protocols. The protocol we use now is\nit stands for in-suit light exercise. What we were trying to do is our\nholy grail was to get down to like a 90 minute\nin-suit pre-breathe. And what we came up with is that\none where we don't have to do the exercise on the bike and we\ndon't have to sleep for eight hours and 40 minutes overnight. So the in-suit light exercise\nprogram basically utilizes the simple principles of movement\nand exercise and increased cardiac output and getting\nrid of those nitrogen bubbles. So the protocol we use now we've\nused it 16 times to date, the crews love this. Because basically they get up in\nthe morning, they prepare, they have their breakfast, they get\non a mask for a while and then we go down to 10.2, the airlock\nis decompressed at 10,000 feet and then they're\nputting on their suits. And after that's all done they\nbutton back up, their colleague gets out. Now they're in their suit for\n50 minutes and when they're in there they're doing\nthis light exercise. And this is things that we've\nlearned over the years, we put all this together. And the light exercise it's\nbasically a series of leg movements that are pretty light,\nwe affectionately call it the hokey pokey because the\ncrewmembers are kind of doing this and we train them on the\nground to understand what that metabolic rate is. And for those that like\nthe numbers it's about 6.2 milligrams per\nkilogram per minute. That's like walking a mile in\n70 minutes, that's not that intense. Four times around the track\nin 70 minutes it's not a lot. But it's an effective way to\nget that nitrogen immobilized. So the crewmembers are able\nto go out the door, so it's a shortened protocol where you use\nless assets and it's been very effective and easy for\nthe crew to perform. Everything the crewmembers do\nare often in these checklists. Now we could have a bad day and\nDr. Chamberlain and I and others we practice our simulations with\nour biomedical engineers and the whole control team during\nsome of our simulations. So we have to ready for\nthat day when you can have a decompression hit when\nthe crewmember says, I am experiencing pain in my shoulder\nand hip like I've never -- this doesn't feel like the normal\nsuit rubbing up against me, this is different, I can't grab my\ntool anymore or I've got some paralysis or weakness on one\nside and it may be because of a decompression sickness. Like I said we've never had\nthat, but we got to be ready for it. So we have a series of\nprocedures which incorporate various switch throws, change\nouts for carbon dioxide scrubbing, etcetera, as well as\nother medical procedures as we utilize -- basically we're\ngoing to utilize the suit as a treatment vessel. We don't have a hyperbaric\nchamber on ISS and some flight directors will tell you can fly\nthe entire Brooks Air Force Base chamber we don't want it if it's\ngoing to hurt somebody and not be utilized very well. And so we look at is there any\nportable chambers, things of that nature and we haven't\nreally found anything that's compelling to fly yet. So we use the suit as\na treatment vessel. So if you were in your spacesuit\nand you had a decompression hit we would bring you back into\nthe vehicle so you'd be at 14.7, which is normal atmosphere\nplus 4.3 in the spacesuit. So you would stay in that for a\ncouple hours until your symptoms abated. So theoretically, for those that\ndied if you got hit we would take you in a chamber like at a\nlocal hospital down to 60 feet of seawater and that's\nthe pressure load. So, theoretically in our suit\nwe can get almost 112 feet, 113 feet of seawater by just\nsimple Boyle's law of physics. So we hope that that would work\nand that's what we simulate. This shot is to remind me of\ngoing around the earth in 90 minutes, 16 sunsets\nand sunrises every day. And so sleep is important and\nyour circadian rhythm is going to change for a little bit. You can see the crewmembers this\ngentleman is floating in this capacity, very relaxing to sleep\nin that environment like that. Here's some other shots of\nfolks sleeping in the shuttle. We have individual\ncrew sleep stations. Now even just look at some of\nthe interesting things, this gentleman always liked to\nhave the sensation of his head against the pillow, so he\nwould have his head like that. We have this other gentleman\nwho liked the sensation of being jammed under some covers, so you\ncan see him in kind of tighter. Some folks wear\nearplugs and ear marks. So they really do sleep quite\nwell, they're slated for about eight and a half hours sleep\non the space station, they typically don't speak as much\nmaybe six and a half to seven. But the environment is pretty\nquiet and pretty comfortable and so sleep is very,\nvery important. This is just to show somehow we\nutilize our circadian shift this was during STS-108, but similar\nprinciples when we go over to Star City in Russia and\nlaunch through there. So in this particular case, you\nsee these lightbulbs to show that we use some bright light\nas we were shifting them. We had conference rooms in the\ncrew quarters of up to 10,000 watts of light, light is a very\npowerful stimulant to help make some sleep adjustment. So we would go ahead and\nutilize various techniques. So when you look at the\nphysiology of it obviously, darkness is going to be working\nto help stimulate melatonin for sleep and light of\ncourse, changes that. And we're not going to go into\na lot of depth on this, but the key thing I just want to show\nyou is that when you look for peak melanopsin which helps\nsuppress melatonin, the peak is about 480 nanometers of light. But what does that mean and\ninitially some of us we were a little uncertain of this. Is this a little bit of voodoo\nor does this actually work? So the idea of the blue light\nand I don't endorse Phillips products just to let you know,\nbut this just to show, this is a little device for example that\nemanates light at about that frequency. And why we're utilizing items\nlike this is that in the middle of the night in the mission\ncontrol center if you're the person getting up at 2:30 in the\nmorning and you got to go work some mission control shifts. What happens at 4:35 in\nthe morning, you're in your circadian you're feeling\nlike dog meat it is not good. The first night usually you do\npretty good you got it out of you, you\ngot a little coffee, but the second and\nthird they're often the worst. So we will often look at the\nlighting in here and we actually in some of our workstations have\nthose little lights that are available. And for those folks that travel\na lot go overseas, we will often allow them to go ahead and\nutilize that so when you get to a different area and you get up\nand you want to try to adjust your biorhythms utilizing\nsome light is very effective. And to the point where when you\nlook at the space station, I mean there's various areas where\nwe have lights and a ton of gear, but we're also looking\nat the lighting in the space station is going to be changed\nand eventually it's going to be changing in your home as well. So when you get up in the\nmorning you're going to have a higher frequency of that 480\nnanometer type of light, it's not going to really look blue\nper se, but it'll be different. And as your day goes by your\nlighting scheme is going to be more normal. And then at home at night you\ncan set your lighting such that you start to get a little bit\nmore of a reddish wavelength not red like those that have ever\nbeen on a ship and we try to adjust your vision at night, but\njust a higher percentage of that light to help you kind\nof download a little bit. Because what's the worst\nthing that happens, what does everybody do with their\ncomputer there or their little Blackberry, they're all playing\non their phones and that's the worst thing before\nyou go to bed. You're sitting there looking\nat this your phone and it's the exact opposite of what\nyou should be doing. So we're doing some neat things\non orbit eventually to change the lighting. I'm going to talk just a little\nbit here to give you an idea of one issue that's high on\nour list and things that you might've heard or read about is\nsome visual changes that we've noticed for some of our\nlong-duration crewmembers. And it is a change in their\nvision oftentimes that's a little bit of a hyper-shift,\nit's hyperopic such that their near vision, have little more\nproblem with their near vision. But what really noticed we saw\nsome crewmembers coming home and they weren't complaining\nof any symptoms at all. But when you examined the back\nof the eye you started to see some swelling back at the\noptic disc and cup area. And you look at that and you\ngo that's a little odd, are you having any symptoms,\nno I'm doing fine. You know, they might be at that\ngiven age where they're starting to have some presbyopic changes which take place with age normally. But we started notice some\ndifferent things, anything from some cotton wool spots to some\nfolds in the back of retina to some flattening of the globe\nhere and it led us to start looking at things. What's going here, what is\nphysiologically happening. We know we've got these fluid\nshifts coming up is that impacting it? Are we changing the intracranial\npressure, is there something going on within the brain spinal\ncord system that dovetails into the optic nerve,\nis that an issue? So we started to look at things\nwe were doing tonometery, eye pressures, we started\ndoing ultrasound on orbit. We now have a device called\nOCT ocular coherence tomography where we can actually measure\nthe thickness of the retinal layer. We're trying to get all this\ndata and put it together and figure out what's going on. We're seeing it in some crewmembers, not all crewmembers. We're seeing it sometimes in\njust one eye not another eye. Does this have something to do\nwith the salt load that you eat in your diet? Is it intracranial pressure? It is something with the\nresistive exercise and all that -- what we generate\nthe forces there. So this is one of our big\nenigmas right now that we're trying to continue to get data\nat and maybe it'll help us with some on earth issues as we try\nto translate all the sciences we learn to issues on the ground. But this is a very, very\ninteresting phenomena that we're trying to chip away\nat and get smarter on. And now our Russian colleagues\nand our internationals are working with us as well. We have ultrasound, we do\nultrasound for various organ systems and it's a\ntremendous tool for us. And here you see Don Pettit he's\ndoing some ocular ultrasound as well for us, doing some of\nour science and clinical work. So coming home, as we're\nwrapping up here today we obviously don't fly the shuttle\nhome, but a nice shot from Kennedy. But we're going back now to some\nof the physiological issues. Remember we talked earlier we\nsaid we lose about 12 to 15% of our plasma volume, well when we\nwant to get some of that back when the crewmembers come home. So here is just a simple example\nthat right around landing for the shuttle a few hours before\nwe started to do a fluid load. As I mentioned, this kind of\nsalty solution kind of a chicken consomme type of thing to\nincrease that salt load, retain some fluid. So of that 12% loss we've got\nmaybe -- we're back about 5% of that loss, so that when we hit\nthe ground and we got out of the vehicle we were able\nto do better on that. And so that was interesting\nphysiological work that we did. Even after only 10 days of\nspaceflight this is 10 days before flight and this\nis at return plus zero. So if you're flying a vehicle\nand you're tracking a moving target you're just watching\nsomething, your head, your eye and the target. Your eyes move in a certain\ncapacity here and you can see the eye movements. But look at this, look at this\njust look at the variation this is only after 10 days in\nspaceflight how the systems adapt. So this could have been an issue\nfor us somebody's trying to land the shuttle and as you know, the\nshuttle is a glider you only got once chance to do it so you want\nto maintain that visual system. So we actually used to\nhave a laptop on orbit where the crewmembers would practice some\nof their visual landings and try to overcome some of these\npursuit tracking issues. So some very\ninteresting physiology. So when the crew landed, here's\na shot at Edwards Air Force Base with the shuttle we had all\nkinds of devices that come up to safe the vehicle and make\nsure it was in a good safe capability. We see a little vehicle over\nhere like you've seen at the airport in Dulles for example,\nthe people mover and this is where we had our entire\nmedical suite in there where we have various little emergency\nmedicine suits, we had some recliners, we kept it very cool. We also were able to do some\nvarious sciences here and we used to make that right up to\nthe shuttle and we'd begin some of our sciences pretty quickly. So now you fast-forward here\nto what we're doing, here we're launching out of Baikonur in\nKazakhstan with a crew of three and it still takes about eight\nand a half minutes to get in space. It's based on the\nsimple physics there. And where we are we're\ndealing with areas in Russia. So this is the longitude is\nabout 12 time zone differences and you're basically almost\nnorth of Kabul, Afghanistan if you will and it's on the\nother side of the earth. And that's where we're coming in\nand our vehicle was coming home under the chute and just\nbefore they land there's some retro rockets that help slow it\nand they use the term here the steps of Kazakhstan. And you know here's part of the\nwelcome wagon and here you see the vehicle landing on its side\nand the helicopters and this is how we get there, Dr.\nChamberlain and I and others that rotate over there. This is how you get there\nbasically through the Russian system. And here you see the crewmembers\nbeing extracted from the side and we try to minimize their\nmovements because things can be very provocative. You've been in space for six\nmonths and now you're trying to do a lot of this and those head\nmovements can be very, very provocative. And here you see another way\nif the capsule lands vertical, there's a stanchion they put\nin here you get your elementary park amusement ride down here. But this is the slide so the\ncrewmembers are extracted and we try to keep their heads still\nand then bring them right down here. And you can see they're a little\nbit pale and they got that pensive look like\ndon't move too quick. And there is a range how folks\ndo, some folks have a lot of difficulty and other\nfolks adjust pretty well. And then they're hauled off in\nsome chairs as we bring them over to some medical facilities\nand it's a tent that's put up and in there you can see the\nsnow in this particular case. And in there we have some of\nthose cubicles that we can start to desuit the crewmember, we\ncan start intravenous because they're usually\ndown on some fluid. We can start to consider giving\nthem fluids, we can start doing some basic sciences there, and\nwe don't stay there very long. We get back into these vehicles,\nmove the crewmembers over to the helicopters and subsequently\nload up on the helicopters and then fly back a couple hours\nto an airport for example in Karaganda and at that airport\nwe'll have the NASA 992 aircrafts. So this is pretty amazing to\nthink from the time they land we can have them back at Ellington\nField typically in about 24 hours to see their family,\nthat's pretty impressive, it really is. And in there we have our crew\nsurgeon, as well as another physician, so we\nhave it laid out. We have a variety of medical\nequipment and capabilities and so we're able to put them down\nand let them rest, give them the appropriate medications as\nwe need to, additional fluids either by mouth\nor IV, and acclimate. We have two stops on the way\nhome, one's in Prestwick, Scotland and one's\ntypically in Bangor, Maine. Crew health coming back,\nrehabilitation is very, very important and we have a 45 day\nintensive program where the astronauts are working almost\nevery day for a couple hours with our trainers and it is\nremarkable to see the changes and how quickly\nthey're coming back. All that work we're doing\nfor their aerobics and their musculoskeletal work is paying\nhuge dividends because we're seeing them come back. We want to mitigate risk, we\ndon't want people getting hurt because they're not in\ngood physiological status. So they're coming back well. And even every day almost\nhour by hour you see their neurovestibular\naspects come back. Some of the crewmembers will\ntell you that they do make a few mistakes at home. For example, if they have\nsomething in their hand now they're at home they got a\ncoffee cup and the phone rings or something they just let go\nof the coffee cup to go get the phone well everything crashes\nbecause they're used to just letting things go for example. The shower, they haven't had\na shower for a long time. Some crewmembers will tell you\nthat it's the most heavenly feeling on earth to\nhave that first shower. Other folks will say the\npercussion of the water pellets on their back was a little\nuncomfortable, it felt weird. Sitting, so you've been sitting\nhere for a good hour you haven't been sitting on your toochie in\nspace for six months even though you get on an ergometer you're\nmore kind of standing on an ergometer when you're pedaling. So when we put them back here we\ntake them to the lab and we try to test their VO2 max, sometimes\nthey peter out not because their legs are tired it's because\nthe seat is really comfortable. And we try to buy really nice\nsoft gel lined seats, but there are certain things that\nare very interesting. On the exam besides the\nneurological things that Dr. Chamberlain and I deal with\nis the skin for example, you almost kind of molt\nto some degree. So right now if I was to go and\nexamine all of your elbows and your feet and your heels ladies,\nyou know what I'm talking about right whatever those special\nemollients are for your feet. Their feet come back they're\nlike little baby's feet because after about a month or two they\nalmost kind of shed that thick layer of skin. So when you look at their elbows\nthey're little shiny, pink, soft skin. The same thing with their feet\nthey're just like these little pristine little feet because\nthey haven't had that impact forces, they're not wearing\nthose same shoes, they're not scuffing up against them. So there are some very\ninteresting physiological differences that we see. And I only have a few more\nslides here as we close out. I want to talk to you a little\nbit about the personal aspect of some of things we do. I'm sharing this slide this\nis STS-134, next to the last shuttle mission. And this was the crew they were\nbringing up the alpha magnetic spectrometers. So for the science folks\nout there alpha magnetic spectrometer is really\nto study dark matter. And Professor Ting, Dr. Ting\na Nobel Prize winner was very involved with the design and\nimplementation of this and this crew brought it up. And a great group, an Italian\nastronaut, they have an Air Force, a Navy guy and Captain\nMark Kelly and you probably know who Captain Mark Kelly is. Well Captain Kelly's wife was\nGabrielle Giffords and she's a U.S. Congresswoman and January\n8th, 2011 she was shot. And I'm telling you this story\nbecause part of what we do is all this great science, but we\nreally have -- these people are our family. And I was the crew surgeon for\nthis mission and the day this happened was a Saturday and I\nwas -- I had done some coaching some lacrosse and we were\nwatching game film at a pizza place with our team and I see in\nthe corner of the place I see a picture of Gabby Giffords on the\nTV and what's she doing up there and I look and then I see this\nhorrible banner that she had been shot. I picked up my cell and called\nMark I go Mark, where are you and he goes I'm in my car. I go do you know what just\nhappened, he goes yes I found out I'm on the way\nto the airport. He had a friend who had a\nprivate plane that was going to take he and his\nfamily out there. And a few hours later I found\nmyself in Tucson Arizona and I walked into the emergency\ndepartment almost in disbelief that this just\nactually happened. As I'm walking in I asked Mike\nwho's running the trauma program at Tucson, Arizona. They go well it's Dr. Peter\nRhee, I go Peter Rhee I says is he a Navy guy, Korean\nbackground, former Navy guy, retired and they\ngo yeah that's him. Dr. Rhee and I were in\nAfghanistan or in Iraq at the same time in 2005 serving with\nthe Navy and the Marine Corps. So my comfort level went from\n0 to 99 in a heartbeat because he'd been there, done\nthat, he'd seen it. And the care that she got was\nphenomenal and eventually we were able to transport her\nback to Houston, Texas for her rehabilitation. And she's a remarkable lady,\nit's a remarkable family. But there's a lot of tremendous\ndecisions that have to take place on how do you fly a guy\nlike this he wanted to go back and fly in April, the shooting\nwas in January and in April was when the first\nlaunch attempt was. So how do you as an\norganization, how do you come together and say okay, can we\nfly this individual while his wife is still\ngoing through this. He's had a lot of training. The folks that he's worked with\nthese guys really wanted him to fly if they could. He knew the mission well,\nbut what's going on. So this was a very interesting\naspect for us to get our medical team together, our behavioral\nfolks, our psychiatrists, our representatives from the\nastronaut corps and to figure out how we make a determination\nis he safe to fly. He's flying a $3 billion\nspacecraft with another couple billion dollar alpha magnetic\nspectrometer, you're paying for it as taxpayers are we doing\nthe right thing putting him in. And Mark is a remarkable guy and\nwe went through a very detailed evolution where we had a plan,\nwe looked, we monitored him, we put him back into some\nsimulations, into some flying environments in a T-38 and other\nthings and he had all these checks and balances to the point\nwhere we got an opportunity to say, you're good to go, you\ncan go fly this mission. It very motivating for him, very\nmotivating for his wife and for the crewmembers. First launch attempt was in\nApril and that day the mission was scrubbed as we were putting\nthe crewmembers in the vehicle there was an auxiliary power\nunit heater line sensor failure, so the crew never even\ngot in the vehicle. So we brought them\nback to the quarantine facility. And as we're bringing them back\nin the quarantine facility the phones are going off Air\nForce One was landing. Air Force One was landing\nbecause the president and his family were showing up, they had\nnever seen a shuttle flight and they were going to\ngo see this flight. And Gabby Giffords actually came\nover there as well during part of her rehab she got flown there\nand so she was going to have a chance to witness\nher husband launch. Very, very motivating\nacross the board. But the President of the United\nStates wants to go and see the crewmembers. Well, if anybody works here they\nknow about something called HSP, Health Stabilization Program. It really doesn't matter who you\nare you're not getting to see the crew in quarantine until\nthere's a screening process involved. Now why is that, it's because\nnot only do we want to keep these folks healthy before they\ngo uphill think about who's on orbit. There's six individuals on orbit\nwhose immunological system is dialed down a little bit, we\nknow that immunological system isn't as responsive\nto various problems. So we have this program we've\nonly had one mission in the history of the space shuttle\ndelayed because of illness, it's STS-136, the commander got ill. A couple days later after an\nupper respiratory infection we were able to fly. So we screen folks. So if you were a trainer and you\nwere going to come in and give the crew some last-minute\ntraining at the Kennedy Space Center you would go through a\nseries of evaluations the doc would make sure you're\nhealthy, etcetera. So now the president wants to\ngo meet with the crew and I'm handed this baton and I go -- I\ncalled the White House physician and I said, you know with all\ndue respect it doesn't matter who you are, we have to go\nthrough a certain process. If you can tell me that the\npresent is absolutely healthy, he has had his flu shot, he is\nnon-communicable, afebrile, you tell me he's good to go we will\nclear it otherwise, it's not going to happen. So he says okay, I'll call\nyou back in 15 minutes. He calls me back he goes okay, I\ntalked to the president we want you to do his\nphysical, I go what. Next thing I know I am brought\ninto this room after the Secret Service does their handy-dandy\npat-down and everything and this is a shot from the Kennedy Space\nCenter where the president, his wife and his two daughters and\nhis mother-in-law are there and I'm brought into this room and\nthe president comes up he goes okay doc, what's the story? And I go well sir, I'm thinking\nthe whole time I'm going why do they want me to do this if\nanybody else if the White House physician says the president\nis good to go he is good to go. Then I said well maybe this is\nplausible deniability because if something goes wrong it's\nthe NASA guy's fault right. So I am explaining to him now\nthat we have this -- just as I shared with you, we have this\nHealth Stabilization Program and we have certain wickets to check and I explained this to him very carefully. And then there this was this big\npregnant pause and I was kind of unsure what he was going to say,\nthen he goes doc you do what you need to do we don't want to be\nthe ones to get the crewmembers sick. Roger that sir,\nthank you very much. So we proceeded to do a -- make\nsure that everything was in place, did a limited physical\nexamination and eventually cleared him and then had to\ndo the same with his wife. So they were able to spend\nsome time with the crew. So it was a very interesting\nevolution that you just never expect. I mean I don't think later that\nday when I called my kids up I go you're not going to believe\nthis, you know, my whole mission that day was to keep my crew\nhealthy and get them ready for launch the last thing I\never expect was to meet the president, let alone examine\nhim, I mean it just doesn't happen right because\nthat's the White House. So anyway, you've got to be\nready and for the future docs of the world here the other bottom\nline is you've got do your medical work with him like you\nwould do with every other single patient, don't cut corners\nbecause sometimes you can't be intimidated by who somebody is\nyou've got to proceed and do everything like you normally\nwould because if you don't do that that's when you're going\nto make an error, that's when you're going to make a mistake. So lock that in your mind. So if you're taking care of --\nat the military base if you're taking care of a general or a\nsenator you've got to everything the same on everybody because\notherwise you can make those errors. But anyway, it was a great honor\nto meet them and they had some quality time with\nthe crewmembers. The last couple of slides,\nanybody know who these folks are? This is the original seven, the\nMercury astronauts getting ready for some of their\nfield training. And this particular gentleman\nover here is now in his 90s John Glenn and he flew on the STS-95\nand Senator Glenn he was like 77 years of age when he flew,\npretty remarkable if you think about it. And I think we learned some\nthings about the fact that if you take care of yourself\nphysiologically you never know what's going to happen to you,\nwhat's going to end up on your plate. He was, of course, volunteering\nhimself to learn some things about geriatrics and other\nphysiological aspects that might be of value added. But he went up and he did some\nremarkable things up there for us and it was a big motivator\nI think for folks back at home they're sitting on their couch\nrealizing if I take good care of myself I might not fly in space,\nbut I can have some pretty good years ahead of me. So where are we going from here,\nwell a lot to be determined. The space station is in essence\nbuilt, we're going to be doing a lot more science here. Hopefully, our commercial\nprograms will be able to get us up there. We've got the Orion program on\ntap, we've got the space launch system hopefully to get us into\ndeeper space opportunities. How that's going to translate if\nwe're going to have a chance to go back to the moon and here's a\nshot of what was conceptualized as the Altair lander and perhaps\nsome folks advocate going back to the moon. Whatever planetary body we go to\nwe have a lot of issues to deal with in terms of whether it's\n1/6 gravity, 1/3 gravity, what about the various compounds and\nhow is the dust going to be an issue. And you're not going to be doing\nan EVA once or twice, you may be doing an EVA almost every\nday or couple of days. So there's a lot of interesting\nmedicine and physiology that awaits us. If we go to the moon how do you\nuse the lunar regal then, how do you use this as a protective\nenvironment from radiation? We had an encounter between two\nof the different landing on the moon where the crew could have\nbeen in grave danger for acute radiation if they were on\nthe surface at that time. So we've got to have warning\nsystems and we've got to be real smart on how we protect\nour crewmembers. So some good work ahead of us. And Deitra, I just wanted\nto click this for a second. This is a couple of short little\nvideos, but this came up from a summit we had. We brought back the Apollo\nastronauts, particularly the ones that landed on the moon. And we were talking to them\nabout various things for example, we were talking about\nthe design of a habitat, to live on on a surface and about how to\nmake it quiet and [inaudible]. And one thing that they said\nthat was very interesting they go don't make it too quiet. And we go what do you mean\nby that, there was something innately comfortable about the\nhum and the sounds of fans and motors, it means the vehicle\nis working in essence. So it was an interesting little\ntidbit yeah, make it quiet but not too quiet. We also talked to them about the\nspacesuits as we're looking at the next-generation spacesuits. How do you design that? When we see people fall on the\nsurface of the moon we're going to look at that here, we were\nasking what kind of loads, what did that feel like when you fell\nor you moved, how much torque on the elbow, on the back because\nwe want to look where do we put the center of gravity with\nthe PLSS we call it, the life-support system. And it was very interesting for\nthem and I just want to show you a couple of these\nif we they pop up. As we're queueing this up, but\nbasically when you see them they didn't actually walk\nthey kind of loped. Remember that kangaroo walk\nat 16 gravity they said that was the most efficient manner for\nthem not a simple gait, but kind of a loping gait and it was\nphysiologically good for them. But when they fell we were\nwatching some of this and we go oh my God, that's got to be\ntough and they go it was like falling on a bed of pillows\nin essence, it wasn't a lot of torque on our joints. So I think we learned a lot from\nthose kind of discussions and hopefully we'll utilize\nthat for future events. I think we may just no joy okay. And they were basically and\nyou could online and see them they're about 20-second clips\nand it just shows the crewmember working on picking up some rocks\nand he stumbles and falls and the legs come flying out and\nhe hits the ground and when you first see it you go whoa\nthat cannot be good. But in essence it wasn't\nthat bad of a load. We'll just press that's okay, oh\nthere it is, there it is, hey we got it. I don't know what you did but. That's okay just queue me up and\nwe'll just proceed that's good. And again, 2 30-second clips if\nyou ever want to have a chance to look at it. So in closing, you know,\nDecember 17th, 1903, 66 years later we're on the surface of\nthe moon, pretty incredible. So what we're going to see\nin the next few years given a budgetary balance and giving us\nsome zest it'll be very, very fascinating to see where we go. This gentleman is obviously --\npassed away the other year, but Neil Armstrong and when you\nthink about -- when you're thinking about 1492,\nwhat do you know? Columbus sailed the\nocean brew, the brew. Thinking about beer here. He sailed the ocean blue. So the fact is that that's\nwhat marked that epic of time. And when you think about what's\ngoing to happen here a thousand years from now when people\nlook back at our epic they will realize that this is the first\ntime humanity stepped off our planet and went to do a\ndifferent celestial body. So for those of us that are\nin the arena of taking care of these, you know, we look at it\nas our mission statement of we take care of the men and women\nwho go into space, willing to go into space and do science and\nwork and explore on behalf of all mankind. So I think we all collectively\nhere that work here try to support in whatever way we\ncan this this noble venture. And with that I will close and\nthank you for your attention, hopefully we shared some good\ninsights on how we from the medical operations side view\nour role, some of the challenges that we have, and we would be\nmore than happy to take any questions. [ Applause ] Yes mam. >> How do you account for eye changes on orbit? You know, if they are experiencing any change in vision. Do you have spare, various contacts or glasses or somethign like that on orbit, or has that not really been... >> Good question.\nSo how do you handle, the question is\nhow do you handle any ocular changes that\nwe're having on orbit? Well, obviously it's of concern\nto us because it is a single point failure, you only\ngot one set of eyes going. We do have a couple things one\nthing we have is we have some glasses and crewmembers\nsometimes will notice some differences over time because\nremember their focal distance is typically within the\nconfines of a node. Every once in a while they do go\nlook outside and have a chance to change their focal distance. But we do have some glasses that\nwe fly that are almost what we call variable, there's an\nopportunity with a little bar to change the curvature of it. This kind of had its origins\nback on some of the things that the Navy and the Army and others\noverseas would do, various parts. I'll give you an example, some\nof the healthcare that was done in parts of Africa where these\nfolks never had access to glasses and they had these\nglasses you put on and you inject silicone through a\nstopcock and it changed the curvature. And all of a sudden somebody in\na fairly rural environment can go oh my goodness, I\ncan see and I can focus. And you close that off and\nthey had an immediate pair of glasses. So that principle of just\nchanging the curvature of the lens is something that\ntransformed into a little bit fancier version where\nwe can utilize that. So we do fly some\ndifferent glasses up there. We are now looking at the\nchallenge of what medications can we fly that if these\nsymptoms get worse, we haven't had any real problems, but what\nhappens if they get worse and it's really noticeable. Are there medicines for example,\nfor any of you that have gone to high-altitude environments\nDiamox, Acetazolamide we use that for glaucoma\nand eye pressures. But does that have a role,\ncould that help us out. So we're looking at a\nvariety of medicines. But there is no magic -- one\nmagic cure I know, we got to figure out why does this happen. If any of you out there know\nof a non-invasive intracranial measurement we love that. We're looking at the\ntechnologies around the globe on that. How do we measure without having\nto put a bolt through the skull, how can we measure\nthat pressure? Is it an intracranial pressure\nissue or not, that's something we really need to tease out. Any the other questions? Yes mam. >> Has anyone received stitches >> Has anyone received stitches? We have had some injuries for\nexample, somebody may be moving too quickly through a given\nmodule and banged their head up on a hatch. We've had some injuries where\nfolks we actually use a compound called Dermabond, it's like\na superglue that's safe for biological tissues, so we've\nactually closed those up. And I think we have had a couple\nof scenarios where we've had a few stitches put in, in a minor\nway but not what we thought it would be. A lot of ocular issues, we've\nhad foreign bodies in the eye and procedurally that's one of\nthe things we've had to deal with. Yes mam. >> What kind of protocols have you considered if someone does end up with a flu or cold? >> Protocols for the flu or cold, very similar to what you do on the ground in terms of keeping somebody well hydrated we have various decongestants, we fly medications like Claritin non-sedating antihistamines, pseudoephedrines, Afrin nasal spray. We also have antibiotics that we\ncan use if we think it's turning into a bacterial infection. We also have some nasal inhalers\nof people getting any bronchial spasms that sometimes folks\nwill get a cold and they end up having a little bit of a\nresidual cough or a little bronchospasm, we have some\ninhalers that we can use for that. >> Do you assume more than one person would have the problem under those circumstances? >> The question isn't how do we\nassume more than one person is how you get the virus\ntransmitted up there. Obviously if they're up there\nfor a stable period of time there should be no entrance\ninto any new virus. So when our upcoming crews up,\nwe do spend time on the order of three weeks or so in quarantine\nor a couple of weeks in quarantine with the crew in\nBaikonur and we monitor them very carefully. We really limit who's coming\nin, so we've been very blessed. We have not had\nany big problems. We've had one or two issues in\nthe shuttle days where we think that there was some late\ntransmission to the crewmember, perhaps there's some trainers\nor family, but we've been very fortunate it hasn't impacted\nus in any substantial way. All right, well great thanks for\nquestions and thanks for your attention. [applause] >> I just want to inform you of upcoming classes we have coming up. On the 14th of april we have the human reseach program overview with-", "Do2c9yrtVXg": "hello let's talk about plasma cell neoplasms a 63 year old woman is visiting primary care because of back pain during the past several weeks she's also having urinary urgency and pain with urination she wakes up frequently to urinate you do a bmp you see sodium potassium are normal creatinines elevated calcium is elevated and total blood protein is also elevated so your cbc she's got a little bit of an anemia her hemoglobin is at a 10.2 hematocritic of 31 but white cells and platelets are normal so you get some imaging done and you see that she's got some kind of compression fractures here in the spine of a couple different vertebrae there's one at about the uh that's about l2 right there and then that would be about t12 so a couple of compression vertebral fractures along with that hypercalcemia you're saying okay there's some bone remodeling going on but particularly that total protein is really interesting to you and because she also has an elevated creatinine you know her kidneys are involved so multiple myeloma is high on your list test question asks what's the most likely explanation for this patient's increased total protein concentration and this is when they expect you to know what the m protein spike in multiple myeloma is when we say m protein like letter m what the letter m means is monoclonal okay it is a monoclonal protein because it is produced by plasma cells which have turned neoplastic therefore these cells themselves are monoclonal you have a bunch of the exact same plasma cell which is just an activated b cell and it's making a bunch of the exact same ig molecule so in multiple myeloma it's igg now if we were talking about this disease called waldenstrom macroglobulinemia then you would see an igm spike in the blood so that's what walden strum is it's essentially multiple myeloma but there's an igm spike instead of an igg spike okay so multiple myeloma always always it's igg or maybe it could be iga point being the plasma cells have class switched already that's what makes multiple myeloma multiple myeloma and not waldenstrom macroglobulinemia so they're very very similar but one's making igm that's waldenstrom and the other one multiple myeloma is making ig anything else okay here's another question 68 year old man with a six month history of back pain and fatigue he's at the ed because of severe low back pain so you do some routine labs and you find he's got anemia with the low hemoglobin and hematocrit he's got normal white counts and platelets it's a normal acidic anemia sodium potassium chloride bicarb normal but bun and creatinine are hinting that there are some kidney problems going on is glucose is normal but calcium is a teeny tiny bit elevated so again because you understand that multiple myeloma has a textbook uh constellation of symptoms then you're gonna have that high on your list here and those symptoms by the way they're crab and that stands for hypercalcemia uh renal involvement anemia and bone pain so those are the four textbook symptoms for multiple myeloma which is the most common plasma cell cancer back to our patient you take an mri and patient has multiple lytic bone lesions you do a bone marrow that's pretty extreme but you do a bone marrow and you find small round blue cells and you hit the jackpot you dug up the treasure chest you found the multiple myeloma or the related plasma cell neoplasm so then the question is what's a feature present in the most likely affected cells so because you diagnosed multiple myeloma correctly you understand that these plasma cells are making immunoglobulin and you understand that the rough er is the organelle involved in protein production and notice ribosome isn't an answer choice otherwise you might have chosen that but rough er is covered in ribosomes that's why it's rough and not the smooth endoplasmic reticulum so protein production rough er don't forget your basics another case we have a 72 year old hispanic man with a chronic cough and he visits the clinic because of a sharp pain in his ribs that started this morning after an episode of severe coughing so he fractured a rib he was coughing so hard he's been very fatigued lately and has some unintentional weight loss you order a chest x-ray which reveals a rib fracture an osteolytic rib fracture particularly so a pathologic fracture and you do a bone marrow on that probably that rib that's affected and you see small round blue cells uh clueing you in that these are plasma cells they've got huge purple nuclei they're very condensed they're back to back to back uh maybe round blue cells isn't the best way to call it because that's what we call neuroendocrine cells but they're definitely small round and dark so then the question is what lab abnormality do you most likely see so because you know that hypercalcemia and lytic bone lesions are part of the constellation of myeloma you're going to say hypercalcemia a couple answer choices that could have thrown you off here the ign spike on electrophoresis man they really wanted you to say that but you didn't because you knew that igm if that were up a bunch of monoclonal ign means that the diagnosis is waldenstrom macroglobulinemia okay and that's the only thing that's going to give you a monoclonal igm spike so even though we call it m protein in multiple myeloma understand that doesn't mean that it's igm it's igg or iga or light chain protein a lot of different things that could be elevated in the blood but not hygiene then there's another one saying decreased red cells white cells and platelets you can see some cytopenias as multiple myeloma or any other plasma cell neoplasm progresses and that's going to be because the bone gets taken out but that's going to be late late late in the progression of this disease and at that point white cells would probably be within normal limits or even elevated it is a white cell cancer after all here's another question a 66 year old male with new onset bone pain and fatigue with exertion bone pain is most prominent in his back and is exacerbated with changes in position he's running a slight fever he's also got a productive cough and pleurisy on physical exam you hear crackles and increased feminists at the left lower base so at least this one they're not completely giving you the diagnosis you know it could be pneumonia it could be past disease tb right could be uh maybe a squamous cell or a different lung cancer that's metastasized to the spinal column so your differential is still a little bit broad here you get your lab values back you're going to see a moderate anemia 8.9 uh hematocrit at 27. it's normal acidic and your white cell counts a little elevated platelets are normal but then they give you creatinine and calcium and that's the only other two lab values that they give you so you know exactly where they're going with this you have to have kidney involvement renal injury usually it's aki and you have to have a hypercalcemia fit the criteria for multiple myeloma and so calcium is elevated correct means normal but getting a little up there you do a bone marrow on the guy you're doing a bone marrow on all these patients they're giving the diagnosis away and you see these plasma cells inside the bone marrow uh and that's the question it's plasma cells there we go so then of course the other answers metastatic bone disease a lot of different cancers there um remembering that prostatic adenocarcinoma likes to give you blastic tumors another highly tested concept here's a 46 year old with low back pain weakness and flu-like episodes his urine output has decreased and he's got point tenderness over his lumbar spine so you run some blood electrophoresis again you're a great doctor you know exactly what to order and you're gonna see a spike in the gamma region of this blood protein sample and i want you to understand that this is exactly why it's called a gamma globulinemia because it's in the gamma region on electrophoresis so that makes sense and it's a big spike because again it's a monoclonal gamma globulinemia it's the exact same protein over and over and over and over again because this plasma cell cancer is the exact same cell over and over and over again so it makes sense why there's a spike in that region here's the question which mechanism explains this patient's decreased urine output this one's pretty tricky even if you got the diagnosis you still want to remember that multiple myeloma gives you protein emia a lot of protein in the blood and so it's going to give you protein urea as a result and particularly it puts this thing called bentz jones protein into the urine and vince jones is just a immunoglobulin light chain but what's really important to know is that vince jones protein forms a tag team with uh tam horsefall protein which is naturally produced by the epithelial cells of the renal tubules and so vince jones and tam horsefall tag team you know uh kind of like uh wrestlemania or something and so they complex together and get stuck in the renal tubules and that's an obstruction of the normal flow of urine and so if you've got a big big crystal in the middle of your proximal convoluted tubule as you do in this image here you know do you think any urine is getting past these crystals no they're roadblocks and so what happens the pressure builds up proximal to the obstruction the glomerulus swells and gets damaged there's your rise in creatinine okay so that's why aki is a big part of the multiple myeloma picture you got a protein anemia that's going to lead to casts in the protein here's another example right here uh we're looking at a big obstructing basically a stone or a crystal inside the proximal tubule and how do i know it's the proximal tubule well the the cells have a little hair on them remember proximal tubule cells have that hair and distal they're just flat they're bald and so there's this crystal in the pct that's an obstruction pressure builds up proximally the glomerulus gets damaged eventually there's your high creatinine last practice question that we have a 59 year old man shows up reporting lethargy weakness and bone pain for two years time he's been frequently urinating and his urine is yellow and frothy and what i want to tell you is that frothy is a synonym for bubbly and anytime you see frothy or bubbly urine you're thinking protein urea okay so he's also had a history of a pathologic hip fracture a year ago you take an x-ray and you see several small hypodense lesions in the hip and spine so lytic bone lesions then you're going to test serum protein and it's elevated so you electrophoresis and you see increased gamma globulins you know what this diagnosis is what's the question well okay what do you see in the glomerulus of the kidney when you biopsy it so go back to amyloidosis what is amyloidosis well it's a disease in which different proteins can misfold into a shape called beta amyloid that your cells cannot break down they cannot get rid of it so it builds up inside cells until those cells die and you can get focal organ damage you can have amyloid accumulate in your liver or in your pancreas or in your brain or in this case your kidneys and so this patient's got kidney failure due to amyloid building up and this is particularly an al amyloidosis the a stands for amyloid the l stands for light chain and it's because these cancerous b cells that are clonal in nature are making a ton of immunoglobulin light chain and ig light chain is the protein that misfolds to give you amyloidosis in multiple myeloma so here's what it looks like we got a photo of it on the right hand side here this has been stained congo red and notice how those glomeruli are indeed pretty red and none of this surrounding cells are so you know it's not a routine h e only the glomeruli are sticking and that's where you're going to see the amyloid build up in multiple myeloma it's going to get stuck in the gbm glomerular basement membrane as well as the messaging in the sub endothelium so you would see fibrillary deposits that stain positive with congo red thus denoting amyloid a bunch of practice questions highly highly tested concept let's run through this sdl and try to catch anything that we did not hit with the practice questions so a plasma cell neoplasm or a dyskrazia is a clonal proliferation of an activated b cell known as a plasma cell that's making immunoglobulin against a particular antigen so it's pretty easy to diagnose these things once you get a hunch for them because again you're always going to have a monoclonal protein and in the case of multiple myeloma that's called an m protein but the m does not mean igm never forget that the m means monoclonal and so in multiple myeloma the cells themselves are making iga or maybe some igg but they are not making igm that's walden's from macroglobulinemia so because b cells grow up in the bone marrow these uh plasma cells you know they're mobile they can go anywhere in the body they want but they like the bone marrow that's home for them you can always go back home to your mother you know and so plasma cells get the bone marrow they start making a bunch of interleukin-1 which is also known as osteoclast activating factor and they also start making a ton of interleukin-6 and both those are pro-inflammatory cytokines they're going to activate osteoclasts and break down bone hence the hypercalcemia that's characteristic of multiple myeloma so this is a common disease it is a disease of the elderly median age of diagnosis 69 years you virtually do not see multiple myeloma in a young adult or a child the axial skeleton is most often involved so the skull and the vertebral columns and the pelvis and ribs this is important here to diagnose multiple myeloma there has to be greater than 10 plasma cells on a bone marrow biopsy so when you take cells out of the bone marrow you're going to put them on a slide and some poor pathologist is gonna sit and go one two three you know you know some of the best pathologists i've heard they can count up to the six digits you know and not even have to take a break for snickers or anything but you're gonna count all these plasma cells and if more than one out of every ten cells is a plasma cell you've got yourself multiple myeloma well actually we're not done yet because you also need the presence of crab symptoms to diagnose it as active multiple myeloma otherwise you got a smoldering or kind of a latent multiple myeloma so greater than 10 percent we're calling it mm and then you can separate it into smoldering or active based on the presence of those crab symptoms calcimia renal involvement anemia bone pain bone lesions and if you have less than 10 percent of plasma cells on a bone marrow biopsy but you have like the the clinical picture and it's a plasma cell cancer there's just not enough of it to diagnose multiple myeloma what we will call that instead is monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance or imgusts and the way that it got explained by dr buck clinical medicine professor here is that all patients with multiple myeloma had mgus at some point and it became multiple myeloma but not every patient with mgus is going to turn into a case of multiple myelomas that's how you ought to think about it uh plasma cells they have a clock face or spoke wheel nucleus that's how they like to tell you in words not pictures they could have dutcher bodies which are intra-nuclear inclusions of immunoglobulin here's one on the far right they could have russell bodies which are cytoplasmic globular inclusions and so you're going to see spheres or circles if they're in the nucleus they're dutch or if they're in cytoplasm they're rustled okay what do you stand him for you can stand him for cd 38 and cd 138 i love it when the numbers are similar like that so 138 is a little more specific for plasma cells sometimes they express cd56 but that cd138 is what you want to write down in first aid just in case here is a table of signs and symptoms the major ones i have outlined again anemia that's a crab feature bone pain that's a crab feature elevated plasma creatinine reflecting renal involvement that's a crab feature and then hypercalcemia that's the c in crab and then pathologic fracture is also a very very common presentation remember this is the elderly so you're usually going to be working up osteoporosis or something like that so you don't want to bark too far up that tree before you consider multiple myeloma because again you want to rule out those uh kind of less favorable diseases first and fatigue generalized weakness as characteristic of just about any neoplasm so the hypercalcemia is going to be due to osteoclast over activation that's how they might posit that in the question stem and again the over activation of osteoclasts is because b cells make a ton of pro-inflammatory cytokines il-1 il-6 they even make rank ligand and remember rank ligand is something that osteoblasts normally send out whenever it's time to chew up some bone and we do have a monoclonal antibody against that that is called denosumab that is a pretty good treatment for osteoporosis now renal involvement in multiple myeloma is somewhat complicated you can handle it but you got to read this section maybe a couple times and understand it so two things going on number one monoclonal ig light chain is directly toxic to renal tubules number two you get casts okay so those are two different things so monoclonal ig light chain we said that in multiple myeloma you've got monoclonal igg and monoclonal iga sometimes you don't sometimes all you have is the monoclonal light chain and so that ig light chain is nephrotoxic now that ig light chain also likes to form casts in tandem with your tam horsefall protein that's gonna obstruct your proximal tubules cause a back up in flow make the glomeruli swell there's your nephropathy so that's one mechanism of getting a nephropathy also remember you can get an amyloidosis in multiple myeloma that can also aggregate within the glomeruli between endothelial cells in the basement membrane uh another word for tam horse fall protein is uromodulin just in case you want to make a note of that tam horsefall uromodulin you get anemia again because the bone marrow is involved uh at some point you got to almost it's normal acidic normochromic you do see a higher rate of infections in multiple myeloma patients owing to compromised b-cell function amyloidosis i summarized it here basically you've got immunoglobulin light chain misfolding in forming beta amyloid sheets that can't get disposed of so they build up and lead to organ failure and we're going to call that again an al amyloidosis and a lot of different organs can be involved commonly the heart the liver and the kidneys here is a picture of a normal serum protein electrophoresis notice that there is no spike in the gamma region okay so if you had in protein inside the blood that's a monoclonal protein and 97 percent of patients with multiple myeloma have this m protein inside their blood and the amount of m protein in the blood is proportionate to the cell mass of the tumor now the most common ig secreted by a multiple myeloma is igg bottom of page five that's pretty important sentence so here's what it looks like on electrophoresis if you do have a bunch of igg in the blood here's your gamma region on electrophoresis and again that's why we call it a gammopathy and if you were to subdivide that and break it down farther you'd see there's a bunch of igg and iga on this patient's electrophoresis and then you also see some kappa ig chain and a little bit of gamma here and on the right here's a different patient who also has multiple myeloma but they've got a kind of a biphasic gammopathy here you've got a ton of igg no iga involved here though and then you've got a lot of the gamma light chain rather than the capalite chain so those are the players involved and you can essentially have any combination of all those proteins igg iga light chain kappa light chain gamma and so uh all these patients are different what they have in common is that there's a monoclonal protein in the blood you don't know which one particularly it is until you do electrophoresis is a protein urea in a majority of patients again if there's a lot of protein in the blood there will be a lot of protein in the urine and we're going to call that vince jones protein also known as ig light chain here's an example of the lytic bone lesions in the skull you get it's classic textbook for multiple myeloma don't really need to know genetic features understand you see trisomies and trans locations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene and i think that'll be enough to see it through an exam question here's a linux vertebral fracture commonly a first presentation of myeloma the pathogenesis so virtually all multiple myeloma cases are preceded by mgus everyone with multiple myeloma gets mgus but not everyone within gus gets multiple myeloma so mgus is defined as you have in protein there is a monoclonal protein but it's of a pretty low concentration and there are clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow but it's less than 10 cellularity so kind of qualitatively it's the same thing as myeloma but quantitatively it's not quite hit the degree or the threshold of disease that we would want in order to classify it as myeloma because finally you do not see crab symptoms you don't see a calcimia anemia renal failure or lytic bone lesions in an m gus sub monoclonal gammopathy so just telling apart the subdivisions of plasma cell cancers if you can do that that'll get you two three four questions on an in-house exam correct how do we get m gus in the first place because again this is a precursor lesion for myeloma well you get exposed to an antigen and you got a b cell that gets turned into a plasma cell starts making making antibodies against that antigen but then the plasma cell sees the exact same antigen again and this triggers class switching so understand this class switching component in the etiology of the disease is why multiple myeloma does not present with a monoclonal igm protein because igm is the default and you have the class switch out of it and anytime you do you go to g then maybe a then d etc on down the line and so if it's igm that's waldenstrom macroglobulinemia that's what i want you to get out of it and then after you class switch then you kind of get the second hit of the disease i put first hit that should say second hit um because this is going to be the two-hit genetic model involving any tumor suppressor gene remember you don't have the two-hit model with an oncogene rather that's a gain of function mutation but two hit model that's a tumor suppressor gene and uh it's essentially going to be two hits involving the ig heavy chain gene so i think that's gonna be enough to get you a fundamental understanding of what's going on here again because it's that ig heavy chain uh the cell kind of gets stuck on on and so hints the monoclonal protein other mutations accrue the cell kind of gets immortality starts making copies of itself same exact ig gets put in the blood monoclonal protein you can have an extra medullary myeloma that's not in the bone marrow that's a very bad prognosis and then here is a important section to round things out with called other plasma cell neoplasms so multiple myeloma your biopsy the bone greater than 10 cells or plasma cells and you have crab symptoms let's go through the differential if you were to not see any crab symptoms and if you were to biopsy the bone and there were to be a plasma cell cancer but it wasn't greater than 10 cellularity then you would call that monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance so right there in the middle of the paragraph that's what you want to know for the test they will give you this information in the question if they want you to say imgus same thing with smoldering multiple myeloma they'll tell you that you do a bone marrow and it's greater than 10 plasma cells but the patient does not have characteristic crab symptoms that's what deems it a smoldering rather than an active multiple myeloma then we have the solitary plasmacytoma which is essentially multiple myeloma without crab features you do have greater than 10 percent in the marrow but what's really particular is that this is a localized rather than a diffuse cancer you only have one single solitary lytic lesion in this sp solitary plasmacytoma so a lot of these do go on to become multiple myeloma just one lesion then there's plasma cell leukemia which is a more aggressive variant of multiple myeloma where it's not just in the bone it's in the blood too and so diagnosis is going to be confirmed by in the bloodstream greater than 20 plasma cells and so that's the bloodstream not the bone marrow you do see a monoclonal m protein here but again we're going to be calling it a leukemia because it's going to be in the blood not just the bone but also plasma cells highly prevalent in the blood then we have light chain deposition disease which is defined as essentially al amyloidosis without the amyloid okay so in amyloidosis there's misfolding of immunoglobulin lychee in light chain deposition disease you get light chain and all these tissues and it hurts the tissues it just doesn't misfold into amyloid so you can't stain it congo red and that's about it instead you see these granular inclusions rather than fibrillary tangles as you would see within amyloidosis so the kidney is usually hurt with light chain deposition disease and something pretty important is that the kidneys develop nodular glomerulosclerosis which is the exact same lesion that you develop in a diabetic glomerulopathy remember those are going to be like christmas ornaments right uh big old christmas ornaments inside the glomerulus they're just pink they're totally pink they're acellular and that's what you're going to see with light chain deposition disease no amyloid state then there's poems syndrome memorize what that stands for you got a peripheral neuropathy that tends to be bilateral and symmetric and we can we might as well stop there because nothing else in this sdl so far gives you a bilateral symmetric peripheral polyneuropathy so that's definitely putting poem syndrome in your differential for the purpose of a test question other than that looks very very similar to multiple myeloma with a monoclonal gammopathy and lytic bone lesions however you do not see anemia or hypercalcemia so it is a little different but again that symmetric bilateral polyneuropathy is characteristic for poem syndrome you do see skin involvement they might hit you with the what else would you see in this patient and then you might have to know something just plain occult obscure like hypertrichosis you know so uh there is skin findings as well there's organomegaly two and endocrine problems and then we in this sdl with waldenstrom macroglobulinemia friends what i want you to know is that this is essentially the exact same thing as multiple myeloma except there's igm in the blood instead of igg other than that you've got living bone lesions you've got some renal involvement you've got some hypercalcemia you definitely have plasma cells in the bone you can have some organ swelling hepatosplenomegaly lymphadenopathy and then something that's particular a couple of things particular to walden's term are going to be number one hyper viscosity syndromes which like to present in a fondoscopy fundoscopic examination you're gonna look at the eyes and then if the blood vessels are all dilated and torturous you know there's a lot of volume in them and then number two because waldenstrom has a monoclonal igm spike sometimes you get a cryoglobulinemia think back to our autoimmune hemolytic anemias remember that warm anemias are igg without fail every time and that every cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia involves igm like mycoplasma for example okay so if it's igm you can have a cold hemolytic anemia and because you see an igm spike in waldenstrom that's why you can see a cryoglobulin agglutination then finally rolos i'm sure all of you know what this is by now a rolo is just a stack of poker chips of red blood cells and they're stuck together because there's a lot of proteins inside the blood changing the charge in between each individual red blood cell so normally electrical uh electrostatic interactions keep them repelled properly from one another but in the case of a protein emia there's a lot of nitrogens on protein since a lot of positive charges most proteins are basic and so that degrades the negative charge that holds red blood cells apart and that is about it for this sdl there's a myd88 gene that you do want to see with uh or do you want to kind of write down for waldenstrom but other than that now you understand plasma cell neoplasms just go back through that other neoplasm section remember how to differentiate or classify these cancers apart from one another and you got it thank you very much", "HIVRN4JbLxM": "thank you and welcome so today I'm talking about some of the top nutrition myths and I actually talked to several my colleagues I sent an email out on the listserv months ago and said you know what are you hearing as nutrition myths so that I'm making sure I'm covering the ones that all of us collectively hear so number one detox diets work lose makes you fat and tired this comes over and over again soy AG masculinity masculinize as men we don't need Gary four counts calcium artificial sweeteners are poison and we can get all of our nutrients from food the other huge I wouldn't even call it a myth is the whole topic of carbohydrates so if you weren't in the last session I encourage you to come to I think it's at 3 o'clock to listen to you Alan Aragon and Jeff Alec debate about carbs because that's constant low carb paleo what do I do etc I'm so first about a little bit about detox diets and cleanses which are all grouped into one and they're based on the theory or the actual reality that we are exposed to environmental toxins pesticides allergens waste and inflammatory substances through food on a daily basis these build-up in our diet these build up in our bodies make us six fat and tired and you know this is a true depends on the person as far as allergies and it also depends on the person as far as what we call food sensitivities so some of these vary between people but detox diets and cleanses and there are a plethora of them I'm going to cover a couple of them but supposedly get rid of harmful substances they cleanse your organs help you lose weight give you energy decrease inflammation decrease disease risk does anyone have clients on these diets now and are they experiencing success do they like them are they fatigued yes okay so some success most of them if you look at the body of or the all the detox diets out there the majority no alcohol no alcohol no caffeine cut out all the highly processed foods basically if it comes in a package unless it's provided by them like it's a juice or some substance provided by them cut it out completely no foods grown with herbicides or pesticides so it's got to be organic no simple sugars and it's very regimented so one of the best things about these diets is that it and also they have different regimens as far as laxatives diuretics lemon juice maple syrup etc depends on the particular one but one of the best things about these particular diets is that they cut out so many different foods that people you know people go on them and go oh my gosh I lost 20 pounds this thing's a miracle well they're cutting out all the junk they're cutting out the beer the sodas the cheese nips at night etc so it's not necessarily a miracle but it can help them and if that's what helps them for a short period it's safe I'm okay with it here are some of the most popular ones The Master Cleanse is actually the that's the lemon juice maple syrup one raw food diet blueprint cleanse and that's one where you're you're given a bunch of juices by mail and then the colon cleanse so the good like I had mentioned it cuts out a lot of low quality food it's you know people are going to feel better if they cut out all the garbage in their diet and it makes it pretty easy instead of sitting there giving somebody a specific diet and going okay let's work on portion sizes let's work on this let's work on that this is okay clear-cut yes no you can have these things on this you got to avoid all those things so there's no thought process involved which honestly makes it easier for people also cuts out excess calories might eliminate some food sensitivities and this is an interesting area does anyone have clients that have been actually tested for food sensitivities there are a couple of different tests out there and it's different than allergies but basically after being going through the tests it will identify foods that you're highly reactive to moderately and low reactive - once you take those food out supposedly people feel better at energy the best science is probably on food sensitivities and headaches or migraines and then digestive distress the raw food diet another benefit of this is possibly fewer carcinogenic compounds consumed and in some instances fewer nutrients lost during processing as we process foods many nutrients are lost if you took a let's say you you chop some vegetables high in vitamin C you leave them out for a little while you're making dinner etc then you put it on your plate by the time you actually consume them they're not going to contain all the vitamin C that was in the original food likewise cooking methods decrease many nutrients some increase them as far as certain antioxidants but processing destroys a lot of nutrients and a lot of antioxidants and I also mentioned fewer carcinogenic compounds consumed on the raw food diet so grilling baking roasting these all anytime you put a food a particular food under high heat it actually increases the production of cancer-causing compounds in it and meat when you expose it to high heat so cooking fast in cooking a very high temperatures you'll get increased production of header cyclic means and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons but I don't tell people hey you've got to give up grilling forever what you can do to decrease those and it's mainly again it's meat and fish etc decrease the temperature so low and slow cook your food low and slow cook over moist heat that decreases the production of these compounds microwave meat first then throw it on the grill get your you know the charring that you like and if you have hamburgers or turkey burgers add herbs add things like rosemary garlic etc adding those will decrease the formation of these now I've got a question for you all what do these two have in common that's potato chips or it could be well could be french fries and cigarettes can anyone guess take a stab they have acrylamide x' which are these ones were produced during high heat cooking meat organs etc fish acrylamide are actually produced in greens grain foods and plant foods also pie crust and the darker the crust the darker the you know if you burn cookies etc the more acrylamide but again the common thing here is high temperature frying roasting baking its sugars plus an amino acid that combined and interestingly enough there are many industries that purposely produce these compounds for grouts water treatment products plastics and cosmetics so they have a function they actually have a purposeful use in our lives they do cause cancer at very high doses and animals and in people the FDA will say you know not a big deal don't have to get these out of your diet they're not incredibly harmful and people at very high doses so those who are working in these factories they've noticed nerve damage so a little bit about the raw food diet those are the benefits for the raw food diet but a little bit about the research and there's not much on it here's a cross-sectional study of over 200 raw foodies as I'll call them that were on it for at least two years and they conceived at least 70% raw food and with this particular diet you can consider yourself a raw food e if you consume 70% or above basically raw food and then cook some of your foods and they had 1500 1800 grams or raw food daily and they found that 38% were b12 deficient that's really high the normal prevalence of b12 deficiency in the population is about 1 to 15% but lack of animal-based foods you're going to have a lower increase or unlikely that you'll consume b12 none of them had high triglycerides that's a good thing 46% had low serum HDL so there's some good there's some bad another study and this one was in a 216 men 297 women and they examine body weight in amenorrhea and I wish they had looked at many other variables because they were on this diet for so long almost four years and they divided them into different groups so the amount of raw food in their diet and they found that the BMI was below normal and fourteen point seven percent of men in 25 percent of females and 30 percent of women had either oligo materia so they're missing some menstrual cycles or amenorrhea now the bad about detox diets and cleanses there's no credible evidence of safety or efficacy there's no indication that hey these are going to work through clients they're going to work for athletes they can be very restrictive making it tough to follow especially for those people who travel all the time or those people even some of them are very high in fruits and vegetables like really a lot of fiber in them so you know you're going to take that into consideration low calories low energy fatigue headaches and dizziness for the people who have had a client's did your clients experience entities could they work out could they work out on this diet no not really low in protein and so that's obviously concern in the lower calories in your diet the higher amount of protein we actually need to maintain our muscle mass so really bad combination let's say you've got somebody on one of these detox cleanses for ten days five six hundred calories minimal minimal protein in and I'm talking like 2030 grams maybe on some of them and then they go to exercise they're not going to have any energy and you know the ability to increase muscle growth and repair muscle tissues can be pretty negligible decreasing athletic training and performance and it might perpetuate disordered eating and some people they'll gravitate toward these things and they'll gravitate toward diets in general because it's a way to continually restrict food intake it's a okay way to do it the other thing about these diets is they're low in nutrients in general I mean anytime you cut your calorie intake you're going to wipe out a lot of different nutrients and very low and they can be low in fight chemicals the juice cleanse probably pretty high because it's all fruit and vegetable juices very low in vitamin D they all cut out dairy low in calcium low and zinc iron and b12 which are two things if irons the most common nutrient deficiency especially in women and b12 is actually considered fairly common but many other B vitamins omega-3 so basically you cut out a lot of nutrients you need for good health and a useless this is one thing that I you know when always say okay detox diets today they help you cleanse well that's what your organs do are no tears or mucous linings they filter out dust bacteria allergens skin is very protective against harmful substances our kidneys filter wastes about two quarts a day that passes through urine for everybody going to the reception later your liver will metabolize all the alcohol you drink there okay you don't need the Blue Point cleanse or any of those cleanses to do that unless maybe you drink too much I don't know but that's the job of your liver so our organs do all those things so that that point of the cleanse I don't really understand but done right again I I don't argue with somebody that really is adamant about something I say short-term sure you want to do it a couple days don't work out during that period take it do it during a time when you're taking a couple of days off from your training help your clients choose the one that does the least harm so consider looking at their diet and then going through the cleanse with them and going okay maybe not this one but why don't you try this one for a few days if you're stuck on doing a cleanse again consider workouts and I would never recommend cleansing if somebody has an injury or illness due to the increased metabolic demands to recovery from the injury or illness now what about gluten you here are clients on a gluten-free low-carb etc type diets very common so I hear this all the time we can't digest gluten most people are gluten sensitive eating gluten-free equals weight loss this is the most common one brains are poison gluten-free means better athletic performance and in fact this year around last year around the Olympic time a couple athletes came forward said you know what hey I'm gluten free and my athletic performance is so much better because I took these foods out of my diet so there's some anecdotal evidence but what is gluten it's the major storage component wheat it's made from glidin and glutenin and gliadin and glutenin are the blue foam roller looking things and griding are the red balls but it's not just in wheat it's in all of these different and in corn is a ancient wheat farro spelt semolina so it's in tons of foods ryan barley and this is from one of the foremost professors on celiac disease at university of maryland Alessa Fasano and this is actually the little red ball so that's the glidin and he identified parts that he believes have cell destruction activity immune destruction is a green and then gut permeating activity in the blue I'll talk about that in a minute but where is gluten and many times I had people tell me hey I'm gluten free and then they're drinking a beer while they're telling me and I'm like you're not gluten free you know or hey this gluten free diets doing me so much good and then you know they'll put some salad they'll go to McDonald's put salad dressings on their salad most sauces dressings contain gluten tons of different supplements contain gluten and sometimes it says it sometimes it doesn't sometimes it's harder to find licorice tons of candies unfiltered vinegar contains gluten and of course beer wine does not and it even appears in lunch meats in a play your peers and malted beverages and due to cross contaminate it contamination french fries as well as tortilla chips I thought tortilla chips are corn right so one day I went home I was looking up something on Mo's and I'm like oh my gosh they make their tortilla chips with wheat wheat corn combo but where is it and this is from a colleague of mine who actually has celiac disease and these are the things like if you have any clients there that want to go gluten-free they these are some of the words just a few of the things that they actually have to look for and avoid so it's everywhere it's all over and if you are at a plate let's say you're at a restaurant or you're at a friend's house I'll give you a story my mom was cooking something gluten-free for a neighbor and I said you know you have to wipe the surface of the counter because you just baked something else and you have to bake it in separate you know separate pan make sure that doesn't have weed on and she's like nonsense but the flour actually can stay in the air for about 24 hours so many restaurants even you know they'll say oh we've got gluten-free this or this was made on a gluten-free line but they've got a completely clean and wash down the equipment equipment for it to be gluten free and preferentially have some sort of barrier like a wall or there's big straps between gluten free and gluten containing items so what is celiac disease it's an autoimmune disease that actually occurs over a period of time it doesn't just happen like that and according to dr. Fasano and others it's a combination of the genetic susceptibility plus the consumption of gluten that causes the celiac disease and in those who have celiac disease what's interesting is all of these grains don't contain gluten corn rice buckwheat etc but they can cause increased sensitivity for certain people so in celiac disease the damages of villi of the small intestinal intestine and actually can cause death of some of the villi very patchy death which is interesting is when they go in to do intestinal biopsies they've got to take it in several areas because if they took one you could have damage in another and so when they're looking at it they may not actually recognize that you have celiac disease but the death of that villi that's where you absorb many nutrients so one of the commonalities people will come in and they'll have unresolved anaemia can't resolve it with eye and like what's going on they may have osteoporosis may have below and other chronically deficient vitamin D and it's not resolving and that could be due to celiac disease because their body just can't absorb it even with high supplemental doses there's an increased prevalence over the past several years and it's not just because of detection methods what's interesting is they're over 300 symptoms most commonly we've always heard hate it causes GI distress but according to all the researchers that's actually not the most common symptom it's anemia that's the most common symptom other autoimmune diseases are very common in people with celiac disease especially Hashimoto's thyroiditis and there's one more out type one diabetes so when I get somebody that you know all the sudden develops a Hashimoto's and they've got these other things going on I'm like you know you may want to get checked for celiac here's the iceburg motto model of prevalence and basically it's showing that most of the people with this disease are actually undiagnosed there's just a small percent that are diagnosed and then at the bottom there are tons of them that have latent celiac disease and those are the ones that test positive for the genetics of having celiac disease but they may be asymptomatic again most people will feel like these aren't undiagnosed you want to diagnose before treating the person that goes on a gluten-free diet even if it's for a few weeks you have to eat gluten every single day for about a month for those antibodies to show up against gluten so people that stopped eating gluten and then go get tested test won't be valid not the blood tests anyway they recommend these blood tests as well as again those intestinal biopsies at least four to six to two look at the patchy areas that could be destroyed and the only solution unfortunately is lifelong avoidance of gluten they can have about 10 milligrams a day or less now what about gluten sensitivity no standardized test for this they're working on one it's based on symptoms so there are people out there that you know they're going to problems with wheat they're going to bloating headaches fatigue whatever and the only thing they can really do is go off it and stay off it possibly reintroduce and see if those symptoms come back I always tell people if you if you feel bad stop eating it it's pretty easy so why the rise in prevalence this is what I find most fascinating in 1961 there's an increase in wheat produced with fertilizers which made more yield you know how farming is the past several decades how can we make more of a product for as cheap as possible so we can feed the masses at for less money so they used a lot of fertilizers produced a wheat that was very rugged survived drought disease so this is a different variety of wheat than what was consumed 10,000 years ago or 9,000 years ago and then they also during processing they'd assemble the wheat and then put it back together if they want a whole grain so there are a couple things but this wheat is not what you know our great-grandparents ate and according to dr. Asano again wheat rye barley that really came into our diet about 10,000 years ago poor he says that part of the gluten chain cannot be digested that glidin is toxic that's the one I showed that looks like the string of pearls and it can cause leaky gut and leaky gut is basically it's something that contributes to autoimmune diseases according to what they think this is emerging research but there's an indigestion gluten fragment which typically in between cells you have these tight junctions which are like glue and they keep those endothelial cells together when there's a break that means fragments can get through and get into the bloodstream and that's leaky gut so his conclusion is gluten is a chronic modern-day poison we don't need it grains aren't good for us go on the Paleo it's intrinsically gluten-free I didn't attend Alan's talk also listen to it later but I'm just reporting what he says yet there's no such thing as gluten-free because it's everywhere so zero does not actually exist nature there's no stats on gluten intolerance again are not gluten tolerance gluten sensitivity there's no statistics on wheat allergies we don't know how many people have wheat allergies they don't even know why we allergies develop and adults or in children no clue potential link between undiagnosed celiac disease in autoimmune diseases and that's all dr. fasano again needs University of Maryland another professor and this is a great website University of Chicago Medicine Medical Center dr. Guan daleney says you know what you have celiac stopped eating it if you think you have sensitivity stop eating it but otherwise the rest of us can enjoy going grains so there's the difference I'll let you all decide if you you know if your clients come to you I always recommend they go get tested by very good endocrinologist because restricted diets are difficult to maintain and gluten-free foods are more expensive that is if you do the packaged foods of course if you eats eggs dairy etc not much more of a cost but many of the packaged foods are actually pretty nutritionally empty because they add all these low fiber flowers that don't have a lot of nutrients in them to make the gluten-free products because if some of the other flowers that are have more nutritional or texture and cases not very good so next soy I hear this all the time I had a FL player who's trying to convince me the other day about soy and his masculinity but the culprit was soy is isoflavones and these are in many foods or phytoestrogens soy is the most has the most isoflavones of any plant food out there they have hormonal and non hormonal properties and some researchers are concerned about chronic long-term exposure do we know like the pro when soy really was something hot in the american diet do we know if people eat a ton of soy what's going to happen years down the road so he has many purported health benefits some studies but some studies show adverse effects especially rodent in in vitro studies studies on soy and reduced breast cancer this is interesting because it's gone back and forth yeah it's bad yeah it's good no it's neutral doesn't matter and basically they've come to the conclusion that soy is protective if kids around four to six girls around four to six consume soy frequently in their diet maybe it actually can decrease cancer risk possibly up to 50% and it's now okay for breast cancer survivors to consume some soy but very high exposures and animals actually cause infertility so scientists began to wonder wait a minute okay if it causes this in animals what does it do to humans but the thing about is animals actually metabolized isoflavones very differently than humans so this is we're taking animal research and applying it to humans we have to be very cautious this effect has not been seen in humans yet if you read the press you know in past couple years oh my gosh it's bad it decreases sperm count in men it does all these things and again it's not very masculine but what there's one small pilot study that found that soy consumption was associated with a lower sperm concentration clinical trials have found no problem with sperm quality or concentration and this is the one this is the study that was the newspapers jumped on and I took 99 men in a fertility clinic looked at their diet so they gave him food food frequency questionnaire how often you need to oranges how often you eat this how often do you use that and they asked them about how much soy to eight over three month period to just three months the majority of men who ate soy had lower sperm concentrations had sperm concentrations within normal minute limits the majority of them a few on the higher intake of soy range had low sperm concentration yet they didn't look for confounding variables primarily obesity so was that at low sperm concentration due to high soy or was it due to the fact that these men were actually obese and soyfoods and isolated and showed no relationship to total sperm counts permeability or other measures of fertility so a meta-analysis scientists got together and they said you know because of this conflicting research we're going to look at everything and they got 15 placebo controlled trials sound scientifically conducted trials and include studies in adult men who consumed soy foods isolated soy protein or isoflavones and found they had no effect on any of these variables so again that was one pilot study that didn't control for confounding variables but according to look at all the research there's really no effect the chemicals or chemical structures are similar to estrogen like I said but it's not estrogen it doesn't contain estrogen as people always tell me so it does have some benefits that can lower LDL by a small but significant effect each 1% drop in LDL lowers heart disease by 1 to 2% and if it replaces high saturated fat foods soy has an even greater effect on heart disease risk it does increase muscle protein synthesis not as well as weight oh it may prolong the anabolic window that's a research that came out last year but they need to tease out some of the data and look and see whether it's soy or casein that had this effect because they combine them the next is dairy how many people have anti dairy clients just one two okay we're and here's what I hear with only animals that mammals that drink another animals milk hormones and milk can cause kids to mature and go through puberty early humans haven't involved enough to digest dairy most people are lactose intolerant and we don't need it for calcium so the research all milk including hip breast milk contains hormones some cows are given that the vine growth hormone you know I always tell people if you don't want that go get an organic milk free just you know for you from bovine growth hormone but pasteurization actually destroys most of that and the remaining amount is broken down to trace inactive fragments in a GI tract plus its species specific biologically inactive in humans so you know it's really it really actually is pretty equivalent whether it contains it or whether it doesn't because it's inactive in humans what about lactose intolerance there's a high prevalence of lactose intolerance basically people who have this can't digest the sugar lactose and break it down so they have you know most commonly GI distress bloating etc sometimes diarrhea happens gradually after the age of two and it can also happen secondary lactose intolerance can happen because of an injury or an illness so Crohn's disease and select these they destroy parts of the small intestine that may cause lactose intolerance its more common in several groups they don't know why two ways to detect it hydrogen breast test in a stool test which is given to kids but for people who are lactose intolerance they can usually stand cheese in fact some cheeses have aged cheese's have no lactose whatsoever many can withstand yogurt especially good yogurt the kind that actually still has the probiotics in it because they will break down the lactose and most can actually stand some milk they just got to drink in small quantities and drink it over a period of time but one thing that milk contains besides 9 nutrients it's the primary source of calcium and vitamin D in the diet and people over 2 plus it contains other bone building nutrients vitamin D in particular is extremely hard to get in other foods you can't eat leafy greens you got to eat a lot of them it's not first of all they're not as bioavailable as the calcium from dairy and like I said you got to eat a lot for people who eat want to go with some of the milk alternatives the type of vitamin D is not as good for your body doesn't increase d stores as well so that's one consideration plus the calcium actually settles to the bottom of the container so they have to shake it to actually be able to drink it the other thing I'll hear about dairy is that hey the protein in dairy it's really bad for bone tissue and protein actually makes up a good part of bone both the volume and the mass so looking at high protein dairy diets and calcium loss there's no increase in urinary calcium excretion from higher protein diets through food even up to 2.1 grams per kg bodyweight so from the research you can go on a higher protein diet you're not going to have an increase in calcium excretion and country's people also tell me that countries that don't eat a lot of dairy of higher bone mineral density and that's possible there are several other factors including activity like if you look at some of the people in Africa they're walking with I talked to a couple African women every day they walk miles and miles with this huge basket full of heavy weight on their head okay they don't consume dairy but every weight they're getting bone building activity by walking and carrying a ton of weight and you can tell by their musculature women you don't actually exercise like on purpose but just because their farming practices they're building bone tissue what about acid and alkaline diets there is a linear association between calcium excretion and acid load in the diet but this doesn't mean a calcium was actually leached out of the bone it could be dietary intake in blood levels of calcium and there's no indication that promotion of the alkaline diet will actually prevent osteoporosis so this is stuff that they still need in my opinion they still need to tease out research still needs to look at this and also those plant-based foods contain compounds that decrease calcium absorption they contain phytic acid in oxalic acid so next - I've got artificial sweeteners this is a very emotional topic but some of the side effects people report headaches decreased testosterone increased cancer risk way gain and actually there are subsets of people who cannot break down aspartame very well in the body or they actually break it down we don't break it down and so they will get headaches that is that is indeed true they're considered grass generally recognized as safe a couple of the saccharin is an older one but there is a that came under fire years ago and some of it still lingers because of rat based research saying hey hi saccharin equals cancer bladder cancer and rats the problem with that was that there's the mechanism by which it caused bladder cancer is completely irrelevant for humans so it's not been shown to cause cancer in humans and it's not really metabolized by the body the thing about it is you don't see saccharin nearly as much now probably because of this study as 14 this is one that moved for most people it just passes right through again there's a subset of the population that breaks it down and they experience headaches interestingly it can cause a very slight increase in blood glucose what about diet soda and obesity these are all observational studies and this is you know is there is there a link isn't there a link it'd be nice if there were more research out there to really look at this but a lot of this press is coming from a couple different studies one the san antonio heart study where they took 5,000 they looked at data from 5,000 people over seventy eight year period and they found that all soda drinkers gain weight aspartame of non-nutritive sweeteners sugar sweetened doesn't matter they gain weight diet sodas soda drinkers gained a lot more weight but again this is observational in nature is there another factor that causes people to gain weight is do they do certain people just choose diet drinks we don't know Framingham Heart Study this one those 9,000 people in a four year period and those who drank both sugar sweetened and non sweden's were more likely to gain weight so again there's something about they're noticing observational II at least so does drinking weight gain the researchers are questioning is this the big math hypothesis though is it okay you know what I'm going to eat all this stuff and then I'm going to go ahead and drink my diet coke and I'm cool I can drink my diet coke with my what is vodka at night I can drink five six of them I got Diet Coke no calories I'm fine not going to gain weight they don't know what the what's that conclude there's no real conclusive evidence here is natural better we don't know there are several types of natural they're stevia sugar alcohols sugar alcohols cause digestive distress in some people a lot of sugar-free diabetic foods low hon go that's a new one and then there are certain fibers that actually increase sweetness so sugar is a lot actually a lot easier to replace in food and food formulas are working on all these combinations for natural because there's an increased desire for natural foods and last but not least I hear this all the time and I know there many of my colleagues are very anti supplements so they'll say you know what you can get all your nutrients from food to see a good healthy diet doesn't matter you'll get every single thing you need and really you can if you sit there and you know add some oysters to your diet you'll get some copper if you add some salmon you're going to get some omega-3s a couple times a week eat tons of fruit eat tons of vegetables eat some whole grains if you plan a really well-rounded diet you could probably hit all those nutrients but the problem is most of America does not do that here's a little older data from n Haynes and this is the percent of people above adequate intake for vitamin D vitamin D is found it's found in milk it's found in some yogurts some mushrooms I've never seen them in the store they expose mushrooms to UV light in a pan of bones so if you eat like if you get canned fish and actually to the bones which my parents do I don't know why but they chew the bones you can get some vitamin D but not in a whole lot of foods and according to this data most people don't get enough in their diet and we know that the prevalent of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency extremely high and the population I work with I work with pretty much all men all men right now and a lot with darker skin all male athletes and I'll this time I'll get them tests and they're all deficient calcium this is the percent above adequate intake and the sorry these are age groups that got cut off but basically showing the yellow is teenagers and the red is early adults basically showing the very few people I mean the youngest group of all these are infants get almost the adequate intake the rest of them are extremely low same thing with magnesium this is a nutrient that I think and again the sorry the age groups got cut off but this is the one that I think is going to be the new vitamin D because it's in a ton of foods very small quantities and yet has so many different important roles in the body it's important for over 300 biochemical reactions it's important for bone tissue etc but many people are not needing there magnesium ease and when I look through diets I'll look for certain foods that you know I'll go through and I'll go okay if they're missing you know I've got some of the high sources memorized so I'm missing these foods they're likely low in all of these nutrients so to sum things up I know we've got a couple minutes for questions here are my rules never place and I know this is tough but never placed dietary restrictions allergies nutrient deficiencies etc etc on your clients I'll see some dieticians and it's easy to do because we get so caught up in a certain area we get so caught up in let's say a person has celiac disease or a dietician you know one of my colleagues might have a food allergy that we think hey everybody might have this let me let me hone in on this area speak openly from what the science says and I love what dr. Volek said earlier that the science is so vast that it's sometimes tough and we can't make these conclusions I can't make a total conclusion on artificial sweeteners but I'll listen to the client make a recommendation based on what I'm hearing from them don't boil down clients issues into one food one ingredient one meal and I know people tend to do this because it's like you know what cut gluten out it's going to do everything I lose weight have that body I want I'm going to feel better etc but usually it's a multitude of factors that as you all know over time need to be it's just like training overtime you got to fix all these different things and then they'll feel better and I always say remember that clients give you half the story because I don't know about the people you work with but I'll be working with someone then later on it's like oh yeah I forgot to tell you my doctor prescribed a pill once a month what was that vitamin D that was well how much am I supposed to take I have no idea do you have your blood work nope so they forget all these things and I have to constantly ask questions with my clients and then I said this recently to a gentleman favorite progress not perfection I was trying to talk him down on actually alcohol consumption and you know I've come to realize that there are so many of these diets that it's almost like what was the one years ago body for life to eat these foods only pick on this only most people are going to do that restrictive diet least my clients aren't so you know those do work if you can follow them but I try to you know say hey let's get some progress you don't have to be absolutely perfect because there's no such thing as a perfect diet none of these diets are perfect you can pick and choose pieces of them that you like and then help your clients to create what works for them based on medical history do they cook do they not cook what's their training level and what are their goals etc so that's it does anyone have and I think we have 5-10 minutes for questions before I guess [Music]", "SwJFGaPTsuI": "hey everybody this is paul and check it out i finally found moon drops grapes these are made by grapery and they are supposedly outworldly now i have tasted a few i would say they are very very sweet and i give them a 9 out of 10. now they there's no hint of a seed they're very juicy and the skin is kind of mild i would say it's not very bitter or that kind of tannin vibe you get so i would say it's a very balanced and not overly sweet grape it definitely looks unique in shape and i did have one or two that were a little soft on this end so that's probably the point where it may soften as they are not as fresh or when they are not as fresh but either way it's an amazing grape mmm really crunchy delicious let's see how it brixes it's definitely not as sweet as the grapery or grapery black tape table seedless grapes that we had they're just table grapes those are wonderful and those bricks that in the 20s 25 or 26 so let's see how this one does so they're brixing in between about 18 to 19. so i'll go ahead and show you that here in a clip and wow definitely an awesome grape so give us a like and a subscribe and see if you can find yourself any grapes from drapery these moon drops are stunning really interesting shape and just a really delicious fruit not overly sweet very very

this video atomy is a company that you can trust and purchase from i have told this story before i started a platform business in 1999 and i launched it in 2000 i started i am korea.com which stands for internet mart korea im stands for you know internet mark korea i started the platform business with internet mark korea to be honest i was lacking something at the time i couldn't find an investor that would invest in my business if i'd met a big investor i could have become the alibaba of korea then atomy would never have existed and we wouldn't be able to meet in hindsight i'm glad that my first business didn't go so well yeah you guys are clapping not even thinking of my suffering one must start a business model that is faster than the trend because trends change one must be a step ahead of the world's progress then the next trend will follow you it's actually very easy to be successful truth be told there are not many successful people but if you know the laws of success it is actually very easy those who make money make a lot of money and those who can't make money just suffer all their lives there are people who experience failure for their entire lives that is because they're not leading the trend in order to lead the trend you must be a step ahead of the trend in order to do that you must know how the world will change scholars have said that the first industrial revolution led to the second one and the second revolution to the third and ultimately to the fourth industrial revolution what then must you do to have a competitive edge what must you do to have a competitive edge in the fourth industrial revolution the fourth industrial revolution is also known as a hyper-connected society you must be connected to other people these days everyone is making money by being connected this smartphone that you have people are making money with this phone right that is because this smartphone is connecting people and businesses in our age connectivity will make you money that is why experts are saying the society we live in is a hyper-connected society so where are you all connected to to your alumni club yeah with a few of your friends you need to first see if that group is going to make you any money will your connection to that group bring you money think about it whether the group that you are connected to makes you more money or if they make you spend more money yeah since all your connections lead to expenses you don't really like those connections when it's springtime you get phone calls right just just a lot of people are trying to call you they want to invite you places your friends are calling you to come to their children's wedding these kinds of phone calls don't make you any money they actually make you spend money you cannot be connected to only these kinds of groups you must decide whether your connections are going to bring you money yes everyone is in fact connected to the world if you have a smartphone you are essentially connected to the world the problem is that you are at the end of the connection that is why your smartphone is called a terminal [Music] the smartphone you have in your hand is a terminal terminal means the end it's not in the middle if you want to make money you cannot be at the end if you are at the end you can only spend money you must be in the middle so let me give you an example how are your terminals all connected this is a hub telecommunication companies like kt and skt are hubs and the hubs connect all the different terminals together the busier the terminals become the more money hubs are able to make am i right we're approaching a world where money will be made only through these hubs if you remain as a terminal then you will be nothing many people say they're living in an information age but if you remain as a terminal the more you consume information the more money you'll wind up spending no matter how hard you work as a terminal it's not going to profit you very much that is why you must become a hub listen carefully in the past if you went out to the marketplace there was a store that maybe sold rice right and then there was a store that sold clothes and other sold shoes and another that sold supplies and there were many stores like this all gathered together in the past this is what the model looked like the hub for rice was this one store this one store used to distribute to all the other stores all these other stores are terminals for the supply of rice correct this is what it looked like but for shoes the shoe store was the hub for that product so this store would sell shoes to all the other people right so this rice store would act as a hub for rice but for shoes it would then act as a terminal yeah in the past the role of a hub and the terminal was all mixed together and that's why the marketplace did not die for thousands of years but in these modern times big hub came right in the middle of all this what is this these are discount marts what then happens to the rice store it will go bankrupt what about the clothes store it also dies the same for the shoe store and the food store the supply store shares the same fate as well the model changed so that only this big mart becomes a hub this is a problem ultimately this big hub will do pretty well but there are two main problems two problems the first problem is that money that is sucked in here doesn't ever cycle out the people in this hub are already consuming enough they don't consume more products because they have more money they might have five cars just sitting at home do you think they're going to spend more just because they have more money no not at all that is why the money that is concentrated here does not get spent this is very bad for the overall economy all the consumers money gets sucked into this hub but the rich people in the hub don't spend the money then the consumers at the terminals will not have an opportunity to make money the second problem is that these people here will become poor later when these people become poor are they going to buy products from this hub here no they won't have enough money then this hub is going to die out as well that is why the hub reaches the ceiling then his revenue will continue to go down and that is why it's necessary to restore the old social order it's not just discount stores where we see this but the same is for portal sites a huge platform business has showed up everything will be sucked into this hub right here right only this hub is going to make money and the rest will die out there is another problem within this platform business what is that problem it's very difficult for consumers to select their products that they need why when a consumer searches online there are hundreds of products is price the only thing you need to consider you know that the cheapest is not always the best right you're not sure if you should pick the cheapest or the middle option some think i'm just going to pick the most expensive one if it's expensive it must be good is this how you should purchase products the biggest concern of people using such portals is the confusion they get confused there's too much choice after you've made the purchase what happens are you always satisfied with your decision are you 100 happy with the clothes that you buy you don't even wear half of the clothes that you bought in stores am i right what happens if you buy products from online you don't use a lot of them the same goes for household products many of the products you buy just go straight into the trash let's say you have a 50 success rate that seems fair you bought what you liked in this case if the failure rate is 50 then the price of that product is actually double the price that's the truth in reality correct this is a big problem within online businesses also it can add a lot of stress you have to think about what to buy all the time these problems have to be solved next also in the position of the supplier though they say they directly meet the consumers there's really not much profit made because there are so many other suppliers but there is no option because there are no other sales channels all the suppliers stand in line to go into this hub but the actual profit is really not high at all so this leads to low volume of production and that causes a rise in price the price goes up this causes fierce competition amongst the suppliers and it causes a lot of stress for the consumers as well this is the problem of platform businesses what happens if someone solves this problem that will be the post-platform business model the next business model that comes after platform businesses will be possible that is why i founded atomy the recently launched azamal also started with 5000 products there are over 10 000 products that are waiting to go up on the site all the products that these traditional marts all used to carry will be up on atomy's azam all 100 of them however in this mall the consumer doesn't have to stress out the quality of the products is good and the price is affordable but the most important thing is the return of pvs you can do business with this anatomy not only well these people here become rich but their pvs the company will pay back 35 of the sales then the normal person can become rich then the consumer can purchase atomy's products again which causes a healthy cycle in this platform business model all the money gets sucked in which makes the consumers ultimately poor and when the consumers have no more money the business also collapses and when this business fails then consumers will have to move to this next model then logically that means that all of you must become hubs correct the atomy company itself is a hub and all of you have come here as terminals you consume products so that makes you a terminal but it doesn't end there you can create terminals under you correct yeah of course you can you can create terminals under you from the company's perspective the company is the hub and you are a terminal but from the position of other terminals you are a hub and these people here can create other terminals under them and if these people under you also create terminals under them then that makes you a hub that exists between at me as a supplier and a large pool of consumers in addition all these people here are loosely connected so are they loyal or not will they go somewhere else if they can find other products that are cheaper and better yeah they will because they're not loyal but what about in this model if they come here they can do this as a business the consumers here in fact become a prosumer someone who acts as a producer because they can start making money when they come here they will not move back to the other platform no that is why this is called a magnetic board system magnetic board system once they come to our platform they will become stuck and when they come they come because the products are good and affordable they even receive commission if they introduce it to others and that will make them stick to the platform then there will be no reason to go back but more and more consumers will come to our platform so we have to prepare in advance the people who are busy working to make money here will come to our platform it's inevitable if you can be grounded before that happens you will be successful we currently live in a hyper-connected society the new age where everyone is connected is approaching us and all of you have come here today to join us in this business thank you for that inspiring lecture chairman mr park hangi so let's move forward to our product introduction so today diamond master miss reggie de la cruz will show us or teach us about atomy's products so without further ado let's all watch this video good afternoon everyone i'm reggie yadav the lacrosse diamond master from the kidnap muslin peak power center actually i am a scientist by profession but you don't need to be a scientist to be successful with that to me i you don't have to finish any education but actually i also finished my phd in molecular biology and biotechnology from a university here nearby and uh but you don't need that one to succeed in that but that is my advantage when i promote after me because i graduated actually valedictorian and soon as biologists so what did my high school much makes says if francis says so then we don't need to hear the explanation anymore that product is really good that company is the best i already felt success with atomy even though i've only been in atomy business almost one year but three years ago i was already very happy with the toothpaste so what kind of success am i telling you what is your success with atomy success is not just money do not think that by starting out to be right away you'll get rich so success will start with helping your family in terms of health and wellness so we are not suffering anymore from any toothache or even gingivitis my mom my dad even my kids really feels good with all the atomy products from the shampoo to the facial uh facial treatments all the products are really very very nice safe and organic that is the first and foremost component of me products that they are organic i will i am a person who is afraid of chemicals even in my makeup i don't put them back on atomy i already started using makeup because i am secure and really sure that this company produces safe organic and even effective health supplement but what will be the product products if those products are expensive so another come on would be our products are affordable if you have this the aging but it costs 100 000 it's okay to age but with atomy the product absolute is really effective and really affordable so we feel success in that way do not think of money right away money will come green it's america just continue using the products once you've tried any product you don't want to go back to your own product and that is what we call absolute quality even the quality assurance system of the company is really insured so absolute quality absolute price let's say affordable so this is the shopping mall about to be so if you're a member of atomy you own a shopping mall that's our statement we own the shopping mall because we can shop anytime 24 hours so you can buy anything that you want and we have already 88 products there and we have this concept behind our academy products my stage because our target consumer we don't target only the rich people who can afford but the products of atomy can be for all the hub even the toothpaste the small one could be uh bought by any anyone in the community class prestige it refers to the quality the quality of atomic products is the same as those very expensive products quality but the price is low so when you are using atomy products you are using very good quality products at a very low price so we don't target only the rich people but everybody and that's one concept behind the success of this company and it's not going to fail so these are now the three health supplements that i will be explaining so we have at [Music] so all our food supplements are really effective remember my field is on biotechnology but this company is nano technology high purification technology fermentation technology and all the products the effectiveness of all the plants used or animals fish use are really uh they are really very effective so this one is new korean red ginseng spherical granule at the members price of 4250 we have 16 packets at the point value of 52 000. so what is this product it helps your overall well-being it's for your overall health so what is indian we call the compounds genocidocytes and it's a sum of rg1 rb1 and rg3 so that is how you see if the products are objecting are really effective the three should be present so it has 20 milligrams compared to the recommended daily dose of three milligram per day and the main effect is enhancing our immunity support fatigue resistance promote blood circulation improve memory function and also antioxidant so the brand news are patented in terms of technology so the technology is very really very good and it's really pure 100 percent ginseng 97 is a concentrated powder and two percent is the powder direct from ginseng so this one are micronized so the powder dissolves easily in water regardless of temperature and it's not it melts softly in bath and the packaging is very convenient that at the middle of the day you feel tired you just open it then place it directly into your mouse so it's really very convenient and the technology is really pattern number 10 1 3 5 7 6 9 so this is in terms of how they made the ultra fine red powder ginsenosides around there and fat is zero sodium is zero probably zero and the calories is five calories so the product is really very good so anybody here who easily gets tired this is your answer those who easily get tough and cold ginseng is your answer [Music] then if you really have very excessive workload for me being a professor we do research extension production that we are all around the picture but at the middle of the day i thank my team and i feel energized and for those who are already taking him you can use it in between alternate so you take him in before breakfast then after lunch you take ginseng then you take your healthy so there are many ways not taking this food supplement so for those with problems with your circulatory system your heart your bp ginseng is good and this is for everybody even the children all family members can take this product for better health and remember with better health we already have success so again that's the patented technology so we take one packet one time per day but if under 18 have a packet per day so take by mouth or dissolve in water but when taken with water we have sediment of ginseng powder that can appear but for me i just take it not just like how we take probiotics and then i i drink water especially those who don't uh really like the then you have your gym safe because the family really thinks a little bitter okay the second product now that i'm going to discuss is for those who want to be slim [Music] so fats have to be taken out of the body because excess fats will affect our health so this is a very new product for the philippine market and we call it atomic wear tea a cup a day enjoy in moderation so we have 30 packets at 1 410 and 13 000 point value so that's the packaging [Music] so we know what is square d it's really a very famous tea in china it's one of the china's top 10 famous tea and it is a special type of aged and fermented ghee named after the queer region in china that's why it's called puerto rico china it's recorded in chinese literature as supplements to the compendium of ontario medica and dictionary of chinese medicine so meaning it's really really very effective being placed there in the dictionary so it's been caring for trade on the key road the oldest trade group in human history so now not only chinese will enjoy party but only also all over the world with atomy distributing it so this is the manufacturing process they harvest they dry then they do fermentation using a microorganism from another plant then they do extraction [Music] water extraction and that hot water which is liquid will be converted into solid powder through what we call as spray drying that no real no wonder why it's more concentrated than just by using the leaves remember some of the tea leaves are the one place in the packet but this one underwent this manufacturing process so it's really more effective and the reason why it's effective is because of the compound garlic acid it's a polyphenol component of catechins and this is the one that will cause the lipid peroxidation removing your excessive fat but do not think that just by taking in within three days you will for one minute again your weight down you should take note if that products will not any product will cause you to reduce weight in just one week there's something wrong it could have many side effects they should fear no but for this do nothing right away because this one you have to continue taking it through the weeks class with atomy with atomy we have to incorporate our discipline you will not succeed with this atomic products if you don't have discipline self-discipline you have to have good diet because though the product will help but if your diet is still the same do not you cannot promote the product because you will not see the effect with yourself but it's true for all the other products that's why one of the success that i see in atomy is not only in terms of our health but also with our values that is why really indeed cherishes cherishes our spirit okay continuing on this is the one i was talking about if you just use leaves in your tea the garlic acid content will just be one milligram but with the potential technology of atomy one gram of pretty extra is equivalent to 34 cups because there is hot water extraction and spray grinding and do you know how much garlic acid costs it's very expensive but with atomy we only buy that around 47 pesos i'm using garlic acid in our laboratory we buy it as part of our experiment and it's really expensive but again with atomy we have absolute quality with the 34 times if content there and price is low so what you do is fill your bottle dissolve it in your water bottle for the whole day you can place it in hot water or room temperature water it does not dissolve in cold water and you can drink bring your bottle to the office and drink it slowly throughout the day that's one way but if you don't want that then you just drink it just like a regular cup of tea one cup of tea so it's suitable for those who wants to go to restaurants eat all you can restaurants buffet so everybody filipinos really want all and memorize and those in all you can so after that one you're going to discover so heavy meal will cause a discomfort so that is why you have to take your atomic party with you when you go to other to this buffet restaurant it will help in digestion and it will also adjust the body constitution of course there are precautions on the product as well as they contain as if content of caffeine which cause nervousness and insomnia okay the then product is atomy supplemental this is for men because this is a plant super metal is of one so it's a five multi formula so one bottle has 90 soft gels at 1560 so that's just around 18 pesos per soft gel and i have an office mate who really transferred to atomy because it's really cheaper compared to other products so palmetto in the in america two million men are taking supplemental it's a very famous food supplement so what is it helps in the prostate health who has prostate here raise your hand of course only the man has prostate so it's a male reproductive organ very small just like a walnut it surrounds the urethra where the urine flows and the urinary bladder where the urine is temporarily stored stored that's why if the prostate will enlarge it will really affect the urine output because it's very mean the urethra and the urinary bladder so the role of the prostate is to produce the fluid needed for the seven and will protect the sperm [Music] so how do you know if your prostate is good guys only so if you do not feel completely empty after you finish urinating something's wrong if urinate you urinate twice or more within two hours that would be problematic and if you stops and you stop and start several times during your donation that is also problematic and if you drive in the highway for example and every now you stop your urination stop urinating so that's another example and if it's difficult for you to postpone urination or you need to push or strain to start the flow of your or you get up during the night to urinate then your prostate is probably starting to enlarge the way of laboratory tests the psa tests that would really help confirm it so for supplemental it's actually a pump and the mechanism behind its action is that it box the five alpha reductase it is an enzyme it's found in all males the enzyme and it converts testosterone testosterone is the male hormone [Music] which is of course necessary in males but it is being converted to another form called dht or a dihydro testosterone and this is the one which cause prostate cell enlargement and enlargement over all of the prostate as we as they grow old and older so what the supplement does is stop the action of that enzyme so that testosterone will remain testosterone and will no longer be converted to dht and there are many scientific publications on this however with atomy so neto it does not only have super metal on it it has other five functional ingredients the dose actually is 320 milligram so the simple intake is just one capsule a day the color of the gel is brown but there's no artificial coloring why because the color we got from cacao so all natural that's true for all the products and the icons are pumpkin seed oil grape seed oil the vodka extract the maca extract actually gives energy and stamina alone but with together with salt now you see the combined effect we have l-arginine which is an amino acid then we have also the tomato extract tomato has actually lycopene and lycopene also prevents the conversion of testosterone to adhd so they really studied what combination would really make our optimism momentum very effective and there are already many testimonies that indeed it's really very effective so sao paulo vitamin e is also present in supplemental so it protects lipids and prevents oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid it is also selenium which eliminates free radicals do you know that this periodicals we get from pollution from the food that we eat in the fast food exposure to chemicals so damage will then occur to our cells and cause other diseases then we have octopus the bioactive substance that boosts energy and stamina so so-called will also give energy to males and the last one is the zinc zinc is really very important for cell growth and it comes from monsters so you see just by growing the three food supplements and there's more you would really see the absolute quality and absolute price in all our products again atomy really cherishes our spare spirit because how do you enjoy life if you yourself is sick if you yourself is very weak and can even walk or if you yourself cannot carry the burden of work you have in your respective work or offices so do not think that with atomy right away you have reached uh you have more money you have but that would really come and that is the reason why i keep on sharing atomy to my friends my family because i also want them to enjoy the success that i have felt just by using the atomy products so we should use first the academy products in order to succeed not only in terms of money but more importantly in terms of health discipline and even honesty and integrity is being taught by atomy [Music] and that was diamond master miss reggie de la cruz products are with absolute quality and absolute price after puniton online one day

[Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] my", "yxygEGuN50g": "so it's my great pleasure to introduce our speaker tonight our lecture is entitled growing healthy babies nutrition tips for pregnancy preconception pregnancy and postpartum susan carter received her master's degree in nutrition from oregon state university she went on to complete a dietetic internship at the ucsf medical center where she then continued to work as a clinical dietitian and diabetes educator specializing in pregnancy and diabetes she transferred to stanford hospital in 2000 as a research dietitian she currently is a diabetes educator and dietitian for the ob clinic and for the sweet success diabetes and pregnancy program at lucille packard children's hospital so please join me in welcoming her [Applause] so what a great place to work when uh the final product of uh your into end of the day is beautiful babies so uh welcome to all of you it's a pleasure to be here i recognize some of my patients in the audience so hopefully this will be informative and not stressful to anybody to hear about good nutrition and just keep in mind that nutrition like most areas of science is sort of fluid guidelines are changing constantly felice and i were talking when i came in if i'd given this talk when i was pregnant uh 24 years ago i would have said something completely different so now i look back and think oh my gosh my diet wasn't anywhere where it should have been compared to what we know now so don't stress too much most women have healthy babies and i want you to keep that in mind so generally what are our basic goals for all pregnant women and really for all of us we want to optimize maternal and fetal health by providing optimal nutrition at key times the reason this talk starts with preconception are there's there are some nutrients in our diet that are vitally important even coming into pregnancy we'll talk a little bit later about folic acid and the recommendation is to have adequate folic acid in the diet um coming into pregnancy to reduce the risk of certain birth defects we want to avoid consuming any substance that could be harmful to maternal health or to fetal well-being and we also want to start establishing healthy habits that are going to model a healthy lifestyle and diet for our children you're going to find that children are very good scrutinizers of any fallacies they see if you are not doing what you tell them to do so i often will tell parents you can't crack open a coca-cola and a bag of potato chips and then tell your kids to eat their broccoli you really have to model what you want your kids to do so what does a healthy eating style look like and i apologize for this really busy slide but that's why i made a copy for you as well and originally i had on the top of this slide my healthy pregnancy plate and i took that off because all of us could learn from this and i borrowed heavily from walter willett who is walter willett is the head of harvard school public of health but you can see this modeled in a lot of areas sort of the plate method and one thing you don't notice on this plate at all is any processed foods and more and more healthcare professionals scientists nutritional researchers are finding we really need to go back to a more whole food diet more plant-based foods and get rid of some of the processed foods in the diet i just read a big headline coming out of research from the uk that saying junk food is not good for a preconception period well yeah junk food's not good any of the rest of the time either but we want to emphasize again most of the time your food choices should be healthy sort of the 80 rule but we want to have mostly filling up our plate with about half fruits and vegetables some people may say why am i picking more vegetables on that plate than fruit i often will tell patients well think of fruits as vegetables with added sugar you get all the vitamins all the minerals all the fibers that you need would get in fruits and vegetables without the added sugar and robert lustig is a very interesting researcher at ucsf if you've read his articles in nature magazine and some of his research on sugar in the diet he says historically our time on the planet most of our diet didn't include any sugar except for that brief period of time once a year when fruit came in season protein food is very essential but you'll notice we want to emphasize more chicken more poultry more more vegetable sources of protein like beans and lentils almonds eggs have been redeemed you might have noticed if you've looked at the 2015 usda dietary guidelines we can now have an egg a day again for years we were very worried about the cholesterol in eggs eggs are very important source of protein and choline an important nutrient for fetal brain development so go ahead and have your eggs during pregnancy if you like eggs and replace the starchy white bread and the starchy white potatoes white rice with more whole grains beans and lentils those are really important part of our diets as well this part of the slide i'm not going to go into a lot i just put it there to talk about some of the topics i'm going to be covering tonight i'm going to talk about calorie intake you're not eating for two healthy diets grow healthy babies staying active i asked a couple of our doctors that work in ob clinic what would they recommend that i say to you tonight as you are getting ready to conceive as your in your pregnancies and most of them there was a common theme the one thing they wanted me to tell you was to be active during your pregnancy one of our doctors said when she was seeing one of our other doctors the infamous kay daniels if any of you know her most of our patients just love her she had gone to her first ob visit with dr daniels and the first thing dr danielle said to her is what's your plan for being active during your pregnancy and she was really surprised that that was the first thing she mentioned so being physically active this is near and dear to my heart because i was put on complete bed rest from 22 weeks on with my pregnancy and shortly after my pregnancy my my doctor told me you know we've learned that giving you all that bed rest has tortured you unnecessarily for three months it makes no difference in preventing pre-term deliveries so a lot of you are saved from the fun i had of spending three months with complete bed rest so preconception let's start out with preconception and then we'll move on to talking about pregnancy and a little bit about the postpartum period so why is preconception so important well most of us get pregnant without really planning on it i'm sure you guys are all very good planners and no unplanned pregnancies but fifty percent of the pregnancies in this country are unplanned by eight weeks gestational age your baby already has a complete nervous system and a beating heart so if you wait to improve your diet until you know you're pregnant for a lot of women it's too late to prevent birth defects and we know that a good diet can reduce the risk of having a baby with a congenital anomaly so we're going to talk about body mass index or your weight starting pregnancy nutrients and lifestyle that might impact your baby's health right from the beginning and maybe some screenings to check in with your doctor before you decide to become pregnant i'm not going to talk too much about body mass index but it will be a theme that we're going to talk about during pregnancy obesity prevalence in women of childbearing ages has gone has increased 64 percent between when they measured it in 1988 to 1994 and most recently the statistics we have are from 2007 to 2008. so in 2010 about 32 percent of u.s women aged 20 to 39 met the definition for obesity so the population has really changed um a lot so what does that look like if you want most of us don't think about body mass index a normal bmi for a woman who's five foot four would be 108 to 144 pounds but most the women uh five foot four tall nowadays weigh about 168 170 pounds and there are some risk factors regarding your pregnancy if you do start pregnancy with a little bit of extra weight it can cause some infertility issues increased risk of hypertensive disorders increased risk of gestational diabetes hypertension preeclampsia and more likely that you need a c-section delivery but there's some ways you can mitigate this risk so if you look at all the health organizations they say oh well just achieve a normal body weight before you become pregnant well i once had a patient when the research unit who said he hadn't gone to the doctor for 10 years because he'd gone to the doctor who told him you need to lose 100 pounds and he found that information so devastating that he didn't do anything for 10 years so i think that's we're doing our women that want to plan a pregnancy a disservice if we tell them you'll have to lose 100 pounds before you become pregnant start walking improve your diet and then that might be enough to mitigate the risk for moms maternal obesity and what are the risks to the baby babies can be too big and that can increase the risk of being overweight later in life increased nicu admission babies can have higher risk of low blood sugar if they're born too big and if mom's heavier at the beginning of pregnancy it may increase risk of certain birth defects i'm interesting we're going to talk about folic acid and its role in reducing the risk of neural tube defects obese women if you look statistically are less likely to be taking enough folic acid at the time of pregnancy onset so real important nutrition tidbit for women to make sure they're getting enough folic acid so preconception action plan for a woman who is overweight um if if you just have a few pounds to lose that's great but if you are in an obese bmi category you might be able to reduce your risk significantly by losing a little bit of weight before pregnancy starts or improving your diet and at least getting started on a healthy lifestyle i know from my years in a research unit we did a lot of study looking at insulin resistance and we talked a lot about what about the heavy patient who's most at risk and they tended to be more sedentary and have more inflammation and chronic risk factors you can be fit at a heavier weight and that also might mitigate risk of pregnancy um so a sample weight loss plan for a woman who's in an obese body range if she was 190 pounds losing just 14 pounds might be enough to reduce her risk this is data from the diabetes prevention program that found that just seven percent body weight could reduce the risk of dealing diabetes for patients that have pre-diabetes by almost 60 percent over the period that they followed them so let's move on to preconception nutrition what should your diet look like if you're planning for pregnancy obviously you want to avoid toxins minimize alcohol consumption some studies show you should start avoiding alcohol even when you start thinking about becoming pregnant and you want to make sure you're consuming adequate folic acid and vitamin b12 so the united states actually recommends for all women of childbearing age that you should be consuming a multivitamin that has enough folic acid for so in case you accidentally became pregnant your baby would not be at risk for a higher risk for a neural tube defect so what about preconception lifestyle goals how many of you are already doing some physical activity on a regular basis okay great looks like the majority of people in here these are recommendations again for everybody sometimes i'd like to emphasize that because i see a lot of expectant dads in the room in addition to potential moms too and i just want to tell you dads out there that you're not the diet police you're co-partners in this game and we should i think some occasionally i've been an arbitrator of marital disputes in my office where dad says she's supposed to be exercising and and that's generally not helpful so these are all guidelines all of us could benefit from minimally uh 20 minutes exercise a day and keep that up started before you become pregnant and keep it up during your pregnancy obviously we don't want to smoke use medications or substances that could impact fetal development as well so if you're planning pregnancy it might be time to go visit your doctor particularly if you have some underlying medical conditions or maybe even just a family history of certain medical conditions consider get screening for diabetes if diabetes runs in your family especially if you have a parent or a sibling with diabetes it's a quick test called glycosylated hemoglobin or hemoglobin a1c that can measure how sugar-coated your red blood cells are and tell if you have a higher risk for diabetes we do this test on all our pregnant women here at stanford and we do pick up on a fair number of women that didn't know they had either pre-diabetes or diabetes and then they come to my office for some counseling i just got back from a diabetes conference and the current statistics according to the cdc are that about one of every 11 adults in this country has diabetes and one of every three adults has pre-diabetes and about a quarter of those people are unaware that they even have this condition so you've gone through great pregnancy pre-pregnancy planning you started exercising and congratulations i see at least three women i think out there that are pregnant right now so congratulations on becoming pregnant what are your goals now well we're going to talk about weight all the way through because weights are packed are coming into pregnancy during pregnancy and afterwards we want to have appropriate weight gain during pregnancy we want to have a good lifestyle food safety is extra important for pregnant women you're a little more vulnerable to foodborne illness and there are populations that have special nutritional needs during pregnancy and i would talk a little bit about how uncomfortable it can be to be three months into your pregnancy or six months into your pregnancy and be constipated and have heartburn and just be generally miserable maybe explain a little bit about why that happens and give you some remedies for it so these are the institute of medicine weight gain recommendations that all of you have probably seen i highlighted in green the lower end of the range because there were some big studies done recently including up at ucsf naomi stotland looked at about 20 000 pregnancies and what she found is most women gain more than is what is what is recommended and there were more problems both with babies and moms if you gain at the upper end versus the lower end so historically these recommendations were all geared towards preventing low birth weight babies and i even had a discussion with one of my patients from china recently why are you worried about my baby being too big with diabetes big babies are healthy babies we think of that as a strong good characteristic in china and i said well we know a little bit more that big babies aren't necessarily uh a healthy baby and you don't want your wife to have to push out a 10-pound baby if we can prevent that so that might not be the most fun so um they're kind there's a lot of data coming out that maybe we should revise these guidelines especially at the upper end i think there's pretty good evidence if you gain at the low end of the institute of medicine guidelines if you start out your pregnancy to normal bmi that's great but once you have reached an obese bmi category above 30 is it really good to recommend a 20 pound weight gain especially if you have a woman who might be coming into pregnancy with 100 pounds extra weight on her body she might not need that weight gain so these are some of the studies 43 of the women in the naomi scotland study gained more weight than was recommended and again we're already thinking that weight gain may be a little bit on the high side excess weight gain is associated with more problems than low gain and excess weight gain can increase risk of heavier babies nicu admission and overweight status later in life limited or no weight gain in obese pregnant women has been found to have favorable outcomes and again we have to be cautious here because i know a lot of you are over achievers i don't want you to start restricting your food intake and remember when we talk about limited or no weight gain this is an obese woman if you started your pregnancy to healthy weight you do need to gain enough weight so don't starve yourself i see women that take this to heart and they're so afraid of gaining too much weight that they aren't gaining enough weight um there was a real interesting study the 2013 uh study there i cited american journal of obstetrics and gynecology they looked at just at obese women and they actually found the most favorable outcomes were in women that had a little bit of weight loss during their pregnancy and they found with a little bit of weight loss in obese women about 70 percent fewer c-section deliveries and about 50 percent reduction in large for gestational age babies but again the flip side of this starvation isn't good for babies either during the nazi occupation in holland there were pregnant women that were only getting about 600 calories per day and a few years later when those uh boys from those pregnancies entered the dutch army they found that the recruits that had been exposed to famine during the first half of pregnancy were more likely to be obese later in life so extremes of the caloric supply in utero can actually change physiologically how your baby's metabolism develops so these babies probably developed very thrifty mechanisms at storing fat so to protect them from the next famine so the pattern of weight gain appears to be very important as well um the first trimester i put down at the bottom there the size of your baby at the end of the first 12 weeks people have been very concerned i didn't gain any weight the first trimester because i was so nauseated i was vomiting a lot and i said well you know at 12 weeks your baby weighs about half an ounce and is two inches long so if you gained a lot of weight in that period it probably wasn't going to baby so a lot of studies are now showing we don't need to eat anymore during the first trimester now sometimes it may help nausea and vomiting to eat a little more frequently but you don't have a big caloric increase and the new guidelines are that you don't need to increase your calories at all in the first 13 weeks roughly a pregnancy so the normal weight person you might have a little increase in your weight there and that's usually expanding blood volume and you women out there if you've been pregnant or pregnant now you notice how exhausted you are in that first part of pregnancy your blood volume is expanding that's one reason you're having to urinate all the time and it's also why you're tired your cardiovascular system is getting used to that increased blood volume second trimester weight gain is when baby starts really starting to put on the pounds at 23 weeks your baby weighs a little over a pound is about 11 inches long and then by 37 weeks a baby can be 6.3 to 7 pounds and be about 19 inches along so second and third trimester weight gain seems to be important especially in multiple gestation pregnancies anybody out here expecting twins that they know okay so we know that and some studies have indicated getting um extra weight gain in the first trimester is important if you're expecting multiples so that no weight gain in the first trimester probably does not apply if you're expecting twins if you're expecting twins and more you probably do need to gain more weight there's a little controversy about how much weight that needs to be one study showed 24 pounds by 24 weeks was important so we'll talk a little bit more when i go into the twin section there but back to the excess weight gain gaining too much weight uh in the first half of pregnancy does seem to be more strongly associated with overweight in babies later in pregnancy so where does the weight go and again this is just rough numbers here things can vary after i delivered i can remember the doctor standing in the back of the room saying look at the size of that placenta so i had two placentas that had merged so it was a huge placenta i remember but the placenta average weight is one to two pounds amniotic fluid volume can be two to three pounds some women have more some women have less your uterus gains a little bit of weight extra blood volume average baby weights about seven and a half pounds and the maternal stores can vary hugely you've all had friends or heard stories about people gaining 100 pounds in pregnancy so if you're gaining a lot of extra weight it may not be going to baby a lot of women will ask me they're very concerned they might come into pregnancy with a body mass index of 35 or 40 but they're still worried if they're not gaining weight how can my baby gain weight if i don't well baby is pulling nutrients from your bloodstream 24 hours a day the pattern of that your caloric and your nutrient intake may be important more important than your weight gain so you want to be eating small frequent meals steady supply of nutrients your your bloodstream provides amino acids uh fatty acids calories consistently to baby so um your baby can gain weight um even if you don't gain weight so um so don't worry a lot of studies have definitely shown that and again i want to caution you i see a lot of women healthy weight out there do not restrict your weight gain too severely if you are starting out pregnancy to healthy weight or underweight underweight women need to gain more women with multiple pregnancy need to gain more and we want to find just the right balance i sometimes feel like this is a fairy tale we don't want to have not too much not too little just the right amount so maternal diet and pregnancy that start by looking at macronutrients calories protein carbohydrate and fat um i just put a little slide in here cautioning about i try to bring in some environmental concerns occasionally water bottles may be a source of contaminants we've all heard about bpa in water bottles there's a lot of toxins in plastic that can leach into that water especially if you like leave your water bottle in a hot car the heating of it tends to allow more of the of the chemicals to leach into the water so i recommend getting a nice good stainless steel water bottle and you can fill that up from the tap and tap water is probably a little bit better regulated than bottled water anyway water is really important during pregnancy so i mentioned i was put on bed rest for preterm labor my doctor told she was part of a research study that found one of the few things you can do to reduce the risk of a preterm delivery is staying well hydrated when your body becomes dehydrated that same bloodstream that's carrying nutrients to the the uterus can cause the uterus to have a diminished blood supply and you can start contracting so it's really important to drink plenty of water your body needs about three liters of water a day during pregnancy more during lactation that does include the water that you get from foods you know watermelon really does have a high water content a lot of fruits and vegetables have a high water content and that does count as well so don't be overwhelmed by that three liters a day a lot of people say well how much how do i know i'm drinking enough water well you should be peeing a lot and most of you are peeing all the time if you're pregnant that's really common but you should be urinating regularly your urine shouldn't be very concentrated or dark in color it will get a nice bright yellow color urine right after you take your prenatal vitamin and that's when you're peeing out all your extra b vitamins but the rest of the time if you're not urinating frequently or your urine is very dark in color up your water and take a little bit and you know some people sweat more than others if you're really physically active on hot weather you need more water calorie intake in pregnancy can vary hugely and again i say look at measures how your baby's growing are you showing a steady weight gain we're kind of obsessed with your urine during pregnancy you notice we dip it every visit when you come in and we check your urine to see if it's super concentrated and we also check to see if you're spilling something called ketones in your urine if you're not eating enough calories during the day your body starts burning its own fat too rapidly and that can produce ketones which we don't think are as good for baby but for a slim woman i had a woman in my office yesterday who is weighs 90 pounds and she's 4 foot 11. she probably can get by in about 1800 calories to 2000 calories a day in pregnancy whereas a 5 foot 10 woman expecting twins or triplets might need more than 3 500 calories per day so you know don't force yourself to eat beyond hunger but you should be eating regularly and i gave you some general numbers there usually you need about 35 to 40 calories per kilogram per day for pregnancy with a normal bmi for a singleton pregnancy and again no extra calories in the first trimester but second and third trimester may be 350 to 450 extra calories per day the pattern of caloric intake seems to be really important one study the first one i cited below there showed that if you eat less than three meals and two snacks per day increased risk of pre-term delivery and there's all been a lot of studies by a researcher named barbara luke who's looked at optimizing good outcomes in triplet and and twin pregnancies and what she found is interesting the pattern of eating was really important you need to eat every two to three hours so her eating regimen to grow these healthier multiple gestational pregnancies was eating three meals and three snacks a day and think about combining with those meals you want to provide not just a bunch of glucose for your babies not just carbohydrate but some protein and some fat with that as well so avoid long periods without eating and that can actually increase levels of metabolites like we talked about ketones which can again cause some contractions to happen so i usually tell pregnant women and you you've got an accelerated starvation going on while you're sleeping at night babies pulling nutrients from your bloodstream so eat when you first wake up in the morning and then have snacks throughout the day and probably most of you if you're pregnant know how how hungry you can get but you're not really eating for two again historically these weight gain guidelines were based on preventing low birth weight babies you don't want to overdo the calories as well especially during the first half of pregnancy so where do women get the extra calories i always talk about fluid intake that first slide i showed you about what a healthy diet looks like you notice i emphasize drinking enough water i never said increased fluids um a lot of time when i used to get patients referred to me for excess weight gain i would say well what are you drinking oh well since pregnancy i'm drinking a liter of orange juice a day i'm drinking lots and lots of juice lots of the doctor says i have to get a lot of liquids in so we need to change our terminology and encourage you to drink more water because you don't really want to get all the extra calories in from the fruit juices and again look at a lot of the research that's coming out now it's much better for us to eat a whole piece of fruit than to drink in all that liquid sugar and a lot of people say well it's fresh squeezed juice well if you look down at the bottom of that slide even fresh squeezed orange juice 16 ounces of it it contains the equivalent of about 10 teaspoons of sugar and in our bodies there's not really a lot of difference at all ends up is turning into glucose sugar from coca-cola or sugar from orange juice so pregnancy protein needs are also very important protein provides amino acids for your baby's muscle development to your baby to make enzymes antibodies collagen pregnant women need more protein about 1 to 1.5 grams per kilogram per day most of us in the united states get enough protein this would be about 70 to 100 grams a day for most people women expecting multiple pregnancy twins or more do need to get more protein maybe 140 to 200 grams per day if you're a vegetarian or follow a restricted diet of any kind you might not get enough protein in your diet this slide i just put in here to give you some ideas of the various places you can get protein again i like for pregnant women it's a good idea when you're planning a snack have a piece of fruit but add a handful of almonds with that if you look there an ounce of almonds can give you as much protein as you get from an ounce of meat eggs i'm glad that the restriction on eggs has sort of been lifted by usda dietary advice go ahead and have an egg a day if you feel like it they're great sources of protein and a lot of other nutrients including choline if you eat yogurt greek yogurt's a great source i'm a big believer in getting some more plant-based protein in your diet beans and lentils can be great because they not only are a good source of protein but if you're having any constipation with pregnancy great sources of fiber and minerals such as magnesium as well a lot of new studies are coming out showing that all of us whether we're pregnant or not should limit our intake of red meat as a diabetes educator i'm always looking at what are the things that cause gestational diabetes and one of the things that's been implicated in causing diabetes both during pregnancy and outside pregnancy is increased red meat consumption so a lot of studies there was a big study that just came out in europe recently looking at the impact of red meat have linked red meat intake with increased risk of diabetes gestational diabetes and just general causes of illness that can decrease life span they say it's an even higher risk if you're doing a lot of the processed red meat sausages bacon things like that so replace a little bit of your red meat intake with more plant proteins and that's a healthful change i came back from the generation of fat was all bad we now know that all fat is not equal and fat is essential for our babies fat can be very satisfying during pregnancy and there are essential fatty acids that are necessary for babies fetal brain development eye tissue there are two fatty acids we must get from the diet that we're not able to synthesize independently and that's linoleic acid that we tend to get plenty of from vegetable oils and then alpha linolenic acid or omega-3 fatty acids which you've probably all heard of they've gotten a lot of press recently trans fatty acids are being mostly removed from the food market back in the 50s crisco and and margarines came on the market when it was a process where the hydrogenated liquid oils to give them a greater shelf stability and better baking properties we now know these trans fatty acids that are mostly found now in processed foods and margarine and hydro partially hydrogenated oils are harmful they do cross the placenta and can have adverse effects on babies and their cell membrane development so you want to avoid trans fatty acids and choose moderate amounts again the plant oils tend to be a little more healthful than the animal oils so canola oil vegetable oil avocado and nuts and seeds some women take a prenatal vitamin that already has a good source of the docohexanoic acid or the icosapentanoic acid which are a couple of the omega-3 fatty acids that we think have some great anti-inflammatory properties some studies have shown that having enough of these omega-3 fatty acids may improve neural development in our babies and actually reduce risk of pre-trim labor other studies haven't shown that but generally it's recommended to consume about 200 milligrams per day of these fatty acids you can get them from walnuts but you get the precursor you get the ala the alpha linolenic acid from walnuts usually you only get the other the epa and the dha from fish sardines i put a picture there a good source because they're small fish not a lot of mercury but you can also get them from marine algae as well expect a light pill is just one brand that's on the market it's a it's a supplement for exclusively for pregnant women and it gets the dha from marine algae i think nuts are a great source for healthy fats and i'm sure probably a lot of you've heard about some of the recent studies vindicating nuts again back when i was pregnant there was some concern about if we eat too many nuts is that going to increase the risk of peanut allergy now we can actually find the opposite is true this was a recent study that was just published last year and they looked at 8 200 mothers and who were not themselves allergic to nuts if you are allergic to nuts you should avoid them during pregnancy because you don't want your body to have these inflammatory antibodies that may increase baby's risk but they found that women consuming at least five servings a week of nuts had 70 percent less likely to have a child with a nut allergy there was another study that's also getting some play recently called the leap study learning early about peanut allergy again finding there might be an optimal time to introduce peanuts uh in child's diet and this was fascinating they actually looked at ethnically similar groups they looked at jewish children in israel who i guess there's some peanuty snack there it's not real peanuts but this puffed peanut snack that is introduced in babies diets starting at about six months of age compared to jewish kids raised in the uk and they found strikingly higher incidence of peanut allergy in the uk where peanuts weren't introduced until later in life so this leap study again is showing that maybe there may be key time opportunities that we should introduce a good variety of foods both into maternal diet into and into our children's diet i apologize in advance my specialty is diabetes so i'm going to talk about carbohydrate more than any of the other macronutrients so we do need carbohydrate in pregnancy again the first thing when i get somebody in my office who wants to be very compliant and i tell them they have gestational diabetes they want to cut the carbs out of the diet and i say whoa gestational diabetes occurs because your baby requires glucose for its developing brain and nervous system the recommended uh daily allowance for carbohydrate and pregnancy is 175 grams a day more if you're expecting twins mostly most of the american diet does get enough carbohydrate in their diet and again the pattern of carbohydrate intake is better you don't want to flood baby with a big blood of um you know six cups of pasta with your dinner with garlic bread and then starve for the next 24 hours it requires oxygen to process that carbohydrate so give your baby little bits of glucose throughout the day that's they can utilize it more it doesn't stress them but you do need carbohydrate this is just one way women can all of us can overdo the carbohydrate this looks like a breakfast i would have eaten when i was pregnant because back then we thought carbs were all great and fat was all bad now we know a little bit differently but just a cup of raisin bran half a banana milk and orange juice that's equivalent to about 25 teaspoons of sugar and there's not a lot of protein in that breakfast so again when i talk about more balance maybe like a yogurt parfait with some nuts and fruit with it whole grain cereal with some nuts on it have an egg scramble with some veggies in the morning or make a breakfast burrito something like that and these are good ideas for snacks too so small frequent boluses of mixed meals may be the best way to eat during pregnancy a lot of people get hung up on looking at sugar on food labels and this is just a caution here to not look just for sugar it doesn't tell the whole story any of you that have studied chemistry know that starch breaks down into sugar very rapidly in our body bodies and a bagel is probably equivalent to eating about 12 teaspoons of sugar which is more than twice what you'd get in an average a chocolate bar i happen to love chocolate too so i put that slide in there sugar free doesn't always mean healthier again a lot of starchy foods like white rice don't have a lot of nutritional value white rice is tasty and but it has a lot of carbohydrate and look how much nutrition value you get for that if you compare a cup of white rice to a cup of lentils the lentils has four times the protein much more iron calcium magnesium so again i was encouraging people to get more beans and lentils for a good source of protein so why do we worry about carbohydrate during pregnancy well most of our time on this planet food scarcity has been more of an issue so the placenta has evolved to put out hormones and even to put out a insulinase to break down mom's insulin more rapidly to push mom's blood sugar up in pregnancy so mom provides enough glucose for the developing baby so interpreting this slide that apple you eat at five weeks gestation by the time you're 30 weeks pregnant your body has to produce more than twice as much insulin to process the carbohydrate from that apple so if your body isn't able to keep up with this tripling of insulin requirements you'll develop gestational diabetes and that can put your baby at risk some of us can't modify all our risks i always joke with people the best way to avoid diabetes is choose your parents wisely you want to choose parents that don't have diabetes because that's about half your risk right there so inherent risks are family history age the age for risk of diabetes going up starts at age 25. each pregnancy we have as women increases our risk of diabetes because of this stress on the pancreas ethnicity and i had the pleasure of working with lata polynomial on an interesting study insulin resistance in southeast asian women and now she's just published a study finding that 15 of asian women develop gestational diabetes with vietnamese women having three times the risk of japanese women so kaiser northern california did a study as well that showed by a time an asian woman is 38 years of age one in four will get gestational diabetes so even at normal body weight so the risks are very high for certain ethnic groups so this great study showed us that if you modify your lifestyle you might be able to reduce the risk of gestational diabetes by 83 percent by not smoking having a normal bmi eating a healthy diet and engaging in moderate exercise 20 minutes a day you notice i put a bmi category less than 23 for asian women this is the world health organization and again because in asian populations there's higher rates of diabetes at a lower body weight the world health organization actually recommends a lower bmi category for normal weight so how well are we doing as u.s women in meeting these goals pretty good for smoking and about 80 percent of us women don't smoke only about uh 40 percent of u.s women have a normal bmi so again i think you can mitigate that a little bit a little exercise and reducing a little bit of weight the third one is the one i think is the one we should really focus on less than 30 percent of american women of childbearing age are getting 20 minutes of exercise a day so that's pretty easy for all of us start doing a little bit of walking every day and then the other factor is to have a healthy diet so in summary on carbohydrate carbohydrate is necessary for your baby but don't overdo it and don't do it all at once you want to do small frequent meals combine your carbohydrate with some protein and fat choose healthier carbohydrate foods like a piece of fruit good vegetables beans and lentils eat whole fruit don't do the fruit juice most of you wouldn't sit down and eat three oranges all at once but you're getting the equivalent of about the sugar from about three oranges and a small glass of orange juice without any of that fiber and again three meals and two snacks a day are better than three big meals so micronutrients in pregnancy there's a huge increase in iron requirement during pregnancy your red blood cell count needs to go up to account for the expanded blood volume a lot of this is in the second and third trimester so a lot of women do become anemic during pregnancy and will recommend an iron supplement for you your prenatal vitamin does have some iron in it but it may not be enough in the second and third trimester especially for you twin moms you do have increased needs for protein but some of these nutrients are really really critical and as i mentioned before folic acid is one of the most important ones early in pregnancy even before you're expecting so women at higher risk for vitamin mineral deficiency are vegans you really need to get b12 from the diet if you're following a vegan diet or take a supplement vegans are also more likely to be iron and protein deficient multiple gestation pregnancies and again you need to be eating more often teens if you start pregnancy underweight and also closely spaced pregnancies women that have get pregnant within a year of a prior pregnancy your body's a little bit depleted so you might want to have to take a little extra attention to making sure you're taking an extra supplement or or taking your supplement between pregnancies and certain medical conditions that impact could impact a healthy pregnancy or your ability to absorb nutrients this is just some of the general um micronutrient recommendations during pregnancy one thing i will mention with twin moms as well is don't take two prenatal vitamins uh too much of a good thing is not always good we know that a lot of nutrients share absorptive mechanisms for example zinc and iron share an absorptive mechanism so taking too much iron you could create a zinc deficiency taking too much zinc you can create a copper deficiency so you don't want to overdo one nutrient also some vitamins are toxic in large amounts and we'll talk a little bit about that when we get to talking about vitamin a pregnancy iron needs you need about 15 milligrams per day extra iron for the expanded red blood cell mass especially second and third trimester you do absorb iron better from meat sources but you can increase the absorption of iron from your plant sources if you add a vitamin c source there so make lentil soup and put some nice bell peppers in it for that extra vitamin c there your body does require more calcium during pregnancy that but the body's pretty smart about it you actually absorb calcium better from the gut during pregnancy and don't worry that your baby won't get enough we have a great reservoir for calcium as women we will mobilize it from our bones to keep blood levels stable so a lot of the calcium recommendation is to protect your bone health in the future um so you do require a little extra calcium in pregnancy and your prenatal vitamin won't include the full amount you need because calcium is a big mineral and if they put all the the calcium in there along with everything else it'd be too big to swallow so if you don't think you're getting enough calcium from the diet you can always take a separate supplement folic acid is really important because they've discovered that folic acid can reduce the risk of neural tube defects such as spina bifida and possibly other defects such as cleft palate and even cardiovascular defects so it's recommended that all women that could possibly become pregnant are taking a prenatal divide or a multivitamin that provides at least 400 micrograms per day of folic acid during pregnancy and lactation we recommend a supplement with one milligram per day and if a woman has previously given birth to a baby with a neural tube defect then she should be on extra supplementation four milligrams per day folic acid is so important in the diet to prevent birth defects that the u.s started fortifying food and neural tube defect rate dropped 19 percent two years after the food supply started being fortified with uh folic acid there's a lot of literature about some of these other antioxidant nutrients that have increased need during pregnancy pregnancy is a time of increased metabolism oxidative stress in some countries like in japan they they add coenzyme q which is an antioxidant nutrient that works at the mitochondrial level lycopene which is a nutrient we find in tomatoes has been shown to have some antioxidant effect and and um some studies have pointed out that some of these nutrients might play a role in preventing risk of things like preeclampsia but the data is not conclusive yet some studies show positive benefits some studies don't so there's not really enough data out there that can make a specific recommendation about those there can be a problem if you double up on your multivitamin for example or your prenatal vitamin vitamin a is teratogenic so it can cause birth defects in large amounts that's why it's no longer recommended back in the 20s and 30s everybody said eat liver it's a great source of vitamins and protein and iron when you're pregnant but now we know the liver is where we clear a lot of toxins and the liver also stores a lot of vitamin a so eating liver you can actually get toxic amounts of vitamin a it's recommended not to get more than 5 000 international units of pre-formed vitamin a a day from your multivitamin or prenatal vitamin because you will get the rest from your food as well now i made the differentiation there preformed vitamin a you get you can also make vitamin a active vitamin a from carotenoid pigments from carrots and things like that and there's not not a harm to eating too many carrots the only harmful side effect that i know of if you get a lot of carotenoid pigments is it might turn your skin orange i don't if you remember there was a case um a while back in the uk of a school boy who was drinking sunny delight and he was drinking like two liters of sunny delight a day and he turned orange and that's this was because sunny delight is actually fortified with carotenoid pigments and some tanning agencies that as well so that was a funny story be careful what you do after you deliver your baby with all those iron tablets they look like m m's they're really cute and they account for um poisoning in children so pediatric iron-related injuries were about on average about 3 000 per year reported in the period 1986 to 1996. and most kids that were poisoned by iron supplements got them they were left over from mom's prenatal or mom's iron supplements um i think when we had babies born in our house we bought just a toolbox and put a padlock on it and that's where we stored most of our medications but you know best laid plans i think i only called poison control once when my kids were small and i'd left a a diaper rash cream on the floor and one of my toddlers ate some of the tube and poison control said oh well he might have a tummy ache and a little diarrhea but that's it so i was lucky one call the poison control was all okay so let's talk a little bit about pregnant women that might have increased nutrition needs any vegetarians out there okay great so i see a couple that i do see a lot of women that follow vegetarian diets and vegetarian diets can be very helpful healthful my daughter has gone vegetarian and vegan and ended up with a gi bleed in college and i attribute this a little bit to the the semester of living on vegan baked goods which they apparently had very good at her college and not a lot of other healthier foods so um a vegan diet can be healthy if you're choosing enough lentils things like that vegans do need to have a source of b12 in their diet either from fortified foods or from a supplement iron so you can get a lot of iron from beans and lentils greens a dha source for for a vegetarian diet might be a marine algae supplement or something like that they do make one for kids even called it's gummy fish it sort of tastes like a cross between a sour patch kids candy and tuna fish so not the most tasty thing and i got those from my vegan daughter once and she would not eat them adequate protein sources for vegetarian diets if you're including dairy products really not much risk you're going to get complete protein there things like greek yogurt and dairy eggs and milk are great sources of protein for vegetarians that include eggs and dairy products calcium can be another nutrient of concern if you're not including dairy products you can get calcium from vegan sources collard greens almonds broccoli sesame seeds and some soy products are very good there are some women that have increased nutritional needs including women with a higher rates of obesity we're seeing a lot of women now get pregnant post gastric bypass the recommendation is to delay pregnancy for 18 months after you've had a gastric bypass operation they have seen a little bit increase in birth defects in women that get pregnant sooner than that we've also seen some women get unexpectedly pregnant and do just fine again closely spaced pregnancies you can have some increased risk and other medical conditions so we'll talk a little bit about twins and more magnified nutrient needs as well accelerated depletion of maternal nutrients so it's really really important to just eat more frequently i usually recommend if you're expecting twins or triplets to eat a bedtime snack and eat first thing when you wake up in the morning and if you wake up at night and you're hungry then go ahead and eat a little snack then steady supply because you're going to find it hard to eat enough at one time there's a lot of controversy about how much weight you should gain when you're expecting twins so i put two slides in here this is some recommendations by barbara luke and she focused a lot on just again one study that she did and she looked at the importance of gaining weight up to 20 weeks so this is kind of a busy slide i apologize but that first column there she's she's actually recommending a net weight gain and i put that at the top so for underweight women she recommended a net weight gain of 50 to 62 pounds but gained 25 to 35 pounds of it by 20 weeks normal weight women 40 to 54 pounds gaining 20 to 30 pounds by 20 weeks if you're overweight gain 38 to 47 pounds net gain and but 20 to 25 by 20 weeks and finally for obese women to gain 15 to 20 pounds by 20 weeks and 29 to 38 pounds overall and she gave some recommended rates of weight gain institute of medicine in 2009 they didn't have any underweight recommendations but their recommendation for twin pregnancies again was just a second and third trimester rate of 1.5 pounds per week if you are expecting twins and you start at a normal weight 1 to 1.2 pounds per week if you are starting with an overweight bmi or one pound per week if you are starting at an obese bmi so again a lot of controversies exist about what the optimal weight gain is and there's even less data on twin pregnancies and triplet pregnancies increased nutrient requirements again especially iron and calcium in twin pregnancies as well and let's move on and talk a little bit about common discomforts of pregnancy nausea heartburn and constipation i teach a class similar to this to the medical residents helping them prepare to be good caretakers for you pregnant ladies out there and i tell them if your patient is not pooping regularly she is not a happy lady it really doesn't feel good so we talk a little bit about that for those of you that aren't in medicine it's nice to review a little bit of physiology here on the left you can see a woman's anatomy prior to pregnancy and you can see her bladder isn't doesn't have a baby's head sitting on it her intestines are not scrunched up her stomach has plenty of room there and then you compare that to a woman who's near delivery and in in addition to the urinary frequency just from making more urine because you're metabolizing you're processing baby's bloodstream as well baby's head is resting on mom's bladder i remember asking the doctor what this weird lump was that i felt up here near my sternum and they said oh that's just where your intestines get shoved up at this point in pregnancy so it's harder for food constants to empty during pregnancy it's almost impossible not to get heartburn because literally your stomach is shoved up towards your throat and things just don't move well during pregnancy so you can be a little uncomfortable by the time you're in the third trimester so again eating smaller meals more often not only helps nutrient supplies to baby but it just may make you feel a little bit better if you're having a lot of nausea and vomiting sometimes eating your meals dry and then sipping the liquids between meals may help just because just it's a little harder to bring dry food up than than a lot of liquids try doing low odor foods i had a dad once who was when his poor pregnant wife was very nauseated was first waking up in the morning he was trying to feed her sardines because he thought fish was good for her and she was quite upset because the smell was disturbing to her so low odor foods may be more helpful earlier in pregnancy some women have reported salty foods like pretzels and chips help a little bit settle the stomach or some crackers and tart foods like some lemon might help some women find it helpful to just put some crackers at bedside and put a little something in your stomach before you get out of bed small frequent meals again can help with constipation and heartburn if you're constipated you really really need to up your fluid intake sip it throughout the day and a lot of us think if we're eating salads we're getting a lot of fiber two cups of lettuce has two grams of fiber it's not a lot you want to get put a cup of black beans on your salad you'll add another 15 grams of fiber and you can do a very high fiber brand cereal like all bran and get 10 grams fiber in one serving there very few americans reach the target 28 grams at least a day of fiber most of us get closer to 10 to 15 grams per day again i hate to pick on rice a little bit but a cup of white rice gives you less than a gram of fiber if you replace that with beans or lentils you can up the fiber to about 15 grams and there's a lot of other good whole grains on the market now too quinoa farro cracked wheat lots of good grains and again this is a good list just of some fiber-rich foods there some of my favorite fruits raspberries are very high in fiber eight grams per cup that's a lot more than you would get in a banana beans and lentils and lots of fruits and vegetables can definitely help but talking about foods and fruits and vegetables you need to be a little more careful about foodborne illness for pregnant women you want to wash hands more carefully you want to cook animal products completely no soft boiled eggs during pregnancy no rare steaks you want to wash all produce before you eat it you want to avoid any unpasteurized dairy products juices or cheeses you don't want to eat liver you also want to limit seafood seafood can contain mercury and also can contain fertilizer runoff if you're eating fresh water fish where there's been a lot of pcbs in the water from fertilizer runoff food that touches the soil so recent listeria outbreaks would have been from cantaloupe strawberries green onions you want to be extra careful if you're eating produce that comes direct in contact with soil like carrots or potatoes especially if you're going to eat it raw and not cook it cooking and heating will destroy the listeria but a lot of pregnant women know to avoid changing the litter box but i always say if you're touching soil or food that touches soil all the animals in the neighborhood the soil is the animal litter box for your neighbor's cats so you want to be really careful with produce that grows on the ground if you're not going to peel it or cook it be sure and wash it thoroughly there was an outbreak of listeria from cantaloupe cantaloupe is you don't usually eat the peel but the the bumpy surface harbors the bacteria a little bit more and if you don't wash the outside skin before you slice through it you can actually transfer the bacteria from the outside to the inside if you're going to cook it you don't need to worry about it so much you also want to minimize exposure to pesticides this is a slide i borrowed from the environmental working group and every year they come out with they study and and put a list out of what the cleanest least contaminated fruits and vegetables are and they always put out their dirty dozen which are the most highly contaminated uh produce on the market you can pick this up if you just google the dirty dozen environmental working group you can find that information online so it might be worth your dollars if you if you want to buy apples for example to spend the money for organic whereas asparagus and avocados are really low contaminant level you can go ahead and just buy the regular for those okay um caffeine has been highly debated and and the consensus seems to be now though a little bit of caffeine in pregnancy is fine usually about 200 milligrams per day this is also good we were talking earlier before i came in about the new usda guidelines saying that coffee may be good for us and in reducing risk of certain diseases so i'm a big coffee fan so i'm great to hear more research that we can have a little bit of coffee in our diet but that 200 milligrams per day for for pregnancy a 16 ounce starbucks coffee is going to shoot you over that pretty rapidly um i drink pizza coffee so i imagine that's even higher so you want to be cautious not to overdo the coffee but i know some of you are so conscientious you know you won't even eat one hershey's kiss so again i put down there even a whole hershey's special dark chocolate bar is only 31 milligrams caffeine so you can fit a little bit of caffeine in your diet during pregnancy so if you're really craving that cup of tea or coffee sometimes a little bit of coffee in the morning may help get the bowels moving if you're suffering from a lot of constipation so let's move on to the postpartum issues so i can leave some time for questions here we want to talk a little bit about losing your pregnancy weight healthy diet and lifestyle and encouraging you to breastfeed hopefully you're planning on breastfeeding before you even become pregnant learn about breastfeeding when you're pregnant and everybody should be encouraged to breastfeed we're very breastfeeding friendly here at stanford one of our great nurses is sitting up front here deb greenwood if you're afterwards if you have any questions on breastfeeding you can talk to deb greenwood susan crowe one of our physicians has been a big promoter and making us a very breastfeeding friendly hospital but i do want to talk about losing your pregnancy weight it is tough to lose the pregnancy weight i gained the 50 pounds they recommended for a twin pregnancy and i'm a dietitian and i was i didn't lose it for eight years so it took me a long time to take that pregnancy weight off most women if you check their weight a year after they've given birth they're going to be heavier than they were 44 of women who started pregnancy overweight were obese one year postpartum and 30 percent of women that had a normal pre-pregnancy bmi were overweight or obese one year postpartum breastfeeding and exercise can reduce the risk that they retain this weight why do we care if you gain a little bit of weight between pregnancy if you go up one bmi point between baby one and baby two that second pregnancy you have a 30 increased risk of gestational diabetes and that risk is increased even more if you go up a bmi category so if you've gone from normal to an overweight bmi category your risk is essentially doubled so tips for losing weight afterwards first of all be a little easy on yourself i i encourage you to have realistic body image goals and i think especially if you're going to be a parent to a girl we really want to encourage our daughters to have realistic body images because i know um i was discord i think when i was pregnant demi moore had that beautiful naked pregnant picture on the cover of the magazine and i just thought oh my god that doesn't look anything like my naked body right now and it was kind of discouraging and this is what most of us are exposed to all the time the average fashion model is actually underweight with an unhealthy bmi of about 16. so this is the average fashion model or the average movie actress compared to the average american woman so i think we would need to really encourage healthy body images in our media and what we represent and also for to be a little easy on ourselves that we can't be expected to look so perfect little changes can add up um i always think about that gentleman that was so dismayed when his doctor told him he had to lose a hundred pounds that he did nothing it tiny changes can add a lot of pounds on to us two extra oreos a day if it's above your basic needs can cause you to gain about 10 pounds in a year but if you walk one extra mile a day you can lose 10 pounds in a year if all things being equal drinking water if i could wave a magic wand and make one change in everybody's diets i would eliminate sodas regular soda is probably one of the most toxic things in our diet right now i don't know who's responsible at children's hospital here but if you notice if you go in our cafeteria you cannot buy a regular soda and i applaud the physicians i think the pediatricians group that we're so concerned about sodas in our kids diet that removed soda from our cafeteria um once 12-ounce soda a day could put 15 pounds a year on you and a recent study i read that so just one 12-ounce soda a day can increase diabetes risk by about 20 percent this i stole a little bit from there's a whole there's actually one diet book on the market that is evidence-based and it's called volumetrics and it's written by barbara rolls who did research at penn state most diet books are not science based at all and she found that you can increase satiety and reduce people's caloric intake just by increasing intake of foods that have a high water content like broccoli so i know i can sit down to a big plate of food if i just tell somebody they have to cut down on their portions from two cups of pasta to dinner to one they're gonna feel deprived but if you change that two cups of pasta to three cups of pasta mixed with vegetables you can really reduce the caloric mix but keep the volume up so that's one strategy and i want to encourage every woman here to breastfeed their baby there there could be a whole class on breastfeeding i just want to touch on some of the reduction in risk for your baby reduction in ear infections reduction in gastrointestinal infections even a reduction in childhood leukemia celiac disease type 1 diabetes asthma food allergies 72 percent risk reduction of hospitalization in your baby's first year of life and for you you're going to have decreased risk of breast cancer diabetes oxytocin produced when you breastfeed your baby is going to help your uterus return to normal size and it's going to help you lose your weight after baby's born breastfeeding twins is really wonderful the one caution i can tell you there is i got used to eating enormous amounts of food and it was really hard when babies weaned to cut back down i wanted to hire myself out as a wet nurse i thought this would be a great breastfeeding plan nutrition during lactation your fluid requirements i harped on that a little bit earlier you need about four liters of water a day to produce enough breast milk i made it all the way through pregnancy without getting hemorrhoids i got so constipated i think dehydration breastfeeding twins that i ended up with hemorrhoids after babies were born so be sure and keep your fluid intake up to help produce that breast milk you do need extra calories for breastfeeding but your body can supply some of that if you gain some extra weight during pregnancies you can mobilize that as well if you are planning on breastfeeding maybe just continue taking your prenatal vitamin it'll help provide some of those nutrient needs as well and we mentioned here almost four liters a day of water are needed to stay hydrated during breastfeeding again you're making that breast milk from nutrients in your bloodstream so you might want to keep up the same type of eating style eat frequently when you sit down to breastfeed your baby have your loving husband bring you a nice glass of water or something to drink so that's one thing dads can do to help out you do lose some bone mass when breastfeeding but generally you recover that bone that you've lost within six months after you wean your baby allergies occasionally babies can develop an allergy to something mom's eating it's pretty rare um if you have mucus or blood speck stools in your in your baby's diaper maybe check out with your pediatrician foods that are more likely to cause an allergy are eggs dairy products soy and wheat products and mom's diet so i'm doing pretty well on time here i just want to wrap up so preconception pregnancy and postpartum we talked about weight all the way through preconception you want to normalize weight or lose a few pounds if you're overweight during pregnancy you don't want to gain too much weight but don't starve yourselves appropriate amount of weight gain for your bmi and your if you're expecting one baby two or three after pregnancy you might want to try and take all that weight off before you become pregnant again or the risks of gestational diabetes preeclampsia and some other conditions can be greater in that second pregnancy stay active we now know that for most women physical activity all during pregnancy is a good idea now having said that if you're not a runner maybe it's not the time to try and train for a marathon when you're pregnant i had a woman come in and ask me can i do this mud run i'm pregnant and i want to do this run it involves jumping over hurdles leaping under obstacles i said i don't think that sounds like a good idea but i'd be happy to run it by your doctor and they laughed and said that she could do the run but she could not do any of the obstacles and she was not to try and win the race she was supposed to hang to the back of the pack so go for a walk 20 minutes a day if you're already a runner you can probably keep up with that but now's not the time to try some really high intense activity avoid smoking avoid alcohol avoid food and environmental toxins that's really important for pregnant women take a prenatal vitamin or multivitamin that has folate in it and consider taking a multivitamin for micronutrient insurance in the postpartum period if you're breastfeeding as well and finally plan on breastfeeding even before you plan your pregnancy prepare for breastfeeding while you're pregnant and you're going to be exhausted and overwhelmed when you take that baby home but breastfeed that baby and if you're having trouble breastfeeding call deb up in clinic or make an appointment with susan crowe or get some lactation support when you're still in the hospital it's very very challenging it's new to you and your baby put that baby's skin to skin bare baby on your bare chest and that will enhance your success with breastfeeding so we talked about some common themes tonight i again i wish everybody could start at a healthy weight but if you don't start at the healthiest weight try not to gain too much weight during pregnancy and try and lose your baby weight after delivery but be easy on yourself don't feel guilty if you're not starting out at a perfect weight healthy diet and again all of us should be working a little bit healthier on our diet that doesn't mean you can't have an ice cream bar that doesn't mean you can't have a little bit of chocolate think about the the sort of the 80 rule 80 of your food choices should be really good and you can splurge a little bit with that other 20 do something for exercise and breastfeed your baby remember this is kind of what a healthy diet should look like for all of us and some take home thoughts again i don't want anybody to walk away tonight feeling guilty about the cheez-it binge they had or the chocolate bars they've eaten or if they didn't start at the perfect weight most women are going to have a healthy baby even if they didn't start out at a perfect weight and even if they don't have the healthiest diet and i handed out this resource sheet here it just gives you some links to some healthy tools for more information including our own website and i will finish that up with some questions and i will tell you that these are my babies the the twins i showed in both spots there so they are 23 years old right now and graduated college last year so i'm happy to answer any questions including on twin pregnancy since i have some experience there", "yE2-cnS3-lI": "\"Health Food Store Supplement Advice\" How many times has this happened to you? You\u2019re in a natural food store, walking\nnear the supplement section, and an employee graciously offers advice;\nasks if you need any help. Very kind of them, but I\u2019m always left\nwondering how these people were trained. Were they trained? Do they have any idea what\nthey\u2019re talking about? So, I was delighted to learn that\nthat very question was the subject of multiple studies,\nspanning a decade. \"Health Food Store Recommendations for\nBreast Cancer Patients\" \u2014 a researcher posing as a daughter of a breast cancer\npatient went in to 40 health food stores asking for their recommendations\non cancer care. 36 out of 40 stores tried to\nsell them something. Understandable; that\u2019s their job. But 95% didn\u2019t even ask a single\nquestion about their mom, or her diagnosis, before recommending\n38 different types of products at an annual cost of\nbetween $300 and $3,000. The most common recommendation was shark\ncartilage; apparently found effective at causing nausea, fever, dizziness,\nlife-threatening hypercalcemia, and liver failure \u2014 but effective\nat little else. The same study was repeated up in Canada:\n\"Health food store recommendations: implications for breast cancer patients\"\n\u2014 34 stores; 33 different products, one of which cost $18,000 a year. One of the fake patients was even told to\nstop the tamoxifen she said she had been prescribed \u2014 a drug credited for playing\na large part in decreasing breast cancer mortality over the last 30 years.", "PxALG6dkX80": "how's it going everybody this is V fit here and I'm on walking in on what used to be my grandfather's grapevine this was like thriving real good about 35 years ago when I was a young boy I would come here and pick grapes from off of this grapevine you can see these big pillars these wooden stakes right here well they used to be throughout here and they had poles connected to them and it was like a canopy in which the grapes would just hang over a real big canopy all up in here it was so big that I could actually go up under there and I could hang from the bars and swing back and forth through the grapevine it also was like so big we had like a cot under here some chairs you can just chill out up under here it created a nice form of shade for you to relax in but like I said that was over 35 years ago and this is deteriorated over time you know my my grandfather passed away in 2003 and no one ever basically took care of it since then so it's just been kind of deteriorating ever since and you can see it's kind of completely just falling down right now but a reason I'm out here is because it's that time of year that harvest time when the grapes are ripe and I was coming to pick some grapes here but uh is really kind of scarce because there are like really none out here because the vine the grapevine is is basically all diminished and gone away ah so I'm gonna pick what I can get some grapes here and I just want to tell everyone the health benefits about concord grapes how they're good for the body and what they can do so I'm gonna see if there are any grapes here what I can scavenge from here doesn't look like it's much I actually have to kind of go through all this weeds and degree to actually get to some I see a few but the bees have gotten to them but uh let's see what's over here I see a few grapes over here in the back I got to kind of walk through all this debris they actually get to him but uh you can kind of see what's left of these concord grapes I'm gonna pick a couple I wanted to just get these in their natural state these are actually the ones they don't have any pesticides these are fully organic no pesticides have ever been on these grapes and I wanted to get these and make some grape juice doesn't look like I have much but you can kind of see what we do have available here hopefully I'll be able to get a few to make a little bit of juice out of these but basically they're all gone you can see the bees I like just all over them hopefully I don't get stung by a bee out here I'm trying to get some grapes out here but I'm being attacked by bees got a few it's got some of my basket here but this doesn't look like enough to make me a cup of juice we'll see but it's not it's slim pickings out here it's not much at all but like I said 35 years ago this was so plentiful that all this was taller than I was you could actually it was it was about seven feet tall you can kind of walk up under here they were so tall they came up the the grape vines came up and you can see the one pillar over there it was connected to the other wooden stake over here you can kind of see the the leftover remnants of it but they but the UM the grapes hung over so you can walk up under the grapevine actually neighborhood kids they would come and they would hop the fence and try to pick the grapes it was so many of them that it was just hang over the fence into the other yard over there and they were just all over the place my grandfather what he used to do he used to harvest these grapes and he would actually make homemade wine out of all these grapes I remember him sitting in the kitchen with a big vat this barrel and he would have all the grapes in there squished up and he made bottles of wine and would give them out to people in the neighborhood everybody would look forward to it every year when he did it yeah like I said there's not many grapes that I left but you can kind of see what we have it's real slim pickings I don't know what is this is a snail look at this basically came here because I wanted to do a video and tell you all about the health benefits of eating grapes and drinking concord grape juice because there are tons of benefits so I'm gonna get some of these back to the house and hopefully be able to make some juice one of the many benefits of concord grapes is that they help decrease blood pressure and that's a good thing because you know when you have high blood pressure that can lead to heart attacks it can lead to strokes and many other things that can go wrong with the body they have a natural compound in them that's called resveratrol it's found in the skin and that actually gives it the purple color that it has but the resveratrol it relaxes the loss of your arteries and that allows the blood to flow more freely throughout the body get you lively keeps you moving and so forth so eating these grapes takes the strain off the heart and the blood vessels and in turn that helps to prevent strokes and heart attacks one other benefit of eating concord grapes or drinking the juice is that they are anti-inflammatory the grapes are high in antioxidants that help to prevent healthy cells from oxidative stress an oxidative stress on your cells can lead to a number of chronic health problems like heart disease and various cancers so all the antioxidants that are in the grapes help to fight off all of those unwanted destructive properties that tend to attacked ourselves whether it's from the environment or whether it's from other things that we eat that caused damage to our eating these helps prevent that damage on ourselves another benefit of eating conqueror grapes or drinking a juice is that they can greatly improve your memory they help prevent the accumulation of certain proteins and harmful substances in the brain that costs all Hymas or dementia so eating these are drinking a juice can help you stay alert can help you stay sharp and his overall increase your memory concord grapes are also good at helping boost your immune system they increase the production of the cells in our body that fight off diseases and foreign invaders and this is really good especially during cold and flu season you want to have a strong immune system and eating concord grapes and drinking a grape juice can greatly improve upon it okay so we've talked about all the benefits of eating concord grapes and drinking a juice now what we're going to do we're gonna actually take these organic grapes pesticide free that we got out of the garden and we're gonna make some homemade natural 100% grape juice no added sugar no added colors no preservatives no artificial anything these are purely natural 100% I'm gonna take these I'm gonna put them here in this juicer I have my glass right here I got a little ice in here and we're about to make some grape juice 100% all-natural I recommend organic grapes but if you can't get organic then um you can just use what you have but I like organic I like pesticide free I like to get as close to the natural state as I can so let's go ahead and make some grape juice we're gonna taste this and see how it turns out I have my juicer here I'm gonna actually throw these all in there the seeds and everything that's another thing I like to eat grapes with the seeds that's how God made them with the seeds that's all I like to eat them I know it's hard to find grapes with the seeds nowadays they're far and few in between but if you can get you some grapes with the seed so I'm gonna take these grapes gotta throw them in my juicer and let's get some great juice going on let me taste one of these oh yeah these are these aren't really good this is gonna be some good juice but I'm just plucking these off putting some in here I don't know how much I'm gonna get hopefully I'll get a nice cup nice little cup but I'm just gonna put these on my juicer okay I'm gonna have to do a couple cycles of this well let's start off let's see what I can get [Music] all right we're all done we got a nice cup of freshly squeezed homemade grape juice let's taste this it's pretty good it's kind of thick but uh

fit stay healthy and be blessed and your body is your temple be careful what you put in there see you next time you", "jcFHQ17D_zM": "hello dear participants as an interpreter I'm speaking on the behalf of dr. Alex orokin PhD an executive director of the national Ayurvedic Medical Association of Russia this course is dedicated to the issues of matching of Constitution types in traditional Chinese medicine and the avi Adam and today we are going to talk about access of Jung which is a 100% equivalent of PETA imbalance in our Veda each time we start with basic notions for those who have just joined us and a constitution is a complex of stable structural and atomic physiological and psychological features of the person which had been formed under the influence of the innate or acquired factors why we say it is important to know the Constitution type of the patient peculiarities of the Constitution type form a tendency to certain pathogenic processes and diseases correction of the Constitution features allows to prevent development of the disease knowing predispositions to diseases the specialist can perform a preventive treatment which is a highest level of art of healing the set of characteristics is determined by certain combination of three regulation systems of Vata Pitta and kapha dosha they form nine subtypes and the tenth type is the ideal combination or balance of doses called triage here you can see the same combinations but they are presented as notions of traditional Chinese medicine and highlighted in red is the type we are going to discuss today it is pita type or access of young access of young or pita imbalance is a complex of constitutional features developing as a result of access of young energy with formation of symptoms of the full heat syndrome manifesting through functional hyperactivity and excessive products of heat let's see the clinical example based on on the personal experience of mine there is a chance that you've met such people and such patients they have a confident walk and confident appearance in general they have loud voice reddish face vigorous gesticulation they have a strong handshake and usually they are successful in business they can be managers or directors such patients would claim that they have problems with heart and maybe they even had micro in fact infection they suffer from hypertension and even the modern good quality peels wouldn't help them being in excess fire starts manifesting its nature in the body let's see what is fire from the physiological point of view what is the full heat syndrome in this syndrome Yin stays in norm while young features start growing here we can see the difference between the syndromes of emptiness hit for example and full hit syndrome the full hits syndrome is characterized through absolute domination of fire while in empty syndromes domination is relative or artificial formed as a result of the lack over the other part young warms up organs and tissues moves activates stimulates creation and development this syndrome contributes to development of hypertension according to angora daya PETA is an equivalent of bile it is something that digests Pitta lies in the basis of all the chemical and biochemical reactions which in very torrent for metabolism and metabolism is the basis of all physiological functions in the body the main location of Pizza is small intestine stomach sweatin sebaceous glands liver blood lymph organs of vision and brain access of pizza color faeces in yellow as well as urine eyes skin attain a yellowish yellowish tint it also causes hunger thirst burning sensation and difficulties with sleep according to pancha Mohammed theory Peter dosa presented as fire dissolved in the water we may see this as acidic environment of secretion enzymes of course fire is a dominating element here pancham maha bua tab allows to carry out a deep expert analysis position of each element shows predisposes Biggie's position to certain state of the body here you can see that fire is dominant and all the other pootis are sub dominant Chinese hieroglyph of Jung has two graphemes the first one is a hill and another one denotes the Sun together they mean the sunny side of the hill which is always getting warmed up sanskrit notion of pita according to our sangha Hidayah pita is something that is hot light it easily gets involved into the regulation processes it's oily it is involved in fats metabolism through this aggression of small intestine participates in regulation of water salt metabolism through the system of neutral neutralizes PTA stance it stimulates processes it's fluent mobile it implicates neighboring tissues into the processes it's stinky as Raja capita forms access of toxic metabolites that are removed through skin thus disturbing skin flora and we get this bad smell of the skin it is also spicy in liquid and bright domination of pitta dosha means domination of five fire sub doshas which form pita it was already mentioned before in the lectures that runs a capito imbalance which is typical for this constitution type leads to different pathological States connected with blood s for Pacha capito first of all it is responsible for hormonal regulation through such hormones as gastrin histamine somatostatin secretin callus cystic kenan intestinal hormones and gastric secretions presented by gastric juice pancreatic secretion bile and intestinal juice Cronje capito which is also connected with issues of this constitution type represents immune system of skin melatonin and melanin production and vascular system of skin causes of axis of a younger PT imbalance according to traditional Chinese medicine it may be an innate excess of young because of weak or week help of parents Ayurveda links it to objectified karmic factors also it made it may be connected with all kinds of congestions energy congestion blood congestion water liquids food and so on it leads to formation of pathogenic heat and excess of young also the causes of access of young or PA imbalance may be emotional disorder and shock irrational diet overeating of spicy hot food with young features an ignorant usage of young restoratives ginseng male drugs for stimulation of potency climatic factors non-endemic residence in the hot climate works towards a penetration of the outer heat as well and increase young in the body and alcohol abuse clinical manifestation of excess of young the main science here would be red face of the patient red lips acne hot hot body and limbs strong physique ulcers and erosion in the mouth and tongue sonorous loud voice related science may be preference for cold food dry mouth and the desire to drink cold water all the time bitterness and the mouth excessive appetite dries to dark urine bad breath and exam anxiety common features of the body it is food tolerance of poor tolerance of heat and love to the cold and strong sexual Constitution or libido psycho-emotional features here would be extraversion nervousness increased activity mobility and vigor tongue diagnosis would show that the tongue has this red color with a yellow coating and pulse diagnosis will show full and frequent frequent pools pulse Manduca got a pulse with high Balam let's see what disorders of excess of young may be symptoms of full hits syndrome with a triad of symptoms such as fever redness turbid yellow nature of excreta another disorder one of the most important here is so-called silent killer of the 40% of population of the planet it is hypertension and also we may say that it may be acne caused by rise up of the pathogenic fire and different inflammations all over the skin as well what features of excess of young we will see in the cardio interval gram during the examination on the very poles device pie chart that you can see on the right will show an absolute domination of fire total power in average is near 2500 up to 4,000 milliseconds squared low frequency range takes not less than 60 up to 80 percent of the spectrum very low frequency 10 to 20 percent of the spectrum and high frequency 5 to 10 percent spectrum equivalents of the empty Heat syndrome cardio interval a gram total power not less than 1000 milliseconds square low frequency not less than 50 60 percent of the spectrum very low frequency 25 to 35 percent high frequency less than 15 percent indices of the time analysis an axis of young or PT imbalance an average duration of the heart cycle would be 750 up to 850 milliseconds mode will be 800 up to 800 25 milliseconds tension index a 60 to 80 conventional units and mode amplitude a zero point 2004 point 13 we can also see that variation range will be with a tendency to the increase showing a substantial adaptation resource restoration index will have tendency to normal restoration rate in young index we'll be of 100 up to 150 conventional units with tendency to well express tension of Pingala Nadi adequacy index will show high requirements and normal capacities of the body and centralization index below 6 and 7 conventional units shows strengthening of the autonomous control loop integral indices and axis of young here we check for indices index of a more functional state and functional indicators of cardio interval gram values index of more functional state shows that that people have sufficient life force that is located in the lower border or the high functionality range or in the upper border or the medium functionality stress level in these people is near 60 conventional units which means that resistance to stress is quite strong adaptation price is just below 30% and the speed of biological aging would always be in a red zone pulse characteristics will see the classical features of Manduca got a pulse Manduca means frog and ngati means features of movement it means jumping if you use Vasant lots a three-point system you'll find pita is always above three points Veda pulse device will show pita is higher than six points Vega will be above 73 in $77 it is elastic rhythm elastic rhythmical pools for Peeta are typical for PTV clich\u00e9 valleys strong typical for Peeta vikre tea as well but Pete ability in balance and tapa mana is Dix na Agni take a look at the cardio interval a gram of the empty syndrome formed as a result of an absolute deficiency of in we see that cardio interval a gram is kind of torn there is a tendency to rigidness of the rhythm which is connected with very excess of wind scattergram is very much typical for the empty syndrome with a trav\u00e9s stress shifting to Vata range in the full heat syndrome pita range is presented substantially in the scattergram by energy in excess of young or pita imbalance the level of energy is high total level goes up to 100 120 percent systems of organ organs which would be tense as metabolic and regional blood flow centers are liver gallbladder small intestine where tension is above 10% in the empty syndrome - compared to the first sign is total level in the range of 75 percent liver gallbladder small intestine tension is above 10 percent and heart is below 5 percent column tension is also below 5 5 percent there also would be amazed a ssin of qi of kidneys which would be below 5 percent as well let's talk about one of the main disorders of this Constitution type it is hypertension or a silent killer as they call it a stable increase in blood pressure systolic pressure to a value of more than 100 140 millimeters of mercury and or diastolic pressure of more than 19 millimeters of mercury according to that of at least two fold measurements by the korotkov method for two or Morgan's consecutive visits of a patient with an interval of less than one week the prevalence of hypertension in the population is 20% in the age group over 65 years old is 50% so why capitation hypertension is a silent killer it takes the first place among causes of sudden death because people with hypertension get used to its symptoms and do not do not take any preventative measures or of treatment until it's too late arterial hypertension reduces life expectancy stroke and myocardial infection occurs three times more often types of hypertension in traditional Chinese medicine it can be increase of young of liver the full heat syndrome it will cause headaches unstable psyche short temper irritability the patient Phil would feel anxious it also would cause a hyper V of the face dry mouth constipation yellow coating of the tongue methods of treatment of such type of hypertension would be to calm the fire of young and harmonized liver another type of of hypertension according to traditional Chinese medicine is emptiness of yin yang excess syndrome or empty heat it can cause vertigo tinnitus anxiety insomnia may be a feeling of numbness in the trunk and extremities pinkish patches on the tongue methods of treatment here would be to nourish Yin and soothe young and another type is emptiness of yin and young at the same time it also causes vertigo tinnitus pain in the lower limbs numbness in them knee pain insomnia or nightmares pale face pathological pollution impotence pale coating on the tongue and methods of treatment is to nourish yen and strengthen young and types of hypertension in Ayurveda it can be Pete the type of hypertension and the person would get red-faced inflamed eyes severe headaches photophobia nasal bleeding burning sensation irritability and anger helpful here would be bitter taste bitter laxatives and sedatives another type of hypertension is hypertension of vada type it will cause the growth of blood pressure on the background of nervous fatigued excitement and here or beneficial would be toning therapy you should take some adapted jeans or recommend some adapted jeans for central nervous system it also can be hypertension of caja type or hypertension of water on the background of obesity fatigue edema high cholesterol blood pressure is constantly high and here you should recommend theoretics that would stimulate metabolism physiological mechanism or regulation of blood pressure first of all Hema dynamic factors directly determine the level of blood pressure and neural humoral factors have a regular regulatory effect on hammer dynamic factors which allows you to keep blood pressure within norm so what is Hema dynamic factors and the main factor is ami need blood volume it is amount of blood entering the vascular system in one minute and it is determined by the derivative of the beat blood volume and heart rate another Hema dynamic factors general peripheral resistance or permeability of resistive vessels arterioles the next one is blood viscosity and the circulating blood volume newer humoral systems of blood pressure first of all first of all here we have immediate control of blood pressure and it is presented by bio receptive mechanisms camera receptive mechanisms a shame a correction of central nervous system it gives an immediate regulation of blood pressure in case it rises also have medium term control and it is presented by renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antidiuretic hormone and capillary filtration and another type of newer humoral regulation of blood pressure is a long-term action the brain stem is located at the base the brain and constantly receives information from the overlying structures of the brain in particular it receives information from the temporal lobe because of what auditory stimuli can lead to increased arterial pressure also information comes from the orbital lumbar motor lobe which means that the magnitude of arterial pressure can change under the influence of psychic gene induced stress which accumulates in vascular mater center whereas studies have shown hypertension takes its beginning another reason of high blood pressure is that hema receptors and baroreceptors get too much of a blood supply and get too much excited and disturbed and this information also enters the vascular motor center medium-term regulation of blood pressure is presented by renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system gets agitated as a result of the increase of the amount of angiotensin ii hormone in the blood and angiotensin ii is the hormone which is more than other hormones in our body is responsible for the increase of blood pressure it is even stronger than the stress hormone adrenaline as it causes a durable increase of arterial pressure mechanisms of the medium term regulation of blood pressure is also presented by antidiuretic hormone antidiuretic hormone is a hormone that reduces the release of water the hormone increases watery absorption in kidneys and increases blood pressure long-term action system of regulation of blood pressure includes regulation by oldster own local renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system endothelial pressing mechanism depressor and depressor mechanisms are presented by prostaglandins canonical a clean system and the filial versatility factors naturally the hormone which is produced in the heart rate in angiotensin oldstone system is extremely important as it maintains the normal blood flow in kidneys in case of decrees of the blood flow toxic metabolites start accumulating in plasma which may lead to intoxication and even death that is why our body has to always maintain sufficient blood pressure the share of hereditary factor in the formation of blood pressure is 75 percent genetic factors create conditions for the inclusion of hypertensive action of environmental factors susceptibility to environmental factors is associated with polymorphism or mutation of genes candidates such as angiotensinogen jen-jen genes of angiotensin converting enzyme green engine and others that you can see in the slide angiotensinogen in people impede the people suffering from access syndromes of fullness syndromes is observed a point mutation of the angiotensinogen this gene predisposes to hypertension coronary artery disease and myocardial infection next Aegean important from the point of view of blood pressure is gene of angiotensin converting enzyme or AC e in people of Peter Constitution with axis of young there is found a poor in mutation of this gene and this gene controls the level of angiotensin converting enzyme in the blood and this enzyme converts angiotensin first to angiotensin ii so it's mutation predisposes to arterial hypertension myocardial infraction and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy also gene that is important here is gene that regulates Iranian synthesis in people with the syndra's syndromes with Vaught the imbalance a point mutation of the iranian gene is observed this gene determines the level of renin in the blood which is formed in the kidneys and may cause weakness on the of young kidneys or energy of young kidneys so the gene predisposes to hypertension as well also important here are genes regulating all the sturm synthesis synthesis mutant jinn disrupts the synthesis of all the stone through the classic way and the synthesis switches to ACTH dependent way which increased blood pressure through natural retention increases decreases I'm sorry Union in blood and inhibit angiotensin ii synthesis and that leads to development of volume dependent form of hypertension such disruption is typical for Kapo constitution and syndromes of dampness disruption of transmembrane transportation of ions may also lead to increased blood pressure genetic defects of sodium transport leads to its accumulation in cells the accumulation of sodium in the smooth muscle cell of the vessel leads to increase in proliferative activity hypertrophy of the vascular wall increased sensitivity of the vascular wall and Angie angiotensin ii and catecholamines increase it increases peta accumulation of salts and causes high osmolarity genes regulating the expression of sodium in kidneys there are genes that regulate the expression of sodium in the kidneys and sodium is a key ion in the pathogenesis of hypertension so the disruption in the process of sodium expression in the kidneys includes mechanisms associated with the development of hypertension a number of studies have shown that in the kidneys of patients with arterial hypertension the number of nephrons is significant they reduced nephron is a functional unit of kidness that actually contributes to plasma filtration if you remember amber Genesis the formation of nephrons ends four or six weeks before birth and if a pregnant woman eats poorly and her diet is of a low protein content this may predispose to a situation where at the time of formation of nephrons in the baby there would be deficiency of structural components and less nephron would be produced so it predisposes to development of hypertension in this amber gene is a stage there all of environmental factors is extremely important if you do not exclude these factors the chance to help the patient is very low excluding them you increase the chance of recovery by half so trigger factors in initiating development of arterial hypertension can be an excessive intake of table salt insufficient intake of calcium insufficient intake of magnesium smoking alcohol obesity a low physical activity socio-economic situation and psycho-emotional emotional stress situations if the patient is not ready to change his or her lifestyle the doctor should make it clear that the chance of recovery would get very low one of the things that is important to do is to reduce the daily intake of salt which is a key factor in development of hypertension an excessive intake of table salt an excess of sodium means growth of blood volume increase of blood pressure the accumulation of sodium in vascular smooth muscle are causes edema of the vessel wall the accumulation of sodium in the vascular wall causes an increase in its sensitivity to vasoconstrictor factors it means increased sensitivity of sympathetic neural system as it was said an insufficient calcium intake can also lead to blood increased blood pressure or hypertension daily requirement of intake of calcium is 800 to 1,000 milligrams deficiency of calcium in food and water causes enhanced capture of calcium enhanced capture and accumulation of calcium in the Maya sites which causes blood pressure an insufficient intake of magnesium is also a factor development of hypertension daily required daily requirement of magnesium is 300 or 350 milligrams every hundred milligrams of magnesium taken a day reduce blood pressure by 3.5 millimeters of mercury and magnesium deficiency causes activation activation of sympathetic nervous system and high sensitivity to stress conditions which leads to hypertension smoking also leads to increased blood pressure as nicotine stimulates the release of catecholamines or stress hormones which provokes a hypertensive reaction for people predisposed to hypertension alcohol is extremely dangerous 20% of all cases of essential hypertension is caused by alcohol abuse alcohol consumption of more than 3 grams per week increases the risk of hypertension by 60% the risk increases by 90% with the use of strong alcohol of more than 35 grams per day per day a morning hangover activates sympathetic Newars a newer system which causes an increase of blood pressure and this agitated state of sympathetic nervous system remains for about 7 days after the intake of alcohol another factor one must pay attention to is obesity according to the Framingham study the indice incidence of obesity in people with newly diagnosed hypertension is 70% for each extra 5 kilos of the body weight blood pressure rises by 5 millimeters of mercury the only thing that makes it possible to the organism to pump all the blood through the body of 120 kilos of weight is to rise blood pressure so weight loss will lead to a natural decrease of hypertension with the help of the VAD opposed device who can calculate the body weight index and you can also use it in treatment of cholesterol and metabolic syndrome issues Belgian studies showed that regular exercise reduces blood pressure you should pay attention to the fact that soft loads or light or isotonic loads reduce blood pressure but isometric loads our harsh loads may arise blood pressure low physical activity reduces capacity of cardiovascular system to adapt to the stress cycle motional stress situation may also cause blood pressure a long active stressful situations play significant role in the increase of arterial pressure to find out about stress in the body use integral in this step here you should pay attention to the stress level on the right if this index is located in the range between 60 to 200 it means that inner systems of the body given adequate reaction to stress if it is situated in the range between 200 to 500 it means that stress agitates systems that adopt your body to stress causing tension in them as a result we tend to stress induced situation and hypertension as one of them if it is higher than 500 it means that the adaptive systems are extremely tense if there is a tendency to hypertension one must also pay attention to stress index dynamics this is one of the screenshots of the dynamic module the dynamic module allows to carry out monitoring of any index you decide to check here you can see dissertation where after being in a comfort zone the stress index jumped up which may mean the increase of hypertension hypertension pathogenesis is quite complicated and it implicates various systems it may be unclear activity of sympathy adrenal system it can be an increased activity of indian angiotensin ii l old strong system it can mean endothelial dysfunction it can be caused by disruption of the depressor function of kidneys and so on and the first thing included in to hypertension pathogenesis is an increased activity of the sympathy and renal system the factors that may provoke an increased activity of this system is a high-calorie diet or diet with high content content of carbohydrates physical inactivity and certain genetic factors the high activity of the sympathetic nervous system and of the higher centers that control it causes an electrical instability in the heart muscle that can run the arrhythmia right down to the sudden death in high activity of the sympathetic nervous system hi begins to work in a head high abnormality mode this leads to its hypertrophy to spasms of the arterioles and ultimately to hypertension and heart failure as it was already mentioned iranian angiotensin oldest roan system plays a significant role in the development of hypertension the process starts in the liver where production of angiotensin an old strong switch to organ switch the organ to work towards development of hypertension and in the failure dysfunction also may be one of the reasons of hypertension mechanism that relaxes and narrows the vessels depends on many factors on the blood flow on the presence of an inflamed injured area resulting formation of a blood clot which is then glued with arrows chlorotic elements a product which contributes to development of epithelial dysfunction is the product many people cannot say no to it is refined white sugar or white killer as we may call it due to its dangerous features disruption of the depressor function of kidneys is also a reason of development of hypertension there men there are many hormones euston kidneys which are responsible for the control of systemic state of arterial pressure in case of disruption in the process of production of the hormones one will get problems with blood pressure the general scheme of pathogenesis of more hypertension we may conclude that there are certain genetic and outer conditions which in different paths would take us to one result which is development of hypertension knowing the classification of hypertension types will let us understand better where it is possible to treat the patient without chemical drugs and where it would be impossible to substitute chemical drugs with anything else all the types of hypertension starting with stage 1 are considered to be curable only with chemicals in some cases though it is still possible to treat the person without chemicals in the first stage of hypertension one of the saddest things about stable high blood pressure is that it causes damage of target organs we can get hypotonic heart damage of the peripheral arterial hypertensive water and large arterioles hypertensive arterioles hypertensive nephropathy changes of cerebral vessels which may lead to an telepathy and so on now let's talk about the early signs of development of hypertension it would be tension in the pericardium channel heart channel and kidneys channel sometimes it is also a liver channel the most frequent combination is combination of pericardium and heart channel where tension of kidneys channel will predispose to empty syndromes and tension of liver channel to full syndromes in sub dosha tab we pay attention to prana Vata which is responsible for tension in general the an errata as it coordinates tension of vessels and that HA capita especially in case of presence of traumatic psyche emotional stress conditions which also influence vascular toners in ayurveda hypertension is often called rock the pizza so if we are talking about Tatas first of all it would be rockton and Marja standing not only for a bone marrow but also for mechanisms of nervous regulation let's look at the restorative major measures in excess of young repeater imbalance from the point of view of Ayurveda in traditional Chinese medicine and modern medicine so restorative measures should include elimination of etiologic factors restorative diet sight a correction or aroma therapy acupressure of a biological active points in Marla's and physiotherapy according to the standards of different countries there is a certain border of hypertension level which is considered to be a starting point where it is necessary to start a treatment those numbers can be explained economically or politically as for example insurance companies may not be willing to pay money for treatment which explains the high borders in standards you may see that in England the starting point for treatment is 160 by 100 which is a hypertension of the first or second stage according to World Health Organization the treatment is to be started at 160 by 95 but we should understand that we should not wait till slightly increased hypertension rises to 160 by 95 as it is always better to start preventive measures before it's too late it would be impossible to treat hypertension without taking care of the following factors first of all it is elimination the stress factors psychosocial situation migration shift based work psyche emotional situations such as normalization of relations in the family or at work the organization of healthy lifestyle normal rest a normal work activity discontinuation of intake of drugs that increase blood pressure hormonal contraceptives non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug glucocorticoids and antidepressants the general principles of nutrition for younger PETA first of all it is cold dry slightly heavy food raw with moderate amount of oils and spices avoid fried and cooked on fire sweet astringent and bitter flavors are recommended bitters should become the main component of nutrition salty sore and spicier food increased pita so we do not take those and it will be enough to eat only three times a day and do not have late dinners as for clinical diet in hypertension there is a certain high for sodium diet number ten it is recommended to people of this Constitution type it is a low-calorie diet and it also controls the level of cholesterol and prevents formation of blood clots it also limits the amount of liquids which is important for normal blood volume and limits the products which may agitate sympathetic nervous system it also provides a sufficient amount of potassium and magnesium the reduction of the concentration of table salts is important as we already mentioned in treatment of hypertension lowering of consumption of salt significantly reduces arterial pressure one should refuse to eat to use table salt excessively or use extra salting and products with high content of salt such as salted fish canned food and so on enrichment of the ration with calcium is extremely important and increased content of potassium salts has a diuretic effect and promote sodium excretion and decrease of blood pressure it is contained in dried apricots raisins nuts prunes oranges tangerines cabbage wild rose baked potatoes cereals gooseberry current tomato juice milk and cottage cheese here is a Kemper diet kempner diet which was developed for treatment of hypertension it is recommended for crisis period and it should be used for three or four days especially in case of excessive body weight we one should eat or cook a rice porridge cooked on water without salt two times a day plus compote six times a day also you should take 50 grams of rice 400 grams of sugar or honey 1.5 kilos of fresh fruit or 240 grams of dried food daily norm of protein is 10 grams fats is 0.4 grams in carbohydrates 308 grams it helps to decrease blood pressure on the very first day of starting of the diet a maximum on the second or fourth day fruits are recommended to people of this type fruit juice is beneficial as well most of the fruit are beneficial they are the cooling soothing and harmonizing effect you should you can see here in a table fruit that would reduce heat and increase heat so oranges raspberry mango plums would reduce heat as well as but but quickly and strongly apples and pomegranate will reduce heat as well according to traditional Chinese medicine such fruits as grapefruit watermelon and persimmon are recommended as antihypertensive fruits most vegetables especially raw vegetables are useful in case of low energy or strong imbalance thermal treatment is necessary for vegetable steamed vegetables are preferred add ghee and avoid frying there are vegetables that we move or increase the fire as well as fruits for example potatoes parsley sweet peppers corn pumpkin zucchini remove heat and onions and chili increase heat Chinese medicine considers bitter pumpkin as a great product which removes the heat in China they also use loofa Egypt chica it is a subtropical plant of the pumpkin family which is greatly which greatly removes heat and poison it cools blood removes the wind and dissolves flag crops whole grains are useful for PETA they strengthen and harmonize it although you should not take you should not make it the main component of the diet for PETA people and you should be careful with crops try to avoid rye buckwheat as they would increase fire PETA people digest legumes better than people of other Constitution types and it gets digested better with cumin legumes cooked in animal fats or if warmed rewarmed increased pita as for beans a one should limit peanut and lamb till as they are not constitutionally appropriate for pita nuts and seeds have oily and warm nature therefore they tend to increase pita especially when fried and salty so we do not want to take them if a protein diet is required in which for vegetarians nuts and seeds are more preferable than meat and fish according to traditional Chinese medicine honeysuckle buds and Coralville lotus seed is beneficial for this constitution PETA people are good and digesting milk protein milk diet fasting is recommended here remember the diet products tend to increase pita acidic properties and work energy of enzymes so you can see the effects of milk food products the products that remove heat it is cheese unsalted cottage cheese milk cream and increase heat such products as Kleber yogurt ice cream and so on pitas love meat and can't help eating meat they think that somehow or PETA people think that they get power of meat but actually meet only provokes manifesting the negative sight of their nature meat increases fire so it is necessary to reduce the amount amount of meat and your diet to soothe the fire oils are over hot nature it is better to limit and avoid them animal fats are the hottest then go oils of nuts and seeds the nature of ghee and butter is cooling so they're more useful than others almost all of the spices increase pita except those that are of a neutral or bitter nature spices with neutral or cold energy are recommended for this constitution type and for this syndrome and again one should limit or exclude salt it is important that you should mention to your patient that there is a plant that is called Korean drum set even that can solve many problems of this constitution type its Russ's astringent bitter and spicy guna is light rough and dry villian is neutral and its special action or popova is a great balancing of pita to balance the fire or balance the heat and peat in general it is necessary to drink enough water spring water is recommended here also may be useful Greenland a green and white cheese as well as teeth of stringent herbs such as Jasmine for example hibiscus dandelion and so on avoid coffee and tea with hot spices some sorts of green tea and white tea are recommended to people of this type although in general black and green tea is not advisable for them white tea terminates heat brightens mind beverages made of honeysuckle buds glow flower Isetta scores of the lotus seeds i said his rhizome are also recommended weight loss in moderate hypertension can lead the normalization of blood pressure in severe hypertension individuals with obesity reduction of body weight increases effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy here beneficial maybe juice fasting fasting days one or two times a week Kaffir day curds day fruit or vegetable juice regular dynamic physical loads are also beneficial for blood pressure not normal normalization I recommend to your patients to walk not less than seven or 10,000 meters during a day moderate exercise significantly reduces blood pressure it may be walking running swimming cycling skiing playing tennis volleyball regardless of weight loss or changes in sodium excretion isometric loads it can be lifting weights for example contribute to the increase of blood pressure so we do not recommend them and those walking workout workout on the home exercise buy a bike can be beneficial psycho relaxation and rational psychotherapy leads to a decrease in systolic hypertension and it is most effective with mild hypertension it enhances the effect of antihypertensive drugs and a cycle axing therapy can be progressive muscle relaxation autogenic training meditation techniques and biofeedback therapy there is also progressive muscle relaxation with that we have just mentioned it is a system of exercises consisting consisting of alternating tension and relaxation of various muscles with mandatory concentration of attention on the process of muscle transfer transition from a tense state to a relaxed one and alternate alternating stress and relaxation works towards learning relaxation techniques autogenic training is based on the use of formulas of order suggestion in achieving relaxation first step here would be relaxation training through exercises with the usage of formulas that promote and enhance the feeling of warmth and heaviness and the limbs warmth in a solar plexus coolness in the forehead formulas related to the heart and second step is near Nirvana therapy meditation my methods can also be beneficial to normalize blood pressure it can be passive focusing on image an object word sound physical impact it causes a decrease in the activity of the left hemisphere and increased activity of the right hemisphere it restores connection and the level of adaptive adaptive reactions biofeedback module of that appalls program will allow you to choose a person all the methods that I have just mentioned and show that one can control his own blood pressure it is a wonderful technique based on an interactive game where the person wins only in the case he manages to calm his heart remedial birth in hypertension can also be beneficial it improves cerebral circulation reduces sensitivity of them cardiovascular system and increases renal blood flow do rhesus in nature rhesus reduces peripheral vascular resistance relaxing the muscle of the blood vessels so on a therapy and hypertension is also great but it is important to divide it in two parts the third the first part is of 10 minutes and the second part is about seven or eight minutes with cooling between coals at a temperature of 22 or 25 Celsius the full recover of heart rate at least 30 minutes and it is recommended in the amount of one or two times a week hypoxic training can be beneficial in restoration of blood pressure daily stay in a hyperbaric chamber at an altitude of

that you should not blindly use horrible compositions created for treatment of hypertension as hypertension of one constitution type differs from hypertension of another Constitution type and the first component here in this horrible composition recommended for mild hypertension is valerian a rhizome valerian is of a hot energy it means it will increase Pitta if it is a highly balanced horrible composition other herbs may neutralize this hot effect but in general we must understand that valerian is effective in hypertension of attack alpha type and harmful for Peter Constitution the next component is Leonora's weed it also to be taken carefully as it is it has spicy v Park and in a long-term use it may also stimulate beta another component is critical foods crataegus is of a

myocardial metabolism and you can see them on the right of the screen additionally we should use sedative herbs and the latex another herb that is often used in treatment of hypertension is viscum album it has a hypertensive sedative and spasmolytic effect it lowers heart rate but it increases Pitta so we do not want to use it in treatment of this Constitution type though it is recommended for work hypertension of other Constitution types are all four layer serpentine is also often used in the treatment of hypertension but you can see in its characteristics that it would only make harm in the presence of full heat as it increases sympathetic activity it is perfect for koepcke and what a coupla hypertension rules of creation of herbal composition in hypertension first rule is a constitutional approach to select verbs of needed characteristics and the second rule is a pathophysiological approach in hypertension we must use herbs of the following groups metabolites the plants

massage EHF way of physiotherapy and aviod a quantum dear friends thank you for attention good bye you", "RxQ_xR0Hcqo": "rehabilitation is probably the most neglected part of the trauma spectrum look around here and see where you where you sent somebody get better from trauma and I'll guarantee you you can find plenty of places to get better from stroke or heart attack with trauma so I as part of the reason one of our biggest problems is traumatic brain injury I've asked dr. Lee Henderson to talk about that the she is our expert on this field podiatrist so I trained in Birmingham I'm from south Louisiana I went to med school here actually I finished in 94 I did my transitional internship here I got to make it up like I wanted it and then I went on to Birmingham husband's your office and sounded to tell y'all have four children and all you ladies going into medicine or there think about having a family and what specialty you choose because I was fortunate that just especially that's easy to have family yeah so there's my Marshfield let me talk a little bro head injury and I'm gonna make an excuse about my slides there from an email that I sent to somebody and they made Corrections I can't find my original slide so I'm gonna have to redo them so there's a lot of misspellings and stuff so just forgive me I am i work for neurology and trauma so i do a little bit of both so we'll talk about head injury epidemiology i'm you know one point seven million head injuries annual so these people are not just somebody that's unconscious for days or whatever an ICU these are people they go to the ER and they go home and they've had a positive loss of consciousness mile maybe thirty seconds but that's still a head injury I had an attending who said a head injuries a head injury the head injury and so anything like that is a head injury and we can't ignore those because those are the majority that leave eighty percent or ER visits so those people go home they the press do they have like post-concussive syndrome issues later and you know they kind of get ignored or they ignore them or the kid that you know the concussion from football is having trouble in class because he has attention issues or he has headaches whatever so those are the majority so we really have to not ignore that bimodal the younger there's the older ones male to female it's you know males are higher risk they're gonna have more head injuries it's kind of the same it's a simple thing ejections are the most common cause of death from a head injury and then an MVA is the most common cause of a head injury period violence at second and alcohol is involved in a bunch so severe is coma GCS of 3 to 8 moderate and 90% or mild like we talked about so the ones that we see here are a very small percentage and that's what I think we miss a lot at least out in the private community I see I've seen it I think it's getting better because of all what's going on with football and all this stuff and there's more awareness but there's just a lot that we do kind of miss so post-traumatic amnesia is the most common predictor the most common picture of outcome and it's when you you know when you start being able to lay down that new memory you get 75% score on the goat or whatever two days in a row you know what you have for breakfast you know what you had for lunch you know who visiting you that nobody's cueing you to tell you you can remember it and can go on and that's when you're out of post-traumatic amnesia so mechanisms of injury and this is sort of my the primary's contusion cortical tissues diffuse axonal injury the what do you call that the hallmark or whatever is white matter petechial hemorrhages on a CT scan if the CT is normal does that mean they didn't have a head injury no so it's so annoying when when people said what the CT was normal really who cares your CT is not going to be normal not anymore I can show the few sec so no injury but still and then where I can be close to normal but if they're unkind just something's wrong so you know those are like a that's like a board question for my my grapes so secondary injury excited toxicity your release of neurotransmitters glutamate calcium mitochondrial failure I mean all of this intracellular stuff so swelling is increased intravascular blood and edema is increased Blayne volume so brain waters so those are two different we use swelling and edema interchangeably but theoretically they're not or semantically they're not so we have basal genic edema which is and these a lot don't you know don't hate me for my my typos vasogenic is extracellular Dima Saito genic is intracellular edema and I have all of these like have so much stuff on it cuz the neurology guys love to have everything so they can just kind of read the slides and use them to study so that's why I kind of do that so focal versus diffuse injury you have contusions the most common are frontal and temporal epidural they're lucid than they're down so you have the person that kind of knocked out then they kind they're you know they get hit in their days then they wake up and they can walk into the ER and I literally had a guy when I was in med school that walked into the yard said I got hit in the head by a bat and that's he's walking like this so he's the one that I remember because that was so textbook subdural you have 30% in severe traumas subarachnoid hemorrhages or in you know aneurysms APM's and you can have it from trauma two dai those are the grades just so we we know what grades are but Grade three dai involves the brain stem and that's not a great one to have don't write people off though like if you're in the ICU and somebody has a severe brain injury just and doctor why go problem remembers this young lady who had brain stem stroke it was a car wreck and she had bilateral carotid dissection and and she wasn't as like a head injury like this but and she had brain stem contusions all this stuff and they were gonna pull the plug on her Friday night at 7 o'clock the family changed their mind at 5 o'clock a week and a half later she mouthed to her husband I love you went to rehab and was singing before she left rehab so for children and she's with them now which is I get goose bumps anyway so don't write people off recovery plasticity is the ability of the brain to repair itself we can't repair a whole lot but it can do some we have neuronal regeneration and we call that collateral sprouting functional reorganization is like unmasking neuronal reorganization and like collateral spreading and unmasking are sort of some like catch words that we use to help us learn about the brain stuff Dionysius is spontaneous return a function it's a functional loss in an uninjured part as well and so it finds it it finds a way to get back we have disorders of consciousness and these are just some different things you know it's a function of the ascending reticular activating system and the cerebral cortex and your coma your eyes are closed but there's no sleep so close but no sleep in a vegetative state your eyes are open but there are sleep-wake sleep-wake cycles so those are just some things to know to think about so coma no sleep persistent vegetative state and permanent vegetative state those are just things to have so to make sure this isn't a kid no okay Glasgow Coma Scale I mean I just put it up for four you know you guys you guys are y'all in surgery right now okay so this is the Glasgow Coma Scale I know y'all have dealt with it we don't need to go over it so initial management of head injury not included this just for like ICU purposes and just because this is what we do like this is not anything that I would be involved in you are you are you know we get resuscitation it's all the basics you know the ABCs CT MRI kind of thing we'll do serial exams the GCS is so important in the field because they come in intubated so what was their GCS before there are 3t yes but what were they really before monitoring you know a bold sedation lorazepam does not decrease respiratory drive so that one's a okay one to use but in the long run we don't like benzos and I'll come to that earlier and then there's of course surgery if we need surgery acute management your CPP we wanted here ICP monitoring you use it for a GCS of 3 to 8 with an abnormal CT and if they're older than 40 or their systolic blood pressures low and I I looked at these are parameters that come from my my board stuff and I've talked with our some of our ICU people have made some some changes so it's not ideal let's say like we it might have some different things you might have a different a different way that you don't you know you guys look at it but this is from my stuff had a bed less than 30 is when your ICP is gonna your intracranial pressures gonna be higher so you want it up make sure the c-collars not too tight had his midline we do hyperventilation we use mannitol things like that just these are just sort of like for like completeness sakes so management in general we want stabilization preventative stuff bowel bladder nutrition you know their spasticity swallowing all of these things are kind of normal we have five senses and we want to avoid over stimulation I don't know how many times you guys have had patients that are have a head injury and their parent their parents or their there are families and they're going daddy you fouling your head you hit your head you know and they're screaming at it and you don't know what's going on but he's getting all like this and all this noise like our ICU right now they're gonna redo it so we can have separate rooms for each patient because that's so important you know day night kind of things and the noise and we forget as physicians and caregivers nurses everything we forget that this patient's like sick and we're yelling and having a party you know chatting with our friends and we forget that that you know that kind of stuff can irritate them even if they're unconscious so once they're emerging out of coma we use niversity amulets for arousal some of the studies and dr. Samra is not here but what's talking about amantadine what you'll hear later that that you have to use it within 48 hours but really not necessarily you know once they're emerging then you can give them something to help them out we've done study there a man sitting near four and five weeks out but serial GCSEs are so important use yours but your nurses too are so important because they're gonna get a little bit different response and so a patient might do something for you but not for her or do something for her and not for you so it helps us to know where they really are so physical issues there are swallowing issues up to 85% of patients with head injury so oh my goodness let's you know let's not ignore that let's not say oh well they seem to be okay but silent aspiration is so common and a speech therapist that we're here right here would say oh yes please you know there's so much silent aspiration so a good coffin 77% of patients that have swallowing issues so we're missing a lot and we need to just pay attention they have slower gastric emptying their incontinence or retention constipation obviously multiple trauma look at all the other issues they have fractures this and that I mean that those all play a huge part and everything that's going on with this head injury long-acting pain medicines are better in a way but sometimes we like to use shorter acting just so we can assess their arousal so it's it's a it's a you know it's patient specific and situation specific everybody's going to have a different opinion so so rehab now we're get to where you know this is my thing we have a lot of agitation up to 50% in severe tbis and we want to stop agitation because it's annoying to the nurses that can harm the patient whatever but sometimes do we really heat them down more than we really need to obviously if they have an NG tube and they have all these IVs we can't let them be pulling it all out but those that don't we put in Posey beds those little fail beds so it's you know it's a two-fold air you want to minimize the agitation so they don't harm themselves but you don't want to snow them so you can't tell what's going on environment can really help like oh so looking about you know a small like a closed room quiet sleep-wake cycles are normal with day night even if they're unconscious put the light on you know their body will sense it and restlessness we use you know these are some edits that we use for restlessness trazadone it's great mad tegretol depakote aggression metoprolol depakote and patience with the psychiatric psychiatric history risperidone is a good one my mouth is so dry so please forgive me the Rancho scale it's actually been updated and there's like nine and ten but I try to you know Rancho scale is very important in rehab and so when you're referring a kid to rehab they're gonna want to know that Rancho scale and so I'll put it in colors because like the first three are no generalize localized then you have confused confused confused and you have appropriate appropriate appropriate and so that way you can kind of think about it but I still use my little plastic card that talks about it and there are like nine and ten are purposeful and appropriate standby assist or purposeful and appropriate independent I mean it's really kind of stupid but I hadn't been able to make corrections so complications post-traumatic seizures well they have to be so from that standpoint what we look at for inpatient rehab is they have to be totally three hours of therapy a day and that's that's not that's not a difficult thing of vision with the head injury is different than a patient who has like a hip replacement or a knee replacement or even a multiple trauma you know are they too debilitated to tolerate three hours a day these head injuries can they tolerate it yeah they probably can and we break it up to and speech therapy is a big part of a head injury rehab so it's when they can participate follow commands well enough to be able to progress in rehab we are expected to make and I think I bet this later but I'm going ahead the fin gain is a functional independence measure and we're going from that now to something else but the scale goes from like a zero to a seven and a seven is completely independent you don't even have to touch the wall to do anything and like a four is 25% a five is standby it's this where you just have to kind of stand there and make sure they're safe a six is using a walker and our assistive device kind of thing or you have to push up that would be a six so we are expected nationally to make to FEM games on a patient and so if we have a head injury that is like laying in the bed following commands intermittently and they can't they're like non-weight-bearing and they can't even know to non-weight bear that's where we we can't we don't we not explode we don't see that we're gonna make some gains enough with the weight so they're more awake and they can they can make the games a long time ago when I trained we were at people in a coma and we keep them there for six months working on I'm waking them up doing range of motion but that's unfortunately l Tech is here now and so that's that's where they go and then they come to rehab so it's it's patient dependent on different things like a head injury that that physically doesn't have anything else going on they have no you know no fractures or whatever and they're they're wiping status is full it's a lot easier to take somebody who's not quite not there that they can at least we allow them to get up and walk and do things with supervision rather than the guy who has non-weight-bearing to two limbs which I think we have one now we can't take him because he can't he doesn't know you know I'm talking about he doesn't know enough that there's no safety there he's not going to progress with the wait till these are better so that he can progress and it's unfortunate it's a it's a messed up system so did I answer your question okay so post-traumatic seizures post-traumatic epilepsy most are simple partial usually in the first few months 5% of head injuries have late seizures but but only if you haven't have one or in the first few weeks first week risk factors obviously the worst head injury the worse that's going to be you know the more at risk the more likely they're gonna have seizures you do an EEG exam and so the neurologist an increased prolactin can firms a seizure but a normal product it doesn't say there wasn't one although dr. Romero said well what's your baseline prolactin Raanana so this is just I'll put that in because it's an interesting kind of board thingy but it really you know what is the baseline so we don't really even use it so we do prophylaxis for one week only studies have shown that doing it for longer doesn't change anything it doesn't decrease the risk of seizures so it's you know we do pepra for a week a lot of times however the patient gets sent out on camera forever and I'll say why are they still in there Keppler they had they had a seizure oh no we just kept them on it well so when you're writing an order you know they've not had a seizure and you're doing for prophylaxis put for seven days it's just like antibiotics aren't you supposed to put for how many days you're gonna treat them because what happens I'll get patients that have antibiotics for 30 days and it was only supposed to be for 7 so that's that's a toll aside anyway so carbamazepine for partial valproic acid for generalized we do use keppra as well Venna barb and phenytoin costs cognitive issues and slowing so don't use those at all I have a list later of all the ones all of the meds not to use in head injury but you can stop it once they're seizure free after two years get an EEG and so many patients still or 15 years later ban had a seizure in you know twelve and a half years and they're still on their favorite role and why so autonomic instability dystonia we've had a patient in ICU right now who's like in storm and they're using bromocriptine on her to help which is not on my list and I need to put it within the first two weeks of a head injury you have hypertension tachycardia hyperthermia so the fever is not necessarily infection can be this perspiration it's increased catecholamines they're storming their you know they're in like the flight fight or flight you treat it lipophilic beta-blockers propranolol is the best one that crosses the blood-brain barrier Dan trium which is a great muscle relaxer as well but that's what we use it for that instance tylenol cooling like it's all of this and dopamine agonists amantadine it's one of my favorite medicines in the whole world you'll see it about 15 times later in the slides post-traumatic hydrocephalus so ventricular megali is very common but post-traumatic hydrocephalus is rare so look at like forty to seventy and forty to forty seven like seven I mean it's like a amazing how rare it is but I had a lady here that not here but in practice I'll tell you about it anyway incontinence the textbooks will tell you bladder incontinence and it is a taxi at gate disturbing their like their balance is off but they're like it's like their feet are frozen it's almost parkinsonian but like like faith it's like they cannot like they're stuck in the mud to turn the transfer you have to move their legs they can't do it declining cognitive function or dementia now so the acute post-traumatic hydrocephalus patient the one who has had a head injury or whatever they're going to have declining cognition but they're others like some patients have some mild dementia they come in for dementia workup and they're found to have hydrocephalus like um like normal pressure hydrocephalus but and it's not just dementia it's that and so we can't go like diagnosing everybody with normal pressure hydrocephalus but then you can't miss it either and you treated with a shunt and all that down gradually and I'll we had a lady who was 85 years old fell hit her head here had some subdural and she went to rehab this was along like February I see her in June and she was better she was mid assist she still couldn't say hot paint after I said what color your shoes hot paint anything her memory was still back poor so she fell in the nursing home and they they did a scan June 18 at Minden and it was normal no huggers thought you know I see her July 13th or July 7th or something like that and she was playing with her gait belt like just like this totally not the same person she had declined over the last that the past three weeks the family to where the point that she wasn't moving and I said you know a civil are you like tell are you peeing on yourself makes it oh yes she's having in context she had a bowel movement as we were talking and had no idea so actually 9/11 wonder from my office because her family couldn't even move her they barely could get her in the car and she came here they tapped her and she woke up and she got a shot and she did great a few days later she was kind of funky still in rehab I called dr. Willis the chairman of nurse our guested dr. Willis can I get somebody to come in and dollars shut down because I think that we need just took a little extra and he's like I don't have anybody so I came and got the thing got the residents to show me how to do it and she and her granddaughter her granddaughter and I did it in rehab which is sort of crazy and 45 minutes later she's reading off the TV someone so Scott convicted to turn it up she is jamming now she is weak still but it was just amazing like when did the hydrocephalus really start should she have gotten better you know where she already having some mild hydrocephalus for months that we kind of missed I don't know that's that's a whole nother aside but those patients that you see that have a diagnosis you remember them you're not gonna forget and you're not gonna miss it that next time you might overthink something but you won't miss it so cranial nerve injuries are are important olfactory 25 percent and head injuries so those kids that don't want to eat are those people that are not eating their appetites poor maybe they can't taste anything it comes back within three months usually but that could be it I mean it's not like it's well what's wrong why are they eating what you know that it uh they can't smell you can't taste you know I wish that sometimes that would happen to me facial injuries in fact there was a guy facial nerve injuries taste facial expression you know kind of thing vestibular issues my gosh that's so common in head injuries optic injuries you can have so much and just like a stroke you could have stroke symptoms with a head injury I've one guy who's got a fifth cranial nerve palsy here just numbness on the side of his face and he's got some slits like in his visual field he's some you know visual field deficits his MRI is totally normal but something happened obviously because he's got this and he's not you know faking it he was the guy who got his chest pressed by the jack or the jack that fell on him the car Jack failed and so he had respiratory stuff obviously because he had a crushed chest but he ended up with these other things that we're dealing with trying to figure it out ocular motor issues another kind of simple visual dysfunction there's just so much that can happen that we don't think of because they can't tell us oh I can't see on this half side you know what you could pick it up and your therapist like your OTS and your pts and your speech therapist to the speech therapist says they do not attend to the left side so they have a homonymous hemianopsia and know like they'll lift you know they'll leave that side of their plate like literally like it's like half-eaten and that's our clue so if they can't tell us we can figure it out focal issues are a visual process conscious vision is occipital cortex ambient is event is preconscious so ambient vision is different neuro-ophthalmologist are great to help dr. Tobias comes over here he's awesome he's got a partner now and they do they do visual rehab and prisms working on different things I have one patient who's got a lot of dizziness she's about to do some rehab with Amy Coburn in town on the computer to help with her visual disturbance and hurt her dizziness just like a 1% degree off and that little bit is messing around and so they do prisms and change their glasses and to get them to where their vision is better so they can walk because it might not be that they have balance issues it might be they can't see it so they're walking like this so so rehab is a team and just like medicine is a team but rehab is really like it's not just the acute let's get them sick and go home or go wherever rehab this is from here to their life I see patients from here and I follow them forever as long as they need and so it's not just me it's everybody else that's working with them and the therapists are a great part or the bigger part so agitation we talked about this earlier is a subtype of delirium it is during post traumatic amnesia they don't know they're agitated you can't tell them stop it they don't know they're just trying to move because they don't realize what's going on they're emotional it's usually in the first few weeks it's really not that long what's coming in front of temporal and there's an agitation behavior scale that we use and we don't really use it we should and so we're working toward that kind of thing but reduce stimulation protect them from harm like I say day night keep it quiet the TV doesn't need to be on they're not watching the news they don't care they don't really need the TV on because any noise can aggravate them they're going to sleep and wake and sleep and awake but it's it's good to get some sort of you know light dark kind of thing going on for them and tolerate it that's really important we have to they can't help it so pharmacologic management not Haldol Haldol is the biggest nono in rehab we love it here we use it and we're getting using it less but it's not us it's everywhere but it slows recovery and prolongs post-traumatic amnesia geodon is a faster onset it's great we use it a lot it helps seroquel is sedating it helps at night and in the pediatric population like I can't even begin to know what you guys should be using or not so if you don't want to say something tell me I don't care okay now doctor I get a mix up Keith Scott always because I Keith white I've known for years so Keith Scott it's hard for me to say his name he said that there was a study that geodon had no there were no recorded deaths in geodon from QT prolongation as opposed to seroquel and Haldol which that was interesting to me I still would never use Haldol you know and I'm not like the biggest fan of circle every geodon I really like circle better just because I like to use it just at night but geodon really does work really well and you can stop it and you can titrate it up you know and it will help and at least keep them from hurting themselves benzos are detrimental for cognition can prolong PTA but used sparingly for acute agitation is okay like ativan is okay like I don't mind it we don't use an axe you know like xanax just shouldn't be around except for me before this talk but I didn't take any I've never had one but um but it's just you know we don't like benzos for prolonged stuff because it's detrimental for benzos aren't a great medicine anyway so but if we use it lorazepam midazolam they have a short duration of action so you can assess their cognitive function soon after after they come calm down look fulfilling beta-blockers propranolol is the best one the top role is the next best one so those are great for agitation if their heart rate can't tolerate it now I mean you can go up to like 500 milligrams a day I mean you can use it so much and it's something that we don't use a whole lot but wow that's a whole lot better than put them on geodon if that'll work depakote tegretol also work for agitation we use those a lot as well but they stay in the system so long and they can cause so much sedation I don't like them as much unless we know where the patient is before we do it antidepressants are great for agitation to buspar and I'll say this later buspar is like the such a low side effect profile it's a great medicine for anxiety and agitation an oxy brain injury there's a lot of decrease serotonin and norepinephrine so in anoxic s-- i like i love to use zoloft and i love still loft anyway because it's the most dopaminergic of all the SSRIs use a neuro stimulants amantadine love it ritalin wakes them up I don't really I'm not use at all a whole lot I use it later once they're awake and they need attention issues but in the early parts I don't like the little lady that 85 year old lady who couldn't her attention was terrible even after her her shut I put on ritalin for a bit she's great and you know we weaned her off of it once she was better and she's doing great now still use lithium for the manic cyclic mood issues and depo-provera it's just this is one of these I put in for hypersexuality of course you're not gonna use it acutely but it's one of those that's kind of a board question or something heterotopic ossification I don't know how common it is in the pediatric population with that injury honestly but it's where bone that need to be bone shouldn't be showing up on there usually it's in the first few months it's in an affected area I had a spinal cord guy who got a Cho in his hip they treated him with indocin and one of the best phosphonates and it like one way and it doesn't bother him anymore it's amazing but I've seen it so severe that they just cannot move and they're swollen limbs and you think it's a septic jointer it's infected but it's a Cho a bone scan is the fastest way to check it out it's most common hips elbows shoulders and knees obviously the worst of head injury the more truss therefore hm so other complications hypertension usually resolves clot they're clinically silent how many do we really miss after what do we do here two days in the ICU we start lovenox but if they have a little bit of a bleed like if they're a neurosurgical like if they have surgery they like to wait 24 to 48 48 to 72 hours yeah doesn't really support that and so there's that there's a whole there's there's talks go on about all that but so a quick aside t10 fracture fell from the deer stand totally intact you know everything like but he had surgery and on the 18th he was transferred to us from rehab and he wasn't on heparin he went on on lovenox so look back I said oh but you never got to eat they must have not wanted it so I didn't put him on it I'm telling you I'm like I screwed up so I didn't put him on it because he was I mean he was up walking the ATM so but he was up walking strong legs like you know not stand with nothing um five or eight days later he's back here with a PE to his left lower and middle Oh retrospectively two days after his surgery or day after his surgery he had to go to step down from the floor because he had some shortness of breath and I think you know what I wonder if that was the first one and then he had the big one that came so you know those things happen and thank God he's fine but it's one of those things we mess neurogenic bladder they have small voids normal post void residual so they're peeing a lot we use time boarding sometimes we use dick your Pam detrol those can call some awesome counter side to side effects we're better anot but it's usually not for malaria it's expensive but then you could also have retention with those so you have to kind of play it just play it and figure it out specificity we use backup and Antrim Susanna Dean those are the most common ones and head injuries Valium we use in spinal cord injuries a lot but because it's a benzo we don't really use it in head injury back often and Susanna Dean our central acting Dan trim is locally acting at the sarcoplasmic reticulum which might be some sort of good information to have yes it can cause sedation as well but it's locally acting which a lot of people don't know and we use it also for think of the word malignant hyperthermia yeah and I see so that's the most common use of it but it's a great muscle relaxer I use it a lot in private practice it's kind of like I kind of fell back in love with it and it's awesome other complications think of the neuro endocrine system we check them a month later three months later a year later and make sure everything's good because that can happen we might miss it aunt your pituitary stuff growth hormone which I didn't know that's like the most common one after a head injury so it's something we need to check hyponatremia you know these are all your ICU stuff si eighty eight you treat with fluid restriction salt wasting you treat with replacement and diabetes insipidus ddavp but there's all of these I'm not gonna go into all of the different sodium is this and that because I don't even remember it right now nutrition is huge huge huge within 48 hours we need to be giving them some nutrition by day seven they should have full caloric replacement and they need a hundred you know a hundred plus percent of their basal metabolic rate a lot of it needs to be protein so these are our goals animal feeding is important why because it's better than TPN obviously because they're good and gastrostomy is better because of the decreased risk of aspiration which is a huge risk as well in g-tube sinusitis and REM won't take an NG tube there's not one rehab that well now an LTAC well but acute inpatient rehab won't take an NG tube if they need an NG tube for a long time they should have how to pay they should how to pay they should have to pay a peg yes there's a risk and families that go don't want that hole in their stomach oh my gosh put the dang thing in we'll pull it out but they need it and so it's something that we sort of hesitate sometimes but we really need to just do it not a patient that had a stroke and her daughter I said you know she's she's not gonna be able to eat enough after a week with the peg she was eating fine which you know it's like oh but the daughter said you know what if she hadn't had it she said she wouldn't have gotten better this time so you know it's like you never know and then some refused the peg end up fine they never have an aspiration pneumonia and we're still like I discharged somebody because she refused to have a peg because my staff said I cannot take this risk and her mother died after her peg and that's why the patient didn't and she's jamming she's fine so you can't not everything's perfect so for cognition you have arousal and attention ritalin is noradrenergic amantadine is dopaminergic memory there's not much evidence based thing to help with memory except for time and repetition but ritalin and and done as a purl have been shown to help a little bit so we tryna use it sometimes depression anxiety I said zoloft is the most dopaminergic we use effexor a lot buspar low side effects Remeron it's great because it also helps with insomnia and appetite and so those older patients that are having trouble with sleep and you get a three-fer and less medicine is better and so if you can find a medicine that will treat a few things then it's better than you know treating a medicine and three different meds and so wellbutrin lowers the seizure threshold so we don't use it therapy's obviously are the most important it's really funny that you know you think of rehab and I'm talking about all this and I'm gonna have one slide on on the therapies because there's so much that they do but basically you know PT look at all this stuff I mean they're not just walking the patient now here you might be might say yeah they're walking through and your feet and so they can go home well no because they're hitting the wall or they're kind of doing this but they can walk through you defeat with a walker I don't care they don't know that they walk 300 feet but specificities think of all the other the physical all the fractures and everything PT's really do work really hard figuring things out Oh teas as well they do all of the above they work on a prac see it like in a practice where you can't you can't put the sleeve of your jacket in or you're putting your underwear on your arm you don't know how to dress yourself you know that it's supposed to go on you but you can't figure out how speech therapy dysphasia and a lot of times and you guys don't know we have a dysphasia of alan we have a cognitive about for speech if you call this safe you ask them to do a dysphasia they're not going to do cognition you have to ask for both because they won't do it it's not that it's their fault it's this this is what the order to put in aphasia is receptive aphasia you know expressive issues writing speech surface doing great cognitive about oh so many of them do we do not have neuro psych here which is what we really need to have for head injury so our speech therapists are on your sites so don't think that a patient's commission is spying and you guys in peds are different than us like we're like oh they're fine she's answered questions she knows what year it is whatever can she do money management you know can she add this port of this time in this penny no but we didn't ask her that so we send her home thinking she's fine and she can't do that so just think about that stuff rehab nursing reimbursing is a special deal I mean they are 24/7 educating patients they're not having it for two or three days and going we've gotten for two and three weeks get them ready and so it's just it's a it's a different thing case management of course getting in the home all that you guys know but that's so important in education to getting patients out so here are the FEM scores for doctors and dummies seven is complete independent just like you or me it's timely and safely if they're not safe or they're really slow then they're gonna be a lower level our pts use like menaces modest this kind of stuff but this is sort of our score but total you know seventy six percent so like you've got to help them seventy six percent they're not doing much and then assist you know one to twenty five percent helped by the helper so a lot of head injuries will never get higher than a supervision level because of safety they're not aware they're impulsive so that's kind of where you look at it like cannot kind of games can I make and I can't get above a five so if they're in a five already if they're walking and dressing themselves and everything but they're kind of goofy I can't get them higher than a five can they benefit from reom yes but they are not appropriate for unfortunately for a cute impatient that would be more like outpatient or like a higher level neurocognitive rehab which doesn't take Medicare or Medicaid only private insurance that's a whole nother issue anyway so neuropsych testing every head injury should have something especially in Pediatrics oh my goodness because you've got you've got a child like if it's a 78 year old man it's not so big of a deal but but this child's really you really need to know where they are and where they're getting and so you can figure out where they're gonna be so and younger than five or the worst issues those don't recover but like five to fifteen they recover grade so even a mild head injury like said and like I said at the very least speech come and follow up follow up with speech not just sent him home by momma taken you know there okay so these are the medicines to avoid Haldol is a dopamine antagonists and in a head injury you have low dopamine anyway so you don't want it and so it's prolonged post-traumatic amnesia Reglan is a dopamine blocker - and I love regular and for constipation I'll use it for a couple of days on older patients here and there but it's not good the central I for one like practicin is sedating clonidine is sedating and we do use plenty you know I see it a lot for blood pressure issues and head injuries but it it's not the best h2 blockers like benadryl and others those could be sedating so and then anticholinergics to which the dry mouth like I have right now and I'm you know I think that's it yeah so these are the Mets to avoid all those so was that speed rant was that speed talk I was pretty sweet though anybody have any questions or comments down Baton Rouge that are making us take this three-day three-hour course on how not to prescribe opiates to health almost not a great drug I don't know you talking about the board people telling you you can't get a medical license until you've taken three three-hour course for opiates you know the drug abuse of course oh well I don't have to take it trees well nobody's told me I did I guess I've missed it I do chronic pain it's long line of course okay everything's on line I guess I'm gonna have to take it but you know okay there's a reason pain medicines are for pain and when appropriately prescribed they're appropriate and there's a higher risk of abuse later in life even when it's appropriately prescribed for pediatric or teenage patients and those studies have been done but you know I mean gosh what are you gonna say just suffer an orthopedic surgeon he was like which stopped the pain meds on the patient with the NEMA placement I said I can't wait until you're hurting because I'm gonna stop your medicine yes ma'am [Music] yeah ativan for acute GI i am is you know great the beta-blocker takes a few days to get going on but I really I don't mind out of it because for a short turn you know we're not going to use it long term if they're not going to be agitated long term if they're if they're agitated long term that's a whole nother issue that's not adaptation that's a result of their brain injury and it's restlessness and hyperactivity and stuff and so that's you know but but like we had like a beta blocker on one guy some old guy that was doing great on the beta blocker because his heart rate was 110 but the guy whose heart rate was 60 you know we'll put him on geodon so my favorites you know like JIT on a circle at night if they're more agitated in the evening I'll try that one just because it lets them get their sleep cycle going and they don't have anything during the day because geodon might move but if we do geodon - we like it lower dose in the daytime and higher dose at night to do that same thing so you know I guess it's sort of patient-specific and situation-specific but those are my favorite amantadine has been shown in studies to to decrease agitation because if you're waking them up and they're more aware then they won't be unaware and just fighting everything so and if you can you know get them out of a get them out of restraints I mean wouldn't you be able to save somebody put you in restraints so the posi bed isn't as fun for them because they can't go anywhere but at least they can roll around and and you know take the clothes off and whatever but they're safe and so i don't know how often you'll use those in peds but we've been using them a bit more up here usually in the head injuries that are hard to place we have peace with my least-favorite rotation but the bikini looked at me and said Lee you're not enjoying this are you I said no sir I'm not and I have four children which is sort of ironic done thank you okay", "vEDR8Jrh1cg": "hello everyone this is our women our review for the meter so we are going to start up first of all welcome to everybody thank you for we have 26 attend attendees right now and thank you for your for your interest and we are going to start doing our review okay so we are going to go over very few we were a lot of remarks I mean and one since that I want you to pay attention is about first of all the organ system so you need to know what what is Integra mentoring system what is the definition of inter wintery system we are going to talk about all the systems especially the one who are going to be related to the Omni stasis on your stasis is going to be the relationship between the nervous system and the endocrine system and about the planes talking about the planes I really want you to be sure what is the sagittal plane what is a coronal plane what is a transverse plane okay so about the six dimensions are going to make emphasis about the six dimensions and please I want use you to remember what is the difference between health and wellness health is going to be freedom of physical disease meantime wellness wellness is going to be your your lifestyle so that means diet and exercise house how you died how what you eat how much activity you will have all right so focus on these we have the health dimensions and I have dimensions we need to remember ours the spiritual dimension that is the relation with yourself so how you're going to accept yourself for example you believe making you happy making you depressed a what if fate what is your hope so those are actually related to a spiritual spiritual dimension just remember we have the social-emotional your feelings environmental you need to review these please try to remember what is an example of each of this okay all right so let's keep going and another important topic is about the prevention disease prevention primary disease prevention is vaccines are and a risk factors right to prevent the risk factor for example avoid excessive alcohol and boy smoking for example your diet no fat no trans fats for example and backseats secondary disease prevention with the early diagnosis and we already know tertiary is when is early treatment of the disease okay so for this I need to remark about homeostasis homeostasis is going to be the balance the internal balance in keep the internal you need to remember that we have two systems the endocrine system and the nervous system that are going to be communicating all the time remember the homeostasis is between the nervous system and the endocrine system at this level you should know that the nervous system regard to on your stasis is going to be the hypothalamus hypothalamus is nervous system related to the endocrine system that is the pituitary gland the p2 de rigueur okay remember them the hypothalamus we call the big gossiper because they know everything that happened outside your body and inside of your body right so that is the two things that we need to remember about the nervous about their own mistakes another thing basically that many questions are being related to know the concept about what is another listen and what is cattle catabolism another listen is building up catabolism is breaking down the definition of metabolism is going to be the how we obtain energy and another definition of metabolism is anabolism + catabolism so is the sum summation of these reactions anabolism and catabolism pathology what is pathology pathology is the study of the disease and we was talking about many things about the seeds right for example sine you need to know what is a sign what is a symptom what is a syndrome what is what is a disease symptom is subjective pain for example sign remember your vital signs measurable so blood pressure temperature heart rate and pulse so those heart rate and respiratory rate so those are the vital signs that's why I call vital signs vital signs if you remember syndrome is the group of signs and symptoms that is for example the febrile syndrome febrile syndrome is the conjunction of signs and symptoms syndrome equal to same signs and symptoms the favoriting syndrome febrile syndrome mean coming from fever is that you have the temperature that can be measurable when you have the temperature high you can see that your heart rate is going up to your breathing is going to increase and the those are signs and the symptoms is the malanez you feel weak you feel pain you get Caidic if you're actually not able to be focused so those are actually symptoms plus the signs are yes mention are going to be what we call a syndrome okay and the favorit syndrome is the group of of actually signs and symptoms together okay all right so what is a disease and he sees is a group of syndromes okay group of syndromes all right so talking about the mother a mass is one just to mention the definition of mass is the amount of matter the what is weight a sorry amount of matter is is mass what is weight is the measure of the how the gravity push or pull down a mass so that is weight and matter matter is anything the occupier space okay all right so let's keep going one thing that you need to remember that is basic for the next lectures is the energy cannot be created mirror destroyed all right so the elements you need to remember few scenes number one they're probably they're going to be questions how is the relationship between two elements and you need to remember the orbits no that's a the first orbit is going to be two electrons as maximum the second orbit is going to be eight electrons and the third orbit eight electrons so just remember the number of electrons of element is going to be the same number of the protons and the same number for the neutrons when you get rid of some of the neutrons for example I have eight electrons I have eight protons I have eight neutrons if I take I remove one of the neutrons that is going to produce a radioactivity okay so that is called what we call X I so talk now if you take one of electrons and you have the summation of positive and negative and result in negative that is going to be one : nu if you are if you add some electron is going to be hanging if you take out one of electron you will have the summation more protons so that is going to be a caveat okay so that is what I want you to remember about ions ions is an atom who has a charge okay so that is about what we I want you to remember please for lecture one let me see if I can close this okay so leg let's go to lecture two and lecture two we have actually a more about electrons and for these what I want you to remember is what is balancing valency is the number of electrons that an atom wants to gain or to lose so that are that is the definition of our balancing another thing I want you to remember are the chemical bonds remember a unique take out all than all the electrons of the other atom and covalent is going to share electrons one to one to another so ionic bonds as they're going to be weak bounds meantime that covalent bonds are going to be strong bonds strong bonds okay so we have for example example of covalent is going to be a molecule of hydrogen h2 so in this here we have hydrogen I drink one proton one proton they share one electron so that is h2 so that is a covalent bond so you need to remember this chart where you need to make the difference between a unique and and covalent bonds so we have covalent bonds we have water methane oxygen hydrogen and gas oxygen gas meantime a unique bonds the basic example you can have is the sodium chloride sodium chloride okay so one thing I want you to remember is these that the covalent bonds covalent bonds are going to be divided in polar and nonpolar so those two are covalent covalent can be polar and nonpolar covalent polar we have the water covalent no polar we have the fat covalent Koller is the water is hydrophilic covalent no polar is for example fat and that is either phobic hydrophobic ok so that is what you need to keep them up ok so about the metabolism we already know the metabolism is the chemical process with cells and the substance and energy needed to sustain life so how to produce energy how is that right and metabolic can be defined as the summation of anabolism means building up plus the process of catabolism that is means breaking down all right so of all the cavities this is a must you need to know what is what are the dorsal dorsal is posterior the cranial and spinal cavity we have the ventral we have the toxic and the abdominal pelvic area for this you need to remember that the thorax is divided in mediastinum and the mediastinum the most important that you need to remember is the middle mediastinum where we are not located the heart now pericardial cavity hi Jo please open eyes open ears here pericardial cavity is the air is the place where the heart is going to be the heart is covered by the pericardium that is a membrane that is surrounding the heart Libra Libra is the cranial cavity is the place or space where their lungs are going to be located and the lungs are going to be covered by money called the play rock membrane the abdominal cavity is we see the abdominal cavity here that is going to be covered - by the peritoneum peritoneum clear I this information of lots of the membrane of the lung pericarditis inflammation of the heart of the memory of the heart and peritonitis is inflammation of the peritoneal membrane okay so that is what you need to remember by heart completely okay open eyes open ears here there is going to be a different type of questions about that and I don't need to ask you this because that is really important so we have for example the nine gradients 1993 6-9 we have right I broken dream that we have back liver the epigastrium we have the stomach the left I pecan dream we have the spleen don't forget about the spleen the right lumbar region we have the ascending colon the umbilical region the small intestine the left lumbar region we have that the same thing : the right iliac fossa we have the appendix the hypogastric region we have the uterus and urinary bladder and the left iliac fossa we have the colon signals okay in addition to that you need to know what is superior to the umbilical region or what is inferior were the Villiger region or any questions about that what is lateral to the epigastrium is going to be the left hypochondria or the right bottom lockira what is lateral to it hypogastric or what is superior to the left iliac fossa you need to just put in your mind this picture and you will give an answer correct of other quadrants the quadrants what is important here is that the mid sagittal plane and the transverse plane are going to cross through the naval through the veil so we have the right upper quadrant etc and you can tell that in the right part of our quadrant we have mostly when we have is deliver in the left upper quadrant we have the stomach and explain the in the left lower and the right lower quadrant we have the appendix and the cecum and the cecum is the beginning of the ascending colon and on the left lower quadrant we have that colon Sigma ok so that is about our lecture number two let's go our lecture number three if there is any question yes please raise your hand okay so lecture three we are going to see few scenes that are really relevant so we have the classification of the nutrients that we are going to see remember the macronutrients and the micronutrients the difference is not the size of the nutrient what is the difference is the amount that you need to eat every day macronutrients micronutrients and water water is not considered macro or micro so it's a part so micronutrients will be which one carbs lead lipids and proteins and the micro is going to be vitamins and minerals so just to make a song shortcut here we have the vitamins are going to recall that call enzymes coenzymes coenzyme that is going to help the metabolic reactions in the body a minerals are called the cofactors cofactors okay so here what we have here is the carbohydrates and the overall situation here is that I want you to remember few things number one that the carbs proteins and lipids all of them are going to be absorbed by the intestine and are able to pass to the cell when they are in the cutting as monomers the monomer of the protein and once in the monomer of the the curve is going to be glucose galactose or the fructose and monomer for the fat are going to be the fatty acids fatty acids once in a I went about carbohydrates so you already know what is the disaccharides you must know this sucrose galactose sorry sucrose is the fructose plus glucose Matos is the MCOs is the beer glucose plus glucose and lactose the most read you will find in the milk glucose plus galactose so these disaccharides they need an enzyme this enzyme is going to split the sucrose into into monosaccharides the maltose that this is disaccharide needs an enzyme who is going to break down the matos into two monosaccharides that is the glucose and another molecule look the same for the lactose remember these guys the mono saccharides are the one can be absorbed the disaccharide sucrose maltose and lactose can not be concerned to be all right so the important thing about the polysaccharides are is that we have the starch by glycogen and then cellulose starch starch is what you for example have spaghetti you have bread you have so doughnut whatever those are starch and this is starch can break it down into disaccharides and then is going to break down into monosaccharides diagram glycogen that glycogen is glycogenesis remember glycol Genesis is the formation of be like oh yeah glycol Genesis glycogenesis and that glycogenesis ordered a Gregorius form when you eat excess or some extra glucose so the glucose can be used as energy but if you still eating glucose they're going to form that glycogen okay glycol Genesis but then the geico chain that is a carbohydrate carbohydrate carbohydrate they are going to break down into disaccharides and then into monosaccharides glycogen is this process of breaking down is called the glycogenolysis like like oh hey mo like see sorry like okay no lysis so glycogen to glucose glycogenolysis glucose to glycogen a glycol genesis all right so this is carb okay and how much draconian we have two pounds okay guys so here's two pounds and each pound is going to collect all strapped four pounds of water so for each pound on glycogen we have two pounds total we have a weight of 10 pounds alright so cellulose cellulose is the fiber creating the salad cellulose is going to enter into the system it's going to release all the enzymes from the salad and the cellulose are going to change name and cold now actually the same is called fiber fiber is being heated by the flora that we have been in tasting and these produce the vitamin K the the bacteria's the good bacteria in the destined eating the fiber they have prior they produce they produce the vitamin K Inouye vitamin a caballo team I didn't mention but differing you need you must remember need to remember the vitamin K Y is important about that because if somebody is taking antibiotics for example for sun infection the antibiotic is going to kill the bad bacteria but the not discriminate with a good bacteria so what is going to happen can sweep out all the flora of the intestine that can lead into the area so same who knows okay so we have the disaccharides and polysaccharides and cellulose and the the way to form the disaccharides are going to be through that dehydration glucose plus glucose is equal mountains when the glucose came together with glucose two molecules of glucose they are going to release water and from this reaction and they produce d'amato's dehydration hydrolysis is when you put a piece of bread in your mouth so it's the water with the starch they're going to actually break down break down into from poly saccharide into monosaccharides starch is a polysaccharide okay talking about the proteins the main functions proteins are going to be part of building tissue repair tissue enzymes hormones are going to do fluid balance don't forget that a fluid balance is because the protein is able to retain water thing is going to attract work we have different different a type of protein we have albumin that is the most abundant protein in the body hemoglobin hemoglobin myoglobin that both dis transport blood oxygen in the blood myoglobin is going to a keep oxygen in the muscles transport oxygen those are proteins and sodium potassium pumps or calcium channels that make the electrolytes coming in or coming out according what the the patient or the cell needs at that moment we have almonds hormones hormones are the mostly all orders are going to be proteins the receptors receptors receptor for example the insulin is coming to knock the door in order to make the glucose get in so that receptor that the insulin strike to activate is made up from protein enzymes we are talking about that is a substance that is speed up the chemical reactions these enzymes they need they need micronutrients these enzymes they need vitamins as coenzyme and they need cofactors minerals in order to make the enzyme being completely active otherwise the reaction will not occur another thing that you need to remember is the clotting process the fibrin okay I'm just three please open eyes open ears the fiber yay we have antibodies antibodies that are immunoglobulins immunoglobulin globulin is a protein so the globalink is a protein is going to have an activity of a part of the immune system that is called the antibodies all right so just to remember about our proteins the proteins are going to have are going to have the transcription from the RNA messenger to the DNA from the DNA and they come out that is the transcription they go out of the cell of the sorry of the nucleus they go to the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum and that is where is going to happen that translation translation is the according to the sequence of the RNA messenger they're going to come ribosomes that are the cart of the same way bringing them in one sheets and the mini Aussies are the ingredients so you place the ingredients one after another one after another until complete the recipe and that is going to create a chain of amino of amino acids that is called the primary protein so this is the primary protein you see there is actually a almost line it's like a necklace necklace of pearls and we have then the secondary the secondary it's not going to be linear a structure is going to be a folding alpha and the big deplete is not functional yet is not functioning yet so what we have now is the tertiary protein tertiary protein is the 3d configuration some of them are going to be active already they still in the endoplasmic reticulum that is traveling little by little to the Golgi apparatus then we have the quaternary and is full functioning what am i they have more intricate appearance more elaborate 3d shape and you'll remember that enzymes that enzyme they have receptor enzymes are going to have like by the inside remember the binding site should be the same the same shape of the reactant or the subtract that are going to match if they don't match the enzyme will not work on that example the lipase lipase is an enzyme that is having is going to digest fat so the binding inside of the enzyme is going to be similar the structure or part of the molecule of fat where they are going to react okay alright so we have a human being the insulin is a protein alright so that is about our our actually the protein part let's talk about tissues and for tissues I want to refresh you and I want to you remember hi Jill and open eyes open ears from all the epithelia we have how many tissues 240 issues right from the patella tissue the one I want you to remember the pseudostratified this is the pseudostratified then the pseudostratified epithelium that is located mostly in the trachea trachea and these are the cells of the solute stratified so here we have one of the cells of the students ratifying who is going to be modified and convert into the goblet cells this is the goal itself this is can you see this the nucleus nucleus nucleus this is the height of the cell one height of the cell and this like a thick area here are the cilia that are moving and this blueish here that we don't see here this blue is the mucus that is produced by the goblet cells so what is doing this is going to protect against the invasion Batian or the entry of bacteria and or dust for example okay so goblet cells are specialized to produce mucus now we are going to talk about the connective tissue with the function of the connective tissue tissue is to connect simple what I want you to remember are actually the classification of the connectivity open eyes open ears here we have the liquid we have blood try to remember 1 2 3 4 liquid blood then we have the heart the opposite of liquid is hard just to remember bone and cartilage bone and Country soft loose tissue is the areolar adipose this is the fat around the belly for example and these and the fibrous that is the hard one to remember yes remember lift L I ft lift Li means ligaments F fibrous and T tendons lift okay so talking muscles this is extremely important please muscles we have three types a skeletal muscle a smooth muscle and the correct muscle right so we have muscular a smooth and cardiac muscle so to start you need to remember the what is the difference you need to know the difference between skeletal smooth and cardiac you can write down or you can make note skeletal is voluntary consciously voluntary a smooth muscle involuntary cardiac muscle is going to be is going to be is going to be involuntary - okay okay so I going to just give me a second okay all right so let me see I'm going to check it you if you're listening to me just a moment I want to check yes tomorrow I'm going to check on one just a moment please hi can you hear me yes sir so so far so far you are here everything is being listening yeah is Claire okay all right Hey all right so now all right perfect let me close this right so because all right all right so here we have the difference between the three cells this is the stride muscle is try at master Y behold we have these extra Asians where is coming from the striations a striations nos three are coming from what we have here is a straight muscle so we have some bands of acting and myosin those are proteins that in the microscope they are going to be there is thousands of these for each fiber fiber what is a fiber muscle fiber muscle is the same to say one cell of the muscle what is the sale of the muscle fiber fiber is equal to say Selma's okay so here we have the difference very fast we have a striations here we have in the cutting muscle we have extra Asians here we have the nuclide and the skeletal muscles multi nuclei which means multiple of nucleus and one look like in the smooth muscle what is this is cylindrical shape this is fusiform shape this is actually more the cylindrical side shape and what we have here is the big difference between the skeleton in his mode multiple nuke like one look like cylindrical fusiform creations no is creation is in image good muscle and the car the muscles in between we have one nucleus as a smooth muscle we have a striations as the as the skeletal muscle and we is almost cylindrical whispering this way on the on that shape of the correct muscle cardiac cell then we have the the intercalated disks the intercalated disk this one please Luca that is going to be in the extremes of the cell and these are a thick membrane where they are going to attach close very close to another cardiac cell and the purpose of this is the electrical impulse and electrical impulse all right so talking about a narrower than ever nervous tissue nervous tissue we have we already tobe pettalia we talk about connective we talk about muscle and the fourth tissue is the nervous tissue we have the body or soma please listen to that is the body or soma body or soma we have here the action we have the terminal action we have the dendrite dendrites dendrite electrical impulses are going to run from the body towards the axon towards the terminal axle so this way all right so we have the shirin cells we explained in class what is the Schwann cells they're contained myelin fat and what is going to do is to accelerate that electrical impulse produced in the body or soma of the cell so they're going to cut they're going to jump from one space to another in between the myelin cells so from here to here from here to here very fast again this myelin is going to be in the white matter if you remember white matter the white matter what is a function to communicate to transport information from where from the gray matter conclusions gray matter are in the cortex Gremory are in according to the brain and they do not have the Schwann cells and the white matter the white matter are going to be the one who contain the shown cells because they want to have the transmission very fast glia glia is the collective name name for cells that are going to support and protect the nerve cells so for example let me see if I have so picture here no all right so this glia are going to be in this portion in this area and this glia is in contact with the blood blood circulation the glial cell that is Manning here they are going to filter the oxygen and nutrients that are going to pass towards the nerve cell the purpose of this is to protect the nervous system all right so that is number three okay and the shown here okay so let's go to number four alright so in number four we have a few things that we there's DNA DNA topics that are going to remark and what we need to remember about the DNA is that first of all we have the DNA one thing I want to tell you is the DNA is going to be like totally coil when the cell is not reproducing they have the shape of the chromosomes and the shape of the chromosomes are going to happen when the cell will read produce so when they reproduce you're going to see the presence of 46 chromosomes every single cell in your body have C chromosomes alright so here what I want you to remember about my favorite picture is the the does DNA the base are the nucleotides the nucleotides these are the base and the nucleotides are going to be the a G C a G C T right or a 80 CG those are the nucleotides important please open eyes open ears this is one half of the step and this cannoli half of the step here and they are going to be joined together 1/2 1/2 1/2 and oral health is going to be the hydrogen bond hydrogen bond for example from here to here is the gene if this the gene from here to here that gene is a group of bases if I want to I want to know this recipe what they're going to do is the hydrogen bonds are going to open on break it down and separate one side of the stern one side of the DNA so and this the RNA mission is coming in the middle and copy the information that the base sequence are giving in that specific gene so that is going to be the recipe that later on is going to go for a protein these crosses or copying or rewriting rewriting the recipe is called that transcription after the transcription happened this a that was a part they are going to come together for me we hydrogen is like a super either involved okay so for this we need to remember this transcription translation transcription happening in the nucleus and the translation happened in the what in the cytoplasm okay one thing that we need to remember the adenosine adenosine and they know seen adenosine is the part of the a t cg remember alright so that they know seen is two part of the AP piece so this is a nucleotide or base nucleotide equal base base equal nuclei these bases are actually not only part of the DNA or RNA but they are going to be they're going to be in cakes or students okay okay and that is going to be part of the ATP's ATP's that's what I want you to remember please okay so this is the adenine guanine cytosine on you receive uniseal look at this this is the R and a R and a it's a Denis in DNA is a and D remember AT&T so a and T but this is RNA right already so ribbon click nucleic acid and this a is going to match with T no greet us here so the DNA have timing but the RNA do not so the timing is replaced by the Unisphere so the a is going to be complement with you and see a gr going to be asked in a complements the same okay so remember the hydrogen hydrogen bonds that are going to during one side of the DNA to the other side why we have to because because that is going to protect each other okay so that's why there the theory is telling that you have the they protect each other okay all right so let's see we have oh this is important there's many remarks about these so please pay attention here what I want you to remember is very simple so first of all you need to remember the a finisher of marasmus kwashiorkor what is Rickett disease don't get confused between marasmus and Ricketts disease so marasmus and pasha call our protein deficit my response first year of life and quash accord to hear someone so just remembered where we have marasmus is short word wash a car is longer work two years listen this about one year yes to remember rickets is actually here again this is lack of proteins like of proteins and this is the lack of vitamin D what is like a vitamin D you can not reabsorb calcium and that means that you have the we have when we call osteomalacia what is Oscar Malaysia Malaysia weakness or weaker and osteo bones weaker bones okay so here we have a theology is the study of the disease incidents are the new cases in 1 year acute less than three months chronic more than three months I do patek is the nice way to say I don't know yet organic is any side effect of the medical treatment or for mycological treatment or therapy in any in whatever sense it is so is there so produce so damaged or hurt the patient adverse effect that is called JETRO genic effect communicable disease is the transmission the transmission fecal-oral fecal-oral so go to the bathroom don't wash your hand that is already fecal oral know and you eat something without washing your hands your that is enough a cow for example sexual transmission by sexual contact for example a drug addictions to share needles for example blood transfusions are going to be oh they are going to be it on me by droplets right when somebody sneeze right so those are the communicable disease epidemic is a dynamic is when the number of cases use taken a year are higher than the unexpected pandemic is a pandemic is when the disease is spread out to reuse that you did never was happening and it's spreading out in large areas the so common infections are going to be for example cross treated officially we will explain that in your normal class exclusive officially when you sweep out the flora the normal flora with antibiotics the one who survive is the silly costume and officially I said I'm alone I can reproduce I can do whatever I want and that goes to you officially start to reproduce reproduce and can lead into a severe diarrhea yes parentheses here a prevention for this or the but the worst thing we need to do is to wash hands with soap we soak it not with alcohol you need to be with soap when you sir have crossed and officially science is everything that is measurable all the vital signs are signs temperature blood pressure pulse respiratory rate symptoms is going to be for example any subjective any subjective evidence of disease for example pain become nauseous pain notions a for example you feel DC in Auburn amarty grow actually that is not as exciting is as a symptom okay so we talk about the primary secondary tertiary see that is a must you need to know what is the primary secondary tertiary prevention alright so here we are going to just finish our lecture number four so let's go over our lecture number five okay Rachel number 5a all right so let's talk about fat and the fat a as you know this is a summary again a unique and sodium chloride covalent can be polar nonpolar no polar fat hydrophobic covalent or nonpolar hydrophobic covalent polar hydrophilic example water okay here we have we are going to talk about the saturated and unsaturated you already know that the fat when is unsaturated is going to be more healthy than either saturated fat the saturated fat produce more elevation of H of LDL the unsaturated fat is going to promote the increase of the good cholesterol that is the HDL okay okay so trans trans is when you have the atoms you see here this is three C's sorry since they have Diwali goes on the same side trust the Iranians are going to be in the opposite side so opposite side hydrogen's we have hydrants in the same side in order to produce this we have a reaction called the hydrogenation so we are pushing we are moving this guy here and this guy here and that is called the hydrogenation C's is okay but trans that is that was called trans trans trans Merce that is going to be a man-made so that is basically the fast-food okay so hydrogenation okay we was talking about the margarine we was talking about 0.5 grams per serve that is a they allowed not to put it in the what in the label they put zero trans and the lipids are basically three sets fatty acids triglycerides and cholesterol please cholesterol cannot be used for any cholesterol we need it for what for the structure of the cell membrane number two we have for the production of hormones so not all orders and proteins the majority of orders are proteins but some almonds are being made from a cholesterol what is that estrogens from collector testosterone from cholesterol progesterone from cholesterol cortisol the stress hormone from cholesterol aldosterone that produced the reabsorption of sodium in the kidney that is from collector plus the cholesterol is going to a form the vitamin D vitamin D so we need cholesterol in order to produce vitamin D again what is vitamin D D doing is promoting the absorption of calcium at the level of the test okay all right so let's keep going okay through fact and substance is for example the bio right so substance what you're going to do that are going to lower the surface of tension of the liquid in this case for example the fat is going to be a big component like that you push the substance they are going to divide any small bubbles X small bubbles if you have many of these as small bubbles carrying it small bubbles the surface area of contact is going to increase because you have more bubbles more bubble more level and you saw all the surface contact they are going to increase the surface content with for example with the insight that make more effective the digestion for example the action of the fat of the light base in the fat alright so this is our friend here cholesterol so all the all the functions on cholesterol that we want to know ok prostaglandins that is actually we have prostaglandins are going to have many effects right so those number one is local messenger local message local messenger local Michigan for what for paying for inflammation for for clotting for mucus mucus mucus the mucus of the for example of the stomach stomach so if there is Stephen if you have the mucosa stoma more thicker you have less risk to have ulcers so they can give importantly means in order to increase the thickening of the mucus of the the storm of the lining of the stock okay so lipid oxidation we have is de baby remember the beta oxidation and when you have lipid oxidation by the way that beta oxidation to are able to produce free radicals the free radicals in the hot potato that we already know and this hot potato are going to make burn or destroy cells around for example if you have exposed to the Sun your skin for a long periods of time you produce you have fatty fatty acids there and there in cell membranes right and they react with the oxygen and the outseam producing the skin free radicals that is going to destroy the collagen and you start to come wrinkles because too much exposure to the Sun okay so here we have a pro-oxidant so those are agent who can lead into for more production of free radicals oxygen radiation smoking alcohol light antioxidants we have the vitamin E the vitamin C vitamin C is important we have AB we need every day by the mean C beta-carotene that is the vitamin A or retinoic acid that actually is going to absorb the free radicals selenium and other elements iceberg lettuce is not good source of antioxidant okay nice coming years so everything that is very bright darker is going to contain more anty anty oxidants and the iceberg is pale green so they don't have too much antioxidant too many antioxidants okay heart heart big topic okay heart become topic I want you to remember the cavities of the heart so the cavities of the heart all the cavities for cavities we have on the top atriums lower bed recalls on the right side we have the oxygenated blood in the left side oxygenated blood the bulbs between the right atrium right ventricle the tricuspid bout the mouth between the left atrium and the left ventricle is the might robot and we have here the in the right atrium it's coming the superior vena cava entry the inferior vena cava the view in a camisole is here Peter Winick our superior vena cava going into the right atrium the blood goes through the tricuspid Bob into the right ventricle from the right ventricle is going to be ejected out this is deoxygenated blood towards the pulmonary artery the pulmonary artery divides into branches to the to the left lung and to branches here through the right one then they are going to come back and they come back through that pulmonary veins with oxygenated blood so pulmonary veins going to enter blood into the atrium then left atrium go to pass through the mitral valve and the miter bar go to the left ventricle they go ejected through the aorta through the aorta these pulmonary artery Bob and this is the RT Bob those can be together call you know individually then semi lunar Bob's semilunar Bob bobs instrument where the blood is coming from the atriums to the bed response to the atrium to the ventricle and the ventricles they go to the arteries to the world's the aorta or to the pulmonary artery so that is what you need to know and what is in between for example the right atrium and the right ventricle what is the bulk who make the exit of the blood from the right ventricle what is above that is making the exit of the blood in the left ventricle so those are the kind of questions that you must remember very well okay so I think that is the end of this lecture five review all right so let's go our left ok lecture six we have we have the membrane transport very high G oh please this is extremely important for for you okay so we have we're going to have this right now Esteban let me see what time is you 9:35 8:35 so we have an hour exactly okay we okay all right cell membrane so say oh okay so for this what I want you to remember about the cell is first of all all the holy onions right what is the what is the what is the energies engine of the of the cell is the mitochondria here is what is happening what the psyche the kreb cycle right the acetyl co a entered into the mitochondria and the mitochondria is going to transform the acetyl co a through several reactions into ATP's all right so the cytoplasmic cytoplasmic is a bilayer membrane remember the bilayer membrane bilayer but bilayer membrane and this bilayer membrane is composed by phospholipids and mainly by proteins so mainly of phospholipids and proteins okay so exciti plasma is part of the cell between the cell membrane and the nuclear and the nuclear envelope so for example this is the nuclear envelope and this is the cell membrane all in between this membrane and the cell membrane the membrane of the nucleus and the membrane of the cell are going to be called psycho plasma sytem remember 99% of the composition of the cytoplasmic is going to be water okay so now we have here another thing the nucleolus is inside the nucleus and that is going to come produce the messenger RNA messenger RNA then we have here this is the nucleus is coming the endoplasmic reticulum that is the graph and this is the smooth so the transcription happening inside here translation is going to get into the endoplasmic reticulum and these like grains are the ribosomes those are the cards on safeway who is going to bring the ingredients means amino acids to follow the recipe from the transcription here so that process to provide all the sequence needs like amino acids for example is called that translation protein primary secondary tertiary protein a star in the smooth muscle and a fourth and the quaternary is going to go to the Golgi apparatus Ghadeer paratus okay so that is the cartoon where it's going to be what is its transcription or translation that is the translation translation Golgi apparatus is going to be the place where the proteins are going to be activate all right so transportation extremely important you must know transportation cell memory yes remember a few words the universe equilibrium right so they want to know that they want to be in balance all the time so equal concentrations all the time okay and we have to type passive transportation and active transportation passes teleportation do not use energy act extract connotation use energy so for this I think again I have some no I don't have so I'm going to just mention this there this is the one alright so passive no energy active energy diffusion we have the simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion simple diffusion gas exchange facilitated diffusion it's going to be glucose enter into the cell osmosis is because the same my permeable membrane cannot make pass molecules that are bigger so what we want to have is equal concentrations if there are solutes can not pass from one side to another side water stirring toodaloo it Ballu it the area of higher concentration to make it email ok ok so simple diffusion facilitated fusion ok the active transportation is using energy and we have protein pump and the phagocytosis open eyes contains protein Pam protein Pam what is protein bond is pumping protein know that the transportation is made that transportation is protein what is going to do the protein pump is to exchange food in or put out electrolytes another substances through it so but basically electron the sodium potassium pump sodium potassium pump is a protein pump because it's made by protein who is going what is going to pump is going to be the sodium and potassium they can pump others in scroller constant etcetera okay so that is about the active and the passive transportation alright so here another high-heel for everything open eyes in ears please hypertonic hypertonic isotonic what when you talk say hypertonic you is hypertonic means that is more concentration than the than inside the cell hypertonic means that is less concentration outside than inside the cell isotonic means that there is equal concentrations in and outside of the cell ok so if you have hypertonic hypertonic outside of the cell is more concentrated you want to diluent so water start to go out from the cell toodaloo it outside of the cell wanted to make it equal concentration so that is going to bruise and shrinking on the cell and the second is going to that hypotonic hypotonic means that outside of the cell is less concentrate than inside of the cell in other words where is more concentrated inside the cell hypertonic is what what is a concentration outside of the cell hypertonic is what is the concentration outside of the cell hypertonic means that your hypertonic means that you can high concentration outside of the cell hypotonic means that you have low concentration outside of the cell and you need to remember that the water is going to go from from lower concentration to higher concentration in order to delue it and make even even concentrations in so I protonic he has to remember like I was telling you before hypotonic is hi papa Thomas who is a lobotomist nacelle how we can i Papa Tom oh because water entered into the cell to make it bigger hypotonic hypotonic is low concentration outside the cell compared to inside the cell its high concentration so water pass from hypotonic area to hyper to high concentration inside the cell - Balu it so that's why the cell is going to soil blow up isotonic there is no entry or exit of water why because there is no need for that because there are equal concentrations outside and inside okay so that is about the oh this is okay so we need to know this this is a must we have intracellular inside a cell extracellular outside cell sodium chloride is the salt right sold out of your plate out of you played out of the cell so this was this was common sodium and chloride sodium chloride sodium cation positive like a tea can you see rackety there and correct is going to be negative those outside and inside the cell intracellular is potassium and phosphate so the most common cat in intracellular is the potassium the most common intracellular damien is the phosphate the most common extracellular cation is the sodium the most common extracellular iam is the crawler phagocytosis don't forget about five or psychosis phagocytosis is means engulfing something or the cell eating okay Rio psychosis is going to incorporate in or is going to put out of the cell through this photo psycho psycho psycho sis is the big name from endocytosis and exocytosis and or something that's coming in EXO is something is coming out from the cell okay so from the respiratory you need to remember the primary function is the gas exchange we have the ventilation is how you move your tour acts if you breathe faster or slower superficial or deeper that is ventilation okay what is normal when you're breathing now what is abnormal if you breathe superficial and faster for example and that means the beginning of probably an infection pharynx is remember the order of the first of all days of firings here the overall firings here this is the town is you push down that is oral cavity that is oral pharynx and this is the laryngopharynx Moreno Farex kick all these is pharynx okay perfect so this is the learnings including we have there piccolo T's and all this is the upper respiratory tract below that the trachea the trachea and the lungs are going to be the respiratory tract okay we talked about epiglottis is a cartilage we're talking about the main bronchi we have the pleura and we have some pathology that are actually going to be interesting if you read it again let me go out okay what's helping with the sewing just one please sorry I'm going to go faster okay so routed it oh there is a lot a lot of you must remember about this all right so we talked about metabolism we talking about ATP's and I going to make a summary really quick so please pay attention you need to remember that glycolysis glycolysis glucose to pyruvic acid glucose to be the weak acid glucose to pyruvic acid that is a reversible reaction they are going to happen in the cytoplasm are going to produce two ATP's and the appear weak acid is when a is form and there is actually no oxygen because you need oxygen to transforming and see talk away the Pyrrhic acid instead to go to acetyl co a because you don't have enough oxygen they are going to turn into lactic acid lactic acid is reversible to pyruvic acid can lead to some ATP's lactic acid is now is the molecule that make you soreness a sore on the on the muscles okay alright so then we have acetyl co a is the common end for fats you see the arrows the common fat the common pathway for protein primary use of energy is there carbs glucose fructose galactose so those are the monosaccharides fatty and lipids so we have fatty acids and glycerol so for example we have fatty acids and triglycerides diglycerides are I didn't say I didn't mention cholesterol why pick on cholesterol can not produce a Satoko a cholesterol is not used for fuel we cannot use weight back for pure so we have the fatty acids and a triglyceride and into acetyl co a proteins can lead into acetyl co a 2 so all of all of them is little boy okay so carbs can produce acetyl co a and when you have excess of acetyl co a they can read into our glycogen so they go back to their pirika see sorry so pretty weak acid we are going to turn into because you don't produce more energy than you need right so the pyramid if you keep eating carbs your weak acid can go into a seat okay because you don't need more energy so pure weak acid go to to glycogen they are going to turn into blackboard fatty acids can turn into acetyl clay and more fatty acid more fat deposit so they cannot go fatty acid cannot go into carbs how many ATP's we have in the glycolysis is two ATP's how many total we have 36 ATP's so that is about about you need to know the nutrient processing ingestion digestion what does it mean that yes I mean one word absorption is going to be a transportation across the cell membrane towards the to the bloodstream distribution is where distribution is not part of the GI tract because distribution is being distribution made by arteries and veins all right assimilation is when the nutrients become part of our body so for example some proteins are going to be part of the cell membrane that is already assimilation okay so we're talking about the clip cycle okay talking about the AC system we need to divide the UC system in the GI tract and the access or the audience what are the accessory organs the liver the gallbladder and the pancreas behind here the stomach you see the pancreas here is upon us is a pancreas pancreas okay and the GI tract is going to be all the tubing all the esophagus the stomach and the intestines bolus is what you eat the food in your mouth when you swallow thank God the bolus is change name in the stomach all kind remember the small intestine start with a duodenum a small intestine and start with a duodenum so we have three components of the small intestine duodenum a small intestine and the large intestine the the the small intestine is going to start with the duodenum jejunum and ileum three components of the small intestine and we have the the colon that is the ascending colon colon but the division of the colon is ascending transverse and descending and the colon signals okay so let's to our number eight at the end please I want you to stay because I going to do some extra considerations just to be sure that we're okay it is something that we already talked about the beta oxidation beta oxidation dings oxygen Oh No yes the Uni toxin that's what is called beta oxidation that means an aerobic reaction I know big react okay so about the proteins can restore proteins answer is no no we cannot we can move us toward proteins what happened so so the amino acids are going to be eliminated how through that deamination if you eat much proteins you're going to use the protein the minutes that you need and the race is going to be eliminated but before the initial happen then the body is going to deaminate they're going to take out the radical amino and this amino is is going to transform in ammonia ammonia is captured by the by the liver and the liver transport ammonia that is very toxic into urea and the urea is the one who is going to it be eliminated through the urine okay so remember the urinary the urine is going to follow they're going to be formed from the bathroom go to the pelvis of the kidney they go to the ureter they reach the urinary bladder and then the ureter gluconeogenesis that we have here is a production of glucose from especially proteins okay the urinary system many questions of a urinary system what you need to know are the parts of the urinary system we have the the what the cortex we have the medulla pyramids 1 million nephrons the majority in the cortex the collecting duct is not part of the nephron this portion is so this is the glomerular go Bowman's capsule that is definitely from proximal cumulative nephron loop head ok mean nephron and the distal cumulative oh never all these is never but this portion is not that is that collecting that that is going to be going through that pyramid then they go to the pelvis then they go to the ureter there's more Anatomy but he still simplify because it's what we need bodies at this moment the functional unit of the kidney who is the functional unit of the kidney is the nephron nifA what are the functions of the nephron is the same what are the functions of a kidney so that's why it's called a functional unit is the minimal portion of the kidney who can make all the functions of the whole Keeney similar same no similar same so fresh filtration reabsorption excretion sake hormones those are the functions of bikini that we are going to see later on in anatomy and physiology okay so that is our eight let's go our nine okay let's go to room 9 right okay any real nervous okay so about energy in and out what I want you to remember you have the review here of the new PowerPoint about this crib cycle right remember when we want to create a more ATP's the energies coming from the food and I want you to take you already create a ATP's the cell can use that energy for the metabolic needs of the cell so when you're tired and you feel weak you want energy what you will do it right so the food is going to be providing the energy in Molly to recharge your a deep peace I'm going to recharge your ATP's okay all right so just remember we was talking about our glycolic already so we are not going to go that we already talked about that ah I see alright so we have the Atkins diet a they have worked by inducing a state of ketosis no carbs I need only proteins well I saw ketosis what they are going to do is high concentration ketosis is going to force the kidney to eliminate the ketone acids and that is forcing your kidney so when you into just proteins the kidneys are actually will accelerate the aging of your car so you don't want that because at the end they're going to destroy it little by little difference and you can lead into kidney failure so for example that is not recommended and what is the best diet again the best diet is the balanced eyes open eyes open years 50% carbs 30% fat 20% proteins so these are kids is not actually a recommended for to read it to decrease weight this Atkins diet can be suggested for people who are sick we need to regenerate some tissue that is going to be temporary diet and we need proteins in order to produce a regeneration of optician but know for lose weight low fat diets very low fat diets Ornish diet the problem is is that they have the fat is not converted very fast into energy so and sugars are going to provide you that so when you have low fat you still hungry so they tend to have some amount of carbon so here we have for example that's why they give you more carbs so all these diet is no recommending what is the best diet is 50 carbs 30% fat 20% 20% proteins okay so here the basis of the voting rate the concept basal metabolic rate is the amount of energy necessary to sustain the basic functions of the body to keep it alive heart beating you're breathing right so those are actually brain functional conscious it's going to use energy tdee is the we have is the total dietary energy expenditure in a day that is the measure by the behavior the basal metabolic rate multiplied by the activity factor okay so I went I want you to remember the formulas it's not going to be needed I want you to remember just the council I know important concept is about carbohydrates 4 kilocalories per gram proteins 4 kilocalories fat 9 alcohol 7 and ward zero okay talking about the nervous system was the last class we have the central and peripheral nervous system the periphery the central is going to be covered by the brain cerebrum and the brainstem and that is the brain plus the spinal cord we have until the frontal lobe for motor activity but I write a law for sensorial activity sensitivity the occipital lobe for vision and temporal lobe for here so we are going to have the afferent please efferent F and you need to remember this please a friend is just hit your hand hit your hand and that is the efferent this is the receptors of your hand so this is the effort with a they go to the correspondent level of the spinal cord they go up to the up to the to the brain and come back through the motor narrow motor nerve is the efferent afferent every different okay all right so this is the receptor and this is the this is actually the different the motor never we have the arc reflex in order to you have the sensory here for example you hit the patella your knee the copper reflex so the reflex is coming but instead to go to the cortex of the brain they make a shortcut through this neighborhood so instead to go up they go directly to the different different a nerve that is called the inter neuron intramural okay so we have the somatic and autonomic and just you remember the somatic again please summary here somatic is voluntary it's part of the peripheral nervous system somatic and autonomic right somatic is going to use a seat Ocoee to contract the muscles somatic voluntary muscles when you exercises your you are willing to move with your arms right and the muscles that is voluntary autonomic we have that the what the sympathetic and the parasympathetic sympathetic use adrenaline means other energy receptors the parasympathetic used as the same as the somatic the parasympathetic use the acetylcholine remember acetylcholine is not the same to answer Jacinto coils totally different okay we have adrenaline or epinephrine we have the nor adrenaline or norepinephrine and all these guys together again noradrenaline are going to be called what catecholamines katakana okay so the acetylcholine are be sorry the sympathetic is the rest and digest the parasympathetic is the sorry I mean sympathetic I'm sorry Apollo X sympathetic is the fight or flight fight or flight fight or flight the adrenaline and using Audrina and relic receptors and the parasympathetic is the rest and digest is the silicon collinear degree cholinergic receptors used for four muscles right hard to can we talk about a dendrite okay so here we have synaptic the synapses synapses this is the presynaptic postsynaptic signal to gum and let's go to our last lecture and I want you to stay because well you want to stay are going to do some remarks when we have here okay yes so ominous okay about enzymes I know a high-yield topic here we are going to talk about first of all what I want you to remember is this is the definition by the inside by the inside of the inside not find inside the enzyme active site when the reaction is happening in the reaction is happening here here we have and you see the change of color this is the enzyme again enzyme enzyme enzyme and this is a substract the subtract is going to get the buyback is going to start with a made it and the enzyme already has two different products so we have for example a problem substance that are going to be convert by the enzyme in two different products or sub products that are going to be used by the body so that is remember bind inside and when they have and that this is reacting the is called the active site active site okay so let's keep going enzymes everything ending aids light pains proteins amylase we was talking about in the previous lectures in the pre review we have coenzymes and cofactors we talked about that the denaturation the denaturation is going to be the change totally of the shape of the protein and that's happening in the body especially when you have extreme temperatures sorry extreme pH pH and high temperatures okay so the pH remember all the pH the pH is going to be zero to fourteen pH - I see and I'm being gastric acid pH six the urinary the urine sorry pH seven water pH 12 pancreatic news okay so those are basically enough on the binding side what we need to remember and here we I want you just to review extra about the competitive inhibition and non-competitive inhibition that is going to be so useful when we are talking about farm alright so we have the last portion is the brain stem the brain stem you see here this is the site of you we have the gri we have the black that is the sulci again in the sulci is where is going to be lined by the grave matter the black line great modern very thing is the king of the orange we will talk in class and this a great mother is unmyelinated nerve cells below these these are going to be the white matter white matter is a function is to transmit electrical impulse or the orders of the gray matter to connect different areas of the brain and this is composed by my my early myelinated nerve cells who are going to have the accelerate the transmission all right so we have the midbrain pons and medulla what I want you to remember is about a medulla oblongata a base motor and respiratory center grab by based on water and the respiratory Center okay so who controlled your SP respiratory rhythm in Montana who control the the heart rate the main you longer okay so diencephalon are composed if you see here this is the Zefram composed by green murder the Potala MOS is part of the nervous system who participate or controlled let's put it away the homeostasis in the world cerebellum is coordination posture and balance connected by the Burmese connected by the Burmese so we have the right and the left hemisphere of the cerebellum that is going to be connected through the Burmese we have the we have the limbic system that is side by side of the word of the diencephalon we have the ipod campus amygdala and wrath hypo campus is lace learning and memory enigma is emotions and reticular is the alertness 'also we was talking about what is the bridge between the right and the left cerebral hemisphere is the corpus callosum the activities of the motto of the the frontal motor area highlighted sensoria area Caesarea sensory and the occipital visual and the temporal auditory so those are the scenes I want to mean even know for or this time neurotransmitters we have epinephrine adrenaline dopamine serotonin mood or neurotransmitter gaba is a nematode and endorphin is going to be chill and diminish the perception of pain okay so now this is a review the general review of the midterm are going to make some extra considerations so please pay attention okay I want you to remember to study very well about the conclusion but I was remarking in this leg in this review is please remember about your how we are we have actually does the six health dimensions like six help dimensions okay then I want to remember you about the heart all the bulbs all the cavities what is coming in what is coming out I want you to remember for example the portions of top of the brain we have the cerebrum we have the central central sulcus and we have done longitudinal fissure of the brain remember that we have the pH pH is going to be zero acid 14 is going to be alkaline seven is neutral so everything below seven is acid everything above seven is alkaline remember about the tissues the potato tissue and I want you to remember pseudostratified epithelium that goblet cells and it's functions talking about tissues you need to remember about the classification of the connective tissue the liquid the heart the fibrous and the loose connective tissue you need to remember we was talking just about the enzymes the enzymes are going to be important for the what is the importance of the inside few things number one accelerate the reaction number two is going to need some cofactors and coenzymes in order to produce the reaction please try to make the difference between ionic and covalent bonds covalent polar water covalent no polar fat again covalent polar water hydrophilic correct covalent no polar fat hydro phobic okay when you're talking about the nervous system and want you to always remember about what is the efferent what is the different what are the functions of what is doing the apron versus the efferent a transportation based example of passive passive and transportation a simple simple diffusion sorry simple diffusion or facilitate diffusion what is the difference what are the similarities what are the characteristics of the one of the active transportation you need to remember that you have down the concentration gradient please remember these down the concentration gradient down the concentration gradient means from high concentration to low concentration okay so down so higher to low concentration that is down the concentration gradient and that is for weight basically the simple diffusion and the facility diffusion three we have the active transportation that is against the concentration gradient is the opposite against the concentration gradient is going to be the the what the existent protection that is why the act external rotation because go against the current of the river then split away go up to the river against the current we need energy for that so that's why act external protection law against the concentration gradient the facilitate diffusion and the simple diffusion go go towards the down the concentration gradient so it's going like going down the river and you don't need to tell you anything so that that's why you don't need energy okay transportation a right so is mostly helping a spontaneous Li in that simple diffusion right facilitate efficient are going to be spontaneously another thing I want you to know is the transportation we have I mean we have we need to know what is interested you know what is extracellular you need to know what is the electrolytes more common cations on onions these kettles and angels are ions correct so you need to tell me what is inside what is more commonly outside alright so transportation that we have a what is for example in free radical I want you to define what free radical doctor means hot potato tell me that is the access of electrons it sense of elegance okay so here we have the functions of the I want to know remember you I'm going to remember the functions of the lobes of the of the brain okay and about diet what happens when you eat too mature what happens when you eat too much fat what happens when you eat too much rotate if you eat too much protein is what happened ketoacidosis right if you eat too excessive fat more fat if you eat excessive carbs glycogen or more fun a old anatomy of the kidney all the not even Dakini all all the components of the Kimmie what is the functional unit of the kidney about the GI tract what is the main function for example of the stomach what is the main function of the stomach to digest why because again gastric acid what is the main function of the of the intestine the absorption that's why it's long so what is the function of the colon is mostly observe water why worry what happened with the nutrient why because the losses are already being absorbing the small intestine so the only thing they can absorb now is water okay alright so that is about what I want to let you know about the trip cycle please be aware of that so all the glycolysis the intermediate intermediate phase and the Krebs cycle that ends into the ATC the electron transport chain okay so you see a basically I think we hold this review we was highlight in topics that are in my point of view important you to remember or keep in mind Anita all right so I think we finish our review today tell me what I received is 1019 so we have how much it's like two hours so I think was a comprehensive review remarking all what is most relevant all right so you", "AuIx2-Uq9CA": "this is this is the 10th presentation to gum recession but all other nine sessions are on they're both on the solar de fitness challenge desk on webpage on knowing the right hand side one by one and they're also on GF our partners Raider colors or partners com / low carbs and Louis with a capital L and carbs of the capital c VAR d f dot HTML so i think by now if you google dr. weed and low-carb you'll get everything people been on it for a while and just start off by thanking both marshall Picard who's been coming to the last few weeks to assist in the process very much appreciated and some of you remember katie from 4-5 weeks ago which we came out the morning yes and katie first gave you your first case of a buffalo chicken dip and remember that at about 20 else i'm going to do a demonstration of how to make a watermelon cake okay because we're going to talk about sugar and the next thing is going to happen is you're going to walk out of here and go to some party somewhere right you know whether it's a wedding or birthday or rename it and what are they going to have paint a big piece of cake and how do you feel if you don't take any it's a wedding is a steer right so you really have to learn about how to say well my doctor won't let me just take a small cage you know i'll take a little piece and then they'll share it with three other people must look I have a picture of me at a party of having one little spoon both of getting cake because what's the problem with cake it is sugar and if you look on the web enjoy did you'll find that the carb content of cake birthday cake those tents things goes anywhere from about 30 grams of carbohydrates per serving up to us on one with 91 okay I mean it's just loaded with sugar and of course we're all told that it's not the sugar it's the fat and of course there's some bad and cakes of and that's what people hear they got it all wrong how many people have not been here before anybody never been to one of these groups we've all been here so you know I'm not a physician and not making medical recommendations let's zoom through the next few slides because they don't need to see those we all know that of fat is not the problem in fact that is the solution okay a submitter that's putting more fat back in your diet and cutting them cutting the car next slide and we find that in low-fat products they're always replacing the battle sugar so it gets worse and worse until you find low-fat products it's the worst thing you can eat just eat the regular stuff but it would be far better on how and we know that fat keeps us from getting hungry which is why we talk about how to lose weight or maintain your weight at the same level of my weight hasn't changed in five years but I eat to live full I'm not on this diet and what I do is replace carbohydrates effect so I keep carved really low and that's much higher than most people will eat but when you find out that remember that doesn't make you fat carbs 20 a lot of people have begun to think of sugar and a lot of different way than we used to think of it so normally we think of sugar is pretty benign after all we give it to our children we celebrate with Surtur all the time all our holidays are based around sugar and we think you have some sugar if I gave me some sugar right now would you fall over and Pacific God that retro the very gradual thing and that's part of the problem that we can eat a lot of sugar over the course of a lifetime and God knows I have without seemingly developing any illnesses until later in life and when i hit my late 50s and begin to see my blood sugar go up I began to realize that the low-fat approach I've been taking where I was drinking Dr Pepper sodas you know tons of that all right yeah sounds from the deeper okay but hey there's no fadiman so drink up okay well what that was doing was putting a very heavy load of carbohydrates on my liver and over time unlike blood sugar until such time that I developed what would have been diabetes I was an a1c of 6.3 when I first found out about it one more point and I would have been diabetic I found out about eating low-carb and more fat and totally reversed what I was eating and now my a1c level is 5.1 which is essentially normal and that's without any medication so that's been my whole method of attacking diabetes which essentially diabetes can be resolved by changing your diet if anybody tells you diabetes is a progressive disease which it appears to be for most people because they simply put on medication and then year after year worse and worse and worse and they're told oh you know make sure you have carbohydrates with every meal yeah you know it's like telling an alcoholics Dybbuk make sure you have a beer or glass of wine with every meal it makes no sense whatsoever and of course the disease progresses because you're making it progress and the medication you're taking though it will control the symptoms to some degree it doesn't really change the underlying cause which is what we call metabolic syndrome and that has to do with insulin resistance that your cells are no longer accepting the glucose because they've had too much so you can continue to try to stop sugar glucose into yourselves make more fat or you can simply stop giving your body so much shorter to begin with and we know that just about everything turns to sugar in one form or another but sugar what we usually think of a sugar as dextrose which is table sugar team we think that's the thing to avoid but in fact you eat a potato chip and that's potato chips starts to turn to sugar in your mouth okay so you really can't avoid sugar simply by staying away from things that look obviously sweet and you also have to be careful about all kinds of products seventy percent seventy percent of the products food source of process manufactured foods have sugar added you don't even know it's there you go to McDonald's not only gives it a fun at sugar the meat has sugar head we have developed a taste for sugar in this country that essentially demands with everything we eat be sweet in one form or another so sugar is a real problem in our culture of course the sugar Association will tell you there's no clear and consistent evidence of between increases in take the sugar and body mass index so sugar doesn't increase your way oh that's nice to know Bob let's take things down here if you ever get a chance to if you want to watch a really intense video is about 50 minutes long he's a yo endocrinologist from the University of California San Francisco and about 70 years now ago and put together a video about on the toxic effects of sugar that has gone viral with heavy millions of people who've watched okay and if you just put lust big sugar you'll you'll find a YouTube video there it's a pretty technical in a lot of ways but he's basically making the case that sugar is a special form of carbohydrate because half of sugar dextrose is fructose remember we talked about fructose last time when we talked about butcher truck shows is the sugar that's improved and remember I said that most sugar gets digested in your gut but breakfast is the one sugar that gets metabolized in your liver and it's the increased amounts of fructose that dr. Lessing has blamed for fatty liver disease that's rampant now among adolescents and overweight obesity and type 2 diabetes and more recently this last December my buddy Gary top is a science journalist who really kind of kicked off this whole low carb thing with the new york times article saying up it's old what if it's all been a big fat lie that fat causes heart disease and wait in Greece but in fact Gary and others have really zeroed in on shorter as the primary cause for any kind of both weight gain and diabetes in particular and you seen chart that shows that we started recommending that people eat carbohydrates and lower their fast that's when the incidence of overweight and diabetes both skyrocket okay you get a chance pick this book up or gather from your library and read it the case against sugar by Gary chops and I'll pass it around to take a look it's a bit technical in some ways but he really makes the whole case historically for why we're in the mess we're in particularly over the last four years and why we have seen an epidemic not only in this country but worldwide and you sure so remember what it does before is it because they justice it's either stored as fat by insulin and only one too little glucose is available do we burn our own body fat that's the whole method of around low carb diets if you stop feeding your body sugar and it will start using the fact that we already have sugar consumption between nineteen sixty-five and 2000 here's 1965 and this is the number of pounds per year that people consume on average sugars have stayed about the same are honey and then actually I'm sorry refined sugar has gone down well I structive corn syrup has gone up considerably high fructose corn syrup is in what product just about everything but most of us are familiar with it in soda it's an easy way to get sugar if cheaper than cane sugar and even though sometimes CEO you know now you can get coca-cola with cane sugar wealth same thing but high fructose corn syrup has a little bit more precious than dexter has that Chef is half and half truck doses about 55 45 so you're getting a lot of that truck shows every time you have a soda and that the culprit when it comes to that II liver disease and type 2 diabetes of design team be sure to decline this this one while high fructose corn syrup increase for one time you notice that this is started to come down a little bit anybody heard about that what do you think if people are buying let so the people are starting to get the message that you know drinking you know glass hat your glass after glass or bottle after bottle of soda is not good for you they don't know exactly why but people are moving to water and other beverages we talk a lot of schools about this and Marshall ate the whole program in school okay a brief history of sugar and a lot of this materials in the hand out there or the history of sugar just so you understand oh it's a very old product but it was very rare when it was first bro I'm paying to sugar cane run 8000 BC and then it migrated from New Guinea down here over the idiot I run 6000 did a lot of people have a lot of sugar then no the old people had sugar were kings and princes and people who had lots of wealth oh the average person got no sugar during about the only sugar people at that time would be familiar with would be the sugar in honey or berries okay but when you think about it are you able to get honey easily and can you eat a lot of honey tickets to know so it wasn't really a big factor in people's diets and the same thing with berries they're only available you know they weren't growing them in Chile and then shipping them to stop and shop over in the middle of the winter you had berries for a few weeks of the year that was it Alexander the Great to introduce sugar cane from India into Europe selectmen's over 2,000 years ago by around 750 the Arab through these undisputed kings of sugared why why is so important for the Arabic world to have sugar argument Rican level they junked it with tea right but more importantly sugar was the commodity that was like gold okay and if you had control over sugar in the sales of sugar you can earn a lot of money so it's important to be able to have access to sugar sugar was more considered more of a condiment of something you would have on occasion like I say if you're wealthy but a topic area so list up as a cure for costco lamella Colin you know so you would have it only when you were sick I guess people would want to get sick then well finally the Spanish and the Portuguese began growing sugar and one of the guys that was very instrumental in this was our good friend Christopher Columbus some of you may think of him as Italian but if you really know the story okay nobody tell you that unless you dig and you find that out but he spent time on the Madeira islands where they were growing sugar canes perfect climate events before he traveled to this part of the world and within a second or third trip voyage over the virgin islands of Columbus was importing sugarcane and began the process of growing men in these islands because he knew that was great wealth some some of the cassis the doors came over for gold but sugar was like gold in Europe and he knew it so if he could grow it here that was he would become wealthy the Sun Diego to build sugar plantation and has a first slave rebellion why are you having slaves raising your shortage game I see what else would it work what's it like to grow sugarcane and harvested anybody ever been in sugarcane field it's hot but worst of all you the sugarcane is home let's spend some time when I was five years old a quarter ethos oh I know sugar cane know what it's like in those fields it's not only happens here just kicking it and the bonds on the plants are very sharp you get all cut up and you can adjust what I look for like a corn plant right exactly right and in order to harvest this how do you harvest be you know hm futsal sugarcane yep with a machete okay which is a very sharp long knife and the way you do it is you hold the stock and you whack the bottom of the shirt cayman well if you are whacking all day long what and you're likely to dis okay you're like exactly so there would have lots of injuries that it was horrible you know I mean slavery was bad enough but to be forced to labor in the sugarcane kid was so worse but others rebellion and if you have guns and your slaves don't how do you put down a rebellion is guilty and that's that was the beginning of the kind of slavery that had never been seen on the base of the earth before people were enslaved the Greeks and played people if you had a war of the members of the Jews were enslaved by the Egyptians and slavery was not new but this kind of slavery then was not the kind of brutal slavery that was practiced in these plantations and also it's a whole different story and that of course got carried to the United States an interesting history so four million caribbean place worked on the sugar plantation from 1700 huge number suppose clean Elizabeth the first not currently today but still ahead is the sweets better Keith's became rotted and her breath smelled awful and people talked about that because he has his accesses in her mouth because she was addicted to sugar well she had complete access she could afford it and you began to see if he you know what the toxic effects of sugar art do we see those effects but with sugar today where do we see in this room five days a week we have children okay who are exposing the sugar and then we go over to health first to their dental clinic and find that we have kids you or five and six years old who are getting with access is decayed cavities etc and some with root canals that is not from eating apples and bananas let me tell you that's from eating sugar ok and unfortunately we've seen parents who put soda and models with little kids and it's parked in a mouth all day long and often i saw mother filth in the pacifier in sugar and you missing well thank you begin to see this and you begin to think differently about sugar of the resin sugar coincided with a popularity shot would copy all of which had to have sugar with them and then a network of cafe de sitter and in the united states sugar became a controlled substance because of its cost and by putting care of centuries because everyone had to have sugar so you put a tax or karafun sugar people had to pay it because they can't do without surgery what does this begin to sound like this sounds like a food or does it sound like a drug yes and that's the blessing full of view of sugar is dedica it's a toxic substance dangerous to our bodies tough of certain levels a toxin is off you know there are lots of toxins in our you can tolerate a little bit of arsenic but once it rises above a certain threshold then it's toxic poisonous your body well that's the case of sugar small amount of intolerable larger amounts will we see some short-term effects of sugar and children although it's kind of interesting the researchers kind of conclude the ideas that give sugar two kids they become hyperactive run around but what they didn't do was in the experiment was but not just remove sugar but removes all carbohydrates which turns to sugar and once you take the cards out of a kid's diet then they don't get that slice of blood sugar and then the freshest so you think the product like this would not need any marketing okay everybody likes sugar we know that infants like the child didn't introduce irrevelant pacifier we like we are born liking shorter because we it signifies in nature that it's a good food it's not poisonous to us okay things in nature's of a sweet Dillon Carman so we like sugar and we'll have sugar anytime we want however there's then push back on sugar that some researchers have begun to say maybe this isn't such a good thing for us all so we have the sugar foundation of 90 of 43 who started research and what's called color research grant all designs of 7th of your ad campaign counterclaims with sugar causes cavities ok the diet soda might be better for your help they want to keep the sugar Flo this sounds familiar it's like big tobacco remember ok remember the ads with the doctors know smoking is good for you the same thing the sugar industry has promoted this idea that there's nothing harmful sugar and the guns others like coca-cola on board to say that eating sugar drinking sugar you can be part of a healthy diet you know it's just a matter of calories right well here's here's an ad says jenny has been orbit since breakfast time from school she must stop rush off to a Girl Scout meeting that trampoline class and then assess rally Jenny needs a shirt nervous energy suffering like a beetle needs of hair piece two four six eight what does she appreciate sugar it quenches the team okay so there you go you know this idea that sugar is a natural harmless form of energy and if you want lots of energy have lots of sugar and what would we tell our athletes have some gatorade you know one big another you need that sugar is right more recently we just discovered in fact it's less fault that I'll remember Ancel Keys the guy who set this we shouldn't be eating fat well he was behind the research along with the head of the new harvard school of public health nutrition units presence care of we're taking money from big sugar while the foundation and made a point of doubting sugars role in chronic illness this is this is where we got this idea that fat was harmful for us and sugar was fine because they were very flawed the researchers you bought to publish articles that said we need to focus on fat that's the killer substance and sugars not a problem okay so you want to fill the origins and you reach girish book you'll explain the whole thing put stuff finish up the next so we can get to our cake so we see sugar at all times of food oh I won't go through all the detail on this but things like grape juice which o is up with healthy creatures loaded with sugar 75 grams of greasy like build a greasy 61 grams Mountain Dew 46 grams a Snickers bar only has 30 and a Yoplait yogurt 28 grams ok so you see the sugar in everything including orange juice apple sauce of Marcia and their colleagues guts to the whole program and school snack and found product after product is loaded with sugar many of which were advertised to either say healthier look healthy on the label so you can't believe what's the food manufacturers are selling the lactose is a sugar in of legumes penguins are like peas and dairy products that drive safe the different kind of sugar than sucrose the table sugar and then trucked out but they all have the same calories something energy to produce from them but glucose is a sugar in the blood and its present essentially an all carbohydrates but doses we said before you only metabolized in the liver in the liver and actually reduces fat in the liver that is not victory but fructose doesn't cause insulin regulates the mess a factor in how buck doe doesn't damage and just sell will do a structure of glucose content ray gun to grape juice about fifty-fifty in most things but then we get two sodas that have more drum I park the corn syrup and a higher percentage constructive over jamming sensation UC Davis did a 12 week experiment just 12 weeks and asked them to the subjects during flight by percent of nearly scholarship to sweetened beverages after the group's got glucose tweaking glucoses the other half of sugars and the other destructive both gain weight but in front of drinking to deliver produce more fat and visceral fat and insulin sensitivity decreased so the average American gets sixteen percent of their energy now from sugary drinks non-alcoholic fatty liver disease now affects us a thirty percent of adults in United States and between seventeen ninety percent of those who repeats of orbit have diabetes early on namitha alcoholic secure fatty liver diseases reversible he simply takes the fructose out and that's what Bob lustick bounds with the adolescent students working which he simply got them off soda and their fatty liver disease results they were no longer still so if you have fatty liver disease you're more likely to develop cardiovascular disease retirement and for official just want to mention of that human cancer cells grow in glucose the other thing with artificial sweeteners is a packet format a lot of disability to take about the states to miss a one-to-one replacement for sugar packets and it's not a Splenda is like 50 times in Swedish sugar so if you're you put two sugars in your coffee and you're like I'm selfish she wasn't in there you're making it you can't even paint how sweet it really is your your taste buds on your tongue can't process the level of sedative you're so sensible so if you're going to use any of these small amount right yeah i was already exactly okay maybe better just using plain David sugar okay if you're just going to have a small amount no necessity if you're keeping your chart slow everywhere else is no necessity of avoiding a small amount of sugar if you need you to combine some definite just make a coffee yeah after I used to it right this is bull p.m. yes and I Greg you taste the cost of their for tonight so this comes to haul up the display Wendell Berry people are fed by the food industry which pays no attention to health and are

as i go i haven't been overly trimming these too much though like i have in the past i did do it some trimming before i watered them i cleaned up a little bit more on the stems because those leaves

month ago i kept doing it so let's show you how to thin some of my cluster so i have to pick some of these clusters to take off this is a little too productive and so i really like this beauty cluster and i'm gonna take off some like that one yeah i did it folks i'm chewing my cluster of grapes people probably think i'm crazy but uh you know sometimes you gotta do it i can't see it and it's so hard to do with one hand extremely hard to uh to what should i owe here yep i did it i'll do it again this seems like a cute i can only bear to do that much hoping i can do more every day i keep coming out to do more thinning off of my tree here is my other tree quite productive i have a hard time thinning it out but i will if i had to like here's one i would love to than now bye bye it can become a fertilizer for the tree hmm what else can i pin out oh my god what a beauty the hidden one right over there but you know i think i can only do that much thinning today i don't think i can do more unless i see something i really want to do one more one more okay yeah i did it crazy i did it maybe this one okay i think i did like five today that's good so it is hard to thin out this cluster uh but you should um these ones they have great sunlight no shading there's no disease but each of the vine can support a certain amount of grape clusters so if you do want the best sizing and flavor you should thin out them a little bit um so they can be healthier um and not compete for sunlight in that sense you can see it's very very healthy looking great", "wZ_cUNyvsCU": "my name is Cecilia Rivera and I am great quality manager for Sun rock The Midnight Beauty grades were introduced by Sun world in the 1990s to provide our customers and consumers a unique black seedless spray what makes a Midnight Beauty unique is its early ripening time is usually about 14 days before Thompson seedless communities that are grown in the United States are harvested in the Coachella Valley they start in mid-may and the peak is in June thereafter they move up north to the San Joaquin Valley the peak there is July and they go through mid-august both Coachella Valley and San Joaquin Valley provide a combination of Sun fertile land and water resources and these locations are great for growing this type of variety it provides color it provides sugar and it provides size this is a very sweet variety because of its bricks the Brix averages out to about 17 to 18 Brix is the method of measuring sugar and asset ratio it provides the perfect harvest time for the farmer on the midnight beauty break and other fruit varieties they also hold up very well to have a long shelf life the appropriate temperature for a midnight Beauty Brains and it's 34 degrees Fahrenheit and if you store them at the perfect temperature these grapes will hold from ten to twenty days it has been known in stores where the beauties are promoted that the actual total category has increase put them in the freezer freezer and eat them as a healthy snack I know me and my daughter love to do that on a hot summer day", "Xmtq4V64Njw": "hey youtube what's going on welcome back to the garden today i'm transplanting a couple plants outdoors and i wanted to show you what i'm feeding the soil as i transplant so this year i wanted to try something different and by different i mean try planting a fish head underneath each of my plants well i wasn't able to find specifically fish heads but i was able to pick up a whole tilapia for pretty cheap so the way i'm feeding the plants is i'm just going to place that fish deep in the hole and backfill with a few inches of soil and then i'm just going to place my plant right on top so i first learned of this method from a channel called self-sufficient me so i'll link that video in that channel in the video description two other amendments i'll be adding are whole bananas and whole eggs and i'll basically be feeding the plants the same way as i um did with the fish i'm just going to plant them deep in the soil but for the eggs what i what i did with all the eggs is you see there's a very slight crack and basically that's just gonna allow the eggs to break down a little bit more quickly um it basically compromises the structure of the egg so once the roots start pushing against it it's able to break down a little bit more quickly and the last amendment that i'll be adding is this micro mycorrhizal inoculant which is basically just a type of symbiotic fungi that allows the roots to uptake more nutrients than they otherwise would be able to so i'm really excited for the growth season and all these amendments will basically allow the plants to have a supply of fertilizer throughout their life cycle so i'm really excited to try feeding the plants with a fish and hopefully it goes well but really excited for the outdoor growth season this video will probably be titled the prologue i'm not going to have this be the first episode the first episode of the outdoor uh garden will probably be the first day of the month next month so i'm excited to film that for you guys and excited to have you guys joining along in this grow season but uh that's about

right by me just playing the full I know you're all here because you want to be healthy and feel sexy and look younger and some people want to lose some weight I'm going to share with you some of the strategies that have worked for me and my clients in this jam session I'm going to introduce you to a simple system that will give you some of the best tools that you need for vibrant health and vitality before you get started and remove some of the distractions like it rid of all the tabs open on your computer and put your phone on buzz and I'm going to do a little question and answer period at the end of the webinar so make sure that you stay to the end so you can get your questions answered and also I have a great surprise for you at the end of the webinar some specials so I hope you'll stay for that and let's get started I'm a little bit new to the technology so some of my transitions are a little questionable so let's get started so before I tell you a little bit about myself I have to give a big shout-out to my mom my mom name's Bianca anyway she was a very very health conscious person she always exercised she did organic gardening and she always served us fresh healthy natural foods that means sometimes we did have good here and there but for her it was really important to pay attend gen to what you were eating she was also very interested in health and read magazines like Prevention magazine she learned a lot about vitamins and fitness and she exercised pretty much throughout her life and it's August she just turned 92 so shout-out to you mom I love you I want to tell you a little bit about myself I've also been interested in health and wellness since I was young the first actual diet I went on I was 13 years old I had gained that little 13 year old PUD and decided I didn't want to look like that so I read a bunch of books and picked out one that looked promising and it had a thing about diet and exercise and it was a counting calories book and I had Lee counted all my little calories looking up every food and measuring everything and I did lose that little bit of weight that I had gained but I also felt very empowered that I could make decisions about my body and actually changed my body and then most of my life I've eaten a plant-based diet and for quite a bit of my life I've been vegetarian I am very interested in raw fresh organic food and I've noticed from working with my clients that one size doesn't fit all one type of eating plan one type of exercise it's really important to find things that work for you and your body which make you healthy happy and satisfied now I did my own little McDonald supersize experiment and I want to tell you a little bit about that when I was pregnant with my second child I was in grad school in Johnson City Tennessee and the McDonald's was located right next to the Dairy Queen and because i had a little less fun than usual being in grad school and because I was pregnant and very much craving iron not realizing it at the time I started to go to McDonald's and I was eating a happy meal every single day and right next door there was the Dairy Queen so I would get my happy meal and then go next Dora get one of those little chocolate brownie you lava cake after the birth of my second child I weighed 175 pounds now have any pictures of 175 pounds except for close-ups of the face of me and my daughter and I think I did that on purpose and when I ready to see me that big but here I am six months later and I'm starting to look healthy again but you can see I'm still pretty big the big distinct difference was that towards the end of my pregnant pregnancy I hired a midwife because I decided I wanted to have a home birth she tested my iron and realized I was low in iron that's why I was craving those McDonald's cheeseburgers so much she taught me how to eat properly by making sure I 8 iron rich foods with vitamin C which helps you to absorb them better and also she taught me that if you eat a lot of calcium rich foods while you're trying to eat iron rich foods it blocks the absorption of iron so just with that little dietary tweak I was able to get the energy I need it again and start on my way to clean eating so I got to really experience the whole supersize thing that when you're eating a lot of that process junk fast food you gain weight very rapidly and then when you start eating clean eating healthy fresh natural foods you lose the weight before I get started on what we're going to cover I have to reveal the survey question what would you most like to talk about in this program and most people were interested in behavioral strategies so we will get to that a little bit later we're going to talk about so much information about how to improve your life and reach your goals and lose weight the great thing about doing it the proper way is you actually get to eat there are so many benefits in the awakened system in the system that I use weight loss hell I will also go over some foods that sabotage your health and your beauty and your weight loss so avoid those foods and then gravitate towards the healthy choices that will help you be sexy and fine also I'll give you some strategies and some tools to help you get started on your journey so everyone is going to be at a different starting point remember my supersize story at one point I looked in the mirror and I thought how did I let myself get this unhealthy in this fat and some of you are probably having some of those feelings don't be discouraged the first place to start is to focus on where you want to go vika specifical and hold this positive image in your mind cut out pictures of what you want to look like put on the refrigerator if you really get this goal in mind it will help to motivate you to make the right decisions moment by moment it's also really important to love yourself just the way you are right now have compassion and forgiveness towards yourself especially if you are falling back into old habits make a positive mantra for yourself one of my favorites is I eat healthy foods that are perfect for my body easily and effortlessly remember too that sometimes it's kind of a numbers game you know you're not going to always a hundred percent eat a certain way so give yourself permission to eat eighty to ninety percent healthy foods and then every so often have something fun we all know one of the major causes of weight gain and obesity is overeating and unhealthy eating but it really doesn't stop there making poor food choices can lead to nutritional deficit it get increased stress levels you can become more tired and fatigued and a lot of people kind of fight that with eating a ton of caffeine and sugary snacks which compounds the problem that ends up causing dental problems high blood pressure high cholesterol depression and sleep problems so when how I eat eating can cause all types of diseases I had this one client John he was like a total junk food junkie and he had type 2 diabetes in her wellness coaching sessions I gave him a detox and cleanse eating pimp plan and then prescribed a moderate exercise program and it was literally just some walking some swimming in some yoga within four months he had lost 35 pounds of fat and was a healthy weight within six months his doctor took him off the medication for diabetes and three years later he still looks and he feels great and he told me the other day that he went to his family reunion last summer and everyone told him he looked 20 years younger so eating healthy can have a real impact on your results one of the biggest problems of unhealthy eating is that your chances of contracting a lot of different types of diseases drastically increases when you don't eat healthy one of the first bodily systems to be affected as your immune system if you aren't giving your immune system what it needs to protect your body you will be vulnerable to viruses bacteria and disease some diseases that are closely related to poor eating habits include cardiovascular disease hypertension diabetes cancer osteoporosis sleep apnea liver and gallbladder disease and even infertility this is the big list of watch out foods these foods offer little to no nutritional value and contribute to weight gain low energy add skin low libido stress or just basically an unhealthy lifestyle another thing about this list of foods is a lot of them people have food sensitivities to them or food allergies and it causes a lot of other detrimental effects so the next time you go to the grocery store look at the nutritional labels and really consider what you are buying and putting into your body I'm not good at this whole webinar thing yet so I'm going to pop up a survey about what kind of foods you're eating and how many of the foods you consume daily so when the question pops up take the survey now some of the top offenders that you want to remove from your diet include artificial sweetener sugars processed foods artificial flavors caffeine wheat gluten preservatives uncultured dairy fried foods and nitrates often clients will protest about one food or another but if you're having trouble there are often strategies to improve your choices like for example have a lot of clients that when I say you should try and avoid alcohol they're like oh no I gotta have you know all the thing about alcohol is it's really high in sugar it's carbs and it has a lot of calories and there are a lot of unhealthy side effect for alcohol to your body so for example if you're one of these people that is doing those big margaritas which I did have a client that was doing that if you switch from those sugary mix drinks to a glass of red wine that's a better choice for your body another example of a switch is that instead of having cups and cups of coffee a day choose green tea instead you catch the drift a lot of times you can switch out foods that aren't quite as healthy for you for some that are more healthy so now that we've discussed what we really should be taking out of our diet let's move on to the good stuff what makes your body tick what is really going to help you reach your goals and live a healthier lifestyle food really is the cornerstone of your physical being it is the building blocks of your body food helps your body run efficiently and effectively all the healthy things you consume are used in your body to help it work properly from the whole body all the way down to the cellular level your body has specific needs that are only met through healthy eating and healthy lifestyle habits when you put bad food into your body everything slows down or comes to a complete halt because your body doesn't know what to do with it or it can't process it correctly ultimately this leads to weight gain dull skin low gee weakened immune system and disease it would be like putting peanut butter in the gas tank of a conventional car so what should you do use the right fuel so I want you to look at this list now and eat more of these and again I'm going to try and pop up the survey questions so I'm not sure when it's going to pop up because there's some kind of delay between live and webinar take the survey question and let me know how many of those food you enjoy daily these foods offer a multitude of health benefits and they're really what your body needs on a daily basis some foods you just you should some foods you should start eating more every day one of my biggest favorites is coconut oil I just saw the video making fun of eating coconut oil but it's really healthy for you and if you want to lose weight eating a little bit of coconut oil is just excellent other things that you can include or grape fruit smoothies greens green juices and if you're going to eat meat make sure you're eating grass fed clean proteins free-range chickens really pay attention to your protein sources or you can do like I do go with the plant-based proteins other things that are healthy for your local honey it helps with allergies and my favorite sweetener is stevia it's an herb and it's just amazing i use sweetleaf stevia it's delicious and next we're going to look at some detox foods now I like to suggest to my clients that they detox their bodies at least once a year but even better if you can do one for every season a lot of people are very confused about what a detox is and my detoxes are basically choosing clean healthy foods there's no big fasts it's just eating clean fresh organic healthy foods these are some of the best detox foods to help you cleanse & remove toxins from your body so take a good look at this list and don't forget about water there are many different types of detox rooms but like I said before I like to stick with the clean natural fruits and vegetables and I feel that some more natural and healthy way to detox when you go through a cleanser detox you are eliminating the waste products and toxins in your body and this improves your health by removing these harmful substances this allows your bodily system to work more efficiently which in turn gives you more energy improves your cognitive functions it gives you healthier looking hair and skin and it drastically improves your immune system toxins and wastes weigh heavily on your body and your major organs particularly the liver many people really see drastic changes in their bodies after a good cleanse or detox including weight loss another really big benefit of a detox is it kind of cleanses your taste buds and regular healthy foods start to taste healthy again now first time I went on a detox after I was done carrots tasted like candy because I wasn't inundating my body with sugars and so the sugars in natural foods tasted absolutely wonderful to enhance the results of a good cleanser detox there are additional tools that really helped i like to do wet skin brushing but a lot of people like dry skin brushing oil pulling it's an ancient practice that helps to clean out your mouth and studies have shown very positive benefits when you use this in your routine daily I know that I have very quick teeth cleaning now at the dentist from doing this practice one of the best things that you can do during a cleanse or a detox is to take a nice bath in epsom salts it adds magnesium into your system it relaxes your muscles and it helps to remove toxins and you can even add a little bit of essential oils that makes the back even more relaxing I late eating seasonal organic foods really helps with your cleanse and detox just as the seasons change our bodies change as well and winter our bodies want a little bit more hearty meals to help us stay warm and in the summer our bodies want fresh light cold meals to deal with the summer heat now here are the power strategies that have really helped a lot of my clients meet their goals both with losing weight gaining greater health or reducing the medications or completely getting off the medications one of the biggest things is to plan your meals I had a boss ruff he used to say all the time if you fail to plan you plan to fail so if you plan your meals you're more likely to choose and get healthy choices I read in a book recently which has really been revolutionary is don't stop eating when you're full stop eating when you're no longer hungry think about that we're always waiting to see well am i full and my full no stop eating when you're no longer hungry that is like a revolutionary way to look at how to stop eating use smaller plates most of my clients that use smaller plates feel more satisfied at the end of the meal a range of food like art so it looks beautiful sit down at a table when you're eating don't ever just wander around and eat or eat when you drive when I was super sizing it I used to what on the way home eat mindfully what does that mean pay attention to everything about your meal how it tastes what it looks like how it smells take those smaller bites to your food completely really taste your food there's always a saying that a lot of health people say that you should drink your food meaning essentially that you chew your food so much that it actually is like liquid before you swallow it and then another thing that has really really helped for me and my clients is to keep a food diary or food journal you want to write down everything you eat drink or taste you want to write the time you ate it how much you ate and you really want to record your feelings what you were feeling before you ate and how you felt after you ate the food and then another strategy to eating healthy is don't eat a lot of stuff after dinner when you're done with your dinner you're done give yourself a good amount of time to digest that food that UV one last thing unless you're doing an intermittent fast eat breakfast so those are the big food strategies that have really helped my clients get better health lose weight and feel better now I'm really big on getting very nutrient-dense foods and super foods are a way to do it they are considered to be especially beneficial for your health and your well-being superfoods are extremely dense and rich in particular nutrients that our body thrive on some are full of antioxidants fiber iron minerals protein vital vitamins and minerals that your body needs when you look through this list of superfoods oh yeah another poll and I'm not sure when it's going to pop up but when you look through the list of superfoods how many of those do you can see on a daily basis now I'm going to do a webinar eventually on the power of hydration but one of the most important things that our body does need is water and just plain water whether it's for weight maintenance for living a healthy lifestyle losing weight hydration is the key to our survival without water you will literally perish the fact of the matter is that when you drink enough water it leads to greater health and comes with a ton of other benefits on top of shedding weight especially there's hard to lose you know extra pounds drinking water helps you from overeating because it gives your body as sense that it's fuller water increases your energy levels speeds up your metabolism and is vital for cleansing and detoxing efforts so if you're on a cleanse you really do need to be drinking lots and lots of water some tips on using water to your best advantage is to drink a glass of water before your meal also your goal should be to drink about 64 ounces of water per day this is just a general recommendation some people need more some need less but listen to your body it will tell you what it needs another thing that I found really helpful for your body is to look into some good probiotics probiotics are beneficial gut flora in our digestive system that helps with breaking down the food that you consume so your body can really absorb the nutrients that are in the food there are both good and bad bacteria in your gut you can often tell if there is an imbalance of bad bacteria when you have a lot of indigestion and acid reflux stomach pains and other stomach complications a lot of times when people are having this the first thing they do is they reach for the tums or Maalox or rolaids and it's actually a bad idea to do this because those medications actually kill a lot of the good bacteria in your gut so you're actually destroying the things that can help you the most so taking good probiotic and eating foods that help support the probiotics will help with a sustained weight loss with your health the other thing about taking probiotics is you really can absorb more nutrients another way to get your probiotics is to eat foods that are rich in probiotics like fermented foods like sauerkraut miso kimchi they're really great sources of probiotics so we've talked about the basic information and additional tools to help you with clean eating so that you can lose weight you can feel sexier look younger and get healthy so now how to put it all together how do you start implementing this new lifestyle immediately are you finally ready to change your life let your goals start here I'm providing some free tools so that you can try your own little mini detox and cleanse I hope you will take the time to try that little quick detox and cleanse and see how it feels for your body if you want a little bit more I have a bunch of different programs some of them have wellness coaching components

you fast and lasting results for example if you can't follow the system completely and you only lose a half a pound of fat a week you multiply that by 52 weeks in a year and you could lose 26 pounds of that and that's why I do recommend the sizzling summer program as your jump start to success it will lead to greater health an added bonus of a slimmer sexier you this program not only includes everything you need to detox and cleanse from recipes to shopping lists to guides but it will give you the results you want fast and as an extra added bonus you get three private one to one wellness coaching sessions with me via Skype or Google Hangouts so you'll get that extra support you need to get that success this is how the program can improve your life it's kind of the magic behind your success one of the most significant benefits the detox and cleanse is that you'll find out what are your trigger foods so you can see how your body reacts when you eat certain things so you can decide what's best for you and what's best for your body and if you look at this slide this is all you get which is quite a bit on the sizzling summer program so i hope you will look in and see if this is something you might be interested in the only downside of the sizzling summer program is that I can only do 20 clients at a time I really do want to meet your needs and give you all the attention you deserve so the one-on-one wellness coaching all that there is is 20 at a time I want to let you know that even if you don't become a part of the sizzling summer program that I know that you can defeat the problems caused by faulty eating once and for all and that you don't have to be stuck in super size or compromise your health because of crappy eating habits you can be healthy look younger and feel sexy again I know this because it happened for me and many of my clients if you look in my resources there's a lot of options even if you can't make it into the sizzling summer program you can look at all my free resources and receive a lot of really great results I want you to think about getting actual results imagine that you can do it imagine getting results like some of my clients have a client Karen she got big benefits and massive outcomes using the sizzling summer program she found out that her biggest problem was actually food sensitivities and that was what was giving her digestive issues and that dreaded belly bloat she could not get rid of those last 10 pounds and after doing the detox and cleanse she found that she could actually eat more and look better and she was able to get into those skinny jeans that she had been dying to wear so if you look over to the left of your screen and he think he might be interested in the sizzling summer program you can just click on that button and it will show you how to enroll as some of you are real do-it-yourself kind of people so I want to introduce to you I have a new little mini version of the summer program that does not include the wellness coaching this option is especially good for the do-it-yourself type person you'll get all the materials you need to do the cleanse and detox there is only one downside is you don't get to work on any other areas like the behavioral issues the fitness or the stress management with me at the one-on-one wellness coaching but maybe the detox is actually just enough for you and what you need also you still get to be a part of our facebook group and the daily email supports for me so you will still be a part of the group and get those daily e-mails supports and as a bonus for being a part of this live webinar you can buy the do-it-yourself detox and cleanse for half price to the end of this live version of the webinar well I'm going to actually put a little bit more but I'm not a hundred percent sure again with the whole technology thing how well everything will work so if you notice i put up the do-it-yourself summer detox and cleanse program on the sidebar and if you would like to look into this feel free to click on that offer and look it over and see if this program will be right for you and i'm going to try and switch this back to my face so that we can start the question answer portion of this webinar so give me a second as i try and figure out this technology I practiced I swear but I am new to this ok so I hope you learned a lot of information and if anybody has any questions just type them into the chat box and I will get to them ok speeding up your metabolism I just did a periscope on speeding up your metabolism and here are a few tips on how to do that ok one of the first things you could do to speed up your metabolism is to stand more I don't know if you've heard some of the research but basically I'm sitting is the new smoking so if you'll get up every 45 minutes or so do a little yoga stretches or walk around the room it will speed up your metabolism and as far as walking goes that also can speed up your metabolism I like to tell people to park far away towards the end of the parking lot in outer suburbia so that you can get a little walk also too if you're going to the grocery store or the mall instead of just going right to where you're going to shop take a few laps around the grocery store to get a little bit of an extra walk I have this watch I don't know if you can see the anyway it actually records my steps and I try and shoot for 10,000 steps a day which is five miles but again you can make your own goals but walking does speed up metabolism getting a good night's sleep is beneficial for increasing your metabolic rate drink water even mild dehydration slows your metabolism a cold exposure is a good way to speed up your metabolism and I know that's kind of a tough thing to do this time of year in Georgia but you could take those hot cold showers where you go in the shower for three minutes leave the water on hot then turn it to really cold for 30 seconds so that's a way that you can increase your metabolism and of course everybody knows that having more muscle increases your metabolic rate so strength training resistance training is very beneficial also exercise in general will increase your metabolism there's this thing called post-exercise oxygen consumption EPOC and basically what happens there is if you get a good workout it will increase your metabolism and even when you go home and you're sitting around your metabolism is still increased because of that exercise that you did earlier hot foods like cayenne pepper increases your metabolic rate and eating breakfast helps copy coffeen caffeine that's in coffee and tea will increase your metabolism but you have to be careful because too much caffeine can keep you awake at night which will slow your metabolism and catechin a substance and green tea has been shown in research to speed up the metabolic rate one last thing they just did some new research that eating more fiber increases your metabolic rate as much as thirty percent so there are my tips for increasing your metabolic rate okay there's a lot of food on the program okay two reasons why there's a lot of food in this is ling summer program when you look at the food on the shopping list the program was essentially made for two people a lot of the recipes or for two people so of course that's going to make more also to you're going to eat a little bit more volume wise when you're eating a lot of vegetables so you might be actually eating a little bit more but i would suggest and i do in the welcome letter to that program that you only buy what's going to stay fresh for the next couple of days so for example even though you might end up consuming you know you know five or six avocados during the program don't buy five or six all at once because they tend to go bad fast so just buy one or two and then you get to go to the grocery store more and then you can walk around the grocery store a couple of times and get those laps and get your step so anybody else have any other questions well good i guess i was very clear during this webinar so if you have any other questions feel free to shoot me an email would I recommend you doing strenuous exercise during a cleanse probably not I I'm not much on strenuous exercise anyway I'm a big listening to your body and doing it feels good to your body but if you're really used to doing something then there's no reason that you can't do it during a cleanse but you really want to pay attention to how you feel and how your body feels during the cleanse well I'm really glad that you all could join for the webinar and if you have any other questions feel free to shoot me an email and I'd be glad to answer your other questions have a great day bye break out leave it all behind us and take down everything but standing Ewing don't stop believin it'll work out again my friend a standout be a part of everything good wake up you're gonna be all that you should try out all the things you always wanted to be you see cuz I know what I know nothing but you in the blue skies welcome to look", "12Pt2Hp58q0": "good morning everyone today I want to talk about taking the greats best time to pick the grapes leaps in the morning because in the morning the fruit tastes much sweeter because the sugar levels in the grapes and are much better the first right here I've got my apricot tree this one is growing from seed so it's a small one but it's growing and I think in maybe two years when I start getting out some fruit my first here are my grapes and in order to get more grapes you have to trim it this one is a little bit too big I did trim date at the beginning I should have trimmed it a little bit more so I could get a little bit more great but every morning I try to come here and cut off one bunch of grapes this morning I'm going to cut that one off and it looks pretty good and this one used to be failed with more grapes that were punches all around here but already cut it off so this morning it's this one but I need my head if I couldn't do it with one oops and they found just I was doing it with one hand but as you can see that's pretty good but I'll come back and cut some more because this one is filled with grapes there's more right there over here we've got some more like I said you wouldn't grow some grapes track them it's gonna take 2 or 3 years to start giving us our grapes but when they do cut them in the morning they're gonna be much sweeter just don't drop them like I did because I was doing it with one hand but they're still pretty good look right there yep and every morning I tried to cut off just one bunch they're pretty good check this one out one little flower just pop me granny gonna plant still hasn't given any they will hopefully that little flower takes off and starts growing in my chest cause it is getting bigger so fingers crossed now we're here cutting some peaches to make sure watch type each video and also nectarines", "DkYldAeXPHU": "- Welcome to Southwest\nYard & Garden. I'm Curtis Smith. You know, California's\nnot the only place they can grow good grapes. We've got good\ngrapes in New Mexico. Last week, we learned about\nwine grapes of the Los Lunas Agricultural Science Center. And Dr. Ron Walser has\ncome back to Los Lunas to teach us about table grapes. And table grapes are a very\ndifferent topic, aren't they? - Yes, it's entirely different. There are a few aspects\nthat are similar, but different varieties,\ndifferent cultivars, different methods of pruning. - Even different species. - Yeah, it's a different\nspecies entirely. So it's a different\ntopic altogether. And yeah, we grow some\nexcellent grapes in New Mexico. Last year, I ate some\nexcellent table grapes. - I grew some really\ngood ones in my backyard. - Backyard's a great place\nto grow table grapes. You don't need many plants\nto have a lot of grapes. - That's true. Well, let's go see some. - OK. - Ron, this is a pretty vine. What plant is this? - Well, this is\none of the hybrids. They're a cross between the\nvinifera, the seedless grapes that you get out of California,\nand the American types bred for cold hardiness and\nseedlessness and selected. They had to do a\nlot of crosses to be able to get the seedless\naspect in there. And also disease resistant. So this one here\nis Himrod, which is a white seedless, probably\nthe best quality white seedless that we can grow, excellent for\neating and for raisins, other-- - So we can make\nraisins from this. - Oh, you bet. Yeah, Himrod makes\nan excellent raisin. The skin, just a\nlittle bit tough, but it really makes\na nice raisin. - Yeah, and as I was looking\nat this, I also saw the leaves and thought of some\nMediterranean food I'd eaten with the grape leaves. - Yeah, I've heard about\nthat, but haven't tried it. But I understand\nit's pretty good. You get one of these\nleaves and wrap them, I guess, wrap the food\nin the grape leaves. - It's tasty. - But you know, there are a\nlot of other seedless table grapes that are available. One, a pink one is\ncalled Reliance. And it's an excellent\nquality seedless table grape. The university of Arkansas\ndeveloped a number of black and red seedless. One was Mars. One was Venus. And those are excellent\nquality black seedless grapes. - Then we do have the\nseeded types as well. - Yeah, we have the seeded type. And their leaf structure's\nmuch different than these. And we'll take a look at the\ndifference between this leaf structure and the seeded type. - Let's go do that. Ron, this one does\nlook a lot different. - Yes, this is a\nlabrusca, American type. Actually, the name of\nthis one is Concord. - Oh, I know the Concords. - And it was developed in\nthe Eastern part of the US. But it does OK here. But notice the difference\nbetween these leaves. This is a hybrid,\nnice and shiny. And then look at\nthis one, the backs. - Oh, white on the back. - There's a whole\ndifferent color and actually shape\nto the leaves. You can tell the\ndifference just looking at the leaves between the\nAmerican and the hybrid types. - Now, these have seed in\nthem, but they're tasty. They're fun to eat. You have to kind of slurp\nthem out of the skin, because normally, you\ndon't eat the skin. And you spit the seed out. - An excellent flavor,\nthese Concords. - Oh, very tasty. - All of our jellies, our dark\njellies, our juice, dark juice comes from Concord. And actually, if you want to\nspit the seeds out, you can. But if you want\nto eat them, they have a lot of anti-oxidants. - They're healthy for you. - Very healthy. And also the skins have a\nlot of the anti-oxidants. You've heard a lot lately\nabout the healthful aspects of grapes, particularly\nthey talk about the wine. But it's the red\nwines, the dark juices. And actually, the\nseeds have a lot of those anti-oxidants,\nhealthful aspects to them. - It looks like this plant has\na problem with health itself though. - Well, yeah, take a look. You know, they were\ndeveloped in the East. And with our high pH soils,\nwith Concord variety, they develop this\niron corrosive. So you can see the green\nveins and the yellow in between the veins. Very typical iron corrosives. - So what do we do about that? - Iron chelates, sprays\nof iron chelates. - Compost, sulfur. - That'll help some\nin the long term. The short term, sprays\nof iron chelates. But even without sprays, the\nConcord will make it here OK. - We've got another variety\nright here that looks interesting, similar to this. - Let's take a look at this one. - Ron, this one has a white\nbottom to the leaf too. - Yes, this is a labrusca\ntype, but it's a white one. It's the one called Niagara. - Oh, OK. - And when you get the clear\njuice, the white juice, that comes from\nNiagara as opposed to the dark juice that\ncomes from the Concord. - And how about the\nanti-oxidants in this one? - Not as many. - Not as many. - The dark grapes have\nmore anti-oxidants, are healthier for\nyou than these. But sometimes you\nwant a white juice. - A different flavor,\nit's nice to have variety. - A different flavor. And also, there's a one that's\nsimilar to this called Muscat, Golden Muscat, that is\nreally not good for juice, but for flavor. And aroma is tremendous. - And I've got a Catawba. - A Catawba is a red one\nthat does a good job. And I guess you\nhad some experience making juice out of this. - Made juice out of it. It turned brown. When we put sugar, it\nturned into a very beautiful golden jelly. - So if you want a golden\njelly, then look at Catawba. I bet it had a\ngood flavor though. - It is very mild. It tasted very good. - The pruning on\nthese is different. - This doesn't look like\nthose wine grapes at all. - No, when we were talking\nabout wine grapes, we did spur pruning. But with these\nlabrusca types, you need to do what we\ncall a cane pruning. You leave about anywhere from\neight to 12 buds on a cane, as opposed to those short spurs\nthat you do on the wine grapes. - And that's very different. - So yeah, it is different\npruning, a different technique all together. - Well, Ron, this looks\nreally good, really pretty, a lot of fruit production,\nand a different way of growing things. So thank you for\nshowing this to us. - Good to be here. [Happy music] - Here's a gardening tip\nfrom Southwest Yard & Garden. Proper watering conserves\nwater and reduces accumulation of unwanted\nsalt in the garden soil.", "yP1pgM3evpY": "[Music] and you're gonna have to noon everybody urban guard our family here wanted to show you guys my grapes coming in but suspect something to eat now first time ever put out any grapes but down here you tell something's getting up on this stump something's taking little bites out of them down there mulberries are still proven still doing really good tomatoes are really getting big starting to overgrow the cages blooms galore certain you get excited got me some tomato sandwiches coming Buttercup - doing good beets are doing good arugula keep plucking the flowers off of it don't really like arugula look at red romaine Wow looking good next year thinking maybe adding a little bit more garden space a little garden plot right back here right over there there's some tomatoes right there couple more Tomatoes right over here a few more over here a little trio right here found this tomato hiding out in the center healthy blooms all around it's gonna be a good year for the tomatoes small berries still hanging in it's doing good looking delicious grapes continuing to grow something's getting Adam I think though but it's a sight in the first year they've ever done this I've had them for four years now put them through some trials really excited I know it's not many grapes but it's a lot better than what's been happening in the last few years", "NAj7U_lcMiA": "we have these wild grapes growing all over in our backyard up here in northern Michigan and how do I know if these are safety or poisonous now let's take a closer look it's very important to do your research before eating any wild edible here we have grape vines they're growing right up along this Tamarack tree it looks like it goes almost 20 feet high now let's take a look at the leaves see its heart-shaped has these jagged edges that's the first good sign and these leaves are also edible and then you'll follow down to the end and you can see these tendrils their forked off that's what you want to see and tendrils are used for climbing up trees you'll see them help them wrap it on the branches now the Canadian moon sea grapes will look similar to the safe eating grapes but they're poisonous their leaves are smooth rather than being jagged and they also have only one seed in a grape and a seed is shaped like a crescent moon are sort of like a banana and when you break apart say feeding grape they'll have at least two or more seeds in it and they're teardrop shaped or shaped kind of like a pear so let's take a closer look at these as you know inside grapes our dark in color will break one off see we have inside there a broken apart and you see those two seeds inside they're teardrop shaped supposed to be a safe edible creep there now I feel confident so I'm gonna give one a test try it tastes sour you're supposed to harvest them are on the fall or after first freeze and then you got a sweeter taste but overall tastes good I remember to always do your research before trying any wild edible and now I'm gonna leave you with one of my favorite video clips when we went backpacking with adventure archives was some good information Oh ever thought of it poisoned myself I mean everything's edible just some of them are only out of one right and thanks for watching up trail 71", "1daNgfxXxXc": "today marks day 41 of the great fast I've been doing it since I think October 3rd or October some second something like that it was a day after my family left they visited us for a week and the next day I decided to start a great fast and I had no intention of really going 40 days in my experience with different fasts have found that you know the best thing is to take it day by day you know if if you're on day 1 and you know you're doing a forty day or a 60 day or a 90 day fast of whatever kind then it's possible just to get overwhelmed in that that inability to go forth and to see through what you want to see if you haven't developed that kind of skill then the overwhelm can cause you to fail or can cause you to succumb to desire so in all my experience I've just found that what works best for me and you know really has led to long-term success whether it's fasting wort diet eating cleaner is simply this notion of living day to day so started on day one in December trying to do like three daily fast which didn't seem too much and three three seven ten and I just kept going and you know really I'd say the first like twenty days or the hardest in the sense that it's like wow I'm not going to eat this or I'm not going to have that you know for another twenty days or 30 days that that's kind of hard but that's why you got to kind of you know bring it all back draw it into you and kind of separate yourself from the future and instead become present you know really if there's anything I could say that fasting teaches you it's really the art of being present you know with whatever you're eating with whatever's going on in your life with time you know it's just the sense of when we're completely in the moment and we're not worried about the future and it doesn't matter if it's 40 days if it's 10 days over 2,000 days all the matters is this day right now draw it in even closer all the matters is this meal right now nothing else so really fasting is kind of in a way about purifying the mind and purifying our consciousness if you will you know obviously we're doing something on a physical level but the physical level is the most gross manifestation of our experience so we start there we start by fasting we start by not consuming a particular food or only eating a certain food for an extended period of time and that's setting the you know it's like throwing the stone into the pond that's what initially sets off the vibration the butterfly effect into the other sheets of our being so you know you accept this challenge and then what happens is slowly it starts trickling into the other areas of your experience you know your mental your psychological your spiritual and then you're forced to cleanse those parts you know things come to the surface emotions desires it's all a purification process initiated by an experience on the the grossest level of you know the 3d of the physical of what we eat and what we put into our mouths so yeah it's been a very purifying experience you know I really did not think I could do 40 days the longest fast ever did was 36 days so I beat it by a couple days not that it was about that you know the the thing to keep in mind also is not letting your ego get out of control you know it may be the ego in one that wants to go ten days and sees themself as a failure when they've only nine days it's the ego in you when you say you're going to do a forty day fast and only do a twenty day fast and you beat yourself up for the coming weeks because you didn't have the strength or the determination or the willpower to make it to forty days those are all really deceptions and you know Val's that the the ego uses to entrap us further and deeper you know their the ego inside of me wants to fast another two days so I could say six weeks I ate grapes for six weeks so if I'm giving a talk or a presentation I could say well I ate grapes for six weeks as if there's some kind of like trophy involved in that the ego wants to accumulate those trophies you know so the the part of us that is more grounded and balanced in self you know the true-self are highest so that's the part of us that has to pull us back into the reality that anything we do any experience any any moment where we put our higher self before our ego is a win you know that's that's accumulating points if you will for our highest self so yeah I could go two more days but the higher self inside of me says no you don't need to go two days you've done enough let go detach be compassionate towards yourself and really celebrate what you've done because it's an extremely powerful healing and therapeutic experience so yeah you know 41 days forty days it's all good I feel like I made what do I really have achieved a lot of what I wanted to achieve and really that was kind of many different things but really one of the biggest being that we seek to get so much of our emotional comfort and our psychological comfort or physical comfort even from so got ups here okay let's see what I got here just sorted got a book out on Amazon understanding the birth chart a comprehensive guide to classical interpretation by Kevin Burke astrology book I read a bunch of it on Google Books and it kind of hit a chord this is actually the book they use on the introductory courses at a Keppler College which is one of the largest institutions for astrological certification but anyway back on point one of the things that we all have to confront to a certain degree or another is this feeling of being satiated you know we all have this kind of void that we're trying to fill or so we feel whole and we've been trained by our society by culture by the media by friends by really everything that the main way to seek that nourishment to fill that void that we're feeling deep inside of us is through the consumption of foods so we eat foods that very sweet that a very salty that are unhealthy for us that are really a scientific coffin II of you know flavors and experiences and food scientists that put all their effort in their money because we eat these foods that they give us nothing except taste they satisfy the taste buds and you know even when you're eating healthy I found in over the years transitioning to a plant-based diet high raw you know mostly fruit I found that even within that world I try to satiate my emotions in my inner yearnings if you will soul yearnings through foods maybes through South maybe some maybe it's through eating a bunch of bananas and I think at a certain point we have to kind of learn that we're never going to get that complete soul level nourishment from the external world we're not going to get it from what we eat whether we're eating a Big Mac or eating a big mango it's you know in a way we're drawing pleasure from the external world there's absolutely something to be said about experiencing pleasure and you know enjoying the tastes of the material world but it's another one that becomes our wing our main source of nourishment for the Soul so for me this was an experience in like you know ok I'm eating the same food for 40 days or meeting the same food for however long I'm not gonna be able to eat a B C and D so then you kind of go into this mode of well what am I going to do that's I need these things and you start having to confront on an emotional and psychological level even a philosophical level what is the impact in the place of food in my life and in comfort you know where do I get my comfort from so you know there's others way is their spirituality there's through career socializing our relationships activity exercise yoga you know meditation you know Qigong whatever it is that we choose to do you know I I found that you know through this experience I was getting a lot of nourishment a through meditation which I've been practicing for for several years now which is always a source of nourishment for me but ever more so when you're in the middle of the fest because it reminds you that you're not your body and that you are something greater and that your body may have needs but the needs of your body aren't necessarily the needs of your emotions or your psychology so it helps to detach it helps you really put things into perspective and secondly I got a lot of nourishment through creativity through creative expression I spent a lot of time really solidifying ideas establishing goals and committing myself really even deeper to somebody life style walnuts which is my you know my personal business that I'm developing so I really put a lot of effort into that and I've seen tangible results you know when we eat food we feel a certain way and really what we're looking for is that feeling the food is really just a vehicle to get us to that feeling and it's been the same with you know this creative expression that I've really been putting myself into it's you know some go to lifestyle and wellness and all the things that I've done are really just a vehicle for me to experience the same thing that we're trying to experience when we eat particular foods or the emotions we try to achieve through our food and that's really the sense of nourishment the sense of being fulfilled a feeling whole complete you know so really this whole thing has been an experience in exploring deeper aspects of the human experience beyond food and exploring the other side of food what is it that we're trying to create emotionally and psychologically and spiritually and how to attain that from other sources really that's what fasting is about fasting is about the the momentary release of nourishment from food and more into nourishment from the other aspects of our life it's a practice and learning how to live a holistic holistic life how to achieve balance and that may not be the case for everyone you know that's just been in case for me with fasting one more thing to add is it's not to say that I haven't enjoyed the grapes you know I've really come to appreciate the the taste on all levels of grapes the smell the taste the texture the crunchiness the the taste of a grape and the feeling of the grape in the mouth when you peel the skin off of it with your teeth you know really if you're only in that single food you know talk about mindful eat and completely immerse yourself in the experience of whatever it is that you're consuming I've enjoyed the grapes they've tasted good some sometimes they've been lower quality but you know I try to experience and enjoy as much as I kind of that great knowing that when I do get up you know a high quality grape it's going to be like divinity in my mouth you know so really in every moment we could see everything as a challenge you know this grape is bad or this grape is soft or this grape doesn't taste good or this avocado has a brown spot or maybe this mango has you know a rotten section on it you know really that's just how things are we choose how we want to react to that or if we want to react or instead see the positive everything you know and of course I have challenges with this I'm a human being I'm working on it but eating the same food for an extended period of time or even if you're not doing it just becoming more mindful of what's going into your mouth you know trying to merge with the experience you know really looking at it feeling it tasting it breathing in between bites you know so you're not breathing the food instead you're breathing air so that when you do put the food in your mouth you can more pleasantly experience it so really there's just so many different things that can be gained from from these experiences you don't need to do 40 days you know I think fasting is one of those things you work up to it's kind of it's something that you know it's a skill if you will that you build inside of yourself sure you could go from eating the standard American diet to then doing a 40 day water fast or 40 day lemon fest but that might not be the healthiest thing you have to develop the wicked the spiritual and psychological and mental strength to go through ever deepening lessons that are communicated to you through the purification terms that one has on a fast so you know depending on where you are the the faster the the cleanse or the detox but what we do is going to be different and that's kind of where either you can do research yourself reading books part you know joining websites groups email newsletters tuning into different you know personalities within what and the other way is to find the credible individual that you feel knows something a little more than you and then that can help you you know I've done that many times on my quest I mean there's always guides out there for us and sometimes it's not a bad thing to seek support you know really that's kind of how the world goes around and that's really sort of the art of personal development so yeah you know if you have any questions about what kind of fast might be best for you or how long to do it or you know what to what to eat or what not tea any that kind of stuff just post your comments below the video and we'll get a little discussion go about it and provide you some support so I've been eating the same food for 40 days and I'm wondering have I purged myself spiritually enough but I said what I want to say to really die into these succulent persimmons I went to the Asian store a little while ago and persimmons are just they have cases and cases of them but none of them were ripe so I spent about 20 minutes searching and searching and I found two ripe persimmons I mean these things are falling apart and a little bashed up but you can see my finger goes right into it squishy that's a ripe persimmon it's not squishy like that you're going to have a chalky tasting experience and you're going to think that persimmons are the worst fruit on the planet I've actually a few years ago I had a completely unripe persimmon I had no idea what a persimmon should taste like or feel like when it's right and ate the persimmon it was absolutely horrible so astringent chalky my mouth is dry for like an hour I had this nasty flavor you know and that's just really knowing what a ripe fruit is all about so found some ripe persimmons on my mouth starting to water and my mind is watering at the thought eating is it's hard to imagine that I haven't I mean he's you know I've just started purchasing some stuff for the day and was like whoa I've only purchased grapes for 40 days I've spent hundreds of dollars on grapes and it was just kind of strange to step back and say whoa I'm about to buy something other than grapes welcome back to the normal world and I'm sure my girlfriend Gina is pumped to eat together again and make some of our awesome brought treats our wraps and salads and all that good stuff but yeah I invite you you know that's that's what I want to end on I invite you the viewer my friends my family strangers you know whoever you are wherever you are in some way haven't been brought to this video I invite you to explore the idea of fasting in the context of your life and the idea of purifying all aspects of your body there's a place for purifying the physical you know we it's hard to go into the deeper realms of healing if you haven't confronted the most gross realm which is our physical experience and we experience this physical world through this body that we've been given so really to me the first level of healing when you're going from the outside in is the body and the way that we heal the body and the way that we take the outside world in and create this vessel is through what we choose to put into our mouth first real live you realize you have a choice once you've realized that you have a choice and that this body is essentially your painting it's your masterpiece you make it what you want with what brushes you use what foods you eat if you will so start there start confronting the deeper aspects of your experience of your being through your physicalness through the physical experience and you do that by confronting what goes into your mouth so I warmly invite you to to question your diet question what you're eating you know we all know to a certain degree another what we should be eating or what more we could be eating or what what isn't necessarily the best thing for us the non nourishing habits that we're participating in so you know start start questioning these aspects of your experience and say well where is there room for improvement what can I change maybe these oats that you know don't make me feel so well but I've been eating them because they're supposed to be healthy well forget about what you've been told forget about what everyone has ever said forget about what every Health magazine and every health food store says how do you feel what is your response to that food you know feeling when you eat oats they blow do you feel like tired and lethargic maybe you should do a faster for two weeks you don't need oats four week it on your notes you know start deconstructing the way the relationship you have with your food with this way that we take the external world in start deconstructing that and looking for opportunities in ways that you can make it a more healthy experience because you know what you need to do your body is always communicating to you in every single moment there is always a channel of communication so begin opening up your give them tuning in listen to your body listen to your mind it's all connected it's all communicating to you Oh ease and when we tune into those communications when we listen to the subtle vibrations of our experiencing of our body we can then enter into more we can enter into the depths of healing our experience bringing unity into our life in a row lots of yoga's about whether it's the yoga of eating or the yoga you know yoga that you do at the studio are the mindful mindfulness practices it's all about achieving unity and harmony and our experience you know I was thinking about this earlier you know what does health mean to me and I realized that for me health truly is about uniting mind body and spirit you know that's what it comes down to and mind body and spirit body is part of that so coming and making peace with our body making peace with what we eat letting go of the things that aren't serving our highest good any longer letting go the foods aren't serving our highest good to anyone you know it's really about purifying cleansing cleansing out the depths of our spirit of our body of her mind and purging that out you know just like we purge out you get some we purge out toxins and give liver stones and gall stones and these tangible things we provide plaque that we could see in the toilet parasite we purify that all out we have those kinds of things but on other levels of spirit of emotions of psychology we need to purify all aspects of our body and it can you know at times it can be in a hard experience hard experience but it's what's on the other side of that that truly empowers us to to be a unified human being so I think on that note I am going to delve into these persimmons okay Gina's taught me a pretty good way of doing this or you basically slice it up I mean how could you not appreciate the intelligence that created this fruit look at that is that not a sacred form it's beautiful and you see the little drips that's not a little ray of sunshine I don't know what is then basically slice the skin you just peel it back look at that Wow just a little lick right where it goes Wow my god ha Wow that is good that is really good the texture alone was foreign I've gotten so used to the crunchiness of grapes that to chew on something that's not crunchy it's kind of soft it's just like whoa you look at this thing Wow you oh my god so good Oh mmm this is literally candy this is candy from God to me why doesn't anyone you candy and chocolates and sweets when there's persimmons ripe persimmon my god if you've never had one you have got to have one amazing it's so creamy and rich and sweet it's kind of it reminds me if I had to put it into standard terms or standard food comparison I would say it almost reminds me of like jello but like a firmer jello texture-wise I mean this thing is falling apart Wow so good and we want to deny children of their desire for sweets when God has given us the suits that the children are desiring but they don't have the language to express it this is what children of design this is what we're all desiring we have sugar cravings which is we're craving the sugar the pure energy that goes from the Sun and ends up in the fruit that's pure energy and we need to consume that and children need to consume that there's not enough you'd only fruit eat as much fruit as you can eat two meals a day for three meals a day to get the pure energy of the song I mean this is sunlight in my hand I mean if you seen a more vibrant orange in the middle of November I'm just going to stick out like a sore thumb if I threw it on the sidewalk nobody would know what to think it's a little alien Wow Wow and that is good that is really good so yeah post your comments below reaction thoughts you know what's your experience been with fasting have you done different fasts if you've done different cleanses you know tell us about your experience we'd love to hear we'd love to get a conversation going don't be bashful don't be shy you know I've been shy to make videos but really what it's all about is helping each other to heal helping us to elevate our experience to bring more harmony and joy into our lives and really the way we do that is by conversing and sharing and talking about our different experiences and inspiring each other and I've been inspired by many individuals I'm continuously inspired and I hope that this video has been inspirational to push you a little bit into the idea of possibly doing you know one of many different cleanses so if you have questions about what kind of cleanses to do the different varieties then how long to go for things like that post it below if you want you know a broader audience then post it on our Facebook page which is some go to lifestyle and wellness you can just type facebook.com slash some Bono lifestyle wellness and let's get the conversation going on there I think it's time that we all start confronting healing and we can do that through our through what we

being seated that's very nice but really wet it's supposed to be wet for a couple more days and I'm thinking all these things are gonna start the mold up on me or something very intact it's a pretty ripe Conchords are kind of dry sweet you'll get more rain get this done just taking off all the bad grapes put them in this pot here and I'm going to incorporate these bad grapes into the compost will

the morning to just harvest a few of these and just to walk around and eat them we put this buying down about four years I think and pruned it back a few times and this year right before we started pruning it again I saw some flower beds so I was like no more pruning weave we have flowers so hopefully we're going to have fruits this year and so here they are they are so delightful they are just drops of heaven I really love the way you know seeing starting from that green and changing to purple it's got that iridescent frosty color it's so Angelica you know it's so beautiful hmm oh just a perfect amount of sweetness I love when I bite into it this in and the flesh just separates and then the blush it's so kind of chewy and I like jelly like they just taste like candy they're just so good they taste like gummy bears that's like made with real fruit juice oh by the way you guys know that you know they say that red wine is good for you well it's actually in the grape skin that's beneficial to you who knew right I mean instead of drinking wine or for someone who's not supposed to have alcohol you can just have some grapes or 100% grape juice or if that has too much sugar you can you know just eat the skin of the grains I thought that was really interesting right you know I heard that the other day so good since this is my first time growing grapes I haven't done much research and whether I'm supposed to be cutting them back or anything like that after they're finished so if you guys have any tips for me please leave them in the comments below and if you enjoyed

the farmers market we probably could find the seed agree if you can't find the CD grape obviously you got to deal with what you can deal with if you're not gonna get no seeded grapes the next best thing to do is to get the grapes to have some kind of color you see this dark color right here this dark color they're supposed to work well on your blood now I know that the sea carries the information for the information that you need to your sail the sea carries will help but the reality is that you can't get no seeds you got to do what you got to do so you want to start dealing with something that's got the same consistency as your blood has and this dark grape has the same consistency even though it doesn't have a see it's still better than nothing so it's gonna give you something even though it's not gonna really give you what it's supposed to give me because it doesn't have a scene so you see this is the black seedless grape so you want to aim for something that's starving if you could do that right here you have the green seedless grapes so I want you to think that you got to be perfect I'm still eating because I felt a sweet tooth with my brain instead of getting a regular cigarettes there everybody good but my mainly fries here got like there and that's all the red gold Grinch not a vehicle global great or deceit a great that's really the brand that you want to look for this is right here these grapes have this season so you can see if I could get it okay can you see that seed can you see that so that has a seed in it and this is what you want to chew the seat the reason that you wanted to the seeds because it's good for your joints all right I don't need a girl for your joints that's all great but it's also good for your heart and also for your blood and even though there goes out in color it doesn't have a dark dark dark color it's still rare and still gonna be beneficial for your book so the main thing is you want to get grapes with seeds and that's the whole purpose in it to get the grapes for the seeds because this is what it help is that and you can see I've to to see because the seed is helpful for the joints I'm real active so the scene helps a lot so this is heart health this is also blood helped it's also gonna send you to the restaurant and this has something what's called resveratrol I can't spell it right now because re s v or ETA a or some light day OTO let's rewrite all a lot of people deal with it and a wine but why drink the wine would be consistent take the right here from the grape a lot of people say oh why it does me good well why nobody do you do it because it's steel alcohol so you want to just get the resveratrol right here from the grape all right this is Cochise two rocks out over get like rapist subscribe also get my book holistic milk made simple we talk about a lot of the fruits and things into cookies to get better I said I'm signing off on seeded grapes and see this greatest piece", "GLLkO1hxlQM": "fresh crop grapes hi it's John steffi for produce geek.com and we're in early June and I just want to share with you some of the things that I'm excited that are about now being in season and the first off is fresh crop grapes so Mexico often has their fresh crop grapes come into season during mid May to late May this year because of cool weather and some of the weather patterns it is late and and the grapes have just not the sugars haven't come up so we're about 2 weeks later than normal but now they're finally here at the beginning of June and some of the first varieties that you'll find on organic and conventional seedless grapes for this part of the year is the red flame and the green pearl at there will be some other varieties available especially on the greens and we'll talk about that in a minute but first off the red flame don't let the small size of this round red skin berry deter you from eating them in my mind I would much rather enjoy a grape that is crispy crunchy sweet and flavorful than a big grape that's kind of mushy or just doesn't have the right you know texture so that's why I love these red flames mmm there now that crisp pop in your mouth sweet tart flavor with the flame variety I'm looking for nice healthy green stems and when I look at the package I want to make sure there's no wetness or leaking in there and if I can feel a berry and it feels firm when I'm feeling than squeezing in the package that's a wonderful sign I keep my grapes refrigerated rinse them wash them and then they're ready to eat grapes are packed out in the field so even these organic ones you're gonna want to wash the grapes because they just have all that field dust from you know several months of growing so wash your grapes the other variety that is common here at this time of year late-may early-june is the green pearl let and these are what you'll find in the store mostly right now again small round variety some of the earliest to ripen they have a nice crispness you know fairly crunchy but they're definitely a tart sweet grape more than a sweet tart grape i would call them tart more tart than sweet they can get very sweet but then they'd start to discolor a little bit but one thing is you're gonna get a nice texture grape again I'm looking for fresh green stems does the berry feel firm and off we go there's something about fresh grapes you're not gonna get the size on these varieties that'll come later in the season and I'll show you more of those as they become available but fresh grapes enjoy organic and conventional from Mexico and also the southern growing region of Mexico in the Coachella area they're actually not behind schedule quite as much as Mexico so they're coming into season here soon peaches are back fresh USA peaches are back and I think that's a wonderful thing here I have some yellow organic peaches from California and some white organic peaches from California and the yellow and white is referring to the flesh most people are familiar with the yellow and not so familiar with the white-fleshed peach white flesh peaches can be eaten both firm when the peaches firm so it's crunchy and firm but also sweet or you can let it soften at room temperature and it'll become more creamy and juicy this one is right out of the refrigerator and I say refrigerator I mean from shipping across the country and so this is a very fresh peach mmm a little bit of crunch but just a nice sweet flavor it's low acid the white flesh variety is very popular in Asia white flesh varieties of peaches and nectarines but that's a wonderful thing you don't have to wait like oh I gotta wait for this to soften up to be just right no you can eat them right away or if you don't get to them they'll still be good at home I recommend storing them on your counter home refrigerators don't keep them quite at the right temperature so counters best yellow-fleshed peaches on the other hand you need to let them soften a little bit at room temperature after they've been picked to allow the acids and sugars to balance out so you get that right flavor homegrown peaches where it's picked at the orchard at you know in the summertime and then sold at room temperature never refrigerated those are the very very best but only a few of us are able to you know access that at certain moments of the year so most of us are getting peaches that have been picked become refrigerated shipped across the country but after you buy them I recommend keeping them at room temperature until you're ready to eat them so this one is firm I don't want to jam my fingers into it but if I give it a gentle squeeze it doesn't give it all so I'm gonna let that be out of room temperature for quite a while because this is what it would eat like it's not completely crunchy but definitely a little mmm a lot more acidic flavor than sweet at this point on the other hand this one's been at room temperature for almost a week this one's a different variety by the way this one has a little bit more red in the flesh but creamy texture already mmm that's really good it's had a chance to soften the sugars and assets have balanced out so much as it has ripened at room temperature so that's probably what you're gonna want to do you don't have to do that with the white but the yellow you do here's the other thing about early season peaches they are not free stone meaning flesh clings to the pit so you are gonna have to cut the flesh off around the pit or you know eat it off with your teeth and kind of suck around that pit at later in the year the varieties start to become free stone and then that's wonderful because you can just cut twists and the pit comes right out but early varieties particularly in June are not free stone hay fro it's best right now keep up with us on our social media share fruit with a friend everybody enjoy summer it's coming [Music]", "csKN3fVhQik": "Once the vine breaks its dormancy, it\ngoes into a period of rapid shoot growth. So, it's growing as much as it possibly\ncan before it hits the flowering phase. We started flowering close to the end of\nMay. And, still about the same period of time, it was about a two-week window\nwhere we see the first blossoms to fruit set. Every flower part has the\npotential to turn into a berry. And, so what's nice about grapevines is because\nyou have so many flowers in one very small area the rate of fertilization of\npollen, of pollination is very high. We don't necessarily need bees. We don't\nnecessarily need any other insects to assist with pollination, because you've\ngot all of these flower parts in such close proximity. Once it hits flowering,\nnow it's got to support those shoots, those leaves. It's still got to grow a\nlittle bit more and it's got to support X pounds of fruit per vine. After\nflowering happens, after all of the little individual berries that are going\nto be pollinated are pollinated, they start sizing almost immediately. They\nquickly move through sizing. And, what's happening there is it we go through a\nperiod of cell division. And then, that happens through about month, month and a\nhalf. And then, we go through a period of cell expansion. Because this year has\nbeen so cool, we're fairly even as far as heat units or hours of warm\ntemperature basically. So, in the two Appalachians in Alexander Valley and in\nthe Russian River Valley, generally speaking, we don't see\ncabernet blooming at the same time. We see chardonnay blooming in\nthe Russian River Valley. Flowering happened a little bit quicker in the\nReds which is is nice because what that will ensure or help to ensure, is that we\nwill have nice uniform sizing and then nice uniform ripening. You know what's a\nlittle interesting tidbit on the flowering is they do smell. And, the\ndifferent varieties have different scents to them. My personal favorite\nactually is chardonnay. It isn't cabernet as much as I am a cab gal. But, the\nchardonnay, the merlot, the petit verdot, the cabernet--they all have very distinct\ndifferent odors, smells to them when they're flowering.\nVery, very light, very delicate smells.", "R_-LyhFkpRA": "my grandfather started farming when he moved from Armenia and my grandfather passed away early when my father was in his early 20s so my dad took on the responsibility real quick well I chose to be organic because I got tired of using all these chemicals of the smell and then once you go through there and spray you can hear pin drop you know and then I was starting to have children and I didn't want them to be exposed all that stuff that I was saying we were young we're playing throwing dirt bombs and playing house in the fields and he noticed you know the signs you have to put out and so many three seven day 10-day reentry's to go in the field and obviously if that's such a big deal just to walk in the field then you know obviously there's not too much good that plays out on that my company is labeled three sisters because my parents had three daughters being a woman farmer is pretty unique because most women don't like to get dirty you know little little dirt don't hurt is how I see it that's very important to walk your fields each day I wish I could walk every row each day but every morning I try to either I walk or I get on my bicycle instead of riding around in my pickup truck and I'll take a row and just check on each block in each field you know a lot of people would like to pick early you know I know I have farmer friends and they're just like oh I'm done I'm all boxed up and I'm picked and yeah the roots of quality like you harvest it and you know because they be quicker the better for them [Music] how long do they typically sit here and rise normally 10 days and this is you know different farming you have to come out here and know this is this is how you can tell this is ready yeah this is ready to be rolled sometimes you get Pickers and they dump the grapes on there and they're stuck then you got to go in there and just move them around make sure you know they're on it this is a skillet they got to kind of be all open my organic raisins have better quality than the other reasons that you get in the store because of the integrity and the patience that goes into growing that product the health benefits in my raisins are it's a natural food it's a natural sugar and it gives you a lot of energy you mean normally if you come in the spring time your cover crop here but you're like well where's the cover crop well there's my nutrients like I just into the soil it helps build the nutrients by disking it in because all the beneficials veterans in the cover crop the presses and of course you know ad student transputer divine also it's beneficial student pet pest management around the different flowers attract the good bug that killed the bad bug you know its habitat I think one degree has a great path for the future and now that with you know everybody's starting with the iPhones and the and the scanning it benefits the buyers and the producers because they also get their word out there to the buyers to let them know that the great pride that the grower is taking into the product and you know exactly where the product is coming from and that's what's going into your body I think it's very important to know exactly where it comes from because it's it's you you only get to live once this is mother nature's home not mahai and I'm just helping to take care of it and conserve it for the next generation [Music]", "S7oaHSYFNQ8": "hello so i was checking out my grapevines this afternoon and i noticed something very interesting that i want to share with you about an easy way to tell the differences in varieties of grapevines just by looking at the leaves so as you can see here i have red flame seedless grapevines and as you look at these leaves you can see that they have a reddish hue to them and so this is because of anthrocynins that are present in the leaves something to note though i've noticed that not all grape varieties have this but red flames see this do and it seems that thompson seedless are absent anthrocynans in their freshly but broken leaves and i'll show some more pictures of that in a minute but i have found that one of the great varieties i have that should have high amounts of anthrocynants has an unexpected low amount in its leaves but anyway this is a thompson seedless leaf and as you can see it has a lot less red hue in it here's another thompson seedless nice green clean color with no red this is a tom cord so this is a hybrid between concord and thompson see this and you can see the hue this is a red flame seedless you can see the hue another red flame see this you can see like the red tips here and the butt broken leaf there's a thompson see this which has the white berries the greenish white berries and you can see they're absent the anthocyanins the red flames see this it has the hue another red flame seedless with that reddish hue anthracitans thompson see this absinthe anthocyanins red flames see this once again has that reddish anthracis present so at least telling the difference between red flames see this and thompson see this it's very easy with the anthracites more thompson see this red flame see this [Music] and here we have black manuka grapes and the leaves are unexpectedly low in um anthracitans there's virtually no red hue to these recently bud broken leaves so it shows that this procedure doesn't work for all varieties um here's another red flame see this you can see the light reddish hue these are thompson's aethers brother thompson okay and back to red flame see this so i hope that this helps you to tell the difference between some of your grapevines the ones that have high or low anthracitans and note that it's not always consistent as it wasn't in my manukas thanks for watching hope this helps you you", "9xV8DoqZHSo": "[Music] [Music] what's happening guys welcome to another episode of stranded view Saturday for the CCC 420 and my name is Nick today we're gonna be reviewing a really exotic Wildomar cannabis that I've been enjoying lately this is the grape jelly donut and this stuff has a crazy cross it really is just some amazing cannabis so let's start kick off the episode by taking a nice grip of the grape jelly doughnut I broke out in the vaporizer for this episode just to switch it up a little bit I've been doing you know flower smoking and then all the episodes so I decided to break out the bait this is a vapor brothers vaporizer just a standard $160 box fake that actually worked really really well great flavor nice size clouds and the high is just almost unbeatable so like I said let's take a nice grip of this grape jelly donut get medicated and taste this cannabis cheers guys mmm oh wow that is tasty oh my gosh so let's start off I guess with the genetics of this strain so this is the grape jelly doughnut it was grown by a grower who goes by Vicky's 420 on Instagram he grows a lot of cannabis for North Star I think holistic collective in Sacramento and he's knowledge some of his cannabis is available at an urban farm and in San Francisco as well and this stuff is crazy if the cross is birthday cake oh gee crosstube grape sugar and to break that down the birthday cake oh gee is a white fire oh gee some I think it's one of the phenotypes like a number three or something I can't remember cross two cookies I think and then that's the birthday cake oh gee and then the grape sherbert is a GDP cross to a sherbert at sunset sure but I believe and then say you crossed the great river to the birthday cake oh gee and you get great jelly doughnuts so a lot of crazy names going on there but they really describe the flavor and smell and it truly is a crazy cross I mean you got cooking sherbert you know OG GDP it's it's really a powerhouse you know lot of powerhouse trains coming together so this stuff is exotic for sure but as usual let's start off with the smell of this cultivar because this stuff whoa smells incredible guys it's got a very very loud sort of sweet musky woody dough aroma that actually does have a lot of like earthiness in it as well very sweet earthiness but it's just this musky doughy sweet wood eNOS that is so so exotic I mean he just almost smell every strain you can definitely smell the cookies that's one of the most dominant aromas in there and I'm guessing the sugar you know plays with in with that fuel Edo eNOS seems like the og might give it some of that earthiness and the the GDP definitely would have given some that sweetness but it is just an incredibly intoxicating smell I mean it's like a twist on cookies a crazy twist really has that cookie dough we bunk in the background but you know this really sweet musky wood eNOS that is predominant as well since I got the vape out for this episode let's let's assess the flavor next because this thing really provides excellent excellent flavor with flowers all right cheers guys oh my god silky smooth Wow and the flavor is very similar to the smell it has a strong strong cookie dough eNOS in the background for sure really really coats your entire mouth I mean I can just taste it strong really that muskiness and it has that sweet earth as well really really strong flavor I forgot to say again I think the smell for this one is just enhanced hands-down 10 out of 10 for me I love the smell and the flavor I mean it really has to be a 10 out of 10 as well cheers guys and the looks of this stuff is just insane as well I mean I I'm a huge cookie fan it's probably one of my favorite strains and any cookie varieties or cooking process I'm always you know looking for them and this stuff is just crazy looking with the combination of parents come going into the strain you know it really has this beautiful cannabis beautiful colors amazing trichome coverage it's just totally exotic looking the nugs themselves are I would say a little bit like og a little bit like cookies they're you know tight tight calyxes for sure not as pronounced as OG but it sorta has an OG nug structure but in terms of the color there's just a crazy crazy darker purple color throughout I mean in the inside of these nuts are just completely that beautiful like gemstone amethyst purple that's what it is as an amethyst purple and it's just a crazy contrast between sort of the that you know true green contrast with this this amethyst purple that is just remarkable there's sparse pale copper pistols throughout the nug and the tricone coverage on this stuff is just beautiful I mean big large trichome heads they completely cover everything they gleam in the light and when you break this stuff open it's just that pure amethyst purple you know absolutely encrusted with trichomes just gorgeous it really has an incredible color I mean for it looks at once again it's just a 10 out of 10 all right now let's assess the high this strain and I can already tell you I'm definitely feeling the effects but I love this vape it really you know it's it's it's nice to take a break from combustion for sure with flowers the vape this thing gets you so high I mean it vaporizes all the terpenes all the cannabinoids it gets everything you know sometimes when you're combusting cannabis you're burning off some of the terpenes this stuff just vaporizes it and you can feel the effects the terpenes you know working with the cannabinoids the entourage effect you can really feel all the effects of the constituents in your medicine and this I love this fake it's it's really a nice way of medicating so let's take another draw here and assess the high of this stuff all right cheers guys Wow the highness tough guys is so nice it's very very strong cannabis it really has a potent indica stone for sure you know three of the actually all the parents sorry all the parents are just pretty much indicas cookies oh geez sherbert and GE P are all just heavy indica so you put them all together and you get a crazy high very very relaxing effects definitely dropped your eyelids big-time I mean it's got me my muscles in my body just feeling so warm and good then I really recommend this cannabis for you know afternoon use to evening use tonight use because it's very very relaxing very sedated produces a very happy indica stone that's gonna leave you very relaxed feeling good uplifted mood and just really really chilled out mmm tastes amazing well I hope you

fungicide any pesticide on my crepes even on my fruit tree as you can see I'm on my balcony and in this part I got lots of grapes and my crepes are really healthy there is no any problem there is no any fungus there is no any insect as you can see this is a great result and every year I can harvest tonne of grapes on my grape ones and that's a lot of grapes even I'm gonna to harvest them when they are unripe and we make we're juice with them and that's we use for make a food you know we're juice is something we use for some making food and that's all really good for your body and then it has lots of antioxidant vitamin C and some other items as you can see all my grapes are so healthy there is no any problem even though I didn't use any fertilizer and fungicide even I didn't use so for in this year I'm gonna to use it and I'm gonna to share with you oh I'm used so for for my crepes honestly I couldn't find out in spring till now so for natural so for not a chemical sofa I find out I found out and use the chemical sulphur for my roses but that doesn't work because of that I tested on my roses pressed for check it works or no but that doesn't work and because of that I didn't used for my grapes you can see his bunch of grapes or honestly Nach in natural way I just use the menu eggshells banana peels compost and ash wood is all things I'm using for my grapes for my fruit tree even for my host plant and seedlings as you can see all these part of my balcony has a lot of grapes and tonne of grapes you can see just in this part what's in natural so for I won't make a video about that and I won't just make a video explain was natural sulphur and hope that works honestly that just produced the gas or smell and that not cannot take effect on your plant and that's not soluble on your plant and the soil if haven't you sprinkle that's over on the soil that is not so label but chemical so for is a label I use that for my roses but that doesn't work and you can see my process is not healthy in this year I cannot get good flowers on my roses just because I don't use the sofa and I want show you my other part of my grapes and in that part I can't approve I don't use any fungicide and pesticide why in this part my create are healthy in this part air conditioned is a great and sunlight to even get a good sunlight and air conditioned is a really good and you know if you won't get turn off great on your great wines and you won't get a ulti great point you should prune them in correct I have a video about pruning you can check out that on my playlist oh I did my grapes and oh I got these tonne of grapes on my great ones as you can see I met a some trailers for this part for next year next year on those branches I can harvest some grapes and that will be so beautiful you can see this is another part and the this part is a full of grapes and another part two and C so let me to go down and I want to share with you my problem on this part you can see this is a fungus on my grapes can see called remelt oh and the whitefly is a big problem in this area in those area has a dry water out the window and the whitefly is a big problem for great ones in some some area as a high level unit black spot is a big problem for great points you can see in this part I lost almost all my grapes you can see that's it those was flowers bunch of flowers and they cannot turn to fruit again see this is why I'm gonna to use the sulphur on my grapes and easier I didn't use it and you can see it happens to my grapes I'm not upset about this because it is a point for first I approved to you I don't use any fungicide on pesticide and second I'm gonna to use a sofa and I will show you how it works even in this bad situation you know fungus we suppress on your grapes so fast if you don't treatment with them other grapes will get that fungal and that powdery mildew don't let you harvest any grapes you can see honestly let me to tell you something I was an engineer of computer 25 years I'm in front of computer if I want make video for just making money for sure I'm gonna to change my content I just create this channel for share with you and other people my experiment about gardening I've been in many one yard around the world French and it Holly even other state in United State you know one of my family has a big winery you know if you want you can check out Dario's winery is a big wine your winery and has a big one yard in California and other state I've been in many one yard and I know all of them use always fungicide and pesticide for their great points I'm not really agree with that and I don't like to use any pesticide and fungicide even those are organic I don't like to use it because I don't know where they're come from you know if I'm sure about the product I'm gonna to use it but in this case honestly five years ago I used many even chemical fungicide and pesticide five years ago when I start gardening in my dad garden that you're honestly all these grapes had this problem and I use many fungicide and pesticide in that time but none of them works for me so I try to find out something and I find out so far and when I used so for honestly all the problems all fungus and insect I never find out on my grapes because of that I recommend to you an even older gardener to use it even for vegetables and other fruit tree that really works I'm going to use it and make a video about this and we can see at the future what happened to my grapes I can solve this problem even in this time with the so for I will make a video about that thanks for watching me I hope you can find some new have a beautiful day bye for now see you", "R-yA16DJDtA": "[Music] types of grapes grapes Vitus SBP are an often overlooked yet desirable plant for an edible garden cultivated for thousands of years grapes are easy to grow and produce fruit for a relatively long period each season vigorous vining plants grapes come in almost 8,000 varieties all falling within two basic groups these are called bunch grapes and muscadines with each group divided into subcategories all varieties can produce for many years but it's important to choose types adapted to your climate and growing conditions about Budge grapes as their name suggests bunch grapes produce their grapes and large clusters with grapes attached to stems that eventually join with one large stem to form a bunch bunch grapes come in two basic types called American grapes be itis lav Ruska and European grapes Vitis vinifera although both can grow in US Department of Agriculture plant hardness sown six through nine with some variation by cultivar American grapes tend to be more tolerant than European grapes while European grapes are best suited to warm dry conditions such as those found in the Mediterranean region of Europe many cultivars of bunch grapes have been developed by crossing American and European grapes to produce hybrids which embody traits of both parent plants examples of bunch grapes [Music] examples of American bunch grapes that work well in a home garden include Vitas lab Ruska Concord which grows in USDA zones 5 through 8 introduced in the mid-1800s it has blue black grapes with seeds that are mostly processed into juice jam or wine although they're all so flavorful when eaten fresh European grapes are commonly used in commercial wine production but can also be grown in a home garden examples include the variety chardonnay Vitis vinifera chardonnay a golden grape that's a vigorous grower making it useful for screen plantings and known for its sweet fruits Morello Vitis vinifera Merlot is another good choice for home growing with clusters of purple grapes and foliage that turns gold and yellow and fall both of these grapes grow in USDA zone 7 through 10 several hybrid varieties also do well in a home garden a cultivar called Blanc du Bois is a good example of a hybrid produced by crossing European and American grapes it withstands heat and humidity well and his extra resistant to disease producing grapes usually used to make wine it grows in USDA zone six through 10 another hybrid cultivar called heme rod has seedless golden yellow grapes that can be eaten fresh or dried to make raisins this plant grows in USDA zones 5 through 8 morning [Music] some great varieties such as Concord might become invasive in certain parts of the United States control this tendency by cutting back vines annually and removing any seedlings that appear where unpick Grapes dropped to the ground about muscadine grapes [Music] muscadine grapes also called Scuppernong grapes are native plants in eastern North America with grapes that usually have dark purple bronze or black skins in a softer pulp than Bunch grapes the grapes grow as small groups or clusters rather than forming large bunches and tend to have a musky flavor unlike Bunch grapes all varieties of muscadine grapes have seeds some muscadine varieties [Music] among the varieties of muscadine grapes available for home planting the cultivar fry has brown skinned extra sweet grapes coward has blue-black grapes on vigorous finds that also tolerate heat well while scarlet has reddish grapes that are mild in flavor its vines are also heat tolerant and have good resistance to diseases these three plants grow in USDA zone seven through nine a cultivar called black noble is a bit more tolerant of cool weather growing in USDA zone six through ten it has purple black medium sized grapes that are especially good for winemaking [Music] you", "hEB8sxRqahw": "what our hybrid grapes and how do they differ from traditional wine grapes traditional will say high quality wine grapes come from the family of Vitis vinifera so you think chardonnay think merlot think of that family in the late 1800s there was a scourge a root louse falaka that came and decimated pretty much the vineyards all around the world and especially the vanilla a grape at one point there was a hope that we could in fact grow grapes without this little root louse killing the plants from the from the bottom up and folks began to cross the traditional I'll say European varietals with grapes that were native to the US that maybe wine wasn't being made from the hybrids were a little more resistant to falak Syrah so they didn't have the issue and the the hybrid grapes still exist today in the Ohio River Valley there's a lot of hybrid grapes that exist here because they grow well here the climate is right for them to do well New York has a lot of hybrid grapes there's hybrid grapes pretty much all across the US and some of them make really wonderful wines it's just not exactly the same as Vitis vinifera so one's not better or worse they're just different you", "yCdQxutrHk8": "hey guys today we'll plant here monkey see this grape they're similar to a Thompson seedless grape we're gonna plant it right here by the chicken barn we have a Concord on the other side and so my idea is to build a trellis over here so I can have some shade and eventually have a chicken run over here but keep the dirt nearby because you got to put the dirt back in the Markey seedless grape was actually developed at Cornell University and it was developed to withstand cooler temperatures so you can grow this grape in zones 5 through 8 however we're in zone 8 we're actually in zone 8 a-and grapes don't tend to do very well here in the dead heat of summer so we're planting this in the shade and it should do pretty well because we have a Concord grape on this side of the chicken barn also and it's really 11 knife right now we probably won't see any fruit from this for about two to four years though so we're gonna have to be patient these grapes are supposed to be really sweet they're a white grape and they give you nice large berries and nice large clusters hey Vanna White as far as planting this goes you can plant this just up to the soil surface in the package however you can plant your grapevines deep as deep as you want and they will root from the vine as with most plants they will thrive with some compost or some organic fertilizer however we don't cheat out with our grapes I'm not sure why we just plant them right in the dirt and they tend to do really well for us especially in this area but to be fair we used to have a compost bin in this area so that's probably why for the first year especially in the summertime it's a good idea to make sure that you keep these watered because grapes tend to be a little bit sensitive when there's inconsistent moisture so I would definitely water this as needed throughout the whole year and just baby it for the first year this will be our first year trying the Marquee grapes so I'll make sure to post updates on it so you can see how it's doing however if I can recommend one variety of grape to grow it would be concord grapes they're my absolute favorite I grew up eating them from my grandparents farm if they had a huge arbor just covered in concord grapes and I just always loved them and this is that grape flavor that you tend to find in your Welch's grape juice that's really delicious and it does taste like that right off the vine so try that one out and I will let you know how this one does thank you guys so much for tuning in today don't forget to Like and subscribe if you like watching our videos we try to post a video every single day we'll see you next time you see a pretty face", "OqpWgnE4ycg": "get a I'm mark from self-sufficiently and in this video I want to show you my grapevine which is behind me here and also I want to talk a little bit about growing pruning and making new grape plants or propagation so firstly why did we get a grape vine at our place fate faces west so it gets the Western Sun in the afternoons and what it tends to do is go straight through our back laundry and heats up the bottom of the place and that heat rises and so we needed to shade that area and rather than get an autumn ental we love food plants so we decided well wanna plant a grape vine there and it's been an outstanding success so not only does it provide good food but it provides a good shading purpose and plus it hides our Chinese laundry which one missus hates but growing grapes is dead-set easy in just about any climate I'm in a subtropical region and it's pretty wet and humid so it's not a great environment for grouse but if you can get the right right grapevine then you're laughing we've got a plain seedless here it's a red variety it's a table grape it tastes great it's seedless the kids love it plus the plant has been bred for high humid environments like mine and that way it doesn't suffer as bad with Belgium powdery mildew and those type of tropical or subtropical diseases plants can get so yeah choose the right crepe for the full your environment as far as fertilizing and care goes while it's growing I might throw a little bit of chicken manure Klarman euro or a bit of blood and bone around the base of the plant but I don't really touch it too much I don't water the plant obviously especially through the wet season and through the dry season I very rarely touch it anyway because that's usually our winter and it goes dormant so now for pruning I make sure that I wait until about mid winter so even early winter there's still quite a lot of growth on the grapevine so I'll wait until mid winter when I'm sure that the grapevine has gone into a dormant stage and then I prune it back if your pruning a great bone back through its growing season it tends to bleed now if you've got the odd vine and it does then grape vines do grow vigorous through the growing season you do tend to get the odd vine that pops out in the wrong position or is growing too much and you have to trim it back that's okay trim one or two off and it will bleed a bit or SAP out a bit but what you don't want to do is be pruning the whole thing back to bare bones like that through the growing season otherwise you'll probably kill the plan I wanted my grapevine to climb up a ladder Singh and I wanted that tea unorthodox Lee go across to our pathway that leads out to our clothesline so I couldn't really trim my vine the way that you're supposed to anyway so what I've done is I've just let the thing grow and I have just trained it all the way to about halfway to the entrance and then I've kept trimming back all the buds from the stem until I had the buds in the right locations now what I do is I leave about ten buds on the top of my little wire trellis there and I prune it heavily back to about ten buds every season and that's all I do so those bits of vine that I prune off I can then use as propagation material or cuttings very simple to do grab about a 30 centimeter long piece of cutting 12 inches whack it in a medium sized pot with some good potting mix you don't even have to use any hormones or anything like that and just keep it well watered and that will grow into a new great plant you have to keep it growing for about 18 months or so and then that will be strong enough to be a de Fung in the ground somewhere else and voila you've got a new grapevine it's pretty simple so there you have it growing grapes at home not just for food but for a purpose as well like shading the house give it a bit of a Mediterranean look and maybe even hide something like a Chinese Laundry thanks a lot for watching bye for now", "HdBbDu0bwUQ": "hey greetings everyone I a mother of justice here to follow up on mine organic feed a black ray so I'm trying to do this video's and no it seems like whenever I'm ready to do a video then that's when everyone comes around so anyway I'm gonna make this quick hey so yes mm-hmm did you finish your mango excuse me did you finish your mango yeah okay so um I'm sorry y'all the black pleading organic great okay so I was all excited about finding them them jumping out at me yesterday and I did my taste test now it's been a while since i've had berries and it's definitely been a while since I've tagged CD great these grapes are a lot different than which you would find at most stores and your fruit salad that's really don't i was eating grapes really maybe in a fruit salad every now again but I wouldn't buy them from the house because I my fruit I want my fruit to have seized in it so these are the great they kind of you know they are dark almost like olives now what I like about these great notes okay I'm not as excited today as I was yesterday but I am so excited because excuse me okay okay thank you so I am still excited and my baby boy here he's excited too cuz he's eating them now he's not eating the feet or the skin which is where the nutrients are but he likes them so that's what I'm going to talk about it I'll do a taste test right now and so the first thing about them is that they can we have the perfect sweetness a lot of groups you come in contact with it's just we a lot of fruit nowadays is too sweet it doesn't even really have a flavor yay mommy it doesn't really have a flavor it's just sweet and so these have like the perfect weakness so that's what I like about them I love all of the nutritious benefit in the skin and the sea sir I'm still chillin yeah crunching on a seat now normally when it comes down to like watermelon give me one women with big black season archivos these are probably choose Truvy's agency fees for the boy I can tell them you know you can fish them out what's with them in a cup because I would like to say be seized and see you riding Roma own organic seated black race so anyway see I'm stop doing it so that's nice almost home right now he'd be laughing at me please be like you went and spent eight dollars for some great you know you heard them say you better eat every last see but whatever it's still all good you know why okay so what I what I am not exactly feeling about them or just have to readjust to is the fact that the skin is sick it's sick it's a bit tough and it take longer to choose it's not like the group that you find the regular briefs that you find regular organic creeps we're regulars you know regularly excuse me okay hold on please okay thank you so the skin is a picnic and even my two-year-old he was um and he's just you know eating pretty much the middle and spitting out this up in excuse you okay so yes the skin is very sick I'm not going to be running out to find me if I see them I may still get them and the Seas bamboo are very hard they're very hard and it inconvenient but that's a better kind of like now we are you i am ok so i'll just open this one up so you can see the seeds I see ah ok I'm not be shown as yeah she's great but yeah look I know I can use the manager ok but neither to see I see hey it's a scene I'm so excited you know we want to chew you I guess what there's a lot of nutrients in the seats of grapes ok why do you think we have grape seed oil so i will still buy them every now and again the perfect solution for me regarding these crates as you can tell i'm not really loving them but i would love them in this movie i would love them in a smoothing out put these in the Blendtec whatever else I McClinton is and I will absolutely love this skin any seeds so I'm still excited about mine or dainik like rain but I don't know we've been kind of conditioned a little bit to have everything quicker quicker easier more convenient even down to our food it's an inconvenience to chew watermelon seeds it's an inconvenience to choose you know the skin the thicker skin on grapes whatever but that's how I want my fruit I'm not a big great eater anyway so like I said like I stopped buying great but it was it was nice to find used to have a reunion with them and sometimes you have a reunion with things and you realize how you a Merry missing anything but now it's just that these are very different in taste and texture not to meet but not the flesh but the skin you know it's just different from what we've been you know used to over the last decade or so with the seedless grapes so that's what I'm still excited about this CD or granite

the trailblazers leaders entrepreneurs and influencers in the ever-moving ever-growing cannabis industry hey everybody welcome to dank discussions today we're joined by jared boudreau jared is the father of three husband of one and the owner of the lost coast wellness thanks for joining us adrian thank you thanks for having me so um what do we want to get into first we got a lot of fun stuff man you know you know i know you've been in the industry since 2005 as a cultivator and not just a cultivator but on the cbd side which is unique so we're going to be talking about that we're going to talk about your experience there um and also what you guys are doing now with lost coast and how unique it is really um you know with your genetics uh focusing on the efficacy and and all that fun stuff but you know say let's get it started off easy let our listeners know where you're based out of pay shelter cove california we uh up in yep northern humboldt very nice our southern humboldt yeah in humboldt we used to uh obviously sing is how my you you started off as a cultivator i started off as a purveyor of um said cannabis back in uh you know 2003 2004 in the traditional market so i met many a trip up to humboldt and brought stuff back down to southern california so uh very cool up there but uh you know like i said at the beginning you got started off in but can you like take me back you know with your history with cannabis how you got into it um and uh and lead me up to what you guys are doing now for sure i um let's see 2005 we were on vacation my wife and i and three-month-old uh baby eloise daughter we um we came out here on vacation and while we're on vacation we lost everything in hurricane katrina so we were in the midst of starting over in california and in doing so we you know realized since we were kind of stuck here that um you could actually grow cannabis according to the the the 215 uh prop 215 law and so we were i was like this is unbelievable i couldn't you know in louisiana you go to jail for a joint and here you can grow it and so you know and it had always been medically useful to me anytime i would smoke i would really get clear-headed i would feel better like it was medicine to me and everybody's telling me it's a drug and it's all this crazy stuff and so i ended up getting stuck in california as a result of the hurricane and then i started growing some plants but the first plants that i grew happened to be cbd because it had always had a medical therapy or a medical effect for me so i decided whenever i was going to grow something i'd find some cbd uh plants and the reason why it was cbd is i just so happened to read an article um i think it was with stephen d'angelo came out saying something about through harborside that they had these cbd plants and they were medical and nice just said well let me go grab those so i went and got the harlequin and the blueberry which had three percent at that point and those were the uh the highest testing cbd strains that we knew of um that i had found you know and i'm actively trying to research what strains are testing high in cbd once i saw the article the only one that i could find were these two in particular coming out of herbicide and so we we uh worked with these plants for years and i i wanted a higher percentage of cbd because i was seeing the medicinal effects these particular plants were having over others and so i i knew very early on the cbd thing was some things um and i didn't quite know what you know i just i'm just a contractor at this point but i'm noticing patterns and i'm seeing things that are working very well and i'm going okay so i need higher cbd so i'm just i'm always actively hunting cbd um at this point 2005 2006 2007. uh i contacted rick simpson uh via facebook i mean uh and so yeah facebook and we uh we communicated for you know months over different recipes i'm asking him you know uh have you ever used do you know what cbd is do you know the difference between indica and sativa is is indica work better or sativa worked better you know i'm asking all these questions and he's just like you put it in the alcohol you let it sit for two days and you know he is very he didn't know much in 2007 basically uh the difference and neither did i i was just simply asking the questions because i was seeing the difference between the two because i just so happened to be growing cbd first and so that led me to really be experimenting with cbd strains and be actively looking for higher cbd strains and that led me to an article with larry ringo out of humboldt had a five percent cbd and it was a sour tsunami and so i then was trying to get up here to come find larry ringo in the middle of humble you know i i've never been up here i didn't know a soul up here but i knew there was this guy larry ringo in the woods that had a 5 cbd plant and i had to get it and so um i ended up having this guy that was living with us um his girlfriend got an offer to go trim that one of the years in 2000 i want to say 11. she got an offer to go trim at a job in humboldt and so um she came up here and my buddy came with her and they uh she worked on a job my buddy started hunting for larry ringo ended up finding larry ringo and got him in touch with me i then set up a vacation with the family we drove up in the rv we came to humboldt i got to meet larry and i think it was the week after or two weeks after i got to meet him um to to talk about getting this strained he got diagnosed with cancer and i didn't even really know that he'd gotten diagnosed once right after i met him and then i basically was here for a month we went back home we sold everything i literally moved back up here to humboldt two months later and by the time i got back up here larry had died uh he basically died three months after diagnosis so then i i'm kind of going okay what what's going on here i just moved up here to start doing uh breeding projects and collect these genetics and go all in on the cbd thing because i had realized i was in the mecca of being able to grow and explore all of these you know different cultivars and just be able to freely kind of do my work so to speak and uh so larry larry was gone he ends up before he dies uh sends all of his genetic material over to uh kevin jodrey and he has uh kevin jodrey had just started a dispensary called grass and he started offering it was larry ringo's wish to basically give all that cbd material away and let me back up just a little bit that cbd material i came up here looking for larry found larry three months later i'm able to get and move up here well that year before i read the article and got up here to meet larry there was a breeding project that happened at dreddy errands with larry ringo and jaime and jaime is a guy who won the spanish competition the same year at the same month that larry ringo discovered his five percent cbd jaime won the svanavas competition with the cantatonic line and it just so happened to have a five percent as well kevin giadry happened to be at the competition and went up to uh jaime and said i need you to come back to america i need you to introduce you to my friend larry ringo you guys need to do a breeding project that breeding project happens at dreddy aaron's and that is happening the year just before i got here so when i got here uh they had already bred the um the i call them the big 11 basically that came out of that breeding project and it's the ac dc the oracle the amrita the susie q all these different these major strains that were not present um in the world before came out of that breeding project of the harlessue i mean i'm sorry the sour tsunami and larry ringo and the cantatonic line from heimi so these two breed lines come together and form all these new cultivars of cbd that the world had not previously seen that's when i showed up on the stage you know i got i basically got to humbled right as larry died and all that genetic material was being pushed out for free out of kevin jodrey's dispensary so then i started gobbling up all this material going oh you guys don't understand what you're doing this is you don't understand you don't understand you don't understand and there they were all just like yeah we do but you know we got to get it out so that people can understand what it is and so they're giving it away and i became very good friends with kevin chaudry um he's giving the material away i'm taking the material away and going breeding with it and creating different strains and stabilizing it feminizing it you know i have all these original genetics from those original lined and i have the original cantatonic line from jaime and i have you know the original uh lines from ringo so i have all of these original breed lines back in the day that i've been breeding with and that's kind of what makes my genetic line maybe a little unique because i've been kind of collecting them early on and you know like the the the charlotte's web is actually the uh ac dc it's only two terpenes difference it's genetically identical um but you know so when kevin was given out all this free material someone came from florida grabbed ac dc brought it back over there named it charlotte's web and there you go um so but that was happening at a crazy rate at that point and in 2013 2014 he's just still giving him away and people are flooding over here realizing what's going on breeding all of those original 11 into all sorts of other stuff and now there's this explosion of testing that's going on around the country and so but that's all it all started in in my opinion in humboldt county because i was hunting it um prior you know in 2005 i was looking for anybody that had cbd and nobody had harborside started testing and found the two strains that were the highest then the next person was samantha miller with larry ringo and they came out with the five percent and then the next testing with samantha miller again and that next breed line batch where the big 11 came out and and then subsequently just very within two years you had all of these other strains like shark attack and you know just all these just other high ratio cbd strains that you had never seen before now all of a sudden there's an explosion of them onto the market but if you want to if you trace them back they're they're basically all coming back to you know humboldt county for the most part i'm not going to say 100 because that would be misleading but i would say the majority of the cbd genetics came came right out of humboldt county right sure that's i mean all this stuff is you know first and foremost and i'm sorry to hear about your displacement there with you know katrina i'm sure that leaves a lot of the scars there all the way back then um you know and it's not our job to look and say oh well you know in ourselves where's you know it's it's good to look at ourselves and say wow you know this definitely happened for a reason you know for someone else was supposed to say i'm really sorry that happened man that's [ __ ] up and i'm here for you right yeah that being said you know it's like man the way it worked out for you you know the way it worked out for you going out to california and obviously not under pleasant circumstances but i mean this is like not small stuff you know i mean the the relationships the knowledge that you're able to have to to build um all the way back then and you know i guess you know for me the most fascinating thing is is you know well going back to 2005 as i said you know i mean i was a medical card and i was you know looking for the stuff with the most chc and looking to get high and whatever else um you know and obviously you know seek relief from my own stuff you know getting off of ritalin and all that fun stuff but that being said um i don't recall back then talk you know cbd is not a new thing isolated in the 1940s research you know visual 1960s 70s and it goes all the way back obviously but for me you know right now you look around the industry and it's this buzzword right obviously it's part of the whole green rush and people are going in there and and that this is what people are looking to do um but you were you were talking about this all the way back in 2005 um and uh you you could identify this if this was helping you and that's what you were seeking out was uh was high cbd um strains i mean talk to me about that this is before you know it yeah my family my family my my family have heard the word cbd more than you know than anyone and they're just tired of hearing it they're like and now they now they're just starting to go wait now you've been fully vindicated now they're like wait a second you're you whoa you were talking about this 15 years ago yeah finally but you know it's out of necessity for me too you know i was diagnosed early with add attention deficit disorder hyperactivity uh you know i you know i was given the ritalin the adderall and the prozac and i just i i you know i wouldn't take it i i started taking it i'd see how it would affect me and then i'd pretend to take it and go this is i got to change my behavior when i'm around these people so that they think i'm on it and then i it started this whole like totally having to think a little harder kind of thing which maybe was more beneficial to me than the actual medicine was because it made me you know kind of start to think how am i going to navigate this thing because i'm not taking these pills and i really need to stay who i am and then when i found weed it allowed me to really fix that you know i had bad back i had inner bowels i had all sorts of issues um and when i started taking the rso it started fixing all these things miraculously and i uh i was just like wait a second this is i was told this stuff's bad uh and it's actually doing a lot of really good things for me and i'm having this own little personal journey because nobody knows about rso nobody knows about cbd nobody knows what's going on but i'm really having these internal discussions with myself that are that are real i i am getting better i am feeling i'm not just deluding myself but i'm i'm stronger i'm more mentally fit i can remember things i'm you know because i struggled with um my short-term memory even when i was a child i just you know i had a lot of stress when i was born you know i was basically almost born dead i had a biblical cord wrapped around my neck i had food in my mouth i was basically they they got me back so um i had a lot of stress growing up and so i had a lot of damage to repair and when i started taking these cbds these new neural pathways started forming and i started really realizing how beneficial this was and at the same time though i'm realizing that you you really can't say anything to anyone about it you know if you're having your own thing that's great but you can't go around telling people that this is what it does and so that became the next kind of strange thing to deal with how do you how do you have this thing that's potentially so beneficial but you can't say anything about it and coming from a person i mean i i you know i genuinely love and want to help people um you know genuinely i don't know it might sound cliche but i really when i was finding out what this was doing for me i was really excited to be able to share it with everyone and i found out that i couldn't it was um that's tough you know and so we really need to um as a society i think we should come together and really try to start changing the way that you know we're able to speak about these things i understand making medical claims nobody wants to make them out of claim that's not true because no one wants to give anyone false hope but to share knowledge about something openly that's that to me isn't necessarily making medical claims we're we're sharing knowledge we're sharing experience with each other that that others can maybe have for themself to to offer some help through their tough time and that's just a human needs that to me is a human desire to help it's not it's not the snake oil type of salesman mentality it's it's a genuine craving to help other people and and and doing that in a way you know saying the right thing at the right time to the right people that's such a challenge nowadays so i don't know i just feel like if we could really figure out a way to at least with cbd and these new cannabis compounds to be able to share knowledge openly without it being medical claim-ish and i don't know what that means but it's yeah it is we all deal with it uh but hopefully they're you know hopefully they'll change the the legislation and it will become a food supplement and we're about to talk a little more openly about it and kind of start doing some real studies um and we're heading that way that's what's you know it's what's really exciting um i see the future is just so bright with all of this you know i got in i got into this with the cbds and the medical applications um but little did i know that those same plants would be able to transition into our industrial applications because they have a lot of the hemp desirable traits in them so they get really big and tall and they have fibrous and they have lots of herd but they're also producing terpenes and compounds for medical applications and so the to use these old strains that i have and mix them with new things and to develop super plants that can provide more cradle cradle applications um for industrial applications from building wood and to hemp creek to being able to produce different compounds and different terpenes and you know different types of bedding and different you know all or different types of products come out of a singular plant that's exciting to me so i'm i'm actually in negotiations with some some companies now to try to go through some of that material um the the hemp material that can can transition you know into many industrial applications wow and i know you guys there you know so you know uh lost coast wellness you guys are not only that but dealing with the atc um doing there with the you know we talk about having to navigate and having to watch what we say and we all have to deal with that obviously you know because um like you know we're talking about it it really sucks right because uh we can use this um you know these case studies and and there's research being done in other places and there's a lot of research being suppressed and a lot of as you know grant's not being funded and um you know and we're talking about um you know people need to get there they're cut before we're going to be able to be able to talk about it freely but you know you you guys they're actually um getting your labels approved by the louisiana health department can you kind of talk to me what that process looks like um and how even more difficult it makes to navigate and even even the normal i guess yeah well it's it's interesting i've i've been through two different permitting processes we've we've got a we went through a medical cannabis permitting process in humboldt county which uh took three years and so that that was probably the hardest most regulated um thing i've ever had to deal with in my entire life by a factor of a thousand um in terms of the the farm set up the the recordings that we had to keep in terms of the security and it was just it was ridiculous so we went through that and so we were kind of trained in that medical cannabis regulatory environment and then we transferred over and in that environment we're able to say a lot more than we can in the hemp environment because we're in medical cannabis we're in a regulated state it is so regulated and that's why we're able to say a little bit different things having said that when we transitioned into national hemp we were kind of already trained on the protocol and not only were we trained on the protocol for medical cannabis you know i think that's why we were able to get our permit uh faster than maybe most people because we were already trained to the regulations for medical cannabis and we took that approach with him in medical him everything that we are doing with our hemp company is fully registered to the atc and the health department and so having to go through those departments and being national we have to follow completely different guidelines than our medical cannabis so you know we can't say a whole lot when it comes to the national hemp company we have to really keep it very broad and open and simple and um and so but that process was much easier um in terms of the the red tape i guess of getting the actual permit and going through the process took us only about maybe a year a little less than a year whereas the other one took us three years and just every day you know multiple people on the project to get it done um so it's kind of a you know on one hand it was much harder in medical cannabis but you could say you know what you're doing on the other hand in on hemp it was a little easier to get the permit but you can't say kind of what you're doing so it's a that's the game that we're we're trying to deal with at this point is what can we say how can we say it and um you know and it's not about tricking uh the health department or anyone it's about being in this completely honest and education and educating people about what this is because we're let's be honest we're conducting a very large experiment right now and while we're having all these amazing um benefits we also need to be honest about looking for things that that may not be beneficial as we go through this experiment and that's just you know you know i think that's any anyone that's honestly looking out for the betterment of the people is going to take that approach um over their profits you know i i recommend products all the time to other people that are not in my company and i don't make any money off of but i know they they are closer to that person they can get to them faster or for whatever the reason is you know our business plan is to educate and to really empower people with the plant as much as possible and to really gather as much data from that open process as we can so that we can then share that information back with the public in in a way that drives our efficacy even higher and it just helps more people get off of opioids yes yeah no it sucks you know it really does suck because you said you know people who can benefit and we're sitting here playing the waiting game because um you know people either get a slap on their wrist or you get uh you know your property's taken out you know completely and you know so so it's it's really really really tough obviously um in the meantime yeah you know those people who do need to be educated and you know we're not here to make outrageous claims it either you know we do see people who make outrageous claims and that's also disgusting you know you also see people who are like oh my goodness man you know plaster on you know what cbd will do for you and it's on their um you know on their storefront whatever else he's like oh my goodness this is outrageous you know so we're not here to make outrageous come do that we're just here to to to bring benefit to people you know who need it who don't necessarily know and like you said you know it goes along with toying this line where you know people think it's snake oil and there's people who who live and die by it and say oh my goodness it's going to do this and that and it's like okay well it's probably somewhere in between you know and um and we're going to um you know like i said it's it's it sucks you know we're waiting on i think it is it is somewhere right it i think it is somewhere right in between there there's you know it it's all about the proper applications and the the not just the proper applications but the entourage effect for that particular individual we're noticing that if we can find the genome of the plant the genome of the illness and the genome of the person and we match those we're getting efficacy through the roof now now doing that is is a challenge um so we're trying to develop strains that offer a broad spectrum in different zones um of therapies um yeah no definitely you know i guess um you know so where do we go from here you know with lost coast wellness i know you guys have you know talking about 150 you know different recipes um and you know what does it look like you know what does the future hold here for for lost coast wellness we are gonna just keep um our heads down we are launching with our 12 or 13 um major products that you know we everybody in our top sellers basically we're going to launch with those and every four to six months or so we're gonna launch another four to eight products and we're gonna be um slowly getting to that 150 number you know we don't want to create a bunch of different products that that aren't really going to sell because we're not known yet we kind of want to start slow and small and organic and really kind of grow based on sales and and based on our ability to actually move products so that we're creating things as fresh as possible and you know all of our batch all of our product basically comes from the first certified organic hemp farm in the california so all of our biomass is certified organic it goes from there to processing facility with some of the highest rigorous testing known and then from there it goes to our manufacturers in missouri where we do another third-party testing so we've we've at this point tested it three different times and then we post those uh batch tests on our website so people can see really what's in the product in real time and they can see it change a little bit as the as our formulations change a little bit and um but we're really open about you know anything you can call me on the phone and whenever you're our website will be launched in about two weeks we're doing some construction the final construction on it and uh the final approval once we get our our batch testing which is done on all of our products and everything passed with flying colors so now we have to just take that qr code and attach it to a label and then have that final approval done through the health department now that everything else is approved and then we're able to uh actually go into business at that point so uh that's happening basically today and tomorrow and then uh we'll be launching in about two weeks um we got um you know like i said we're launching with those first 13 products and we're going to be bringing more on you know we're going to be doing you know we've got toothpaste and we have conditioners and shampoo and we have packs for all different um types of therapies you know we don't want to say um anything else in that we're just kind of we have targeted therapies and you will be able to see what the ingredients uh when you check out the website kind of what they're tailored for yeah so i have a couple of questions i mean going back a little bit you know really you know a lot of times in this podcast we talk about how do people navigate through a space and you know how do people learn how to navigate to a space you know and we talk about mentorship a lot and where we learned all this stuff from and you shared a lot of that with us already and you know i'll be honest you have so much a plethora of experience like first hand being taught from like the leaders uh you know original ode you know the ogs really of this industry um especially in that area so it's you know really you know we talk about education and how we need to educate others and you have so much knowledge like i said what are your plans pass down that knowledge on to other people and on to the next generation of growers and the next generation of users on the next generation of industry leaders well that is our plan was lost coast wellness is is to be education i mean it's it's to do exactly that is to answer any question that we that we can to to be as open source as we can about our products and and if if you know if you want to know what's in it you want to know the ingredients because you want to make it at your own house then go for it you know we're not the we're a lot different of a company we really just want to spread knowledge and and the education behind this plan and we feel an educated person as an educated consumer an educated consumer is just going to help us all you know so um our goal is to really educate i mean it's to to you know yeah i've noticed in this i've been doing this for a while i know a lot about a lot of different things and what i do best is when someone tells me what they want to know or tells me where they are in their knowledge and i can kind of speak to that more than me letting everyone know how smart i am about whatever you know that doesn't always resonate you know in certain crowds maybe but i kind of speak to what do you want to know what what do you what are you interested in what direction do you want to take yeah and then i'll feed that i mean that's kind of what we talked about before the podcast it was kind of you know a lot of times i um you know turn uh pull back the current a little bit you know i really uh you know once we let the podcast start then i you know kind of take a more direction but you know i really want uh my guests to be able to tell me their expertise and everything that goes on and everything like that so that i can properly prepare the the pot you know prepare the episode um but you're like let me know what you want to know you know and uh and there's so much there's so much here that you have you know really like i said it's it's really uh it really is unique like i said a lot of times we've been focusing on cultivation people like been doing it for 23 years and even focus on a different side and so much education with that so i really appreciate that you know we talked about some of the problems with navigating obviously through the business through the approval stuff through the through the through the song and dance [ __ ] what we can say what we can say um you know the applications all that and you know talking about now you know by the time this is live you guys are going to be completely live right so tell me like what's been that biggest barrier uh you know aside from those applications all that stuff finally getting everything up and going all this work all this all these years of preparation and you guys now are bringing this uh you know this high up efficacy um high yield and what you guys been focusing on for so long to it what's been the the biggest obstacle there to to bring that to fruition bring it to fruition the biggest obstacle that's a great a great question i i would say myself and and making uh this you know there's just a constant drive for higher efficacy is just set us back um a while and i feel like it's all been good at the end of the day um but we've really have formulated these recipes based on so much i mean it's it's not just putting some cbd in a cream and putting it on the shelf yeah i mean the ingredients that are just wrapping a label on something on another person's property okay you know that is what it is right i don't want to poo poo the whole thing and all that stuff but you know what i mean it's like um you know i really do totally and there are great people doing great things out there um we i don't want to diminish their products because they they work great we've just taken it to another level and we are calculating the bioavailability of all of the ingredients within our product and then the cbd in with that and the absorption rates of the skin that it's going on in the different locations and and so there's a little bit different um level of why our products work i mean they work because they work by design and it's years of making them work and not just putting things that seem like they'd be good together in a product and then putting it on someone our products are designed for specific things and so when they go on you they do that thing and me wanting it to do it better and better and better led us to finally launching in the next two weeks and not doing it three years ago when we were legally able to so the biggest obstacle i would say is you know would have been us because everything else is mechanical it's do your job you know wake up every day make the right phone calls you know stay diligent those are all mechanisms of good hard work so the other outline factor of that was just creating the products that we felt a thousand percent confident about putting out in the market knowing they're gonna work and knowing we were gonna it was gonna catch fire as soon as we release these products and so that's that's been probably the hardest part i mean you know everything else is work and and you got to be in it uh to win it you have to be in it regardless i'm in this to help people i don't care what the laws say i don't really care what kind of obstacles you put in front of me we are going to help people period how long will it take to help people you know that's the question it you know what is the government going to allow us to happen quicker or slower does it matter but we're doing it regardless we're not going to give up even if our margins go down and we're barely making money we don't we've designed the company to barely you know it doesn't doesn't require a lot of infrastructure uh it doesn't require a lot of money to keep it going and we've designed it that way with our partners so that we can always be able to supply product to people regardless of of anything that's our goal in doing this it's not to make money making money is obviously a byproduct of what we need to do to keep the business going but it is not our motivation in the least you know it it's about getting the product that works to people that need relief that want help on things that don't want to spend an exorbitant amount of money to just feel good i mean that's kind of like a human right to be able to make yourself feel good and to share that knowledge with your neighbor to help them feel better you know and so that that's just i don't know that's where we're coming from oh yeah we just want to help very self-aware answer you know in terms of um you know sometimes ourselves holding us back and wanted but for the right reasons right wanting to do things the right way um and not jumping into something when before before we're ready before we put our best foot forward definitely um you know that's right that's the challenge [Music] definitely and um you know that leads me you know you gave me one self-aware answer and you know this is my favorite question here you know it's uh so looking for the good one because i know what kind of person you are it's just very simple what does success look like for you um whether in terms of personally professionally existentially uh and what's your definition of success my definition of success is a happy family and not stressing over work every day i understand stress stressing over work because of issues and things like that because things pop up and dealing with it but just living happily have a happy family happy kids happy wife everybody just enjoying you know their time here that that's that's you know if i can do that um i'm a success if i can outside of my family if i can help people feel better and and be healthier that's a success and so you know and if i can educate people on how to help other people help other people then that's just even further uh success i love that i love that you know it's um you know we're only here for a little bit of time right and we have to make the most of it we don't know what's going to be but one thing we can do is we can leave a good legacy we can teach our children the right way and we can make sure we're happy they're happy like you said you know business isn't easy all this stuff isn't easy it can be very stressful you know being able to come home every single night and and families seeing us happy and making sure that things are properly placed in the right way meaning um you know we're very lucky you know we're in a we're in an industry that we love that we're passionate about that we've uh you know been in for a long time and sought to stop change for a long time and now we're seeing it happen and change is slow and sometimes frustrating and pisses us off and there's stuff out of our control that we can't you know that we can't change but you know what we can change is how are we at home you know are we coming in with that with a smile are we making our our loved ones happy are we are we showing them the right way to live in the long term so i really love that that is that is amazing it's very good jared you know um as we close how can our illusions find out more about you find out more about lost coast wellness and actually before that you know i want to actually what does lost coast mean right on the west coast so what is this lost coast and lost coast it's a shelter cove has been nicknamed the lost coast um it's hard to understand until you get here um we're about let's see 45 minutes from garberville which is the nearest town of probably 1500 people or so our town here has about 700 or 800 residences and only about maybe 350 to 400 full-time residents so it is a very small town we have three restaurants you know we have a fishing we have a beach we have it's a it's just magical place and it's we have 26 miles um of uh coast trails that are just unbelievable and um it's been coined the lost coast because it's kind of hard to get to um we have an airport in our front yard basically with an einhold golf around it golf course around it and you know we're right on the ocean so it's just a in a magical place when you come when you come down you have to go over the kings range which is 3 000 foot elevation and when you come off the top of that and you start coming down it you can it's just a magical place it's hard to describe other than just saying those cliche words so if it's magical and all that but when you get here it's a different you know only certain cell phone carriers work you really really feel like you step back in time to a slower kind of pace everybody says hello it's really a really nice i don't know how to describe it except for it's kind of just very relaxed very chill vibes you can make your own pace out here it's very beautiful amazing you may not find much um cell phone reception but maybe find some uh some sea lions and you know beautiful coastline everything like that so amazing man so absolutely and we have vacation rentals you know we have vacation rentals that we have out here part of why we call it lost coast is we educate people coming out to the lost coast shelter cove they want to learn about whatever it is from cbd genetics to making their own rso oil to making their own salves they set up an appointment with us we get that they can we have access to over 25 vacation rentals and we get them lined up in a vacation rental and my wife has a sound and yoga studio here and they do all sorts of you know retreat type of uh events where you know people come out they'll give them a sound bath and give them a yoga and we'll educate them on how to make an rso or something or different genetics and maybe they're sick and they want to stay here and just kind of go through the process for a month so we have access to that kind of environment where people kind of fly in or they drive in come stay for a month or a week or two months and really get first-hand kind of course on their new alternative medicine or modality or whatever they're working on and so that's why we call it the lost coast i know it was tragic that brought you you know from louisiana and no offense to louisiana obviously but you definitely sound like a california guy nordica guy you know um very good so now now um you know we'll go back you know so as we close how can listeners find out more about you about

for us in the vineyards the plants are starting to wake up we break dormancy the buds actually start to push and what we call bud break and that's a great growing phase there's a great growing time right there for about two months and then we really get into we segue into a really critical point in in the growing season where we have flowering and flowering is a really important time because that's the segue for the vintage so we call it flowering because it really is the point in time when the the grapevine actually flowers it sets flowers and each one of those flowers that is formed ends up pollinating itself and ends up being a single berry it's really critical for us to have a really nice even keel of temperature we're looking for something in the in the mid 70s early 80s we don't really need we don't really want rain it's we don't really want a lot of wind a little bit of wind is okay because it blows the pollen around it's a natural form of pollination but what we don't want is which kind of what we've been having is some some uneven temperatures and a little bit of a rain spell here and there and what that can do is that kind of disrupts the cycle the the growing cycle that we're looking for the flowering process and we want to keep that nice and smooth and even and that really will allow us to set a really good crop so cool weather during flowering has a tendency to give us a smaller crop and what I mean that it would be less less fruit per acre on an acre basis so if we're normally bringing in four tons to the acre we would be bringing in a little less than that with this cool weather that we're having but what can also happen is is in a year like 2005 where we saw that we had some different weather patterns and we were thinking oh my gosh this is going to be another light crop and then it all changed and we had this huge crop so the second half of the growing season is still to be determined we have about another 120 days to go and we are really crossing our fingers and really excited about what that's going to present to us so what's also kind of unique about this cool weather is you never know who's gonna actually go into flower first on a typical year your varieties like Chardonnay your white varieties you typically harvest those first as well so you see that they have actually a shorter growing season so they'll actually flower first followed by Merlot you get some Petit Verdot in there and then you can always count on bringing in our Cabernet Sauvignon in the end but this year and our higher elevation vineyards where we have some great exposure and great heat units up there we have flowering taking place up there where we also have flower taking place in the Russian River and the Chardonnay so where our window has shortened as far as what's flowering at this point in time but it's been dragging on because of the cool weather when you look at on a longer plane so what we're seeing is is Chardonnay and Cabernet are actually closer in flowering than they would be on a typical year", "6EoL-4IQE3Q": "This is the High Density Espalier Gardener And I am going to be showing you An update on my little Mini-Vineyard The last time I had shown this little area That I put together I had 10 different kinds of Grape vines Now I have 14 And on the last video I didn't say what the dimensions were On this one I would like for you to see How much I have planted in a small area I say High Density because I am putting a lot of different plants In a very small area And that will be true for all Of the videos that I post Here at the end... By the way Its important to note that The Grapes come out at different times So that you don't have All of the Grapes all at once You have actually a nice long Season of Grapes If you get a good mix Here on the end I have a Perlette And the dimensions are From this post To this post From the top all the way across It is about 10 feet And from here, this post, All the way to the end Is about 20 feet I am going to be planting 3 more Grapes That I have on the end And they are potted still At that point The total area will be 10 by maybe 25 or 26 feet I have the Perlette here I have a Cabernet And by the way Of the 14 I have a really nice mix Of table Grapes and wine Grapes And since I have no plans of making wine We are going to have just a lot of table grapes Some seedless and some with seeds Here I have what is called A Blueberry Grape It has very strong hints of Blueberry in it Its actually a patented vine And very hard to find But soooooo worth it They are delicious Grapes Next I have a Merlot And by the way All of these are Trained in the Cordon style Meaning that For example Just like I showed you With some of the other videos That I have The vine grows up And then directly across And that is considered The Cordon style Of Espalier And Cordon style of Grape vine training And all of them As you can see all the way across All of them are trained in that same style What I am doing though I am doing a slight modification In that I am doing from the base I am doing one row of Cordon Then I am training it To have a second row of Cordon as well And then for example I have nothing going this way yet But this one once it starts to grow out nice I will let it come up here And then I will start to train it Along this wire Ok so next to the Merlot I have a Black Monukka And the Black Monukka is A purplish Grape delicious delicious Grape Everything that I ended up getting I am really happy with Cause they are very very sweet Very nice Grapes Here I have a Zinfandel And then I have a Summer Muscat And then a Red Flame Seedless And this one... There are several that still are not Throwing out little buds but For example on this one They are already starting to come out This one is a Himrod And by the way Many of these Grape vines I found at Lowes or Home Depot They are like $25 a piece And for the amount of money That I have spent on these I have already made my money back With the Grapes that I have picked This is a Thompson's Seedless here And this is a Venus Seedless And the ones that I still have to plant Are a... I have a Concord Grape This one is.. Oh that one... This one I am really looking forward To seeing how it gives off Grapes We haven't gotten Grapes From these little ones yet But this is called a Midgley's Purple And once they really get going The bunches are like 12 to 18 inches long They are super big And then this one is an Autumn Royal And what I am trying to do Is these little buds coming out I am going to let them grow up I will choose the strongest Like I did with this one here And then I will let that one grow up high And I will do with that What I did with these For example here From the very bottom I started training out the branches but Once they start to grow up Then you take and put it up To a certain point like that Then you start to train it Then you can let the next stage Grow up and then when they start to come out Then you start to train from there as well Ok one thing that's really important I had a little bit of trouble The first year Because I was under the impression That you had to leave a lot of the leaves But as it turns out when you are doing High Density planting Especially for Grapes You HAVE to trim out A lot of the greenery Otherwise you start to get Problems with white downy mold And rust spots Its just not nice You can combat those With different things like Neem oil and copper sprays That they have at Home Depot Or Lowes but The best thing to do is just To prevent the problems From coming up So what I am doing now is I let the vines grow out Like this I let them grow Up to a certain point And then I take a look To see which ones have Grapes And which ones don't The ones that have Grapes I leave those And the ones that don't I trim them off Because the point is You have to let the air flow You have to have a good amount Of sunlight and if there is too much Overhang or if there are too many Vines with the leaves on them and no Grapes Then it starts to block off the sun And then you have problems And its.. the Grapes are too Delicious and too nice To let something like that happen So all of that stuff gets trimmed away And I will post an updated video To show you again Once the greenery is out And they start to grow out Grapes So you can see what I mean Why I keep them actually rather thinned", "QbOkOkK-NG0": "greetings YouTube I am mother of justice and I am so excited so Bob guess what I found I went to the store today y'all and guess what I found at the store what I found a rare commodity okay I found something so rare I have not seen these in a long time I have enough what great a year okay because generally well I want my fruit to have seeds in it most grapes that you find out there are seedless every now and again you will see what they call I guess slow great in the store they usually have feet but they're usually not organic so I listen to my local organic store and it just popped out if you jump out at me I'm out organic seated BlackBerry's get a gallon of you can see organic feed it black grape y'all just don't need to understand baba you don't even understand how excited I am about this because I don't out on migrants anymore having a great for a long time and now I can enjoy some seated organic great how much were they babam some babies are people how much woman okay well well um they will 599 a pound you got to eat every last one of those seeds so it came out to 859 for small bit of glue was it's a great flick but guess what like it blows up okay these are black grapes okay which means that they campaign melodies they contain antioxidants they contain a kind of mess up his word a little bit reserved at all I think that's what it's called yeah this is this is just right here okay hello you just can't put a price on come on hey I'm excited so tomorrow will be feasting on some organic feed it black great all right peace to the book", "5ytzG86kqAs": "[Music] no [Music] welcome to table graphs everyone today on table grapes we're gonna play a game yes the game is called what's in the box what's in the box so the basis of today what we're going to do is we're going to have five random objects each i'm going to have five keys to get five and we're each gonna put an object in said box now these objects can be anything from around the household we literally just found random stuff around the house so hopefully we're gonna trick each other and yeah there's gonna be a point system by the way at the end of the game of what's in the box the loser is going to have to take a really really sour lovely crafted shot so stay tuned it's gonna be fun all right so the first object we got is this hopefully you won't know what it is all right so we got our first item in the box now and we're going to have you go first you know i'm a little nervous because i've known you for a few years now and i know the way that your mind thinks it's pretty crazy i'm thinking that when i put my hand in this box i'm a little nervous if something's gonna bite me or you know do do something you know something's gonna be like sticky or nasty so uh maybe okay nothing you're not gonna give me anything i'm gonna give you one hint alright right off the right off the beginning okay don't move fast so it's something that's possibly sharp maybe is it something that's dangerous if you move fast rules are you can't use your whole hand you can only use fingertips too by the way so uh going in at first now am i allowed to what am i allowed to do exactly just all my fingertips i'd say just fingertips just just fingertips just fingertips the nerves going first careful all right tapper top or bottom it's on the bottom that's in the bottom what what is this oh wow what this is what all right take your hand out you talking that yeah all right oh yes because you can't just keep touching it you know oh okay so all right here's the thing whatever's in this box this has like some sort of little spines or something on it like little like talons i'm trying to think of something that would be sharp like all over they know what it is i know what it is you don't know what it is any ideas what do you think it is i believe it is a succulent plant no all right all right so you're going to show me what's in the box now you want to do just one point for the scent let's do one point one point all right what's in the box a cheese grater cheese grater okay hear me out though any way that this would be laying it feels different so there's no way of actually knowing but now you understand why i said don't move fast a happy cheese grater check that out it's a good day to be a cheese grater this is a good day to be a cheater all right so uh you want to move on to the next one then so the first item that i'm putting in the box is a little overused bar of soap so let's see if he enjoys this do i get a hint for what's in this um yeah what i'm gonna tell you by the way guys we're gonna change the scoring up we're gonna have like golf rules person with the highest amount of points is actually the loser person with lowest amount of points so he has one point for not getting it right so currently i am losing yes okay so you want one hint you said one hand for your one hit i'm going to tell you that this object is something that you may encounter every day that's that's what i'm gonna tell you that's that's your hint and remember we gotta you gotta go in just fingertips just fingertips i'm gonna let you know what's in the center of the box and it's small so you have time to find it what you think it's a bar soap it is a bar itself how'd that feel felt like a slimy box my hands are clean all right guys this is what i got next it's just a little umbrella i don't know if we'll get it okay well i'm i'm actually not gonna ask for a hint this time because you got the first one right yes so that gives you the advantage yes so i'm just gonna dive right in and i'm gonna regret that i said that let's see see if you can guess what it is by my reaction is it be careful though be careful don't break oh just fingertips just fingertips yeah oh oh wait is it oh okay okay i think i know what it is what do you think it is is it an umbrella little umbrella even the even the score here even the score okay so all right because it's my turn to guess are you ready yeah let's do this so the second item that i'm gonna put in the box it's a it's a fake halloween wrap a decorative wrap all right so now for your second challenge okay would you like a hint you know what i don't i'm just gonna try to just gonna go right for it huh i mean i'm gonna try to just guess it and all right well let's see how it goes man let's see what it is just fingertips fingertips [Laughter] be careful it might bite you okay do you have a guess if you want to think about it for a minute maybe uh maybe phone a friend or somebody who's here in the studio with us you want to know honestly what i felt what's that i feel like it's a toy a toy okay i mean but like it's it's not so much a toy but it is down that line no no go ahead and think about it for me it feels like like a toy or something so i'm giving you guys like a little dinosaur toy or something is that your final answer yeah it is not a dinosaur toy it is a decorative rat boom halloween decorations on par see i felt the tail so i was thinking like stegosaurus or something yeah i was nervous to actually put the tail in the way that you would be feeling because i i figured if you grabbed that first you would know instantly he got me i honestly thought it was just a toy all right y'all but this is what i got the like the little you know it's funny already again it's time to put my hand in this box and i don't know what's in it it also worries me that we're on round three which means we're halfway through which means that you may have put something vulgar in this box i might have all right i'm all right way to be vague it's gonna be fun i'm just gonna tell you this again don't move fast don't move that's all i gotta say i'm trying to decide whether or not i wanna take a hit i want you guys to know that this game this is not easy this is not what you think you think you're you're putting your hand inside of a box and you don't know what's in there and you know that's that might be fine for some of you guys but we don't know if this thing's alive i don't know if there's a knife in there right now that's gonna cut me which would not surprise me uh it's not a knife no well no better time than the present that's what i say so i'm gonna i'm i'm gonna hold back off the hint from this round because i think if i need to hit i'm gonna go for round four around five maybe okay well put your hand in there and get ready get ready as if it's gonna seriously don't move fast though but pitter patter let's get at her oh uh uh i said what is that it's almost like a grip to my to my fingertips when i was trying to they do that they might do that okay so you know judging by how small this is you guys have already seen this yes so you know what i'm going through i have no clue what's in this box they know they know but it almost felt like like jacks if they were small and you know breakable and bendable so what's something that's like that is that your final answer no no no that's not my final answer no okay something like that what is something like jacks what's small is it is it is it a bundle of bread ties is that your family answer that's my final answer it is not oh no you ready to see what it is oh oh fake spiders just a bunch of fake spiders oh god i just started the halloween theme that you're just doing i may have a little bit of arachnophobia so that's that's ironic there it's a good choice i'm surprised i didn't get it if i had i known you know or had some inclination that it would have been regarding spiders i wouldn't have wanted to stuck my hand into that box to be honest i had more money i would put real spiders in there yeah unfortunately i know it would have been a great time all right so you want to take it out and go to round four yeah what's the points at uh i have two points nope i have one point i also have i have zero points because my last one i you didn't use a hint i didn't use it did hit dude no you have zero points it's still zero all right let's get to it so for my fourth item i have a clip-on bow tie because hopefully he will have no idea what is in this box though i'm kind of nervous for this one are you ready i'm kind of nervous not to that's a lie uh all right i'm gonna give you this all right you know you know never mind you know what you can you can ask me for a hint if you want him all i gotta say is if you don't get this then we're tied what you feeling in there be careful what you think i know it's fabric okay that i do know it might be fabric i know it's fabric i know it's a fabric i don't know like the question is what kind of fabric is it all right can i get a hint yes you can um [Music] this is something that you don't put on very often uh but when you do it's usually for something special so it is a it is a garment that you wear something that you put on is it a tie is that your final answer yeah is it a tie it is a bow tie a question should we give it to him or should we not or do we give him half a point maybe um i'll take half a point half a point all right okay all right where'd you get a bow tie i found it in my backpack man okay guys this is what i got it's just you know hopefully he doesn't know okay so honestly i really don't think you're gonna guess this one honestly i'm very afraid right now i really don't think you're gonna guess this one all right uh on a scale of one to ten how nervous should i be going into this round at least a nine oh no a nine maybe what did you put in there fukushima oh you gotta find it find what it is oh is it in the center of the box yeah it's all over the box isn't it maybe it might be okay so what's what's the score as it stands right now i believe half a point to one point or half a point to zero still no i think i believe i have a point half point to one point yeah are we at half point no um one point jade yes okay there you go yeah half point one point one point all right round five round five all right let's see which i actually i don't know if you can see i actually have sweat i'm so nervous on this round right now should be uh okay what about like a smell is that do we do points for smells you're not gonna smell it i'm not gonna smell it i don't think i really smell it so it's not cutie pie i don't think it's not the dog i'm not gonna put the dog all right is it dangerous i mean it depends is it depends maybe oh it's gooey oh what is that gooey oh all right there's no but you're not gonna what this this is the consistency of like the top of a pumpkin pie or a cheesecake but my thing is if he's a good man like i know he is he wouldn't ruin a cheesecake by let me put my fingers all over it maybe so i don't think it's a cheesecake i would also have things on my hand maybe it wasn't cold what do you think it is it was it was rather warm it's about room temperature i'd say room temperature what do you think it is it's very large my hands are my hands are clean i'm gonna say is it no you would smell a piece of chicken you would smell a piece of chicken or a pizza but it's not or something that's not a food item might be might be a food item i can't really give you that could be could not be this is this is for the game right here some people might eat it some people might eat it yeah i i don't i wouldn't but i bet someone does you know i'm gonna have to go with some kind of gelatin because i just the way that this feel without knowing what it is it's like it's like tapping the top of a jello is that your final answer i guess that's my final answer you were wrong what is it slime slime what it's oobleck oh it's just like like an actual like slime it has a bit of a scent actually oh my gosh okay so for my round five item i've chosen to fill the tub with these solely music tees [Applause] so let's hope that he has no idea what to think how do you feel about round five honestly now it's like the last round i feel like you're gonna put something crazy in there the thing is i know that one of us after this round is gonna have to do a nasty yeah nasty sour shot uh worth it though i don't know i kind of like sour stuff but this will be a lot so what we have for this punishment guys just a bunch of citrus and sour stuff honestly so it's not smart but for your enjoyment and partially mine or his depending on who wins or loses probably me as always wins or loses loses oh we'll find out this is the last round last round let's get to it let's get to it all right anything you want to tell me before i check out what's in this one so what i have to say to you is that you are very familiar with this item okay and i think i think that's all i can give because i think you have a good chance of guessing what it is i think you might have a good chance of guessing what it is i don't know but you're really fine around you want to have fingertips though final round you want to do like a five second feel five seconds well well i already went through final round so oh i saw one more item oh you have oh that's right we did fourth round i'm one round ahead all right yeah i say we do the five second feel then five second seconds five seconds five seconds yeah all right so you gotta you gotta start counting ready are you ready ready and going in go one two three four five okay so honestly it feels like a shirt maybe like something like it feels like if you were touching a design like a design on top of a shirt that's what it feels like i want you to be very specific with your answer as be as specific as you can be hmm i must say it's just a t-shirt with a design on it i don't know what it would be a t-shirt with a design on it you heard it here first folks that's that's honestly the only thing i could think of that's what it felt like it was just true yeah but like balled up or something you know i don't know that's what it felt like do you what do you think on this uh on this one for points you think that's point worthy he's interacting with this object a lot i am we have is it a pillow i need a final answer from you what i'll tell you is you were closer when you said a t-shirt with a design on so i have you guess what t-shirt it is not necessarily you should be able to get this right off the back is it multiple t-shirts because it feels like there's a lot in there maybe is it my dirty clothes is that the final [Music] [Laughter] there's an assortment of solely music keys because why not plug your own brand right i honestly thought he was like it felt like there was more than just one thing in there so i was like what could be more than one teeth like there has to be more than one t-shirt in there so i was like where's a lot of them and i was like my dirty clothes has to be i was trying to be you know very lenient because you were really close on there this is what it is hopefully i i don't think you'll guess this i mean be careful though don't don't move too fast well i can tell it's not moving around and that makes me more comfortable to stick my hand in the box it might be moving slow maybe okay final round five seconds ready so when you get ready all right one oh two three four uh five uh again i don't know if you've ever even it feels like a piece of glassware almost like like a vase or something [Laughter] they know they know you guys know what's in this box yeah you guys know exactly what's in there it felt like there was almost like a like a geode type texture to it a geo like it was rough and some of the spots like had like a crystal type texture almost or like a like a rougher pattern texture and then other parts of it were smooth like it was brass okay um so it had a rustic feel huh it did have a rustic feel okay so let's just say i i guess what's in this box because obviously i'm stalling to think right now yes which you should answer pretty soon though so i'm gonna go with what's your answer is it a bird bath a bird bath a bird bath it is not it's not a bird bath would you like to see what it is i would a lantern oh okay okay a little electric lantern it's funny because it it's almost as if okay this is what i was feeling that was rough did you hear me yeah my little clue when i said had a rustic feel yeah yeah rusty i didn't get it though i didn't get it okay so from my fifth and final object i chose an open container of ketchup so we'll see how he feels about this this is bound to get interesting okay so this one kind of scares me because it took an awfully long time for you to get it in the box whatever it is that's all i gotta say so i'm kind of like scared on what it is now all right should i be um what i can say is sometimes it's got a little bite to it but you should be safe okay you ready [Laughter] it's [Laughter] [Laughter] instantly i just as soon as i put my hand in there too it wasn't like touching around it was full on my fingers went straight into the ketchup perfect aim you got the aim for that ketchup man yeah oh that's great so that means it looks like i'm doing the punishment yeah as i predicted all right well let's uh i'll go grab the stuff all right let's get that going we'll set it up so you can get that punishment so here's the thing guys in future episodes of table grapes we want you to write down in the comments below the video and give us punishments for our games because i'm not gonna sit here and do a shot of really sour stuff every single episode because let's be real i don't hate my colon that much there's warheads lime juice lemon juice in this my hand smells like well you know what in spite of the irony that i couldn't catch up to you so we're going to get this speed not much though not much at all we still want it to be sour it's going to be very sour but uh really don't ever do this you should put one of the yellow ones and one of the yellow and one of the red ones okay yeah because the yellow ones are pretty sour so i got here's my i'm sorry you can't you can't quite see it there uh we can show it up here put it up here there we go right there beautiful so we're gonna do one of these lemon warheads open up your red one for you uh yeah

something and you can also like you feel like doing stuff I hear a car indoors yeah like you like probably like later on you you'd feel lazy but um not right now you don't feel lazy you feel like I said really good about yourself you have ambition it's the neighbors car so she'd be good to go no it would not there's those guests that I was hoping for okay you can probably see the tree back there

everything about it that I possibly could yeah I'm glad I know jeez I'm glad I didn't get the whole gram because I don't know if it would happen you probably feel way worse like get me sick or something oh I'll put that out there's only like a putt for to it I don't need a puffer to I'm good yeah so that's my review of grape soda and it's really good I good so I'm gonna go inside and some homemade Turkey see think about what I'm gonna do next I want to do something you just don't know what so oh don't forget to Like and subscribe so that's it that's all bye", "7OLwISys82I": "we got our red candies grapes they're about 3 years old see how much clusters they ripe in October so this one has over forked 5 clusters of grapes for such a little plant over here I have this one aside a German variety I'm not gonna attempt to pronounce that name is too long for me but yeah it's this one's older obviously it's a 5 year plant it has a lot more fruits it's very typical for this variety to have this what do you get back me this is a sick look sick well you know obviously you can see the wood is quite different but yeah people thought this dry wood on grapevines it means it's gonna die no it doesn't die that that's very normal that's how it looks you know", "YgvYcAWwTHo": "greetings greetings greetings greetings I'm mother of justice okay oh my gosh okay that would be justice okay so guess what Bob will found some more organic seeded grapes okay I'll just show this time these are mom okay this is like clipping but whatever red seeded grapes organic boom okay so I'm excited about these I wasn't initially excited because my last experience okay I was okay with the last ones with the black seeded grapes but guess what I think I might like grapes again I washed some off so these are freshly washed these are huge the K these these grapes are pretty big like they are big they're not like regular no you cannot just wait a minute these are pretty big I taste it one and they're a lot easier to eat okay give it something thank you I will give you Apple just hold on okay okay here so this one I tried one already a lot easier to eat [Music] okay okay so you can see the see now stuff like this it may not be important like most people will see this video into like kind of wack like she getting all excited over some grapes for seizing it most people don't want the seeds in their grapes I want the seeds in my food okay in my fruit want my fruit to be fruit so anyway I'm just doing that video the black brakes are great and probably have a higher nutrient content because the color is so rich but that skin was just very very easy thank you and so this is perfect the taste is perfect it tastes like a grape but the taste is perfect it's easy you know easy to chew in so that's that thank you I don't know what she's talking about we're ganic seeds it's great okay yes", "f7s1RR3yQpE": "[Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] do [Music] down [Music] oh [Music] so [Music] hey welcome back to the homestead so just got the grape trellis finished up fully installed now so let's go ahead and just take a look through and review what i've done here all right so the first thing i did was set these end posts these are 4x4 treated wood and they are about two feet down and six feet up so these were four by four by eight and uh concrete down and leveled them off and all that so i got those in that's what i did first then really just as simple as setting the lines through them so these are those those wire vices i'm using so you basically drill put those in screw them in place and then you can send your wire through and i'm using a 12 gauge galvanized wire and it's really simple as you just push it through the one end pull it tight pull it through the other end so yeah it this is going to be this is a two-wire trellis system and i'm going to be doing a top wire cordon system so i'll show you that what that's going to look like just in a minute so then here's the middle post and it's just a t-post a six footer just hit in nice and solid into the ground then we got these clipped in place so they're nice and tight to the middle post and yeah you just follow this back over and it goes to the same thing over here but one important thing leave a little bit extra wire on these you might want to re-tension them down the road and if you have nothing to grip onto if you just cut it off right here where it comes out you'll have nothing to grip onto you can't retention them so uh the spacing is three feet from the ground to the first wire and then just under three feet to the next one and yeah so let's see what we've got here we've got concord grape here and this came bare root in the mail because we couldn't find it locally so we just planted these a few days ago so hopefully that'll come out of dormancy soon and come up and then we've got a flame seedless grape here this was from our local nursery not bare root but it's already got foliage so that's cool and then this is the thompson seedless here and that's that green grape that classic green grape that everybody loves and same thing local nursery and this one as well local nursery this is a crimson seedless which is also a kind of a purple red grape so that should be good so how the system is going to work it's called a top wire cordone and so this vine is going to grow up first you'll tie it off here just to keep it straight then it's going to go all the way up to the second wire and then from here it's going to branch out in each direction and the spacing is so that each one can have a three foot on either side let me put here load up what it'll look like at the final so yeah each one's going to branch off in either direction and then the fruit grows down so the fruit will come off the vines will grow down and down and you will prune accordingly and we've gone with a top wire cordon system because it's uh pretty simple overall it seems like a pretty easy to use system and it will work with the types of grape we're going there are so many different ways to do a trellis and to train a grape to grow it is crazy it's actually overwhelming uh but i spent a lot of time looking into it and just decided to go with this one so hopefully this will work out and you guys can follow along and just see how it ends up this whole project wasn't too expensive all the materials for the trellis system was under 100 bucks so that's really good and i actually have leftover materials because the wire was a roll of 100 feet and i still have extras so that's great so make sure to subscribe to the channel so you can follow along and see how these grapes will grow if you have experience with grapes any type just please drop a comment down below let me know hey just drop a comment anyways tell me how things are going in your area what the

fig hey it's John with protists Keep Calm and today for late August enjoyment I want to talk about organic grapes figs and Bartlett pears let's get into it so organic grapes our peak season from California conventional as well but I'm really excited about these organic grapes from California red seedless green seedless even the black seedless varieties they're gonna be affordable nice quality and plentiful during late August and into September what I have in front of me is actually called in Chrissy variety red so for late August you'll find Chrissy's you'll find red flames and a few others let's take a taste hmm nice crisp picture dark dark color to the skin sweet tart taste love it this is a sugar one variety on the greens next will be some esteems and others like that so the sugar ones very common and I'll just taste this variety classic green tastes sweet and just a little Tang enos underneath and some really good green varieties are coming in September big and crisp and crunchy ones check it out organic grapes Hey figs I love a fresh fig and this is one of the few times of the year to get excellent quality delicious fresh figs so these are from California this is a black mission variety which has more of a purple skin when you cut it in half you can see the insides what they look like it's kind of a red gooey Center really cool looking I typically just hold them by the stem and eat the whole thing like this mmm hmm sweet and gooey like a rich taste a little bit of earthiness from the from the skin you know the if you've had a Fig Newton you kind of know the base fig taste but that's been drei that's a dried fig so it's had lots of time to condense the the flavor and just be mostly like the sugary part but I think fresh figs you can really enjoy in a lot of ways you can slice them from salads or to eat with cheese bake with them I love a fresh fig they're very tender the skins can get cool part easily they're gonna be most ripe when they give to a gentle squeeze you want to keep them refrigerate until you're ready to eat them just playing with some fig skins on my teeth mmm and it's not just the black mission variety that's gonna be available there's also some green varieties like camera and Kadota that are really sweet in fact if you get a pack and you're looking at the pack and you see a little bit of like leaking in the bottom that's actually the figs can almost weep like the like a sugary SAP can come out that's not a sign that you can't eat it you just need to quickly wash that need it right away mold on the other hand is an issue you don't want that so check them out figs late August and September I want to eat that other piece so bad Bartlett pears so this is our first you know great tree fruit of the year for 2019 these are organically grown Bartlett pears from California where their peak season for August and then in September and late August and September is when their peak season from Washington State and they take the best of the crop and they put them in controlled atmosphere rooms and and then they can sell those throughout the rest of the year but right now is when they're they're fresh and they're best and the Bartlett pear has that classic Bartlett shape but the other thing that's unique about Bartlett is that it tells you it's ripeness stage by the color and so where are other pears you gotta kind of check the neck for ripeness a Bartlett pear turns from green to lime green to yellow to a deep Gold as it ripens and as it ripens some of the blemishes will come out but boy you are gonna get a juicy succulent sweet pear at that point so this is kind of like on its way to ripe I'm gonna call this more right than not so I cut it it's not crispy but it's not fully juicy succulent succulent yeah let me have a taste mmm those rich classic pear tones really delicious piece of snacking pear hey for what's best right now keep checking back share this with a friend and if you find some good fruit make sure you share it with a friend until next time [Music] you", "jsBLOK6_yJw": "what's up to Tang Dynasty like to say first off that this channel is for cannabis patients caregivers and

agenda today so we're gonna get right on there right away folks let's take a look just harvested of plants in the garden this is the mystery strain we've been running we're not really too sure what it is the look of a Sour Diesel nice swollen calluses [Music] sort of an OG kind of not really sure pulled right out on top really hard to make out [Music] what a nice plant nonetheless unfortunately it did have a tendency to pop banana or two here there so we are getting rid of it anyway that mother of Mary's we normally run here's some of the bugs yeah well good sized folks [Music] really can't complain and these are pretty big so really really freakin happy they all came all really good so we pulled down four hangers told two hangers in each plant and I'll pull about two and a half of those two strains and I'm really happy with that so alright folks you got more coming up [Music] they're looking terrific to our dreams Sour Diesel in the back here looking terrific get her under the stronger lights hit that small little headband coming up if the boss hogg here looking good of course other headbands for like I said we heard these two cheese quakes from Jay s main thanks again dude

wrong with the stream definitely produces some weight it's in great genetics okay probably to our backs she might be able to get a little bit more audible with some co2 but she's definitely definitely producing why we'll be taking this stuff down over the next week or two any questions or comments go ahead and throw it down we've been flushing these girls since the beginning of week six trying something new whether they have been getting a lot of organics so we're a little worried that might if it's build up in there and are taking a little bit longer to flush out but seem to be looking

greens on how our variety of Elmen takes new varieties from this to this the first is our new late white seedless table grape shown here about two weeks from harvest this varieties grower friendly requiring relatively little hand labor and it's sizes naturally to about an inch has incredible flavor and we have a new late black seedless grape shown here five weeks from harvest another naturally big grape with great taste and unlike other black grapes virtually no seed trace over the next five weeks the color will become full black and the aroma will develop and and sugars will develop we usually pick this starting in the last week of september going through the month of october both of our new late season varieties will be marketed with scarlet a-- seedless brand grapes that would give retailers strong late seizing offerings in all three colors son world uses traditional hybridization technique to develop new varieties it's similar to what bees do in nature when they go from plant to plant pollinating flowers only we do that by hand after pollination once the great berries are large enough the clusters are harvested while the grace may be seedless they do contain a tiny seed trace that can be removed in the lab and nurtured with nutrients and sugars to grow a new plants that we call hybrid seedlings the new seedlings are very delicate so they're started in test tubes under grow lights that simulate the Sun as they become stronger they're transplanted into a greenhouse and they slowly acclimate to the direct sunlight and harsher conditions in the springtime the young seedlings are planted outside in the field where they'll remain for the next four years from the time the cross is made to the first commercial harvest of a blue variety is typically over ten years an important part of the testing process is the fruit trial flavor pounds and we hold weekly during the fruiting season this is where we get feedback from consumers customers and marketers and find out their preferences on the new varieties in the pipeline but we're always looking for the next big thing and something that helps our customers differentiate themselves we're always trying to provide a great eating experience for the consumer that's very important to us", "mXotFrwjKpY": "the question arises what can you use in organic growing and the the main the toughest thing for a grape grower to stop using when they go organic is roundup it's a very addictive chemical because it lets you spray and knock down weeds underneath the wire these days modern grape growing has as you with trellis wires and grapes growing up so the area that it can't get to with the tractor is right underneath the wire once you kind of grow into how to deal with that either through mowing through there are cultivation devices that move the dirt in and out and knock the weeds down then your next problem in great growing is generally mildew which is just a light fungus which grows on the leaves and on the surface of the grapes mildew is treated in both organic and conventional grape growing with sulfur when you sulfur is the first stage itself is fairly inexpensive it's a very effective slightly smelly so it's not that popular in subdivisions the sulfur is sprayed on either as a powder dusting sulfur or as put in the solution as a liquid and it's put on grapes when they're small and green before the clusters start to close the most of the sulfur that's sprayed on will leave it'll either be washed off by rains fall on the ground it will sublimate which is the chemical word for evaporation of a solid substance it sublimates the leaves so when the grapes are finally harvested and brought into the winery you may have suffered a number of times all the way up through say the fourth of July but there really won't be much of that sulfur on the grapes the most of the sulfur that shows up in the winery and there is naturally-occurring sulfites that come into the winery most of that is in the berry in the juice that has been picked up by the vine from the from the soils and brought in to the grapes and then so those are the the sulfur basically sulfur molecules that we're dealing with in the winery as naturally occurring", "ZDXlPjQUH0c": "okay well this is a a grape trellis that I I built a spring it's about 50 foot long I put 4x4 posts buried them well these were 8 foot posts and I buried them they're 2 feet in the ground so they're 5 foot 6 at the top and then again I used the those same anchors and like I said you buy them from Amazon these are great Petrella for 9 gauge wire strung a wire through one thing I might do different is I didn't do any tie backs to it I did research on it and whatnot and they said well anything under 50 50 foot and under you don't need a tie back well the first thing I did was I I started tightening a wire and the the post leaned on me and there's no there was no going back especially with this kind of um with this kind of anchor once you typed it so far there's no releasing the pressure cut the wire and started over and I did not want to do that so I'm just gonna have to deal with the lean and then eventually I'll do a tie back but again here's my irrigation I've got a shutoff valve so I can shut it off so that when I'm wandering my trees differently than I water these I can shut off the water to to this and and just but I'm I'm well I'm a good 300 feet or better from the house so I buried a lot of line in it irrigation is relatively inexpensive I was surprised I think I put in all total somewhere around 6 to 700 feet of irrigation line because it goes snakes all over the yard here but anyway so let's go down the line here these are ers these are Somerset this is a Somerset grape this is a table grape all these back here are my table grapes so I'm kind of looking forward to eating these in a couple years and again now I got the drip irrigation I probably got it a little far Oh a maybe it may be just a little too far in whole idea about having that drip so far away is to get the roots to creep towards where the water is coming from and although this is a half gallon per hour over eight hours I do it in a day it it'll open into a wide poem of moisture that should cover the grapes you don't want it directly right on the root right next to the plant because then the roots won't want to search for water and then you'll get your root ball really will stay really close to the to the vine so this helps spread the roots a little bit again I used grass clippings try to keep the weed population down a bit I kind of screwed up on this one I have been trimming off these Spurs a little bit here are these buds that come up between the leaves and last night I was picking off a tendril and then instead I clipped off the leaf and I'm not exactly sure what's gonna happen now I made a mistake so I'm sure it'll start a new shoot somewhere and we'll have to start up start over again but this this particular one of both of them right here I got two to two lines of each type of grape on the back here and they're both you know they're only two foot tall if they're two foot tall and so they're not they're not doing too well and they're really kind of spindly I know Roy always said pencil thickness and all I can do is hope that it increases in size because even the bare root itself that I was given if you can look right here it's not even the size of a pencil so I couldn't cut it down far enough to get a pencil size thickness fine out of this one so we'll just have to see what happens again this is another Somerset grape growing you know I spray the fruit tree spray on here to keep the bugs off and and then the copper fungicide to keep the diseases in check and they seem to be doing fairly well I had some insect problem earlier in the air and that's the problem with very young plants when you only have a few buds and you only have a couple leaves and insects start eating the leaves it's like you know then you're really screwed so once these vines get established you know if they insects take a couple leaves trimming it's not gonna be any big deal anymore but it's starting a mess the hard part once you get started it's not a big deal it'll take a while they come back I'm an impatient guy so I get frustrated when when things get stunted and again these all these plants back here and I don't know why maybe it's because of this nice bush right behind it did not get any frost damage to it so the bud stayed stayed well so these were the only ones that were protected this is a reliance table grape and it's it's growing fairly well it has reached the mid the mid wire nice healthy plant and again I come out every night and I I take these little these little buds off because they just SAP strength away from the growth of the tree you don't want this to start coming out until you are ready to reach your target height and then you want these two to establish cordon side on either side one going one going this way and one going that way but we have a ways to go yet before we get to the top where so this is another reliance and it's doing even better than the previous one that Bud's not ready to be picked yet the leaves are doing well and this is what I was talking about this is the leaf that was eaten early in its development again another one up here you know so we try to try to stop that but you know there's only so much you can do I try to use a an organic spray on it and and what not so but you do what you do only what you can do mother nature is a fickle Beast okay and these are the final couple of vines here this is a NATO ice Wisconsin grape and I should probably point out that I'm here in Wisconsin central Wisconsin and all these grapes that I've chosen are supposedly good for my region this was developed in oh I think Osseo Wisconsin so we know that it is good for our region and it's doing fairly well as well and this was a cutting I actually have had this in a glass of water for Oh about a month and I just decided to plug in the ground and see what it does you know we'll see it might develop and my whole idea behind this is to plant one in between each plant and angle and use the mid mid cordon or the mid wire to just stretch the vine so we'll see how that works I'm an experiment this is my first year growing grapes I don't know anything about them I try to learn as much as I can by watching YouTube and what that so hopefully you know you can learn with me as we go but you're doing really well little insect damage quite a while ago but overall the plant seems to be doing a while I used this I use this tape this is Nursery tape at first to tie my vines and this is really elbow it's it's somewhat stretchable and somewhat flexible when you want to untie it it's a pain in the butt it does it like I said it doesn't stretch near as much as you might think so I didn't want to damage the vines so I switched to these footy socks and this just seems to be working so much better they stretch really well they're easy to untie the last years you know after these vines get established I only need to tie it at the wire you know on each side so I'll be taking these off once this vine is trained on my bamboo pole here so um it was funny because when I was pulling this post actually stayed fairly vertical that was the other one that that moved so you know what I'll do tie backs on both as I get grapes growing in vines growing and then there's grapes hanging I'm sure this will be a this will weigh on it and it will need to get tightened up a little bit but uh but that's it hope you enjoyed it", "We6u_ShZgEc": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "ioPN9UGAems": "it is a complicated process to figure out when the grapes are ripe and ready to be harvested there's there are scientific methods that you can test the sugar there's a refractometer that you can look and see but most high quality producers are actually having their wine makers in vineyard managers are walking through the vineyards and doing the good old fashioned taste test they're tasting the grapes and making sure all the phenolic ripeness is there so not only are the grapes ripe and sweet and juicy but the seeds have also hit ripeness to which eliminates a lot of the bitter the bitter flavors and green or stringent flavors that come in wine sometimes so it's not only just the scientific ripeness but it also has to be the complete ripeness of all the aspects of the great so it is a it is a complicated process mother nature has been getting her way for many years and climate have changed there's erratic weather and strange things that are happening but for the most part you have a pretty good understanding of what a microclimate of a vineyard is and historic data of when you're going to harvest so right now for example the Napa Valley is harvesting about four weeks earlier than they were 35 years ago and that's been that way for the the last the last ten years or so which is kind of a fascinating proposition so things change an altar but the vineyard managers will know best what happens in the grapes so it's a matter at this point of day-to-day testing and tasting and knowing what the grapes taste like and are they ready to go will we make the best possible wine from these grapes", "dgMqYorA6xY": "[Music] hi guys welcome back to my channel don't forget to Like comment and subscribe turn allows for certifications to be notified every single

up I do have my seatbelt on I'm not driving it's just that it's like this because I'm recording and I have these that I've never really tried I'm scared it's like burning the stick okay that was just for fun they actually lit up oh [ __ ] it did taste the grapes right off the bat is feeling like but it's going straight to my brain and I'm like sweet relaxed like just mad I wanna like stay back I'm gonna have to ask one thing holy train in my car honestly I used to think that said he was speaking for like jittery because I said like smoking too much said healer to veterans I'm already kind of like already like over the place like my thoughts and stuff so that's why I kind of like for my own hybrid aside so I just like but I think the reason why I think desti bizarre liquid too much is because I would only be smoking cartridges sativas I never gave myself like the transfer to actually keep trying like flour because I don't think wouldn't back then back then I wouldn't be smoked sour at all it would just be cartridges so if I was trying to stay up it was a sativa courage and it was just all the time because I smell like people say they drink coffee to like wake you up I feel like me if I drink coffee I can still take a nap right after and just the parents like that's a team I will have me like if heads like that flower that I try the sativa I had feeling like like not like not energized all the way where I want to go run a mile but I felt like if I started smoking this at the beginning of my day and I had things to do definitely with that flower that I smoked I would be and then I'm so like sometimes there'll be some stuffy without smoke that even though it's a sativa I can still like sleep right after and just like the same with indigo like I feel like not every end up just like indicas I feel like not every Indyk level let me they all relaxed me somewhere that's what suffering where I will sleep what huh but other times it I'll just be like turn it back because I was smoked sometimes an indica right from when were Corley got I'm on my break but I have caught myself to it we're looking in indica and I'm like this on my phone that's like a college at one time was oh my gosh I'm falling asleep and like my head was bobbing like and I'll shine [ __ ] I don't know have y'all ever done that like especially at school I remember when I would take naps at school and I would just jump I don't know where like it was weird but I'm good King Tommen City I'm burning pretty good because like I said we had to do a little surgery on it but so far it's smooth I know I say that's all the time but it's just like it really is smooth you", "6TkTTZ2R4Gw": "[Music] look guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm back and we're back for another straight review today we're checking out some more grapes some more grapes this stuff is called a humble grape soda first thing I'm gonna say about it is it's kind of confusing when you go to the brand's website it comes up as great tech calyx great leaks or however you save calyx calyx great calyx aka grape soda this is another one from up north I'm pretty sure this is the second time you've reviewed their product on the show probably the third or fourth time that we've smoked it looking up the obviously we like to do our homework if we haven't smoked the strain before we're going to you know to do whatever research we can online to get as much information about the strain as we can that is correct sometimes they get information something out there sometimes it's a little bit questionable yes this brand actually a website that we can go to and read the background of this so I'll set that aside good for you guys cuz it was pure gold just hit that they're great calyx take a grape soda the long experiment that were eventually yield great calyx began in 2012 with the cross between Durbin poison and pure Hindu Kush he knew that he knew that he knew punished from the Hindu mountain from their Cowan's garden carefully a home the strain incorporating dozens of sometimes rare and unlikely hybrids sfv og Platinum Girl Scout cookies and purple pine nuts to name a few super rare I'll be honest you guys lost me right there rare and unlikely hybrid nothing more rare than boji and cookies that will more rare than that you won't find that nobody's bed oh gee cookies and purple pineapple to name a few cherry picking the very best qualities from each strain finally they struck gold swollen calluses soaring THC levels and off-the-charts terpene profile thus great talents report great calyx but on the jar it says on the box it says humble grape soda I think there's a little bit of disconnect here no website and says gree Kaling's aka persona and that's a powerful name that crack that I don't care what you say like that tell me what that smells like well that remind you is it ring available yeah we talked about this just now this smells exactly like the if you guys have been following us from way back you're gonna remember 2012 maybe 2011 somewhere in that time period when we were on the dogs walk the dogs well are you sure we have a string of you up online if you want to search dogs Walt's train review dog waltz stringer video you'll find that da WG thing yep it was I think I want to see freak or burglar cool and the treads walk across oh it's great that's what this smells like for some reason it's the closest thing I found see that it actually looks a lot like it - it tastes like it too so looking at the packaging here we were coming in 17.5% th see there you're soaring THC levels storage obviously that's not high preferred today's standards but yeah yeah up north I think this is I think this is the second time we reviewed some of their flowers on the show probably the third or fourth time we tried it what would you say you know it's your first impression of this one overall about to dress to be honest I feel like it's a weaker version of the dogs wallets that used to smoke like you said honestly it's just I think it's like some pickle show I'm gonna keep it 100 I'm not trying to dog nobody but we keep it real we're not trying to dog wall - nothing like that but you know that I mean the one thing I'll give it is it does taste really good it really does bringing out bring back that flavor of the dog's walls but like I'm just not too impressed I agree with you on the flavor probably being the best aspect of this one this is the we smoked a little bit for the wagon baked this morning this is my second time smoking it yeah both today through tomorrow I'm back in the pine so I was hoping that it would you know looks decent but I've definitely seen you know better-looking tweed the nose line I do like the smell is just not very pungent yeah it's kind of just that sweet sweet creepy I mean if you're going off of the end smell that delay gave us here and there it basically sounds like a mud run yeah it sounds like they got about 20 different strains mixed in here and they're rare I don't know it doesn't really you know really the flavor is good but it's just not no it doesn't really have any traits that really make this wheat stand up yeah there's nothing that stands out exactly it's just you know it's just it's just like something else I'd rather probably just have to something else so in this case I'd rather have with dogs wallets yeah it's grapes we love it we're smoking it it's not great being creepy though like kind of like we've been talking about lately we've actually they're talking about grapes a lot more than usual lately you know it's it's not that pungent sweet candy creepy fruity grape that I really like when it comes to like a purple you know it is it's just it doesn't really have that and it's a lot more mild right so yeah going going to the rating it I'll probably start with the taste because it's its best feature but in the same it's nothing crazy so I'm gonna have to give that like a generous eight a generous that's like the best rating I'm gonna give this this flowers so a taste longer than eight as it is producing yeah tastes are go eight look I would go seven and effect in the way it you know that could smell I probably go five yeah for bug overall I'd say this is probably a solid six and a half six and a half to seven it's a good middle show it was Shino little cheaper and not something the other better flower that we picked up like like I keep saying them the REC shelves are slim pickins right now but we're trying to bring you guys you know good strains slim pickins for everybody man have these shops I mean compared to before the regulations dad like this selection is just really really hurting right now concentrate to specialty so do anything that'll mean more interviews right so yeah it's rough out there in these streets right now yeah we're trying to bring you guys quality content for all these drainages hope we're doing that what's strange is you guys want to see us review what are you smoking on right now that's fire know in the comments if you're still watching this video what's the best [ __ ] strain or cultivar you have smoked this year and we will go hunt it down we promise we will do our best I know people want us to stop saying strains all the super wieners yep and we nerds up there want us to stop saying strain because it's not technically correct what about strands but we got strain reviews and we've been rocking it like this for eight years now I don't remember the other people to say strand from like the strand with a D on yeah man that's my favorite strand now I guess we're supposed to be saying cultivar yeah anyway doesn't sound as good it doesn't have an ice-rink cultivar is that really what we're supposed to be saying stream refers more to life and the technical sense it would be like cannabis indica and then cannabis sativa is like a different strain of the cannabis plant and there's like ruderalis and [ __ ] you learn something new every day

AUGUST IS TIME FOR GRAPES.", "pxYCCmlUxVA": "[Music] hey guys today I want to make a video about the differences between wine grapes and table grapes so I've got a couple of both right here first one here is a Cabernet Sauvignon which is a pretty good representation of a wine grape what you see here would be a lot like what you'd see in a merlot a Malbec some of the bigger popular red wine varieties and then here I've got a table grape and these usually aren't labeled I think this might be a ruby seed list but it's really anybody's guess what this is so visually you'll obviously see there's some differences table grapes are almost always going to be a lot larger than wine grapes wine grapes are usually smaller they're more concentrated and you know if it's a red wine it's actually a lot darker than the table grape so it's like a blue-black instead of just like a you know cranberry colored skin the one thing you'll notice about wine grapes it's really obvious is that they have a really really thick skin so these are actually called a slip skin so I'm gonna squeeze it pop it out here and kind of let the pulp out and you can see the pulp here is green even though it's a red grape so all the skin you're gonna get from this is gonna come from that that or all the color you're gonna get from this is going to come from the skin so I don't know if I squeeze it really hard if I'll get any color here but normally you would or pretty much always you would ferment a red wine on the skins and let all that color kind of suck out of those blue black skins on that grape the seedless grape the table grape is pretty much exactly what you know as a kid eating there's a seed usually in there but it doesn't have the crunch like if I were to crunch on these wine grapes the seeds are pretty pretty intense they're pretty bitter they're pretty astringent where if I eat this grape I can't even really tell there's seeds in there I don't know if the Thompson seedless if there even is a seed there and that does bring a question well how do you grow a grape if it's seedless well pretty much all grape vines are propagated from grape vine cuttings so they're usually even referred to as a clone number so if you go up a whole row of grapes it's not only going to be the same grape variety it's gonna be genetically identical to every other grape in that row and that kind of keeps you know if you find a grape that vine that's really working well you don't have to worry about any weird cross-pollination that could happen on the future generations of that grape vine if you were propagating by seed the other big difference between these is you'll notice that the wine grapes are really really sweet the store-bought grapes are sweet they're usually 14 to 16 percent sugar but these red wine grapes are closer to 24 to 26 percent sugar usually so just a lot more sugar additionally they're gonna be a little bit higher acid and all that really helps to give you this big intense full-bodied wine with you know the acid the tannin all that sugar gets mostly converted to alcohol if this is gonna be a dry red wine so really just makes for a really good good wine I'm only talking about red grapes in this but the white grapes are gonna be the same you're still gonna have the slip skin you're gonna have high higher sugars higher acids generally white grapes are a little bit lower in sugar so instead of 24 to 26 percent you might be you know 19 to 23 percent sugar but all still the same family vidis vinifera would be the genus as vidis the strain to be or the species I guess would be Vanna Farah and then from there you have each strain so you know all your wine grapes so those are really the key differences between like I said slip skin big crunchy seeds higher acid higher sugar those are gonna be your biggest differences between a table grape and a wine grape and that's why you don't really see wine grapes sold for eating even well you could eat them but people probably just don't really want to chew on that big skin and they also don't want to crunch on those really bitter seeds so they're just not as you know maybe commercializable from an edible standpoint even though they taste delicious if you like these types of videos make sure you click Subscribe below and I'll put a follow-up article on my website smart

all the grapes that we harvested with them in our last episode if you guys missed the last episode with presley vineyards i'll put a link above and in the description so you guys can check that out and uh here's stage two [Music] hey everyone and welcome back to my channel if you're new here i'm tara a farmer from northern california and this channel is mainly about farming but sometimes it's not and today we are going on a field trip hi [Laughter] alcohol what else did you say aldehydes aldehydes is it all natural stuff or is it stuff that's been added in no it all the smells are natural stuff and it's in it there's you know there's probably some there's definitely some a little bit of co2 some methane some sulfur it's strong how's the smell in there okay you're used to it it smells good so this is all the grape skins yep so it's been sitting in here for how long so they just pumped it down okay so the juice is now on the is the free run and then this goes to the press but how long was the juice has been in here oh we picked two weeks ago it was about two weeks ago two weeks so so we're here to see it all get pressed it finished fermentation like three days ago okay just sat on the skins and now we're ready for the next step how's it going charlie he's got a ways to go so we've got all the skins that just came out of the tank and they're getting dumped into the press danger zone there we go [Music] [Music] no um lydia will do it after she eats lunch okay but thank you i appreciate the offer a little harder to get out than in got a full baby [Laughter] gotta fold yes yeah we're going to let's watch daddy you're not going to try to go out that hole are you okay are you having a hard time hearing what dad is gonna get dirty and come out say come on out darren baby jay we go wow that was so beautiful that was very graceful all right we're here we're ready to rock and roll huh tommy [Applause] like yeah whatever we just or i didn't i just supervised all of the grapes getting dumped went great perfect you got into a job too because i'll hide it right now i can take all the help i can get okay so this is the press can you can you introduce yourself first because i don't think i got you in video at all last time yeah i don't think you did okay i'm elise perry i'm the wine maker here at bocas vineyards and i am the wine maker for presley jr yes so she helps them out a lot we kind of talked about that how she helps you and stuff like that she guides us guides you i'm in consulting she's our consultant yes okay so do you want to explain what's happening now sure um so the grapes have gone through primary fermentation um so we now have wine uh and what we did was we drained the tank first of all that what we call free run wine it's all that wine that's just ready to go that went into a tank we dug out what was left of the grapes uh in tank so they're pretty squished at that point uh and we jump them into the press and we're pressing out the rest of the wine that's inside of those grapes okay so can you explain what we're smelling because i feel like it's a very strong smell uh well if you had smell-o-vision it would be great yeah yeah i know yeah i'm so you're getting a lot of uh burning my nose a little bit like i feel like i might have just take like a shot of something you're definitely getting some of the alcohol there okay there's still some carbon dioxide in those grapes so you're getting a little bit of a shot of carbon dioxide okay and then you're just getting all of those aromatics that are coming out and this happens to be a really nice bright pinot noir okay you've got some really nice bright uh red fruit aromas happening yeah and we have our assistant wine maker here tommy hamilton this is all my makeup huh who's also got his gopro let me see your camera wow and this is what's coming out oh can you explain how it works so this is so the grapes get dumped up there i was just up there they get dumped in and then how do we get the juice out so inside this big drum is a ladder that gets inflated by air that's what you're hearing right now is air getting pushed from a compressor it blows it up and it squeezes those grapes against the side wall and there's slats you get the the coming down through those slats so it's continuing press and it builds pressure over time okay so you get you squeeze harder and harder how do you know when to cut it off does this start looking different it smells like taste so i'm constantly tasting it okay entire process today so you're just getting this good stuff right here wow and eventually it'll taste a certain way and that's how you'll know when it's ready yes okay so you can i don't know if you can see maybe not there's like little slits there and it's all coming through what do you think does it look good yeah [Laughter] so you can see all the little slits in the side so like she said the bladder is pushing them up against there and there's the juice okay so you can see all the slits are on the top now so it just rotated i'm assuming the bladder is shrinking down and i'm assuming it's going to rotate again and then the bladder is going to blow up inside again so let's see if that's what happens so by spinning it's getting all those grape skins and everything in there loosened up and moving around it's actually spinning a lot more than i was expecting but obviously the bladder kind of smushes everything's to the side this gets it loosened up looks like we're going at it again okay so last time in the last video we put all the wine and the skin or not wine the juice and the skins and everything in there so since that day until today when you were taking it all out what has happened you want to be in on this what we have done is it got it sat for three days cold soaking so just yeah we didn't inoculate it was sitting there just trying to get more color into the into the wine okay developing better color and then it gets inoculated and then we slowly start tracking what is inoculated with the yeast okay so with the yeast that we're going to do added juice added use to it okay and so we add yeast and then we are um yeah at that time we were at least pumping over twice a day twice a day so call in the morning and call in the afternoon to kind of reintegrate so the skins will float to the top because you're having a release of like co2 and just a lot of gases are starting to release because it's an active fermentation okay and so you're trying to reduce the temperature at a certain temp on reds and then re-integrate um the juice back on top of the skins okay and they also take a sample every day and test for the sugars to see how the sugars are coming down okay because you're basically oh right because you you're you guys said you go till zero correct right so you're testing the sugar every day yeah see where it's got okay yeah so say you start off at 24 bricks you end up at 14 um alcohol and so when you're tracking it is how because you want to have that the wine where this is going to dry okay so no more residual sugar left okay so once that goes dry then you know you're done and fermentation's over yeah okay and then you said it finished fermenting a couple days ago yes yeah so is it hurting it sitting it in like being in there a few extra days before you press it it's not like you've got enough gas that's holding it okay that's fine okay okay so we've got the press down there and we have a hose here that's coming out of the pump pumping but from the tray that's down there right so pumping out of the tray okay coming up the line okay and it will go right into a tank into that tank yep and it'll settle out within about 24 to 48 hours okay and then from that tank it will go into the barrel so you're settling it's going to be in there just for a day or two yeah and then from there it's going to go into a battery then you'll go down into a barrel okay okay so their cab is in here it has your name on it oh it's beautiful so there we go presley vineyards 2019 cab so that's from last year so we're in the barrel room which is always like so cool to me all the barrels here okay so the roses in metal yes stainless steel um is there a reason for that or is it just the flavor profile that we like the flavor profile okay it creates a cleaner crisper um white wine yeah as opposed to as opposed to a um an oak style like chardonnay okay um this creates a nice crispy come here dude come look what we're looking at over here what have you got what have you got there grapes grapes how long does the rose stay in we'll bottle in january and when did it go in there though it went in there in beginning august august yeah so okay eight months or so pretty quick yeah and then the cab was 2019 so that's how long does that stay in there so it's kind of up to charlie and i on what we wanted to like how it's tasty right now we're talking about bottling maybe next may but we'll make that decision once we actually continue to taste it and see if it's gone to the point where we want it it'll probably be about that 16 to 18 month mark by the time we get to it like what our red just went through is in tank it did primary fermentation same with the white you press it get off the skin and you go to the primary fermentation here and then whites are done okay so once it goes in the red up to that tank it will sit and settle and then it goes into barrel where it gets inoculated for monologuing fermentation okay okay and then uh then there so that's it's secondary fermentation and then after that it's done and it sits in ages and barrel and then once it gets enough age time and oak integration then you decide when you need to bottle it and then from there it'll bottle age for so many more months okay so what's gonna be the next thing you bottle like the soonest thing so we'll do yeah the rose on our albarino bottle in january in january and that will be the mobile bottling that hopefully i can come to yeah cool that will be really cool to see so we're going to taste the rose now yeah that we were just looking at a minute ago so what okay so for people that don't know what is what goes into rose like there's not a rose grape right you know like if someone knows nothing about rose what is what goes into rosette peanut yeah so this is our pizza that's it that's it you don't know what definitely depending on how it's tasting at least we'll um we'll blend it with a little something like we've done grenache in the past um also a red grape okay um but yeah so pinot noir is a red grape yes and so how does it end up pink comes into the winery and we um let it sit on the skins for what do we out do um and so it gives it this nice okay buddy i give this this nice little pink this one looks very like peachy color it is and it's a little cloudy right now because it just finished fermentation about two weeks ago on the nose here you get like a lot of like like there's acid like grapefruit it tastes really good citrus a lot of citrus notes are on the nose um it's just super elise is a rosie rose wizard so this was picked for rose picked for rose and then we have some of our son yay which when we bring in our pino we bleed off some juice to help increase color okay in our red wine okay some of this percentage of juice that we have will barrel down and that will help infuse more color into some of the rose where you see it's a little bit lighter okay yeah okay so this is sagna oh yes okay so beautiful color wow that is beautiful so that will help with the color of this yeah and it can also help with like the flavor profile it's like you want to have a little more full body you know like we're trying on this in barrel yeah so it has different flavor profiles and the wine that you're going to get out of the stainless steel okay so this is all the grapes that just came out of the press so what now happens with all this so this will now get re-incorporated back into the vineyard is it going to go back to your vineyard no it'll probably stay out here in comets okay and this is is it just going to go like in the roadways or does it get like what you know does it have anything special they just toss it out there this winery they'll they'll have it spread it out through just a normal amendment spreader and then they'll disc it in what do you think tommy yep you like it fun very nice sustainability yep that's right sustainability you guys are sustaining rules lodi rules sustainable that's sustainable farming right certified yeah okay sustainability is um farming in a way that preserves it for like future generations to come and be able to farm because we set up and stand up for them yeah okay it's it's looking at the holistic view like britain said it's you know it needs to be everything needs to be economical for the grower and it needs to be try the best the best possible situation for the environment that it's situated in yeah um and does it stay sustainable on your bottle anywhere or is there any way to know okay there's a seal yeah on the back of our uh wine on the label it has a the lodi rules uh sustainable seal on it okay because i think i've seen it on the website yeah okay there's the whole hamilton family [Music] [Music] you", "h-PXOl9a3aQ": "hi I'm Natalie Jill let's talk

worry about the calories so much on the grapes because you can have a lot of them for a small amount of calories and you get so many great rich nutrients in them and they're great as a snack by

backyard and if you're new to my channel please consider subscribing don't forget to hit the like button and I welcome your comments I like to share my tips for growing eastern Concord grape vines the eastern concord brake mines is a vigorous deciduous vine with deep green foliage and medium-sized edible highly aromatic blue-black grapes and the skin separates easily from the fruit harvesting is usually late August to September and pruning is important to maintain vine form and improve through quality this should be done before early spring right before dormancy breaks I've constructed a support system using two different training systems the top wire is a corridor in training system and the bottom wire is a spur training system although the eastern concord grape is suitable for growing in colorado over the course of four years I discovered that Colorado's climate and high altitude brought challenges to growing this type of cultivar the two issues I've had with this cultivar in our climate as concord grapes are susceptible to leaf rust and uneven in ripening the leaf for us is a result of rust fungus which mainly occurs in warm temperatures which is when born spores this problem typically occurs in July when the temperatures start climbing above 90 degrees the first sign of this problem I immediately removed and discarded the effective foliage and organically sprayed the vine foliage with neem oil I also started covering the vines with a micro mesh shade cloth which you see against the fist this management system significally decreased the leaf rust problem another problem that plagues concord grapes is uneven ripening according to the experts the reasons are not completely understood but it is thought to be due to high temperatures which affect the sugar in the grape cluster colorada is 5000 feet above sea level our Sun is is extremely intense and we get a lot of sunshine in Colorado therefore it was necessary to start shading the vine again I purchased the micro mesh shade cloth and started covering the grapes when the temperatures was 85 degrees or higher this year the shading reduced the temperature by 8 degrees and I saw a significant improvement in my grape cluster being more uniformly right also the micro mesh shade cloth kept the birds and squirrels away I'm happy to stay with this management system I saw a healthier grapevine the concord grapes would turn a darker shade two or three weeks before peak harvest the concord grapes are very sweet when eaten as a table grapes and the seeded grapes juice is very well without adding sugar it's harvest time [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you for watching do not forget to Like and subscribe and hit the notification veil [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

real challenge with the eastern concord grape vine this season because denver colorado got a late May freak snowstorm and check out my video about the snowstorm I literally show my entire backyard that was impacted by that snowstorm this particular grapevine already had buds on the grapevine and I rushed home grabbed all of my frost blankets my commercial frost blink is try to cover as many of my vegetations and flowers as possible unfortunately I ran out and I actually put sheets over my grapevine I doubled up on the sheets unfortunately it wasn't enough to protect the buds on the grapevine however the grapevine did bounce back as you can see it's really really nice except the buds on this side of the grapevine actually froze and so I didn't get a lot of grapes on this side of the grapevine however on this side of the grapevine I got a lot of buds and therefore you can see I had grapes I would have had a lot more grape clusters this year again I we had that freak snowstorm one of the things I like to do is journal all the experiences I have growing all of my vegetations and one of the things that I have learned over the years of growing Eastern Conqueror grape vines is to cut down on what they call leaf rust now in July of 2018 I literally documented that around the middle of July because of the intense heat and the fact that when the temperatures get up to 90 degrees eastern concord grape vines is very it's very common to get leaf rust so what did I do to avoid that I started shading the grapevine so this is a mess shading it gives about 20% shade on the e-string concord grape vine and 2018 I had about 5% of leaf rust on the vines again this is a result of temperatures over 90 degrees so these are this is my my journaling and my documentation so I know from the previous years what I need to do to try to correct issues I'm having with the grapevine and therefore I indicated that in the July temperatures were over 90 degrees for the entire month believe it or not I only had two leaves that had leaf rust so if you look at this entire vine we've had 90-degree temperatures for two months in Denver and none of these vines got leave for us one year I had the entire vine healthy for us and I had to treat it I the the vine suffered a lot due to it but this this is how I corrected the situation so eastern concord grape vines is a northern type of grape vine does not do very well in high temperature so my tip is to get a frost excuse me a mesh covering and protect your your vines if your temperatures get over 90 degrees also it keeps the critters off your grapevine I don't have to worry about squirrels getting to my grape clusters I don't have any of those concerns so as soon as my grape cluster starts maturing the temperatures start getting in the 90 degree temperature this is when I put a mesh covering over the grapevine and I don't have to deal with it from that point on also my grapevine is growing in wood chips they've been growing in wood chips for the past three years and as a result of that I feel that the nutrients from the decomposition of the wood chips has provided my grapevine with the type of nutrients it needs so I really do not feed my eastern concord grape vine except I give it a fish emulsifier right at the very beginning of spring and other than that keep it water keep it protected and over the years those are some of the tips and corrections I have made over time now to try to prevent the episode that happened this season with the late snowstorm I am gonna make sure I have plenty of Frost blankets commercial gray frost blankets to cover the grapevine so I don't have a repeat of what happened in May when I ran out of frost blankets when we had that late freak snowstorm which does not occur that was very freaked it just never happens in Denver like that and I'm a native therefore I lost all the bugs on this side so I didn't get a lot of grapevine clusters this year like I did last year so journaling your experiences with the crops you're growing helps you to understand how to overcome or correct issues that are either predictable or unpredictable so that each year you have a good successful crop so without further ado I'm gonna go ahead and start harvesting the grapes oh one other thing I'm gonna point out that I want to share with you as a result of my grapevine growing in wood trips and being covered I noticed that my clusters are ripening a lot more evenly so in the prior years I had noted in my journaling that that was something that was occurring and as I started making corrections on what what the problems was on the grapevine rust I also realize that my grape clusters were even where ripening more evenly as opposed to not so this is a good season for my concord grape vine except that this half of the road unfortunately the buds froze so let me go ahead and start the harvesting [Music] [Music] so far this is what I've harvested and I still have more to harvest but these crepes are so sweet look how plump they are mmm they are so sweet and they have seeds in it ah beautiful beautiful so I'm gonna finish harvesting but this is what I've harvest so far just want to let you know that I am growing my grapevine on a bilateral cordon training system where the arms from the trunk is trained on this wire and the arms from the truck is trained on that wire as well as the top wire so this is the training system I've been using for my Eastern Concord grape vines I got a really great harvest despite that may late freak storm I'm gonna continue harvesting these are just beautiful grapes to grow especially in in the cooler climates like zone 5b so I'm glad you came along and was bait was able to be part of my sharing the tips of growing this beautiful grape vine especially in zone 5b thanks for watching and don't forget to hit the like button [Music]", "zlkRt0ZvmLo": "[Music] you might think you know grapes but given the sheer volume of

them in the army in church we bless grapes sometimes a few times a year but definitely we do it on the feast of the assumption of st. Mary bless grapes I know I know the first thing everybody's doing is saying wait that's not in the Bible actually it is we read in the Bible John chapter 15 Jesus says I am The True Vine and my father is the vine dresser he says you are the branches and you have to bear good fruit it's right there John chapter 15 I am The True Vine Jesus Christ the true vine he says that we are the branches okay let's think about that for a moment this is what's called a metaphor Jesus is using the metaphor to describe something great you're something that he is the true vine think about the true vine it goes into the earth it gets its nourishment it seeps thus the Sun to get its heats to get that light and produce what beautiful fruit he says you are the branches you have to be connected to the vine in order to bear good fruit we bless grapes in the Armenian Church because Jesus sets up that metaphor and by blessing it we understand that there is a purpose to our life it's basically to produce good fruit think about how beautiful the grape is it looks beautiful it looks scrumptious they smell great they have this aromatic aroma and if you take one what your eyes it it has that Zuna sonora one grapes are delicious you want to produce good fruit but Jesus warns us he tells us that unless we are connected to the wine we cannot bear good fruit and I want you to take a look at these grapes as beautiful as they are as delicious as they are that's good smelling as they are they are dead ah yes once they're disconnected that's it it's finished these will dry up and you know what they become Chum eat raisins they don't wrinkle fruit they may taste good but what are they solid iron in other words void of all that emotion of all that quality in the same way our lives when we are not connected to the mind when we are not connected to Jesus Christ what are we chopped eat which is basically wrinkled we lose that quality of beauty we lose that quality of flavor in our lives so Jesus invites us today and every day to be united to the vines now we in the Armenian Church bless the grapes on the feast of the assumption of st. Mary in the Armenian Church we celebrate this on the Sunday closest to August fifteenth in many of the Christian churches they celebrate it right on the day others 15 the tradition is that the Holy Mother of God st. Mary was assumed into heaven now that expression Holy Mother of God is a very special one and it is very endearing one throughout all Christian tradition for in fact if we believe that Jesus Christ is God incarnate in other words came in the flesh the mother of god is st. Mary the army new church we refer to her as us rodzina Espada's e towards our spots means God dzien means to bear to bring into this world and st. Mary was the one who said yes to God despite all of the difficulties that she would endure she said yes she said that I want to bear that good fruit I want to give the ultimate fruit the fruit of my womb to be given to this world for the salvation of humanity and that's what Jesus Christ is the ultimate fruit he is the mine we are the branches we are commanded to bear good fruit that's what this feast is about to think about st. Mary not as a figure in history but an opportunity for us a saint that we could emulate with our lives to say yes to God that we are ready to bear the greatest fruit of all and what is that but love so you see Jesus Christ is love incarnate is God incarnate st. Mary said yes that she would bear love into this world and that's what's demanded of each of us can you bring love into this world can you bear Jesus Christ in your life can you make sure that Jesus Christ is delivered to this world and guess what once you do that you start understanding your place your purpose in life connected to the wine barring that great food the delicious fruit because it

opportunity to I guess talk a little bit about a specialty in medicine that you guys may not have really thought much about having said that I hate talking about myself but I've been asked to sort of talk a bit about how I got into this role that I'm currently undertaking and a little bit about you know what it means and what you can achieve in that specialty so it is a special opportunity and I hope that you learn a little bit about an increasingly important specialty I think as you will see so my plan is to really give you a bit of a background about where I've come from in my career how on earth did I end up in this specialty that you probably didn't really think much about aerospace medicine what pursued me to do that and I think just trying to define it a little bit for you so you know what does it actually mean is it the same as occupational medicine for example well I think there are competencies in our field of work which are very different it certainly calls on some of those expertise some of that expertise but it is different I don't to have a look at some of the opportunities and challenges of the specialty and certainly the opportunities going forward there's been some really amazing things happening just recently in the way for example Australia is getting involved in space and some of the ways that our specialty can contribute to clinical practice in a number of different ways which you might find useful over my career and it's been 30 years and I've got to say I'm at a lot of the things that I'm it said struck a real chord with me because I remember 30 years I went my 30 year Sydney University reunion a few weeks ago felt pretty old but it was great catching up with colleagues but over that time the number of times I've been asked you know so what sort of doctor are you then and you know when you say oh I work in aerospace medicine on a specialist in aerospace medicine you get various responses like oh never really heard of that you know oh that must be such a narrow field and you know also you aren't a real doctor then but really in just the general public - you know they really don't stop to think about people working in a specialty that tries to keep them safe for example every time they fly on an airline so there's a real you embarrassment I guess that goes along with that trying to explain who you are and you know at the moment as you'll see as we go through aerospace medicine isn't recognized as a specialty under the IMC in this country whereas overseas it is a board-certified specialty for example in the US so what got me into it well I guess the first thing to say to you guys is whatever career that you pursue in medicine you've got to love what you do and you've got to follow your passion and it really didn't take me too long to realize that I was kind of into flying just as a bit of a straw poll how many people here think flying is really cool and like flying alright hands down how many people here have considered learning to fly oh that's quite a few that must be that part of the doctor's Broman says this is done since I'm learning to fly be the brain what about actually getting a pilot's license how many people have done that alright so be a few fewer than that well that's what got me involved in this I was passionate from a very early age in aviation and space I remember sitting as a four-year-old in front of the Apollo 11 mission on television and making you know plastic models of aircraft from when I was a big so I think being able to combine something you love with something that actually earns a living is you know really advantageous so it didn't take me long to go from that in an emergency department to a slightly more exciting way to spend my time and I don't think was that far into my work as an intern and resident when I started to earn some money that I started to learn to fly so I got my pilot's license and thought gee this is really great I won't earth did I do medicine I should have really become a pilot but that really did sort of fall in heap when I realized well you know he really can't make as good a living as a pilot and there were a whole bunch of problems in the aviation industry back then in the late 80s so I realized now it's probably better to stick with medicine so I did though realize that you could train in aerospace medicine so I started off by doing a qualification which still exists at Monash University the Australian certificate of civil aviation medicine which is two weeks so if you want to practice as an aviation medical examiner even as a GP that's the sort of course that you need to do but I went on from that and I did a further postgraduate course you know as a diploma in aviation medicine the one I did was through the University of Otago in New Zealand the common one that's done physically with our military Docs is one that's run through King's College in London and then more recently we've stood up a college of aerospace medicine in Australia and I've been sort of grandfathered into that because of the length of time I've been in the specialty so the stuff that you do for love there's stuff that you do for passion but you all obviously have to do stuff to earn a living so I mean I've done a bunch of stuff in aerospace medicine now over the last 20 to 25 years which is purely voluntary but it actually means that our profession gets or our specialty gets advanced so I've been on the so our society board the Australasian Society of aerospace medicine for 22 years I was a president of that Society and currently the secretary I've done a whole bunch of organising these things conferences and conventions for our specialty and I set up help set up at college so we've got the Australasian College of aerospace medicine now and my current role and things keep me really busy you aware that our society is I'm chairing our space life sciences committee and I've been very involved in the last 12 months in a lot of meetings and a lot of input into the new space agency which has been which is actually just commenced operations on 1 July so that's very exciting news for us for money I've been paid as a consultant for the RAF for quite some time but same time actually 1996 started working for the Royal Australian Air Force Institute of aviation medicine I've done some work for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in the civilian role as a designated aviation medical examiner so there's a number of things I've done there being able to combine stuff that helps the profession but also obviously stuff that I've done to earn a living my role at the Institute of aviation medicine which is an Air Force Institute in Adelaide at the RAF base at n bura it does a whole bunch of different things it's a tri-service multidisciplinary spesh specialty unis my main role is teaching so I teach all the military doctors that come through about aerospace medicine but we do a lot of the air medical fitness determinations for military aircrew we do a lot of research policy making clinical advice for doctors all around defense and even in the civilian world sometimes and the whole aim of that is to make sure that our military pilots are safe so it's all about human performance and safety in very high-performance machines and making sure that they can do their job effectively in a civilian role with a super Aviation Safety Authority Casa is the regulatory authority that looks after aviation safety in Australia and there is an aviation medicine section within Casa and that staff by about four to five doctors so they look at the fitness of civilian pilots they set standards for that they look at the oversight of the medical examiners in the community that do pilot medicals and many of you some of you even many of you may end up doing that in various specialties or general practice clinics that you work in and of course engaging internationally with other regular regulatory authorities such as the FAA and CIA in the UK there's a lot of fun in this job I got to say but I think that while you have fun doing your job for me at least part of that is actually walking for a while in your patients shoes and I think that's true of any medical specialty in whatever field of medicine you end up getting into the most important thing you need to do is understand the environment of your patient for me that means understanding what it's like to sit on the flight deck of a 737 it means understanding what it's like to fly in an f-18 Super Hornet or indeed to wear a spacesuit and do geology on Mars whatever it happens to be they're the sort of things it's really important to appreciate because you can't make clinical decisions unless you understand that that's really a basic premise of occupational medicine generally know what your patient does and this is a bit I hated I mean talking about myself but if you do that if you are passionate about it and you get involved then that brings its own rewards and you will end up achieving perhaps you know a career that that you would hope for and get rewarded appropriately I think the point of this slide mainly is to point out what an international specialty aerospace medicine is and I've been fortunate blessed enough to become a fellow of a number of different organizations around the world from here space Medical Association in the United States the Royal Aeronautical Society in Britain and the International Academy is a originally a French organisation but it really is an international institution of specialists in our field so with all of that and indeed I've been recognized here in Australia for the work that I've done over the years so when you're passionate about something it really is important - or it's it's motivating I guess to get that recognition but why aerospace medicine what is it about this that I found so exciting well I think for a start it it's kind of sexy I mean aeroplanes I think are sexy but it's more about I think using aerospace medicine and I think I'm quite passionate about education I think it's using a very interesting field that can teach you about physiology that can teach you about clinical medicine working a lot with University of Adelaide at the moment trying to get some aerospace medicine into the physiology training that they do because it's a great way to teach some of the basic principles of physiology but it's a very niche field it so in some ways you could say it's narrow but it encompasses pretty much every clinical specialty that you can think of but applied to people in a highly specialized role but we're very lucky in that unlike the local ward and you know the the the acute hospitals that you might see here we have very healthy motivated patients in fact so motivated in fact they will often conceal clinical problems so that they can keep doing what they're doing but the physiology that we know and we practice is very applied it's about applying physiology to keep people safe and keep people alive and develop life support systems in very high-performance aircraft to ensure their safety in that sense it's multidisciplinary we are involved in not only medicine in physiology clinical medicine were involved in biomedical engineering human factors psychology pathology there's a number of different specialties that are involved and we call upon a number of different clinical specialties such as cardiology neurology psychiatry to help assess the patient's that we deal with on a routine basis but the bottom line is it's a safety focused profession and I think that from up from my perspective that's really important trying to do something for the betterment of the community making sure that when they travel when they fly when our aircrew fly that they are safe and protected I also love the fact that it is an international specialty and very collegiate it's quite small in Australia so pretty much everybody working in my field knows everybody else very collegiate and the conference as we go to a lot of fun as a result of that and I say with a bit bit of tongue-in-cheek but potentially the future of humanity depends upon us in some ways if you want to think of us as a multi-planet species but over the years we have gone along with the adventure of powered flight leaving since the early days of ballooning aerospace medicine and doctors have been involved in trying to keep people hell fiat altitude from the early days of powered flight in 1903 aerospace medicine doctors have been involved in working out the problems of flight developing techniques to keep people alive as aircraft have flown faster and higher and further and even today that's becoming increasingly more important with our future push into into deep space which we're doing again now so if we want to become a multi-planet species and survive as a species guess what aerospace medicine is going to be there helping out terms of what is it there's a bunch of pictures on that slide there everything from civil commercial aviation to spaceflight to military aviation to even adventurers such as Felix Baumgartner there on the bottom left who made that record-breaking parachute jump from one hundred and twenty eight thousand feet you remember that in 2012 needed a spacesuit to do it but survived and broke a lot of Records so what we're really doing is looking at the health safety and performance of people who fly in the air and in space and it's kind of different from normal normal medicine I say normal medicine but it's different I guess from the traditional clinical medical practice you may be used to in traditional medicine you've got patients with normal physiology in a fairly normal sea level 1g norm oxic environment however when you fly it's more about normal physiology of the crew or the people on the aircraft working in a very abnormal challenging environment so it's that bit that we get involved in in trying to come up with strategies to keep people alive if we're talking about aviation it's these sort of challenges as you get higher the atmospheric pressure decreases oxygen therefore oxygen partial pressure decreases hypoxia becomes a real risk temperature extremes particularly cold the forces of acceleration on the bodies of those fighter pilot or fighter aircraft there that you see the pilots that fly those aircraft can pull seven and a half times normal gravity which means they weigh seven and a half times what they would normally weigh sitting in this theater right now sensory information is degraded the risk of disorientation when flying is extreme isolation from medical care but isolation generally in terms of being alone up there is psychologically interesting and of course then you've got the long-duration travel the multiple time zones that area crew cross in terms of the space environment of course slightly different challenges some are similar some are different microgravity is the big diff it's the big the big one which we have yet to really solve but radiation the absence of an atmosphere in a vacuum again acceleration forces on launch and reentry the isolation can you imagine a three year mission demands seven months getting there eighteen months on the surface seven months getting back in a tin can with five other people the psychological aspect of that is really interesting of itself and then of course developing the life-support systems and mechanisms that allow that all to happen there are lots of opportunities especially going forward we know that the the aviation industry is growing almost exponentially if you have a look at Airbus data in the next 15 years or so that the number of passenger miles is pretty much going to double passenger kilometers in fact in that slide in fact Qantas IATA and Qantas to put out some data just this week that there's going to be a seven percent increase in passengers traveling even just this year in 2018 four point three billion passengers traveling around the world and a lot of that increases in the Asia Pacific which means thousands of more pilots are going to be required which means era medical support for the industry is going to only increase over time the specialty training program is an opportunity the Australasian College of aerospace medicine is a four-year training program mentored it's very similar to the occupational medicine training program but requires some clinical experience over the first few years of your careers followed by some postgraduate work and a deployment of aviation medicine and then a mentored training program towards a fellowship of aerospace medicine this is very interesting to the military at the moment and they're trying to retain doctors within the military who can specialize in aerospace medicine and make that their primary career as a military doctor to that end there are military registrar's but they have just been created in the last 12 months registrar training positions at the airline so Qantas and virgin both have registrar positions the the regulator a casa has a registrar position it is my fervent hope going forward that we can increase those registrar positions within the Space Agency and potentially within the Australian Transport Safety Bureau in Axum investigation actually just go back on there the Space Agency as I mentioned stood up on on 1 July which is really citing and we're yet to see how that pans out but the aim there is to accelerate the growth of the space industry in Australia and see if to make a keep pace with global growth in space we have plans to go deep into space NASA is currently looking at missions to the the lunar orbit region of our sort of moon earth system but we're also looking at missions beyond that to Mars probably in the next 15 to 20 years the other big thing of course is commercial space tourism Virgin Galactic is still on track Blue Origin is another company looking at commercial space operations and once that is fare-paying merry-go-round rides at the moment I guarantee you within the next sort of twenty to thirty years that that fun ride that people paying hundred and well probably two hundred thousand dollars for a ticket for that's going to turn into purposeful travel in the early days of fixed-wing aviation we started with Barnstormers coming out of the first world war as pilots not knowing what to do so they flew people around for the giggles people would pay money that go for a Baron storm ride they'd land and it wasn't too long before those fun rides turned into purposeful point-to-point transport so at the moment the opportunity that exists will be point-to-point transport suborbital or hypersonic which is on the cards as well the challenges that our specialty face are many we tend to wear two hats in that we have a clinical role that's true we're and as doctors we always put the clinical hat on first we are patient advocates but in aerospace medicine often there is a regulatory role to be considered you have to take a step back from being a clinical doctor and say right I'm not treating you right now I'm assessing you for your safety to do a particular role we also have the problem of pilots being very motivated being very healthy but if they do get a problem most pilots in fact astronauts too they don't tell you they want to keep flying and they're fearful of being grounded so that is the reverse malingering that you might see not see so much in other general occupational medicine we have a problem of being too risk-averse of course grounding everybody that can't fly cuz of a medical problem we would have no pilots so what we have to do a lot of is risk management so we don't ground people we look at how we can in an evidence-based way get people flying safely managing the risk and there's been a bit of an issue with that into the regulatory space just lately with our Civil Aviation Safety Authority widening back some of the regulatory aspects of civil aviation and loosening off some of the requirements for medical standards which is an ongoing discussion between doctors and castle Perth now London 17 hours you all know that flight the 787 Qantas is doing direct flights the flight durations that we are flying are getting longer and longer we have to be able to mitigate that risk not only for the flight crew but for the passengers so Qantas has been looking really intently at how they manage the environment to make that happen we've got mental health issues of concern you may be aware of the Germanwings disaster in Europe some years ago which was the result of one of the pilots having some mental health health concerns and deliberately crashing an aircraft which raised a whole bunch of privacy concerns about release of information as well but those concerns are ongoing how do you assess the mental health of these pilots doing their job and it talks back to what I made was saying earlier about even the mental health of doctors in the military context new aircraft coming online the f-35 lightning you see pictured there is the new generation fighter aircraft the Air Force will be getting and that brings with it a bunch of physiological and human factors challenges so there are many challenges that we face and we will face over the next few years and one of those in fact is our College seeking AMC recognition as its own specialty so can we inform clinical practice I think we can from an aviation perspective the risk management principles I've talked to you about I think can be used to manage risk in clinical practice so there are lots to be learned lots of crossover there we can I think learn a lot in the way that aviation investigates incidents and accidents in a no blame culture in how we do that in medicine because at the moment I think in medicine it's very much much about you're at fault it's about litigation in aviation that's not the case it's a no blame safety safety focused culture we can learn a lot in medicine from simulation we've done simulation in aviation for both since the early days of powered flight but of course in medicine now increasingly we're using simulations to train emergency procedures to train emergency management techniques in man for example as a an automated system to do that kind of training fatigue management armored was talking about fatigue tired doctor did not make good doctors and audio tied pilots make good pilots and I think there's a lot to be learned in medicine from the crew Judy limits for example that are applied to aircrew across the world so that they don't fly when they are excessively tired public health is important disease transmission as global aviation increases the risk of disease transmission globally of course increases we're becoming a smaller planet not just in terms of getting from A to B but in the way that we can transmit infections across the world pass passenger safety on aircraft I mentioned the long haul flying but other aspects of safety and crash worthiness and and in making sure that our ill patients are fit to fly how many of you if you are confronted with a patient in front of you that said doc oh you know with my heart disease when my diabetes on these medications can I fly that 17 hour flight from Perth to London making sure that they're safe to do that dealing with in-flight medical emergencies I have that opportunity just last year I got called twice on the same flight to manage met has anybody been called and managed something in flight as a medical student usually I'd say is there a doctor on the plane if there's not a doctor you might get called as well but but twice on the same route from Melbourne to London it was and we need to advise on how best to manage those sort of problems and then of course era medical retrieval as a whole specialty onto itself in terms of space medicine these are all the issues that we can learn from the research that's going on to keep astronauts safe in space and mitigate the effects of microgravity we could learn from that we can learn how to deal better with osteoporosis and muscular disorders from the muscle atrophy that astronauts experience in terms of managing the vestibular problems that occur in space in microgravity managing vestibular problems on earth protecting from radiation developing pharmaceuticals there are some molecules you can only make in microgravity and this is a great laboratory for developing novel pharmaceuticals monitoring astronauts physiologically biomedically can translate into the miniaturization and monitoring and other techniques that we can use on earth to manage patients in intensive care units or in neonatal intensive care units and the way that we analyze that data we can utilize telemedicine and robotic techniques learned in space a lot of telemedicine or a lot of robotics and robotic surgery is calling upon techniques that have been developed over the years for the use of robotic arms in space from for example on the international space station and rural and remote care it doesn't get more remote than Mars if we're going to deal with astronauts on Mars it's a 20 minute turnaround time to get a message from Mars to earth and another 20 minutes to get another message back that's as remote as it gets but I think we can learn a lot about how to manage rural and remote communities here on earth by how we develop techniques to do that for our astronauts if you're really interested in getting involved in aerospace medicine the professional bodies in our country I think I've mentioned a college of aerospace medicine there's the website the Australasian Society of aerospace medicine has a conference coming up in Alice Springs in a couple of months that's the website there and the aerospace Medical Association is the largest organization in the world that's the American organization and they have a conference in the US it may each year and that usually is attended by about two to two-and-a-half thousand doctors from all around the world for you guys if you're contemplating career path I think going forward there will be increasing opportunities within the regulator within Qantas who currently employed two doctors Virgin Australia employs medical officers but the military is probably the most common place where you'll find people working in this specialty and that's really the most intense place I guess to do it because the challenges the physiology is just that much more interesting and challenging GPS as GPS if you choose family medicine and general practice as your career path you can certainly do aerospace medicine as well and by doing aircrew medicals becoming a designated aviation medical examiner and indeed any other specialty from cardiology to neurology to even to psychiatry we need all those specialties in aerospace medicine to help with opinions and you can do that Plus have a special interest in aviation on the side I would like to think going forward space medicine will become increasingly important from the research that we can contribute in Australia knowing that we do have fantastic research capabilities and big an international efforts both flight is an international effort I think we need to contribute more to that as we go forward over the next several years if you are interested particularly in space there is a course you can do that we run through the society the humans and space challenges for exploration that'll be running again 1 2 3 September in Melbourne this year two three day course giving you an introduction to the fundamentals of the challenges of human spaceflight and it really is a fun course we have a faint faculty teaching nap so I think I've got through the the formal part of the talk really just leaves time for plenty of time for questions if there are any but I hope you've just been able to give you a bit of a sense of what aerospace medicine is once upon a time there wasn't a career path in Australia but now thankfully with the advent of those registrar positions in the college we do have that ability so thanks for listening and hopefully I can answer some questions for you okay thank you so much Gordon for joining us all the way from Adelaide to tell us more about aerospace medicine I think I can speak for everyone here as you said at the start that it's not something we get to hear about in medical school so it was really nice to have the opportunity today to hear more about it we're going to take a couple of questions guys so if anyone in the audience has a question pop up your hand and we can bring your cube to you are there's one at the back there I guess my question is Elon Musk company SpaceX has a bit of an ambitious goal to get a team to Mars by 2022 giving this only four years away how likely do you think that is of happening and happening safely yes that's the big question I think Iran's technology and ambition potentially is outstripping our ability to keep people safe at this point the three big problems we need to solve before we go to space safely microgravity radiation and the isolation of psychology issue we really don't have a good handle on all of that at the moment and that obviously the research is ongoing the fact that he wants to go that quickly I don't think were going to have the answers in that time one is assuming and hoping that they are return missions I do know that there are other companies around the world you know I think was Mars one was the company you might have heard of them doing a big recruiting push all around the world they had about 200,000 people applied for a no return trip to Mars I found find out really quite extraordinary but they narrowed that down to a small field of candidates but I got quiet I don't know whether this planning to do that you know if you don't want to do it safely send people on a no return mission if you want to do it safely most of the space agencies around the world are looking at return missions so Eastern NASA JAXA Ross cosmos they're all planning to get people there and get them back safe the question is though I mean even if you get the meso and get them back I've heard a trip to Mars described as a three-year radiation shower and the implications of that going forward in terms of risk to health of the astronauts cancer risk reproductive risk and so on we don't have a good handle on that we haven't sent people to space for that long the longest we've sent people to space is sort of just over 12 months there's a Russian that currently holds the record the record holding American is Scott Kelly just over 12 months that was a twin study he and his brother his brother stayed on earth Scott went to space the the fact is the longer than that we just not have any experience and those missions were low-earth orbit where the radiation is entirely different to deep space when you go to Mars because you within the protection of the Earth's magnetic field in low-earth orbit the International Space Station is only 400 kilometres up we're talking about going tens of millions hundreds of millions of kilometers that's very different hopefully that answers your question any more questions from the audience oh yeah um so just you briefly spoke about infections on the plane how often do they happen so for example if there's like a flu breakout and stuff like that yeah general I mean if you talk about cabin air quality that's always a an old chestnut in a vexed question people get really quite concerned about cabin air quality and getting sick on aeroplanes to be honest the cabin air quality on modern aircraft is actually really good you're much more likely to get sick sitting in a cinema next to somebody with a cold you know watching a Star Wars movie honor on a plane you've got you know high efficiency filters that filter the air and you know the particulates are taken out most of the chemicals that exist are in such low concentrations as to theoretically not cause any any problems and the newer aircraft types are now using pressurization systems that are even safer still the aircraft that you generally fly on here in Australia 737 and 767 and so on they're pressurized through the bleed from the engines there is possible contamination from that but the 787 the Qantas flight for example person London is completely independent of that engine system it's much cleaner air coming in an electrically driven pump in terms of infection potential again unless you're sitting in the row next to or immediately adjacent to somebody with an infection it's highly unlikely that infection will be transmitted but it's more about transmitting infection from one population one country to another and you may remember when the the bird flu scare came out some years ago they were actually doing thermal imaging of people coming off your place to see if they were febrile and anybody febrile it's got a hold aside and tested just to try and minimize that transmission but it's global aviation increases in population or passenger numbers increase I think we have to be increasingly aware of that potential for transmission of different viruses and other agents internationally yes so like in those cases of breakouts you could say the disease's flew from one country to another that's very good and I thought I was bad with dad Joyce that's really good end of the day as well that's pretty impressive we'll just finish up with one quick question from the app so dr. Kable you said that you got into aerospace medicine because of your love for flying do you still have the opportunity to fly much now no you know I tell you what flying if you really want to know it's a very expensive hobby even back when I started to learn to fly as an intern so burning holes in the sky and spending lots of money with a little as we call them bug smashers is it does take its toll on the finances so I gave up flying a few years ago in favor of flying simulators so my I love now although I've still technically got a pilot's license I don't exercise it that much but I do go fly a 737 simulator from time to time to keep my hand in and I couldn't do that in the real world so that's a really good way to stay familiar with the aircrew environment keep your flying skills up a little bit but also it's just really good fun and you've got to keep having fun absolutely guys can you please give Gordon Cable another big round of applause for joining us today he's birthday",

today I'm going to show you five easy three ingredient snack ideas that will satisfy your sweet tooth and get you through to dinner we're kicking things off today with my PB&J yogurt parfait and of course it's really easy to make because it's only got three ingredients so I'm starting with some vanilla yogurt in a bowl and to that I'm going to add a few tablespoons of crunchy peanut butter I like using crunchy because I think the texture is better but go ahead and use smooth if that's what you have on hand no big deal I'm going to whisk this all together and then pour my peanut butter yogurt into a jar and top it with a couple teaspoons of jam and if you want to add a little more crunch you can top it with some crushed peanuts technically this is still just three ingredients because natural peanut butter there's nothing but peanuts anyway next I've got my banana almond snack bites now all I'm going to do is take a whole wheat tortilla spread some almond butter on it and then roll up a banana I'm going to cut it into slices using a sharp knife and basically what you end up with is like Nana's sushi we're going to talk about the easiest recipe I've ever made um show I think this might be it if you're really lazy you can just eat the wrap as is and forget cutting it that's fine too next on this menu is my cherry chocolate Trail Mix now have a look at how easy this is to make so I'm simply combining some roasted salted almonds some dried cherries and some chocolate chips I'm going to stir this all together and then divvy it up into individual portions I like to pre portion these because otherwise let's be honest you just munch on this all there next I'm making some really simple Froyo bites using some vanilla yogurt some dried cranberries and some crushed pistachios but you can really top these with whatever kind of toppings you like sprinkles chocolate chips crushed nuts the world is your oyster I'm going to be filling each of my muffin cups with some vanilla yogurt I'm using these handy dandy little parchment paper liners nothing sticks to them I like it once you portion them out into your muffin tin you just want to put them in the freezer for at least a couple hours and then they're ready for you when your next snack attack is finally we've got some chocolate hazelnut energy bite and I'm just gonna come right out and say it these taste like Nutella in the bowl of my food processor I'm combining some pitted dates some cocoa powder and some hazelnuts now I've toasted my hazelnuts and remove the skin but you can also buy them this way at the bulk food store it's totally up to you if you find hazelnuts a little bit expensive you can also do this with peanuts and then they end up tasting like a peanut butter cup and there is nothing wrong with that we're gonna give all of this a good list in the food processor until it's well combined and what you end up with when you're done is this really fine paste that is sticky we are going to rule it into a little ball and then if you wanted to you could roll these in a little more cocoa powder to make them extra pretty and they are ready for snacking and there you have it five three ingredients knack ideas that will satisfy even the most serious sweet tooth I really hope you guys will give these ideas a try and if you do don't forget to share them on Twitter or an Instagram because you know I love seeing your creation and for more great snack ideas feel free to check out these videos and if you have any snack ideas I haven't thought of don't forget to leave them in the

the stores to pick out your grapes make sure to look for a green stem to indicate that they're very fresh and at the same time look to make sure you see a powdery texture on the grapes this does not mean they're dirty it just means there have been freshly picked the more powder you see the fresher the grape is combine two kids fire market and look for these two varieties of grapes",

out wedges there the seed look there's another one let see how this one split it's like it's starting to germinate already inside the apple what do you do after you get your seeds and you harvest them take some potting soil pick your potting soil in a container like such as this this is an old mushroom container that we bought mushrooms in filled it up with potting mix moisten the potting mix taking a pencil poking a hole take your Apple seed how long how deep is the hole well it's probably a little deeper than it needs to be it should be rent an inch right yeah and half-inch lot of seeds only go down 1/4 inch plant got apple seed in there then you mix up the potting soil and now there's an apple seed in there so there's my heart I think I have like 25 little apple trees find it in here mm-hmm and then again enjoy your Apple and you want to enjoy your Apple so you cut out you want to get rid of your little core piece like that hard and your apples ready to eat I'm usually about

But they have a problem that limits their ability\nto do their mission. Our research focused\non solving the problem and it led to an unexpected\npath of discovery for neurological diseases and cancer. The problem results\nfrom the specialized equipment that the Navy SEAL divers use, including the oxygen rebreather. The advantage of the rebreather\nis that there are no bubbles so it's very quiet and helps the SEAL\nevade detection from the enemy. The disadvantage \nof the oxygen rebreather is that the high levels of oxygen and the pressure\nfrom the undersea environment causes a potential for a seizure. These seizures occur\nwith little or no warning and there is no effective\nmitigation strategy to prevent them. So the question we ask is\nwhy do the seizures occur and how can we prevent them. To answer this question required funding from the Office of Naval Research to develop a microscope that was installed \ninside a hyperbaric chamber, or a high-pressure chamber. This chamber could simulate\nthe underwater environment and the pressure\nof the underwater environment. Using this technology we demonstrated\nthat neurons in the brain, when subjected to high pressure\nand high oxygen, are overstimulated. The overstimulation of the brain from the high oxygen and pressure causes a decrease\nin brain energy metabolism. When this happens, it causes the potential for a seizure. These oxygen seizures occur\nwith little or no warning and there is no effective way\nto prevent them. These drug resistant seizures are similar to epilepsy patients that have drug resistant seizures, and in the case of patients they can use a special diet\nto prevent these seizures. One example of the patient\nwho used diet is Mike Dancer. Mike used a variety of antiseizure\nmedication, and the medication caused\nsevere side effects and was not able to control his seizures. So, due to the severe side effects Mike stopped\nall the antiseizure medication and when he did it, he saw an increase in his seizure frequency. At about this time Mike discovered there was is a dietary intervention, that he could use to control his seizures. And when he did it,\nhe found a sharp decrease in his seizure frequency. I'm happy to say that Mike\nhas been on the diet for 5 years now, and he's been managing his epilepsy for 5 years without medication. So what is the ketogenic diet? Compared to a normal diet, the ketogenic diet\nis very low in carbohydrates and it's very high in fat. People have used the diet for years to help them regulate their body weight, reduce their body weight, and control or reduce\ntheir blood glucose levels. But most importantly, the ketogenic diet is proven\nto control seizures, when drugs fail. No organization has done more\nto educate the public about therapeutic potential\nof the ketogenic diet than The Charlie Foundation started by Hollywood producer\nJim Abrahams. Jim's son Charlie\nwas stricken with seizures. They were so severe and no amount of drugs could help him. So Jim looked into alternative approaches to manage his son's seizures. And with his research he discovered that the ketogenic diet was being used at Johns Hopkins Hospital, so it was a treatment that was used specifically for pediatric epilepsy. So Jim took Charlie\nto Johns Hopkins Hospital and they worked pretty closely\nwith a dietician there, and within a short amount of time Charlie's seizures were under control. And Charlie was actually\ncured of his epilepsy at Johns Hopkins Hospital with the use of the ketogenic diet. So Charlie is actually off the diet\ncompletely today, and he remains seizure-free. The ketogenic diet is effective for a variety of neurological disorders including Glucose Transporter\nType 1 Deficiency Syndrome. Children with this disorder lack the ability to transport\nglucose into the brain. So their brains are literally\nstarved of glucose and this causes a potential for seizures. So it's known that, you know, the brain can use glucose\nas the primary fuel, but it can readily adapt\nto using ketones for energy. So in this way the brain\nis like a hybrid engine, right? So it uses glucose as the primary fuel but during periods\nof limited glucose availability the brain can readily adapt to using this alternative fuel source. So we are exploiting\nthe neuroprotective effects of ketones by developing ketone supplements\nfor the Navy SEAL divers for oxygen seizures. So the advantage\nof the ketone supplement is that you can circumvent\nthe need for the dietary restriction that's required to elevate and sustain blood levels of ketones. There are many therapeutic\napplications of ketones because nearly all healthy cells in a body can use ketones for fuel\nas an alternative energy source. Surprisingly, cancer cells\nlack the ability to transition from using glucose for fuel\nto using ketones. So, in a way, cancer cells are like\ndamaged hybrid engines. They use large amounts of glucose much more than healthy cells, and they lack this ability\nto transition over to an alternative fuel source. So we can say that \"sugar addiction\" is really the Achilles heel\nof cancer cells. This observation inspired me in the lab, and I asked a question, I wondered, why very little attention\nwas being given to nutrition to exploit this weakness of cancer cells. So, it turns out that the sugar addiction was actually observed over 80 years ago\nby Otto Warburg. So, Otto Warburg did experiments, he won a Nobel prize\nfor these experiments, demonstrating that [cancer] cells\nare damaged in their metabolism and the damage in their metabolism results in high amounts of sugar uptake. More recently, Thomas Seyfried\nfrom Boston College has been a pioneer, really,\nin validating Warburg's hypothesis and proving that cancer\nis a metabolic disease. In Tom's experiments, he demonstrated that there is a specific, metabolic defect of cancer cells\nas glucose dependency, and that we can target that with a variety of non-toxic\nalternative approaches. Oncologists target this weakness\nin cancer cells, which is excess glucose consumption, with something called a FGD-PET Scan. The PET Scan actually shows the excess consumption\nof glucose in cancer cells relative to the healthy tissues\nsurrounding it. So this allows for the imaging\nof excess glucose consumption that oncologists use. But this information really isn't used to exploit the cancer\nfor a treatment modality. The excess glucose consumption\nof cancer cells allows them to thrive and proliferate in a low oxygen environment. Another interesting observation\nthat we made in the lab is that high pressures of oxygen are actually damaging to cancer cells. We've demonstrated that when high levels of oxygen\nare given to cancer cells that they overproduce\noxygen free radicals, and these are damaging\nto the cell membrane. At high magnification we can observe bumps on the surface of the membrane that are indicative of membrane damage. What's most interesting is\nthat the same level of oxygen that damaged the cancer cells was non-toxic to the healthy brain cells. These observations inspired us to test the combination of the ketogenic diet\nand hyperbaric oxygen in a mouse model of metastatic cancer. The glowing regions on the screen, show the growth and the spread of metastatic cancer cells. This study demonstrated\nthe therapeutic efficacy of a new, non-toxic, alternative approach to cancer management. So what started out\nas a Navy SEAL project and then led to a promising\nmitigation strategy for the oxygen seizures in the form of ketone supplements ultimately led us down a path to this unexpected discovery. So the question is, can we manage cancer\nwith non-toxic strategies? I believe that we can. And I've been inspired by a number of seizure patients\nand cancer patients that have used these alternative methods to manage their incurable diseases. Future treatments and prevention\nof many diseases may fall back on the ancient\nwisdom of Hippocrates, when he said, \"Let food be thy medicine.\" Thank you.

things that MIT was doing Oh a few months ago and was had a real pleasure about a month ago of sitting down with them and having a conversation and he blew my mind with the stuff that he was telling me it was absolutely incredible so we're gonna learn today about what he and his group are doing at at vgh ICU but not only about the state of state of our clinical city of the our clinical care for brain injury but but the ramifications that it has for clinical care for all of us and even beyond traumatic brain injury and and he's going to talk a little bit about that so MIT padam comes with fantastic credentials if you can imagine completing your primary residency and completing your ICU training and then deciding to go to Oxford and do another two years just in neurocritical care and then bring this fantastic stuff back home it's you know my hats off to him for for doing what he's what he's doing and probably one of the most knowledgeable guys in the actual management of patients with traumatic brain injury so I'm gonna hand it over to you map and thank you so much for for coming and talking to us if you feel like with that introduction I'm going to woefully disappoint I'll do my best but is that working is that okay yeah so so first of all thank you very much thank you for the introduction Jim and thank you for the opportunity and appreciate you guys coming out on a Wednesday morning to listen to me ramble or for an hour so it won't be that long but but we'll certainly have some time for questions so I'm going to talk to you about that the updates of traumatic brain injury management and specifically I'm not gonna focus on trials and I'm not gonna focus on p-values and capital Mike Meyer curves and so forth but talking about actual patient physiology the bedside individualized resuscitation that you deliver patients and how to do that and and and also talk to you specifically about that approach as it pertains to a functional interdisciplinary and in interdivisional programmatic type of care so the neurocritical care program a bgh i'd be remiss to not mention these two organizations for giving me some money for a fairly mediocre research career all right historical TBI management this is not that long ago 1960 this is what TBI care consisted of that John Hopkins this is a gentleman in the recovery position to avoid aspiration here he's got a condom catheter on he's got an oral airway there's supplemental oxygen and everybody cross their fingers and hope for the best and and this type of care actually didn't really evolve until the 1980s when certain things started to change and so since then they're tremendous amount of interest into pursuing though evidence-based medicine in traumatic brain injuries and unfortunately trial after trial whether it pertains to ICP monitoring decompressive craniectomy hypothermia another trial of decompressive craniectomy red cell transfusion have repeatedly come up negative and so there's been this notion in traumatic brain injury or brain injury as a whole that the injury that you have at the time of ictus is what you're left with it is not modifiable I'm gonna make the argument that it actually is and unfortunately I think we've suffered in a couple of respects from these trials and then being negative mainly because we don't appreciate it in us and when I say we I mean medicine as a whole and I mean critical care we are so stupid in the way that we approach this disease if you think about traumatic brain injury traumatic brain injury is a syndrome it's not a disease it's a name that we have applied to an entity where there's blunt trauma to the brain that results in a GCS of 8 or less and if I show you a few patients like patient number one who has diffuse axonal injury where the brain on CT scan appears structurally normal but there's small hemorrhage throughout the brain there's a rotational injury where the optional and shake back and forth and there's ruptures of the micro vasculature that in the thala by and the basal ganglia and the corpus callosum in critical areas of the brain in the cortex that result in a decreased level of consciousness that gives you a GCS in less than eight patient number two with a subdural hemorrhage with midline shift where the parenchymal is largely intact that gives you a GCS of less than eight and then there's patient number three where you have also a intraparenchymal contusion which gives you a GCS of less than eight that's all traumatic brain injury but those are actually different diseases different natural histories different physiologic consequences but the failure that we've made is that we group these patients into large trials and we study them together and unfortunately we don't look at the underlying physiological characteristic because each three of these patients have different diseases the only thing in common was a motor vehicle accident now each of these patients though we do know will their injury will be modifiable with the prevention of secondary injury I'm going to focus on that and describe what that is so I'm not going to talk to you a lot about evidence-based medicine like I show you Kappa markers I'm not gonna show you p-values and all that sort of stuff but instead I'm gonna as one of my mentors in England used to say you know maybe you should always focus on evidence-based medicine but you should never forget about the medicine based evidence and that's the individualized resuscitation of your patient at the bedside using physiological principles to optimize oxygen delivery improve utilization and prevent secondary injury and we start off with a case though so this is Jamie permission to share and at the time of her injury in 2015 she was a freestyle skier in fact was enroute she was second in the world ranked second in the world she was enroute to to attend the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea unfortunately at the world tour finals in Whistler on April 5th she suffered a fall in the halfpipe and so she was intubated on scene and then she was hell datura site her CT scan was associate with those dreaded words diffuse axonal injury an injury pattern which we have typically associated with a vegetative state her MRI in fact confirmed grade three diffuse axonal injuries so not only did she have small microhemorrhages throughout the cortex through the deeper structures of phthalimide but also into the brainstem and in fact her examination confirmed she was Dussehra by posturing and then she underwent a cardiac arrest on the hill so here she is being transferred down and this is her in our unit now if we were to plug her characteristics into a large scoring system the impact score what we would find is that her chance of mortality was in excess of 60-percent and her chance of an unfavorable outcome was in excess of 90% of six months so keep that in mind we're going to come back to that at the end so I talked a little bit about secondary injury well what is that secondary injury is the additive hypoxic or ischemic injury that is suffered by the patient from second one after the initial active two weeks thereafter that is modifiable you can't do anything about the fact that somebody went through a windshield or fell off their bike or was a ped struck but you can prevent secondary injury so those neurons which aren't dead right or which are staggering along they can be rescued in fact now our brain is only 2 or 2% of our body weight but consumes 25% of our cardiac output because it is so metabolically active and because it has no inherent energy stores is insanely susceptible to additional hypoxic injury and if that's not corrected or if secondary injury is not mitigated well that results in cell death of course and that is a cornerstone of TBI critical care management ok and in fact yourselves have the biggest impact of that because you know we always talk about the golden hours talk about the golden hour of sepsis but in fact the golden hour of traumatic brain injury is probably equally equally as important and the only reason that we don't harp on it is because the brain is so poorly studied is the hardest organ to access this is the difference between normal brain and injured brain so here on this electron microscope slide and of a patient and here you've got a blood vessel here you've got astrocyte env processes surrounded by neurons and axons over here this is what happens after traumatic brain injury this is secondary injury there's vacuole ization of those neurons there's cytotoxic cerebral oedema there's Perry vascular cerebral edema there's contraction of the blood vessel all of which results in lower cerebral blood flow lower oxygen delivery and then an exacerbation of the of the injury on the right seeing a different way in a cartoon figure this is sort of kind of what it looks like here you've got a dendrite you've got an axon you got options molecules got glucose you've got astrocytes and there nfe processes after an injury there's Micro thrown by the blood-brain barrier breaks down there's neutrophil diabetes this is an inflammatory change in fact there's depletion of glucose neuro black copy near brain hypoxia which ultimately results in a reduction of oxidative phosphorylation produced ATP and then cell death so how do we prevent that well it's kind of like a teeter totter there's the two sides to this is one optimizing oxygen delivery and the other one is optimizing oxygen utilization I'm gonna entirely focus on the oxygen delivery aspect to this because auction utilization is a totally separate topic in and of itself so surive oxygen delivery is a control x o2 content the o2 content part of this is easy because that's predominantly determined by hemoglobin but in fact the dissolved portion becomes very very important after throughout brain injury stream of blood flow we estimate with serial perfusion pressure as you know is map - ICP and ICP there's a variety of determinants of intracranial pressure one of which is venous return to carbon dioxide three temperature and in for sodium so I'm gonna focus on all those physiological parameters for the remainder of this talk like I said I'm not going to miles PubMed is for that but what I'm going to show you is individual patient files of the physiology changing in front of your eyes to sort of hammer home these points so let's talk about intracranial pressure first intracranial pressure in and of itself the absolute number is probably not that important okay we should be hell-bent on reducing ICP to less than 20 in everybody but in fact it's probably individual dependent and what's more important about ICP is not the absolute number but where one lies on this spectrum of this curve the compliance curve so what you're actually doing with the integrative pressure is you're trying to determine where your patient is along this curve and here's a here's a mass expanding of all or a volume of a mass expanding lesion so we are all sitting over here at a low volume and at a normal pressure as compensatory mechanisms like venous return like CSF shunting out of the intracranial space become exhausted we start to escalate up this curve very quickly and so this is limited compensatory reserve ventricles can only clap so much the veins can only clap so much and in shunt venous flow out of the brain and eventually you've got exhausted compensatory reserve and this is where herniation occurs so all the therapies that we're gonna discuss coming up are all designed to drag a patient back down this curve and keep them sort of in this what we think it is is health a healthy and safe safe place see in a different way it sort of looks like this where you've got four components of the intracranial or intracranial volume you've got the brain matter arterial volume which largely doesn't become change apart from one physiologic phenomenon which I'll show you later but the CSF in the venous vasculature those are the two compensatory mechanisms because they're low pressure compartments those a mass starts to take place whether it be a tumor epidural hematoma a subdural hematoma intraparenchymal hematoma cerebral edema those two compartments accommodate up until a point where they can't do so anymore and then one herniates well let's talk about this again one more time let me just go through this I'm going to show you the importance of venous return now venous return is critically important reason being part of the reason it's so important is our CSF also gets reabsorbed into the superior sagittal sinus that's how CSF exits the intracranial space predominantly it gets reabsorbed in the street in the superior sagittal sinus and then drains down into the sigmoid sinus and then into your internal jugular veins so in fact venous return not only drains the blood volume but also the CSF volume positioning we know that positioning is important question is how important we know that or sorry--and position position let me just touch on this for a second it's so critically important reason being the force of gravity takes venous blood back from the intracranial space and then takes it to to the to the thoracic space and to the cardiovascular system now so anything obstructing that flow will lead to venous and Gorge meant an increase venous volume and then a subsequent potential intrapreneur hypertension which can be catastrophic so anything that obstructs that whether they be endotracheal tube ties c-collars had a bed flat high intrathoracic pressure for like a tension pneumo or high peep can can be deleterious so here's a real-life patient and just to handle um the points of how important in fact this is so what you have here you got we've got ICP on the x-axis or party may wonder why actually we've got time in minutes on the y-axis or x-axis so here's a patient charting along just perfectly fine at ICP attend patient was laid flat for an x-ray and almost instantaneously you can see the ICP shoot up to 20 and in fact once the x-ray was over in the bed had a bed was back at 30 the ICP were reduced by about 5 to 7 millimeters mercury air pressure that is a lot to put that into perspective a decompressive craniectomy in fact only reduces ICP by about 8 to 10 millimeters mercury pressure okay it's a simple maneuver is cheap if feasible relatively easy to do here's another patient same thing patients trotting along about an ICP of 10 had a bed flat for an x-ray and then we put the head of bed back at 30 and and then the ICP reduces to about 10 the other important thing here is this occurs within a minute or two it's not like this takes time smelly this takes time for like a patient to go to the operating room get an EBD for CSF diversion which can take an hour or two this will occurs within minutes and in fact so highlighting the importance of positioning in fact here this patient this is kind of an extreme example because this patient arrived to us with a hard collar and the face was somewhat purple probably from it being on so tight in fact all we did was just loosen it to the point where you could get your fingers through I'm not saying that see colors are important that's not I'm saying at all but in fact I don't need to be strangulating somebody probably and in fact here you can see see color removed in you by yourself about ten millimeters mercury of ICP change how about carbon dioxide well we know carbon dioxide arterial carbon dioxide tension is critical reason being hypocapnia at least the cerebral basal constriction and hypercapnia vasodilation for every millimeter of carbon dioxide arterial carbon dioxide tension is reduced by a millimeter the cerebral blood flow drops off by about two percent okay and vice versa for every millimeter that goes above 40 it increases by about two percent this is a real as our colleagues in Cambridge who did this study where they took patients with TB I took him into a PET scanner and then did cerebral blood flow and oxygen extraction Studies on them at normal cacnea hypercapnia and hypocapnia and what they found was patients exposed to hypocapnia sustained hypocapnia for 20 to 30 minutes in fact dropped their Ceibal blood flow by about 10 percent dropped their or increase their oxygen extraction by about 10 percent further more than that the IBV is the ischemic brain volume patients exposed to a paco2 of less than 35 for 20 to 30 minutes about a hundred mils of their brain became a skimming 10% ten percent of the brain became a seaman and probably the most important 10 percent the watershed areas right the thalamus the basal ganglia the hippocampal so very very critical areas became ischemic highlighting the importance of of co2 control in fact this is a real-life patient it doesn't project all that well but here's one of our patients where you've got weir end-tidal co2 and this is in minutes over here and what happened here is this patient was warmed at the state ventilation we didn't change the minute ventilation so the end tidal co2 in fact went up only by about five to ten millimeters mercury pressure but the ICP spiked to about 40 then once we changed the minute ventilation back down on the ventilator and tidal comes down and so does ICP the in fact Marik mirrored each other so in this case hypercapnia but two vasodilation blood engorgement and then increased ICP here's another case where similar sort of thing here the ICP of this patient was about thirty all right this is typically the level in which you would take a patient and take him to the operating room do an EVD or decompressive craniectomy if there are maximal therapy all we did here was we ventilate the patient appropriately and in fact the ICP dropped from about low 30s down to about 15 and more importantly occurred very very quickly so maintenance of normal cap Nia is critical how about temperature well we know for every degree of core body temperature that the brain increases blood flow goes up by about 10 percent and so in fact in this patient ICP about twenty thirty seven nine all we did here was cool them over two hours and then the ICP gradually came down to about twenty or so or uh ten same thing here we lost control on this patient thirty six six pretty good no normal thyroid core body temperature control unfortunately this patient became February there the ICP would up to about twenty temperature changes generally take a little bit longer okay so positioning the changes with ICP is positioning occur very quickly similarly with co2 but temperature changes do take a little bit longer to have an effect I'm gonna skip over that the last thing I'm going to show you is another question I get a lot is well what do i do should I give the patient hypertonic or mannitol to be honest it doesn't really matter the ICP reducing capabilities are the same the one benefit of hypertonic saline is this a slight volume expander and in fact it it will augment through a blood flow by a little bit and so what you in this case is a patient again nice people 30 or so 150 mils of 5% and within about 20 minutes the ICP tapers off down to the low 20s similarly in this patient 5 percent given the ICP comes down more importantly though this is another catheter that we insert into the brain which is an oxygen catheter so it's a cathetus it's directly within the Franklin and measures millimeters mercury of pressure of oxygen within the interstitial of the brain that's our gold standard for oxygen delivery and in fact what you see here is I suppose I see P comes down but in fact P vo2 comes up so augmented oxygen delivery in this case the one downside of mannitol cuz the post osmotic diuresis is you may if you may get some reduction in cerebal blood flow hemoglobin concentration here's a patient you know typically the trip child tells us we should transfuse patients and I firmly believe unnecessary transfusions are bad but then the trick child does tell us that in a non bleeding patient we should transfuse at a human level of greater than 70 we do know and brain as your patients though that that additional anemia may in fact in animal studies certainly does augment secondary injury so in this patient what you see here is in fact we transfuse the patient here here's P Bo - so to put this into context 20 millimeters mercury or pressure means the brain is hypoxic so this patient's hemoglobin is 75 we decide to transfuse the patient and over the course of a few hours the PB to general are gradually starts to come up so these are changes that are occurring in real life and and you only you only see them if we actually look for them then finally the last thing I'm going to show you is in fact oxygen saturation now the dissolve po2 portion is such a small portion of oxygen delivery as as we as we sort of alluded to how every becomes critically important after brain injury and probably has to do with that large diffusion barrier I showed you that electron microscope slide where there's a lot of perivascular deema and so that's critically unfortunate limit amount of oxygen that can be offloaded by hemoglobin in the micro vasculature and so desaturation Zin factory hospital hypoxia is the most predictive physiologic predictor of an adverse outcome and so this is what happens so here's a patient s po2 of about a hundred or so PB o2 is sky-high this patient is well oxygenated patient got a mucus plug SP o2 down to about 82 percent transiently but the oxygen shoebox and delivery fell off very very quickly let me show you one last slide spo2 in this case again ninety-eight percent I'm not sure what happened in this patient went down to about 86 transiently and the PPO to mirrored that fell off very very quickly highlighting the importance of of adequate oxygenation so I've showed you a bunch of physiological interventions you might ask well what do I do with that right so that's a bunch of stuff I don't and you know I'm certainly admire your profession tremendously because you're dealing with 8 million things at once whereas s certainly not the case with me so we've got the time and the luxury of time to do that or to optimize cerebal resuscitation but how can you do this as a bedside well we've recently come out with the checklist it's a one-page checklist and Jim's been tremendously supportive in getting this on the where did you see medicine Health Network and this is also supported by T SBC as well to serve as a checklist for physicians in in sort of maybe I describe a time-limited scenario to go through and and just make sure that all those a few of those neuroprotective interventions which I was showing you are implemented because it really is the golden hour of TBI if there's additional hypoxic hit to the brain early on that's what leads us to prolonged periods of cerebral edema prolonged ICP monitoring and all these sort of things so this is a I think soon will be available on the the Health Network and also through TSP see okay so that was like the nuts and bolts but now I'm going to show you something different I'm going to show you something unique something that you won't see elsewhere outside of probably Cambridge and a few other sites internationally I touched on these three patients and we touched on how they're different how they're different diseases if you think about how we've traditionally managed TBI is we've taken all patients regardless of who you are what type of injury you are place an EVD or an ICP catheter and resuscitate everybody to an ICP of less than 20 now I would say that's that's fine but it's woefully it's a woeful oversimplification of this disease because it doesn't take into consideration the individual variations that patients have not only as individuals and their individual physiology but also their underlying disease the most important thing in preventing secondary injury is in fact optimizing oxygen delivery and blood flow well is there a way that we can individualize that for that patient or for that disease and in fact there is so I'm going to show you something here is and this is personalized resuscitation the question is what's the optimal mean arterial pressure because even all of us in this room right now you know they I'm sure there's like Nate for example you know healthy guy blood pressure probably rhymes 100 on 60 I'm a moderately overweight Indian guy probably run my blood pressure at 100 one hundred and eighty or a hundred and eighty on 100 and so our brains are in fact used to different blood pressures at baseline and so after an injury why do we resuscitate everybody the same doesn't make sense it's an oversimplification of the disease process and so there is a way to target the optimal mean arterial pressure and in fact patients have individualized mean arterial pressures and it gets to this this sort of physiologic phenomenon called Auto regulation which you're all well aware of if we plot three mobile on the y-axis and mean arterial pressure on the x-axis in a healthy population we maintain cerebral blood flow roughly between 50 and 150 a map of 50 and 150 we're below 50 there's a pressure passive vasodilation occurring this is why we faint the brain becomes hypoxic we go into the recumbent C position to augment blood flow above 150 this is where intracranial hemorrhage occurs hypertensive encephalopathy hemorrhagic transformation hyperemia right so bad areas bad up there and then ischemia down here and but we're all happy over here and so our brain does this on our own and the reason it does this and like I said in the ischemic zone there's pressure past the basal dilation for every increase of pressure of mean arterial pressure the blood vessels Basel dilate there's these l-type calcium channel receptors within the the smooth muscle of the super basket or that wake up and say whoa whoa too much blood flow they start to phase or constrict all right when they start to vasoconstrictors cerebral blood volume drops off within the preserve zone and then there's that breaking point where they can't accommodate anymore they can't take it and ergo vasodilation question is what happens after TBI I was always taught that it says that this was a direct straight-line autoregulation is lost and in fact in most patients it's not what actualized and then one other thing I should mention is ICP also changes within the zone of autoregulation so in the ischemic zone here pressure passive vasodilation leads to an increase in blood volume hence the intracranial pressure goes up with it and then because of that cerebral Veysel constriction which is appropriate ICP comes down and then it goes up in the ischemic range again after TBI autoregulation is preserved in the majority of patients but the window is narrowed it's highly individual is dependent upon the underlying disease and and it changes from day to day so if I were to draw the same ICP curve what ends up happening in TBI is the same thing in the ischemic zone as map increases ICP increases because of pressure passive vasodilation and then it decreases in the narrowed zone and then it increases in the hyperemic zone now if we derive moving Pearson's correlation coefficient in real time so it's only comparing fluctuations between ICP and map you can figure out where this zone is now follow me here so because it's a Pearson's correlation coefficient it's only going to vary between plus one if there's a positive correlation between two variables then minus one if there's a negative correlation so as the map increases here the IACP increases that's a positive correlation conversely in the narrowed zone as the map starts to increase in the narrowed zone the ICP decreases that's a negative correlation so see in a different way it sort of looks like that that Pearson's correlation coefficient positive in the scheme Excel and positive in the hyper UNIX zone but negative in the preserve zone that correlation coefficient this is what our colleagues who work the better part of the last 15 years in Cambridge discovering they've turned that pressure reactivity index now if you plot the entire mean arterial pressure range against PR X pressure reactivity index plus 1 and then minus 1 down here you get a u-shaped curve so what ends up happening is something like that and it's the nadir of that curve which is that patient's optimal map so it's sort of like Goldilocks you don't want it too high not too low but just right in fact this is one of our patients so you see here this I don't know if that's projected all that well this is roughly this is a u-shaped curve here's PR x over here plus 1 and minus 1 and we roughly got a optimal cerebral perfusion pressure of 80 to 100 so this person's autoregulation curve kind of looks like that now the brain trauma Foundation guidelines suggests that we should keep everybody 50 to 70 now if we were to do that in this patient this patient would be critically ischemic additionally here's a different patient a little bit tighter range CPP 92/100 brain trauma Foundation guidelines would say if to 270 this patient be 20 millimeters mercury of pressure lower than the lower inflection point so in the ischemic zone secondary injury will occur and what we would say at the end of this is bad injury this is it real life at the bedside so here's a young girl and now I'm not don't get me wrong we're not we're not indiscriminately pushing pressures this is where I think the nuance of TBI sort of comes into play somebody's got big contusions you're not gonna push pressures in that case because it would be a significant risk of hemorrhagic transformation but if they got diffuse axonal injury where there's no real risk of hemorrhagic transformation those are patients that we ended up we end up eventually pushing quite high so here's a young girl diffuse cerebral edema after a car exam accident from a few sec so no injury here's her CPP and here's her ICP of 20 so she is 34 degrees getting regular hypertonic saline normal capping ventilation sedated she's sort of maxed out on therapy the only things left for her and the ventricles are slit like so she can't have an EVD left for her is a by hemispheric decompression but in fact all we did in this case was we looked at her monitoring and in fact her optimal CPP was much higher than one would typically expect about 120 so the Levophed dose here is 5 mics per minute didn't do really anything fancy but increased it to 8 a few minutes later 5 minutes later the ICP comes down to 12 or 22 not a big change but once we get to a CPP of 120 again the ICP comes down to 11 right so what's happening here over here the brain is critically ischemic it's releasing all sorts of endogenous vasodilators to augment blood flow and all we do in this case is we augment blood flow by augmenting cerebral blood Hogman blood flow by augmenting map and then the ICP dissipates within about 10 minutes these changes occur very very quickly here's an example of what it means with oxygen delivery so here's the CPP right here in red about a hundred or so far higher than the brain trauma Foundation guidelines would suggest that you go here's the PBO - I said a PPO - of twenty or so is the where the brain is norm oxic what ended up happening here was for some reason the CPP fell off below 100 you can see how quickly the cerebral blood or the the street blocks and delivery falls off with it this occurs within minutes conversely over here patient was hypoxic we augmented blood flow you'll notice here when you augment blood flow the ICP comes down a little bit that's that cerebral vascular vasoconstriction occurring PR X to make it easy for all of us who aren't color blind red red is bad green is good okay you can see once we get back to the sweet spot tree Baro through a basil constriction occurs it starts to turn green and then the P Bo - flies up to above 20 so this is the epitome of of individualized resuscitation but you can only do this unfortunately with with some additional monitoring catheters in place which brings me to like sort of a the way that we've approached TBI like I said I was saying earlier you know TBI has traditionally been approached as a fixed disease the ictus the injury that you have is dependent upon the initial injury at the scene but this is all secondary injury yet outcomes have started to get better but the reason and and there's an TBI in fact the clinical or the critical care sort of mantra of TBI is very similar to septic shock in terms of augmenting oxygen delivery right we know that patients with septic shock for example who have oxygen delivery augmented and clear their locked gates and have less organ failure do better in the long term well in fact TBI is the same the golden hour of sepsis certainly applies through the golden hour of TBI but the way that you resuscitate all of you resuscitate septic shock not everybody gets the same amount of fluid not everybody gets the same dose of vasopressin some patients need dobutamine some don't but you individualize the resuscitation of those patients right this now in neurocritical care we like i'm saying we're so dumb we're finally catching up to the rest of Medicine in terms of recognizing the individual variations the individual variations in disease and physiology and individualizing those recessive the resuscitation of those patients now I've showed you some interesting things I'm just gonna take a little sidetrack and I'm going to end off with something for you to think about now showed you monitoring or showed you physiology I've showed you catheters okay all that's fine but unfortunately this can't be done just haphazardly you need a functional program and so that's probably the most valuable thing that my colleague Don I learned in Cambridge was the the development of programmatic care for these patients it's the nursing staff to be honest who need to be doing a lot of these cases per year right if you're only managing 4 to 5 these cases per year or 10 of these cases per year that's probably not enough to disseminate amongst the nursing staff in the unit and the parties and the other physician staff and so in fact you need numbers you need constant education of the staff pre-printed order sets protocols there's a tremendous amount of work that goes into this we also need buy-in any collaboration from neurosurgery and so we're very fortunate to have that and from a trauma surgery colleagues and from our emergency medicine colleagues and for and of course buy-in from administration so it's my good friend and colleague Don Drysdale and I'm very proud to to to now note that in fact not only do we have a functional program but it's it's the largest program in Canada by far in fact half of the cases of multimodal monitoring are done here in Vancouver for all of Canada and we're not far off our colleagues in Cambridge but we do a bunch of things so this is the oxygen catheter that I showed you we insert ICP catheters we also insert this type of catheter which is called a micro dialysis catheter sits within the prank mother brain and gives us crucial crucial information as to what stable lactate is cerebral pyruvate glucose you wanted to measure phenytoin you can measure phenytoin off of this and then we have a blood flow catheter wet measures zero blood flow in real time so you can make pretty changes to mean arterial pressure depending on what your blood flow is telling us we in fact assert these catheters at the bedside so here's Peter go to ham one of the neurosurgeons and then Don just at the bedside placing the catheters in and here's the patient right here we've got this four pronged bolt that sticks out of their head with all these casters and in fact we've done most of these patients I think administration likes this is that we're saving operations and saving them money so most of these patients in fact are had the catheter is inserted at the bedside takes about half an hour or so and we've very recently published these outcomes and so we noticed a few interesting differences one of the things was because of these monitoring devices in fact our mean arterial pressure in our patients is much higher we're using a lot more norepinephrine fortunately in fact troponin levels aren't different no rates of cardiac arrest are atrial fibrillation rate is slightly higher expectedly our temperature control is better and our sodium control is better all this is programmatic care and individualizing the resuscitation of patients and in fact the duration of monitoring is less so this is pre and post so our monitoring three days or less and this is probably because we're auctioning the brain better we oxygenate the brain better the cerebral edema dissipates if the cerebral edema dissipates you don't need to sedate patients as long if you don't sedate patients as long we don't ventilate patients as long and then our ICU free days aren't quite significant but but certainly trend in the right direction and most importantly our outcomes are better so pre was about 40% good outcome rate good outcome meaning back to independent life full like back to work importantly paying taxes or or back to independent life but not back to school or back to work but now we're about a 60% good outcome rate Cambridge has about 70 percent favorable outcome rates so we still have some work to do to catch up to them so coming back to that case here's Jamie we went through all her went through all her injury characteristic so grade three diffusive solo injury dis Arabic posturing pretty catastrophic to be honest with you I haven't been out working very long but this is the patient that I can remember created cases in training that we went to come for Carol no question for sure there she was enroute after her cardiac arrest and unfavorable outcome rate of 91% here's dawn putting in her monitoring there's the catheters one of the catheters sitting right there this is the auction catheter sitting right in the white matter frontal lobe white matter and here's her monitoring so you'll see here CPP of about sixty or so like I said brain trauma foundation guidelines was to suggest we are doing awesome CPP of sixty perfect look what the PB o2 is though PB o twos about Oh less than ten put that into context the PB o 2 is zero means no auction in the brain doesn't that is brain guy and so all we do in this case is we augment blood to a little bit well we augment blood flow up to about a CPP of eighty or so PPO to comes up in the brain is norm oxic most importantly look how quickly this is happening within five minutes these changes are occurring so so quick same thing here PBR CPP about 55 btf would say a good job PPO to here though was about three to four so over the course of ten minutes all we did was we augmented CPP ICP comes down because there's that compensatory visa constriction and the po2 and Cruz so there she is and then she came back to see us a year later but it's not just her I want to show you and our permission to share all these a few patients just from this past year but what you see is there a young person after young person after a young person who typically to be honest with you I would have associated many of these young people with dismal outcome vegetative States seven years ago and now it's just a case after case are making really wonderful recoveries and it's not secondary of catheters but its secondary to a program of care between divisions a collaborative effort a multidisciplinary effort okay ask me to leave you with this perhaps in a few months maybe next year sometime I can come back and talk to you about about some of the other things that we're doing but if you think about that's TBI if you think about a similar disease pattern let's take cardiac arrest for example right ninety percent of the outcome in cardiac arrest patient survivors who survived the initial arrest get I see was determined by the inherent subsequent brain injury that occurs from withdrawal of care you know diffuse cerebral edema hypoxic injury great weight loss all that sort of stuff so what if we approached hypoxic brain injury you have to call egress the same way that we approach traumatic brain injury if we think about the parallels they're actually not that different if we think about how we manage tea or a hippie I should say our hypoxic ischemic brain injury it's pretty rudimentary still right you've got a patient who comes in post cardiac arrest and assess intensivist show up to the emergency department and just make asinine comments and suggestions I fully believe that to be honest with you because we show up and we say all Coulomb that 33 or 36 doesn't really matter keep their map at whatever it is and then we'll take them up to the ICU when we can get a bad turn off through sedation at 24 hours they're not waking up then we phone ez transplant right that's pretty crass but it's not that far from what traditionally has happened so what if we took the same approach to optimizing oxygen delivery in cardiac arrest which is one of the things that we've started to do so this is a Donna's basic major program so what we've it's a bit out there again I get it but we're in fact characterizing the pathophysiology of this disease because there is no human studies to tell us what the optimal blood pressure is what the optimal co2 is what the optimal sodium is what the optimal temperature is even if you certainly look at TTM for example awesome study but there is no efficacy in both groups in terms of if temperature adequately achieve the therapeutic benefit of 36 verses 33 in terms of cerebral metabolism are the equivalent in terms of cerebral metabolism reduction ICP reduction seizure threshold reduction so I'm going to show you I'm going to show you a case of a patient which really changed the way that I think that we viewed the world and this is this is Ashley again permission to show 31 year old female wolff-parkinson-white at baseline no drugs at all she's just followed by her cardiologist she's never had a problem with that she had palpitations and that's how she was diagnosed no history of cardiac death or sudden cardiac death and the family it's a full-time student single mom and at 9:00 a.m. she underwent a while in class gender women arrest a couple minutes later her classmates recognize she's in cardiac arrest and started CPR ten minutes later EMS arrived she was different related a bunch initial rhythm was VF had epinephrine and then 35 minutes later they got Ross so a post resuscitation GCS 3 she arrives 12 minutes later at BGH so she got very good management I would say on day 1 in the CCU pupils are 3 millimeters and reactive today was just propofol and fentanyl 36\u00b0 she was cool too with surface cooling and very well her map was in the 70s Levophed roughly about 10 their initial Lochte was close to 8 so fairly fairly significant ischemic hit ECG it was pretty unremarkable in fact she did get a calf immediately as she came in the coordinators are clean and in fact her echo was largely normal here's her CT head on day one just run you through this cisterns are open doesn't project all that well but you can see the salsa there the Sylvian fissure x' the ventricles probably for age or good she's got some salsa have top and great great white differentiations pretty darn good I would look at that CT head even though it's early and say oh you know we're gonna can't really can't really defend with lyc\u00e9e if there's a permanent bad damage okay so day two sedation withdrawn 30 hours post arrest and she's not doing anything initially then day three roughly 24 hours later so 48 hours into this our pupils are eight mate and fixed and in fact we were asked to take over care for organ donation so one of my colleagues repeated her head scan and cistern I think I can convince you the cisterns are gone can't see the intra productive cistern in the quadrigemina cisterns but the great white differentiation is still looked okay and there's lit seems to me there's a lot of cerebral edema there right this all Sargon so here's a 30 year old girl 48 hours into this with that CT scan and their pupils are fixed and dilated so this particular colleague of mine pretty aggressive decided to get an MRI right away and here's here's a b1000 image so white means cytotoxic cerebral edema okay so she's got diffuse bilateral significant burden of cytotoxic edema in the white matter in the corpus callosum in the thalam i in the occipital lobes of vision centers Broca's area like it's diffuse it's bad this is really bad in fact this is the diffusion diffusion weighted images the DWI images a DC map black or dark means that that brain is on the verge of dying or dead or dead so again bilateral significant hypoxic burden bilateral through this hemisphere so with that MRI fixed pupils diffuse dribble edema and 48 hours post you know seems seems like a pretty catastrophic outcomes so in fact it's calling a by decide to give some mannitol and hypertonic saline people's came down then phoned us and said can we put in catheters and my beyond I totally honest this yeah my first inclination was like no I really don't think so this is a this sounds like a pretty bad outcome but he's fairly persuasive so so we ended up giving it a shot and this isn't a picture of dawn putting it in her butt so we put the catheters in at the bedside and just to highlight there's the catheter there's the PPO to catheter right there it's sitting directly within that cytotoxic and edema or that that brain tissue that was on the verge of dying or dead so what we found was this her ICP expectedly was about forty her PPO to way less than 10 in fact down to two or three millimeters mercury pressure so on the verge of that tissue being dead and her prx here meaning that all regulation she wasn't all regulating at all so that seemed like a significant burden of injury in fact her optimal CPP was quite high so you know the AAA says we should keep the map of 65 and all these people and in fact her CPP who was upwards about 90 or so so we ended up pushing her with some norepinephrine this is the day after so here's the map right here about 85 or so the ICP has come down by magnitudes she started to all to regulate again her PB of 2 is about 25 so well oxygenated here's her repeat CT scan cisterns are open she's got a little bit of the Sylvian fissure back the great white is still pretty good and she's got some small sign up talk no question there's still edema there so we went on and kept doing this for about 10 days or so and they three to five so she's monitored with five days with this invasive monitoring sedation was weaned at day six she wasn't doing anything so M one day seven starts to withdraw day nine starts to obey commands fourteen she's excavated and age when seven there's Ashley so a girl who went from fixed pupils diffused cerebral edema was transferred to us for organ donation to be honest with ya who with principles there's no there's no fancy therapies here included there's no fancy medications this is principles of physiology oxygen delivery oxygen utilization there's nothing more to it than that to be honest with you and and so what we started now is we've started putting catheters into patients while studying them so we're just about done that study and perhaps sometime in the future I could come and come back and talk to you because I'll tell you the even the results for me characterizing this disease is physiology I don't know how to look after these patients to be honest with you I don't know how to prognosticate them anymore it's a it's a disease that I think in medicine myself most guilty of all have thought we understood and we have no idea no idea at all in terms of how to prognosticate these people or how to resuscitate them post post Ross so anyways food for thought and with that I'll take some questions and I would like to give a shout out to have certainly been very lucky to come here and talk to you but the real driver to be honest with you behind all this is my good friend colleague and mentor Don Drysdale who's the real champion of this program and and has pushed it forward to what it's become thank you very much [Applause] yes okay all right thanks month I was really interesting I just have a question this is all may I see you or you guys are putting them bolts in people's brains um do you have any recommendations the emerge and these patients come into the emerge and if you think we're doing things radically wrong you know one of the things you mentioned is a lot of these patients need to need higher maps then we've been targeting previously do you think we should be targeting higher maps from the emerge as well yeah that's a good question there's a trial I'm going to right now about this other Belgium and Holland the randomizing patients to 85 versus 65 I still fundamentally think it doesn't make sense because we're what we're trying to do is we're trying to take patients and put them into boxes right whereas the patients are so different so one of the one of the things that first off I think you guys do a phenomenal job to be frank with you the I think one of the things that we we're trying to do in this so in this study that we've just completed where we're putting an invasive catheters we can get the optimal blood pressure and and the optimal math in patients pretty quickly within an hour or two but we're also comparing it against non-invasive monitoring techniques as it pertains to three-block symmetry but also jugular venous oxygen tree so hopefully that I suspect it will give pretty useful information I think that the notion is that patients in fact are unfortunately so different there's you know they're just there they're not uniform they're not the same I think personally I think the map was 65 that the h8 recommends the direct citation from that is the river of study where that recommendation comes from I think it's too long personally I'm so unless there's not another good reason 7580 is what I typically do and then tailor it with monitoring personally yeah I am questioned so in cardiac arrest the petha fizzes essentially hypoxia so but this not be also used for opioid overdose yeah it's a good question so we've done a couple of those patients with opiate the so peep we just had a kid [Music] 23 year old kid last week same thing fentanyl OD and but had a pulse had diffuse cerebral edema and in fact when we put the catheters in him the brain was critically lacking oxygen and in fact in him it was predominantly cerebral edema and high ICP so he had a lot of like cytotoxic and vasogenic edema so if you push pressure in that that guy he just augmented more cerebral edema so in fact we did the opposite kept his blood pressure very low and kept him Cole like 32 degrees indeed for like five days and and he did great", "YqjcWr-lIW0": "[Music] hello everyone it's me the cannabis reviewer i'm back for another exciting week of grow i am growing well first of all we are in our my fall growing season and i'm growing wedding cake and i'm growing killer cheese dog one plant each they're both in their 9th week of flower and today we are going to be making some uh flushing solution watering solution um and i'm going to add a little bit extra to it because the way that the leaves look because i don't think we're gonna be ready with wedding cake just yet i think it's gonna be another week or two so i'm gonna if i don't give her some food a little bit of food i'm afraid we may not have any leaves left to do any good a lot of yellowing going on but that's part of learning that's definitely part of learning so we're going to make that today and i'm going to try to go a little bit quicker because i've bought myself one of these wonderful little st they stirring they stir and they heat all at the same time or both don't don't need to do either one i mean you can do either one separately this will stop me from worrying about shaking it having to shake it and everything and to be honest i had this water this water's been sits on the floor in the shed and it's it's fairly chilly we're going to find out how chilly it is when i when i look at the temperature here but um so i figured what i do is i just heat it up just a little bit and then we'll we'll go from there it it shouldn't take much to heat it up so let's do first thing let's get the water in there get the gallon in here when i'm done with this i'll pour it into my other one and then i'll go ahead and use it today and feed the feed the lady [Music] yeah and this is a 4 pyrex milliliter beaker glass beaker you can get them everywhere internet ebay whatever there you go there's my gallon this probably won't stay i may buy another one of these and see how this works for feeding the plants because it's a smaller diameter but it's not taller but i i can't heat those plastic ones obviously too too much with this so that's obviously going to be a problem so let's see if we can even see what the temperature is what's that saying that's saying about 58 60 degrees right yeah so that's uh that's what i mean i don't want to [ __ ] feed the plant 60 degrees water so we'll turn her on first we'll crank some heat you know you're dealing with some [ __ ] when it [ __ ] turns and this is so cool don't get too crazy with it so we'll let it heat up here that's electric so the [ __ ] of it is it'll stay [ __ ] hot definitely gonna have to turn that that is awesome though can't seem to keep that where i want it but uh besides that everything's awesome so we're definitely warming up a little bit so we'll heat this up for a little bit then i'll come back and we'll put nutrients in okay we're back i'm gonna i'm gonna it's about uh 65 68 now so i'm gonna shut the heater off here real quick anyway we'll shut this off drop [ __ ] on the floor which is always a good thing to do that's how i roll see if we can figure this out turn it the right way all right back up a little more come on focal length you can do it there we go let's see and um that's a hot plate and that that's a hot plate so it's going to stay hot a little bit longer so we'll shut her down that's interesting ain't it that's probably good enough let's leave it at that so what we're going to do this time differently as i'm i'm going to add a little bit of cow mag as well so we're gonna add eight milliliters of bembe ten milliliters of flawless finish and five milliliters of cow mag and with this all i should have to do is throw the [ __ ] in it and call it a day i don't even have to shake it or stir it because it's doing the stirring for me we'll start with the flawless finish true with this though seem to be getting bigger and bigger [ __ ] and uh it is true that it gets harder to see everything don't it like this for example but i can't pull it back too far all right here we go we're going to do 10 milliliters of flawless finish a little bit more there we are okay there's the first one quick and done next we will do we'll do bimbe next put the lid on this let that stir up real good we'll go up from the lightest to the yuckiest of them all turn it up a little bit more so ben bay we do eight milliliters this one's also marked so that helps for me these glass uh are nice but uh they're a pain in the ass when it comes to um just being in the [ __ ] way they are pretty [ __ ] nice i have to say oh [ __ ] it's all or nothing with this [ __ ] it's all right i know how to get rid of the rest that will probably do it [ __ ] too much god damn it one more time uh try again here don't need much it's easy to overdo it there we are okay okay number two is down next it's uh cow mag i always do a good shake should always put the lid on [ __ ] too because i'm a class all right we're not going to do tds on this i'm just going to do a ph balance i think that's good enough for this we're getting so damn close that well that's hard to get off that uh i'm you know i don't think it matters that much i'm gonna say it don't [ __ ] it all right next one up cow mag and what did i say five milliliters that is not much but we do have this handy dandy all right a little too much almost a little bit more there we are and in we go beautiful so i'm gonna wipe some of this [ __ ] off might make it easier to get the [ __ ] lid back on later i might make it easier to get the lid back off later because i've taken all this extra dry [ __ ] off boy we got all kinds of stinkiness in there going on she's looking pretty good though right did not stir it at all because it's stirring itself now it's time for the fun part and that is to do the ph level so let's shut that off led lights man i tell you they uh or something else see if that works for us shake take the meter shake it i'm getting ready to start two two day two night cycle on killer cheese dog by the way that'll be coming up and um you haven't seen the video yet but i started the next grow season and that's coming up you'll be seeing that soon four point nine eight so four point so five 5.0 we're going to call it all right so write that down 5.0 by the way uh killer cheese dog or sorry wedding cake was fed five days ago so it's been quite a while and there's no [ __ ] way i'm gonna be able to see what that says try this again you can't see it but i wrote so small that all just bled together okay so when we go from three two to six which is three of them we do four so we're at five oh now so let's do uh so what did i say we do three we do four to go three right so uh if we do two then we go one and a half which would be a little too high so if we do one let's try one let's try one milliliter of the ph up all i gotta do is find it where are we ph up hiding in between the two there we are looks like i thought it thought i might have used the damn thing but no it's just uh not been used for anything okay uh here we go what did i say one milliliter there is one so i'm i can't really show you so i'm just gonna pull it and now i can bring it down and she probably can't see i'm trying to get it to one which is at the very very bottom almost there all right there's one oh and move that out of the way turn this back on put that little bit in there see what that does for us spin this up a little bit more get it going okay where do you think we're at now we just did one milliliter okay let's see take this out shake it off blow it out real good turn her on let's see where we're at and it's hard to see isn't it there we go 5.0 no that didn't go [ __ ] anywhere same same old same old so one didn't do it okay we'll add more that's easy enough to do so let's add since i have more in there let's add two more so that's now three maybe i should have just added four i don't know so now we're at three really get that stirred up really good so now we've done three there we go now we're getting somewhere okay try this again where are we at now didn't move hard at all did it a [ __ ] cow mag man keeps her keeps the ph balance much lower more acidic for sure let's see where we're at now 5.4 we're not moving up that fast look at that [ __ ] all right play that game then that's fine so that's been three i'm gonna write that down for forget we're at three and that didn't move [ __ ] 5.4 so guess what we're gonna put three more in here we go trying to get all these others out of the [ __ ] way so i use the right one there's three oh i got three already so now that's going to be six so we'll see where that's at huh stirring it back up i'll be recalibrating my sensors uh the ones that i have for the next grow again i've got some powdered solution i know it's not as good as the other [ __ ] but it's what i got and that's what i'm gonna use so there we go here we go let's see where we gonna be at now oh here we go 6. 6.0 okay we're getting closer i'm gonna crank this up stir this again get this going so we went six to go for we went three more to go from five five five four to six so let's do one more [ __ ] it up you know me if you watch my videos you know me hopefully i don't [ __ ] it up i don't get too too much in there but she don't come up too quick there's another one more milliliter and i think we're done i think we're just gonna go ahead and call that done unless it's still the 6.0 but i'm hopefully we're probably not because now we're we've done seven that [ __ ] okay man that cow mag right something else all right she's mixed i bet she's at least 6.0 i know right no you're load don't be so dumb oh we're coming down i was getting [ __ ] freaking out on this and it's blurry 6.3 though you can see that right 6.2 6.2 beautiful we are there took a little bit more than i wanted but that's okay we are there took seven milliliters we're gonna call it that now i'm gonna go ahead pour that into the other jug and feed my ladies probably three gallons or so i guess three gallons three bottles usually that's what we do and we'll keep going be on the lookout i'm gonna have two more videos coming out we're gonna have video uh showing that the last basically the last hurrah for the killer cheese dog may not go too elaborate like i did on the last time when i thought it was done but i still want to get some pictures and show you you know what it looks like here at the end good for myself too so i can compare and then there's going to be a video coming out where you will see me planting my new seeds getting my my solo cups ready um and changing up changing it up a little bit gonna start with six trim it down to five two of them is gonna scrog three of them's gonna manifold if i do it right that's the plan so let's get done with this hopefully it wasn't quite as long i don't know maybe it was but uh thank you all for watching my channels thank you for coming to the channel to the video thank you for watching my videos thank you for coming to my channels thank you for listening to me being medicated i appreciate that please keep coming back please like

Aluminum in Tea?\" Aluminum is the third most abundant element on Earth, \n and may not be good for our brain\u2014 something we learned studying \nfoundry workers exposed to high levels.  Though the role of aluminum in the development of \n brain diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s is controversial,  to be prudent, steps should probably be taken \nto lessen human exposure to this metal.  There are a number of aluminum-containing \ndrugs on the market  like antacids, which have the highest level,  though aluminum compounds can \nalso added to processed foods  as anti-caking agents in pancake mix,  melting agents in American cheese, \nmeat binders, gravy thickeners,  rising agents in some baking powders, \nand dye-binders in candy.  So it\u2019s probably better to stick \nto unprocessed, natural foods.  However, if you cook those natural \nfoods in an aluminum pot,  a significant amount can leach into the food, \ncompared to cooking in stainless steel. If you do the same thing with tea, though,  you get a few milligrams of aluminum \nregardless of what type of pot you use,  suggesting the aluminum is in the tea itself.  And indeed back in the 1950s,  it was noticed that tea plants \ntend suck up aluminum from the soil,  but like anything, \nit\u2019s the dose that makes the poison.  According to the World Health Organization,  the provisional tolerable weekly intake\u2013  our best guess at a safety limit for aluminum\u2013  is 2 mg per healthy kilogram \nof body weight per week,  which is nearly a milligram per pound,  so someone who\u2019s around 150 pounds \nprobably shouldn\u2019t ingest  more than 20 mg of aluminum per day. Up to a fifth of intake \nmay come from beverages,  so what we drink probably shouldn\u2019t \ncontribute more than about 4 mg a day,  which is the amount found in about 5 cups \n of green, black, or oolong tea.  So should we not drink more \nthan 5 cups of tea a day? Well, it\u2019s not what we eat or drink; \nit\u2019s what we absorb.  If you just measured how \nmuch aluminum was in tea,  it would seem as though a couple cups could \n double our aluminum intake for the day,  but if you measure the level of aluminum in people\u2019s \nbodies after they drink tea, it doesn\u2019t go up.  This suggests that the bioavailability \nof aluminum in tea is low,  possibly because most of the extractable \naluminum in brewed tea is strongly bound  to these large phytonutrients that are not easily \nabsorbed from the gastrointestinal tract,  so it just passes right through,  our intestines get flushed away without \nactually getting inside our body.  Probably more than 90% of \nthe aluminum in tea is bound up. But what about studies like this showing \na large spike in aluminum excretion  through our urine after drinking \ntea compared to water?  The only way for something to get \nfrom our mouth to our bladder  is to first be absorbed into our bloodstream,  but they weren\u2019t comparing the \nsame quantity of tea and water.  They had the study subjects chug \ndown like 8-1/2 cups of tea,  or just drink water at their leisure,  so the tea drinkers peed a lot more, period,  so the aluminum content was no \ndifferent really, tea versus water,  suggesting that gross aluminum \nabsorption from tea is unlikely  and that only little aluminum is \npotentially available for absorption.  So though as few as 4 cups of tea could \n provide 100% of one\u2019s daily aluminum limit,  the percentage available for absorption in\nthe intestine may be less than 10%.  Therefore, it is unlikely that moderate amounts \nof tea drinking can have any harmful effects on humans.  However that\u2019s for people with \nnormal aluminum excretion.  For example, tea may not be a good \n beverage for children with kidney failure,  since they can\u2019t get rid \nof the aluminum as efficiently.  For most people, though, \ntea shouldn\u2019t be a problem.  Though if you drink tea out of a can, \nbuy undented cans,  as the aluminum in dented cans \ncan leach into the liquid  boosting aluminum levels by a factor of 8 \n sitting on store shelves for a

substance called laetrile made from apricot seeds they claim cures cancer Jason who was charged from a hospital bed where he was taken with a purported hip infection was also ordered to post $100,000 bond promoting unapproved drugs as a disease cure as they allegedly did on this website is fraud and a violation of federal law leaving federal court Barbara Vail flashed a thumbs up while another son defended his mother and brother we have so much stuff going on in the world smoking and you have people dying from vaping you have an individual who beat cancer when he was 18 years old that nobody else be anything Jason's ever done his intentions are the best I find it hard to believe why today they're coming around looking at my mother and my brother throughout the day federal agents were in and out of this house gathering evidence and a hazmat team was called in when several drums of hazardous liquid were uncovered federal authorities noted that Jason an arm wrestling champion was up to his old tricks that he was sentenced to five years in prison 19 years ago for selling his toxic brew online he claims he was twice cured of cancer by using the apricot seed concoction neighbors of the veils seem shocked by the charges against the mother and son knowing them the 20 years at least never had a problem I'm upset that somebody would try to take money from people who are in a really bad situation and are looking you know probably for the last hope that they might have and the government claims that the Vails charged 295 dollars plus shipping for a three pound bag of the apricot seed and they contend that over a six year period the veils earned about eight hundred and ninety thousand dollars they'll have an opportunity to enter a plea during their next court appearance we're live tonight in Bell Rose Queens Marvin Scott pix 11 News", "0WzwQkeY-nE": "hello and welcome to the Migro Youtube\nchannel my name is Shane and I'm the founder of Migro in this video we're\ngoing to look at what are the optimum conditions for your grow room to get the\nbest growth and maximum yield so plants of course need adequate water and\nnutrients to grow healthily but photosynthesis which is the driver of\nthe plant growth it would be largely determined by the amount of light the\nplant receives the amount of co2 the plant receives and also the temperature\nof the environment which will determine the rate that the photosynthesis occurs\nthe data and the references that we're using in this guide are taken from a\nUniversity study published in 2008 by scientist Suman Chandra which are\nlaboratory studies carried out on a high potency strain of cannabis sativa where\nthey looked at the influence of different temperatures light intensity\nlevels in par and co2 levels and the effect on plant growth so let's look at\neach of these in turn so first we look at the level of light intensity that the\nplant is receiving and we're talking about photosynthesis of course we're\ngoing to be talking about light in terms of the horticultural reference which is\npar photosynthetically active radiation and at par levels up to 1500 micro moles\nper meter square per second you can increase growth rates however it's also\nshown that once you get past around seven or eight hundred micro moles per\nmeter square per second the rate of growth that you get is not really worth\nthe amount of extra light energy that you're having to input into the plant so\nit's generally accepted that around seven or eight hundred micro moles per\nmeter square per second is the best trade-off between getting maximum growth\nand not having to use too much energy to get that growth and all the heat and\neverything else that comes with it of course in this is for the flowering\nstage in the vegging stage you would aim to get about 50\nto those levels so somewhere in the region of about 300 350 micromoles per\nmeter square per second you can achieve this by getting your light fixture\nreducing the output from your light fixture using a dimmer if you're using a\nnumber of fixtures by having the number of fixtures you are using or by just\nraising it about one and a half to two times higher than its optimal hanging\nheight and this will reduce the intensity directly underneath the light\nand reduce the light intensity for the vegging stage the optimum temperature\nfor plant growth was tested at two different light levels and sort of a\nmedium of medium and power intensity level of 500 micro moles per second and\nthen a very high level of attires and micro moles per second in both instances\nthe maximum plant growth rate occurred at 30 degrees Celsius and fall off\nfalls off quite significantly where five degrees above or below this temperature\nof course all different strains are going to have have different\nrequirements and needs in terms of temperature our suggestion would be that\na safe band of temperature to operate in would be between 25 and 30 degrees\nCelsius and you should get optimum growth and minimize the risk of\nstressing your plants through to higher temperature finally we look at the\nimpact of different levels of co2 on Plank Road you can see the normal\natmospheric level of co2 is about 370 parts for a million this would be air\nthat you'd be taking into your grow room from the external environment ie fresh\nair if you are replacing that fresh air regularly the general guidance for\ncirculating air range of grow room would be about 60 changes per error and if\nyou're achieving this it's highly likely that you're maintaining that atmospheric\nlevel of co2 in your grow room difficulty with using this system so\ndrawing fresh air in and expelling it out into\nthe atmosphere is it's very hard to increase the co2 level because if you if\nyou input more co2 into the grow area it's only gonna get drawn out just as\nquickly and so it's almost impossible to artificially raise co2 levels there are\na couple of ways of doing it you can enclose the environment so that the air\nrecirculates back into the grow room or is recirculated around the grow room and\nyou use a co2 sensor and some form of adding co2 some technologies such as co2\nbags or burners or co2 tanks and you can use this to artificially elevate the co2\nlevel in your grow room another method you could use is to use effectively\nnatural and free sources so we all expel out co2 when we're breathing and\ntherefore in occupied buildings the co2 level is often raised as much as twice\nthe level of from the external atmosphere that this would be normal and\nso if you can take air into your grow room from an occupied building so a\nhouse or workplace you will most likely be bringing in elevated levels of co2\ninto your grow room which will increase the growth rate so I hope you have got\nsome useful information out of this guide if you have any questions or\nqueries please leave them in the comments

"today purchased two flats of strawberries at my local farmers market and now I'm going to turn them into jam and kanima so the way that I like to remove the stem from the strawberries this is like a hard plastic straw it's from one of our sippy cup type things you insert it into the bottom of the strawberry and out pops the top so it's been poured not that that really matters but um there you go so you talk to use a knife or anything like that and there is the whole strawberry now I'm going to rinse them off kind of give them a light flush so that's about that's about a cup and now I'm going to put in my pan you're just going to mash them as much as you you want if you want more chunks in your jam - less let's chunk smash more I'm just using a potato masher from Ikea I believe now I'm going to add my pectin this is this one here if they low or no sugar needed pectin because usually sugar is what sets the pectin I'm going to need three tablespoons now I'm going to stir in my stir in my pectin should probably mix it as you're dumping but yeah I'm not a professional can't but I get by just fine now finally I'm going to add I'm using water you can use fruit juice or whatever you'd like but I'm just using water with these babies now you want to turn it on high and wait for it to become a really rapid boil I'm going to turn this on and see if you can hear some seals oh okay that was that was a seal seal that I'm not an experienced well I'm experienced I'm not professional canner when I hear the Pops I get really excited alright as you can see here we got a boil but when I stir it it goes away so we're not hot enough not quite hot enough yet we're almost almost there all right that's as hot as I'm gonna get now I'm gonna sweeten this batch with a little bit of honey I did do some without any sweetener but I'm going to do some with because this is going to be gifted to some people not everybody's a fan of no sugar whatsoever so just add a little honey clean spoon like a sneak peak you can taste your jeans back up to a boil see how it's not calming down when I stir it so you want now we're going to set the timer for a minute and give it a try oh yeah that's some good stuff I'm actually going to turn this down it is decorating my wall strawberry splatter now all this time I'm going to be preparing my jars and and whatnot umm I have a link a video of mine in the description box it's really fast to the point easy and you can check that out for more of the actual canning specifics done super fast now I'm going to throw it in my warm cars my jar here and put in my funnel and I'm going to ladle summer jam into my jar you want to leave a quarter of an inch headspace I have a little doohickey a measure of it but I'm just eyeballing it all right so you clean up your room get your lid out of your hot water I've got a pan over here some line with my lids in it there's this nice little magnetic dice you set it on and then from there you just lightly screw on your lid doesn't need to be tight or anything like that now I'm going to put it in my pot my pot on the stove and I've got all my jam in it lower it into the water and as soon as it reaches a rapid boil which is almost pretty much how do you that because I'm I'm just in wallowing um as soon as it if that rabbit whoa which it is now I'm gonna set my timer for 10 minutes and cover it this is my my leftovers I don't have quite enough to make a jar or anything like that so I just put it some type of where I'm going to put a cover on it and throw it in the fridge and we can enjoy it breakfast tomorrow here's my beautiful mess not too bad not too nice but you know alright my time is up well my jars and placing my jars on a keep pulling wrap with a towel over it all right now I'm just going to let my jar sit here and cool overnight in the morning I'll check to make sure they've all popped kind of scary I've heard a couple I've had some success this is the moment of truth I think you're supposed to eat a whole day but it's the morning now so you're in long enough um now you're going to test your tops and see if they're up or down so you're just looking for that little all those tech so exciting um I have four over here pretty sure one of them to take took to check it this one okay so this is when I'm actually kind of glad that one didn't so I can show you but this right here means it didn't seal so this is just me going refridge and this is what and what's in the fridge that one little container which will show here in just a second but this is what a flat of strawberries and one container of pectin makes so this is organic strawberry jam and let's see here let's think about this I Pitt I paid thirty dollars for the flat and $5 for the pectin so this is $35 worth up jam is it cost saving I don't know but it sure tastes good and I control the sugar he's got left over GM from last night there was a little bit of foam on it but um see how upset looks not bad at all I'll take it it's perfect so that is my homemade strawberry jam with little or no added sweetener", "4oHHvvqIxrc": "hi friends your cloned a I live alcaman remember circa so I'm gonna
