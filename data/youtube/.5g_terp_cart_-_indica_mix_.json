{"7KDXXoIL28Y": "[Music] what's going on guys my name is Jeff Austin is popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys are smoking with net let me know what videos you want to see in the future

species of cannabis plants that have thousands of sub species known as strains they are commonly hailed by distributors and recreational users for having their very own distinct benefits and effects for the longest time I thought that all strains of cannabis must be one of three types indica strains that are said to have a sedative relaxing effect sativa strains known to provide a more uplifting cerebral effect and of course hybrid strains which are thought to possess qualities of both indica and sativa right well what if I told you that everything I just described is just too vague to be accurate the effects that a strain may have on any given person depend less on the type of plant they consume and more on a person's body chemistry and the chemical properties of cannabis itself a recent study reveals a huge variability in the cannabis species with terpenes and cannabinoids actually having more to do with strain effects that indicates the Teva plants do what are terpenes and cannabinoids you may ask terpenes are compounds that provide a very distinctive smell and taste of each strain while cannabinoids are compounds in the plant that our body naturally has receptors for researchers proposed that Mir seen a commonly found terpene in cannabis is responsible for battling conditions like anxiety and insomnia so surely a strain containing nursing must be an indica strain right well not exactly your scene is actually found in both indica and sativa however it's the amount of mere scene that determines the type for example if your scene is found in a specific strain with a volume greater than 0.5% the strain is considered to be indica but if the volume of your scene is found to be less than 0.5% the strain is considered to be sativa with so many strains like this does the notion that all indicas today and all sativa is invigorate even stand true there are also other factors of play like a person's metabolism mobility and genetics each person metabolizes cannabis differently a strain that works on one person may not necessarily work on another for example this is Bob and this is Steve say both Bob and Steve smoke one gram of the same strain in one day after consuming his portion of cannabis bob is capable of functioning normally and goes about his day however Steve on the other hand feels much more potent effects and has to take five before he carries on his day why is this among many possibilities Steve may have specific physical ailments that affect his ability to metabolize cannabis unlike Steve Bob may have more scepters for cannabis in his brain stem allowing him to accommodate a larger dose so one can see how the type of plant had no influence in this equation whether they smoked an indica or sativa strain due to their respective physiology Bob and Steve would still react to the cannabis in the same way shown before you so if factors like chemical compounds and a user's unique physiology determines the effects a strain has on us why do we continue to use redundant terms like sativa and indica when they have no scientific merit at the end of the day sativa and indica exist as broad terms used to simplify a much more complex process many experts say it's due to convenience for a novice cannabis user these terms may help navigate a diverse field of which they have little knowledge simple terminology certainly comes in handy when an 85 year old grandma who is using cannabis for the first time has to differentiate between a nighttime strain and a daytime strain to alleviate her pain however convenience should not supersede true information advocates of the plant should be aware of all the properties of cannabis in order to help novice users out to the fullest given how long false information is circulated about cannabis for centuries the onus is on all of us to understand what cannabis truly is only then can the proper medicinal and recreational value of cannabis be truly recognized thank you for watching the puff puff post and follow us for all news cannabis", "If7OxA5SEzo": "hello once again a long time no see Joey Murdock I know my last video was also on this type of thing and if you guys don't like these type of videos I am so sorry please let me know if you wanted to make a second channel about this type of stuff I personally don't want to because this is what I love but if it bothers my regular subscribers so much then I'll go ahead and move over if not we're all Gucci it definitely wanted to film this video because in this subject it may seem to you if you're experienced and then set this up like girl we already know this but you would be surprised all the different dispensaries I've been to so far all of the different medical marijuana patients that I have interacted with before may not even know this stuff and so that's why I really want to start making these type of videos to just educate people more on marijuana its benefits and the good things about it because you probably only hear like weed is so bad for you it's a drug and it's a plant that grows from the ground and it's not for everyone but it is an amazing miracle plant and I am so so so so so happy that I am able to access it here in my state especially let's start off with the plants themselves and we're gonna speak a little bit about that first so sativa plants we're gonna speak about those first so tebow you can think of as more of a daytime plant do they grow taller up to 18 feet you definitely have thinner leaves and they're gonna be more narrow sativas usually have longer flowering cycle they grow in warmer climates and longer seasons they like to reach for the stars as I say and grow kind of up and out the buds are gonna be not so close to the stalk now speaking on indica plan Anika plants are gonna be shorter they grow between 2 to 6 feet opposite to the sativa plant the leaves are thicker brush ear and broader as well as the buds growing closer to the stalk of the plant can think of indica leaves as being like fatter wide and sativa is during the day she's a little more active so she's a little skinnier hybrid plants they're gonna be a mix because we'll get into why but hybrid plants are a mix of the two so I can't really tell you if a hybrid plant is gonna be super tall or super bushy or like in between you know what I mean the flowering time with hybrid plants very it's not something that you can indicate like sativas and indicas plans it's a very time when I put the plant I know if you're patient you don't really ever see plan especially here in Florida we can grow them what you are here 40 types of cannabis sativa indica and hybrid domain major types are indica and sativa now sativas are definitely for daytime use more than night 100 percent a lot of people use sativas during the day and then because during the night so sativa they're usually used for daytime use I like to describe sativas as being more of a head highs more in your brain than you feel it in your body so sativas are known for being like more of a psychoactive type of strain but they're definitely uplifting euphoric they provide lots of creativity's they give you energy they're uplifting make you more alert and they're also very stimulating which is why they're associated with being for the daytime because you don't want to get sleepy you want to be able to do what you got to do get your work done and be a little creative or whatever you don't want to be falling asleep personally I love and because just because I have ADHD and sativa sometimes can just make me a little more hyper than I want or they can make me super like ty explained sometimes if I get too much of a sativa I kind of get a little little like jittery anybody else can relate let me know but like I said any type of stuff that comes from this plant is gonna affect everybody differently it might be good and other people like it other people don't but that's with everything in life some popular sativas are definitely Maui Wowi super Lemon Haze Sour Diesel is a really big one being crack is a really popular one Jack Harrier super Lemon Haze tangi the list goes on now for in because well indica is give you more of like a body high there definitely for nine-time use because I don't know if you want to be sleepy while trying to be creative at work you go to me it helps a lot more when it comes to things like pain or with me like I said my ADHD indicas are more of a body high and they're very sedated they make you calm relaxed sleepy I like to associate indicas with making you somewhat of a couch potato it can make you sticky as what I say where you want to just stick to the couch and don't want to move that often happens a lot when it comes to in because making you like a couch potato types of indicas that are super popular here in Florida I know one is 9 pound hammer especially from truly if everybody's always posting that one granddaddy purp or granddaddy purple whatever you guys want to say is also a very popular indica Afghan Kush or a Ghani I know at my dispensary here at cure leaf it's Afghani and shabu banana alright y'all so let's talk about high ridge personally I like hybrids for during the day instead of using sativas but let me explain something when it comes to hybrids just to get this clear to everybody just because the name is a hybrid and as you know hybrid is like a mix of two things it is gonna be a mix of two things but some hybrids are definitely leaning towards different sides of the spectrum when it comes to the types of cannabis we describe it as being sativa dominant or indica dominant what it means is that it's a hybrid but it's gonna have a little more of both indica effects or a little more of the sativa effect usually the terms of use for that is the Teva dominant or indica dominant some hybrids that are 50/50 so it really just depends but definitely when you are going to purchase or whatever you want to deal with your we can definitely look up the strains online I know there's apps that you could use like Leafly or read map will give you the breakdown on the strain and tell you if the hybrid is the team a dominant or usually in the Kodama nation when it comes to hybrid you can get both effects of sativa and indica but sometimes you'll just have more indica or more steeper or both and those are great for people like me who during the day like to be uplifted more but also be calmer winning comes to my body because I'm hyper all the time some examples of hybrids are pineapple express oh my gosh that is like my favorite hybrid Girl Scout cookies I love Girl Scout cookie Blue Dream is a very popular one as well every time you tell somebody blue dream they're like oh my god blue dream that's my shrink and I'm like growing always real good yeah those are some hybrid strains but when it comes to symptoms usually and I want to make a whole nother video about that when carrying your symptoms I guess you can say like your pain or if you have a headache a lot of that also goes into ratios and I want to make a whole nother video on that about like ratios between CBD THC the different cannabinoids because there are so many that are in that plant it's not just THC and CBD we'll get into that in another video yo but for now these are what's usually associated with the different types of sativas are definitely more stress relievers they're usually good for headaches as well as stress depression anxiety thing creasing the serotonin in your body and being more uplifting and help with chronic pain so hope you focus which is why I like using a more suitable eating hybrid when it comes to during the day with indica they give you more of a mental relaxation they help a lot with acute pain nausea and vomiting for indicas they increase the dopamine in your body as well as help with inflammatory issues nausea and if you need to eat girl I would definitely go with an indica often associated with giving you munchies but I love it because I don't eat throughout the day and as soon as I have an indica end of my system a lot of the time I'm like girl hungry and I go and grab like scooby snacks and everything and I'm just eating the hope with anxiety and they help you sleep okay people's that's it for this video today I just wanted to make it quick and short for you guys and kind of get to the point and let you know what each one does remember that everything once again affects everybody differently and I'm not telling you what strain to choose I'm just educating you guys on what the differences are and yeah oh and remember sativas are for daytime Anika's are for nighttime to make you a couch potato they make you sleepy you're gonna have a good night's sleep you take an indica if you have a sativa it'll help you be creative stay focused stuff like that hybrid make sure both just depends which side is dominant got it got it all right I will talk to you guys later what do I wave in like every video bye", "CsyyH2RzlIc": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "iTfuP__t89g": "totally speed big-time swerving all over we are we're gonna

been a minute yeah it's been a while no probations are not know that no okay do you have a license for marijuana yes I do yeah okay I just I have smell I have there's two memberships for dispensaries but I do have my like see the the dates on this January 21st 2016 so that's the actual government-issued this is just my I can do card but the this is you know the expired license actually suppose in the next day or two you're supposed to be by the end of the month this is like my government Medical Marijuana or like thing but rate it expired March 29th 2013 fire but this is but this is this is

addicting I brought it with me everywhere I went Seema Herman never expected that what she thought was a harmless habit vaping would end up nearly killing her I took two days for my lungs to fail and I almost died the 18 year old going viral with this photo from her hospital best a tube still pumping oxygen to her failing lungs in her hands a call-to-action asked for like a pen and paper because that was the only way I could communicate and I wrote I want to start a no vaping campaign that was the first thing I did when I opened my eyes Seema's story is just the latest in a landslide of incidents linked to vaping sparking what many officials are calling a national health crisis what we've seen in the course of the past let's say month is an increased number of people coming in with respiratory problems as a result of vaping so far the Centers for Disease Control report more than 450 possible cases in 33 states of lung illness associated with vaping and six deaths have been confirmed in California Illinois Indiana Minnesota Oregon and now Kansas last Friday the CDC issued a stark warning if you are vaping no matter how old you are you should consider stopping like I didn't think of myself as a smoker the vaping just makes it seem like it's nothing like you're doing nothing wrong Seema was in high school when she started vaping nicotine I was 16 the first time 15 and even the first time I bought it at the smoke shop I went in and I was like can I get a pack of jewel pods and they were like how old are you and I said 22 and they were just like okay it ended up becoming my oxygen I couldn't live without it I needed it all the time every day but because all of my friends were doing it all the time and no one else had symptoms that I had I couldn't like I wouldn't even have imagined that maybe this is killing me sima was an active healthy teen she'd been dancing for years even making dance team her freshman year of college but as her vaping habit increased adding in cannabis her ability to dance disappeared she was vaping a cartridge a day that's like smoking the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes in one day her parents had no idea their daughter had become hopelessly addicted this healthy dancer dancing 12 hours a week stopped dancing because of it stop living because of it stop going to school in college because of it Sima says she was feeling sick all the time over a year I lost like 50 pounds without trying 50 pounds yeah by this summer Seema had stopped going to her college classes she says her health issues were getting worse but no doctor could nail down what was wrong did you not tell the doctors that you've ached I actually did I made sure that every hospital every ER every doctor's office I went to I told them that I smoked but you never thought I can't breathe I feel like I'm gonna die maybe it's because I'm vaping every 10 to 15 minutes no doctor ever said like maybe you should stop vaping it all came to a head on August 15th when Seamas dad rushed her to the ER I said go fast don't let me close my eyes don't let me fall asleep or I won't wake up now why did you say that because I knew I was dying you felt death on you yeah it was terrifying the worst part was I couldn't I couldn't let it like my parents watch it happen to me but hospital staff couldn't figure out why Seema couldn't breathe two days later doctors had to put her on a ventilator I was begging them found her faster event her faster she's going to die it was terrifying it was in that agonizing moment that Seamas cousin revealed her secret addiction she said you know she smokes every day what what are you talking about you said she smokes every day she smokes that beep I said you tell the doctors right now you go tell the doctors right now and I ransacked her room and I found all the vapes it looked like gum wrappers they look like little candy wrappers they look like little cute a mascara wands this progression is so fast dr. Catherine Melamed is a pulmonologist at UCLA Medical Center she worked on Seema's case this was Seema's chest x-ray when she came into our Hospital these hazy white areas here at the base at the bottom of her lungs just show that she could have a pneumonia but what you can then see is if we choose an x-ray from just less than 48 hours later now her lungs all of this white haziness here is inflammation from just day 1 to day 3 is remarkable dr. melamed is on the front lines of what health officials fear is an emerging crisis the National Youth tobacco survey found a 78 percent jump in East cigarette usage among high school students alone but any research on the impacts of vaping lags far behind part of vaping is heating oil and then inhaling that oil and that's not something the lung is used to inhaling and so with that comes an inflammatory reaction that then produces phlegm and sputum and gives the lungs sort of that wet cough when property that sounds terrible and dangerous yes last month 17 year-old Tristan zou fell described how he spent 18 days in the hospital fighting for his life after vaping I woke up just throwing up everywhere how it was just pounding on my chest going 100 miles an hour Tristan lost 15 pounds and said he had to relearn to walk and just yesterday a Texas teen had to be rushed to the hospital after vaping at school passed out and you and I wake up like he was not waking up in Wisconsin today a man was arrested for making thousands of illegal THC vaping cartridges the state of New York is taking an aggressive approach in an attempt to find answers and crack down on black-market products you shouldn't be vaping products that clearly you don't know what you're you're smoking or vaping many vaping products are popular with young adults and teenagers but no company has taken more heat than Jul the industry leader the company says it's designed to get adult smokers off cigarettes but just this week the FDA sent a warning letter to Jewell accusing it of illegally marketing its nicotine bait products as safer than traditional cigarettes without proof Jewell responded we share these concerns about youth vaping it adds it shut down its Facebook and Instagram accounts and recently began deploying new technology to verify IDs this yeah.but Seema's mom blames the whole industry for trying to hook kids early the fact that they market this crap to children and they turned into pink pretty purple packaging candy pisses me off there's a lot we don't know about the both short-term and long-term consequences of vaping and so I would just say don't and the week since Seema has worked to rehab her lungs she still feels that pull to pick up the vape now I don't necessarily crave the nicotine I don't necessarily crave the weed it's just craving like the act of smoking so that's been my hardest thing of like staying away from it but she hopes that going public with her story can keep her and countless others like her alive what would you tell somebody who's under 18 who's thinking about vaping and says I'm just gonna try it one time to see what it's like I would show them my pictures and say I tried it once too and then I tried it another time and then another time it's just remembering that you don't need it like it's gonna kill you for nightline I'm Adrienne banker in Los Angeles hi everyone George Stephanopoulos

extract small batch took take cherry hash plant cherry hash plant this is what it comes in this is how it comes there's another little label here sealed up nicely you okay let's go ahead and open this I believe this is a indica or maybe hybrid but this I don't think it says it on there but I believe all of the other containers it's a nice yellow the one bad thing is that you can't really measure this so you don't know if it's on point or not we're about the same size but yeah you can talk you sealed cartridge I know how to open to refill these check out my other video get a little gas type of smell something like that not much I'm sure it's gonna smell more I got it on real low about 3 volts right now so depending on the voltage it will change the flavor and stuff like that but it's on a low ball right now yeah it's about three point two volts it's pretty good I don't get no cherry yet you had sometimes brandies a little before you get the flavor to come so it's got like a little sweet funky taste THC seventy four point nine five percent THC V one point five four percent THC a two point zero seven percent CBD a zero CBD one point four four percent CBM 0.25 percent CBC four point zero eight percent CBG one point six one percent total day eighty five point nine four percent back with the revolution triptank cherry hash plant oh god what a beautiful sexy color this and beautiful yellow vibrant color but it's all gone there was a little bit of oil on the bottom there so I think it's built a little bit which is not good at all last thing you wanted to see any spillage there it's got a sweet fruity candy type of taste I would say kind of like apricot like a sweet apricot taste or some kind of sweet fruit taste didn't get cherry from it but it does have a sweet fruity taste and that smells a little bit now like like the same thing like fruity apricot and a little bit of Bud but not too much of a bud smell it it makes you think a bit so that is okay a somewhat but once you start thinking too much then that's not too good either so you know that's about it for this review if you liked it pick it up Ellucian craft small-batch premium extracts to tank

man and in today's video we're gonna be talking about does delta really get you high [Music] okay so i know i haven't really talked about delta e lately um i haven't really made a video over it uh just because you know sometimes i want to and sometimes i don't uh but i realize i've never made a video just me sitting down talking about do i actually get high from delta so i haven't smoked all day for the video so let's go ahead and get 30 likes on this video and we will make a cake cart review okay so the cake cart has actually been like really popping for delta 8. um a lot of people have liked it so i went ahead just bought one they didn't send me any so i went ahead and bought one with my own money so if i don't like if i don't get high i'm out and you just learned a valuable lesson through me okay so yeah anyway man so yeah 30 likes and we will do a cake review uh so i've tried like a lot of delta cards and edibles now at this point um delta companies out there if you're seeing this if you want to hit me up man send me some of your bud the concentrates i've yet to try those i would love to try those man um but i haven't found a company to work with that i really like so we're gonna go ahead open this okay so this i literally haven't smoked all day and this is a first review so i'm pretty pumped for it honestly i'm not gonna review it necessarily i will tell you like what i think about it how i feel about it uh or what i think like the taste is let's see gotta pop like five things open just to even get to it so that's cool but yeah i've heard a lot of good things about the cake parts um they're disposable this is what it looks like this is actually pretty nice looking i mean it's pretty sleek i love disposable stuff like i'm a sucker for disposable pins to be honest with you um so yeah let's go ahead we're just going to hit this a bunch hot box the whip and see if i get high as [ __ ] okay like i said i haven't smoked all day so i should feel effects pretty quick uh as long as it does get me high now i've tried different ones like edibles have made me high and some of the pins made me high whereas i took the deltae pills if you haven't seen that video and it did not make me high at all by the way we got lemon kush it's an indica so i'm trying to be in the couch because i got the night off don't uh worry about this i got it at work all right so we're gonna take a couple hits um yeah give you your give you my first impressions and see if i actually get high maybe we can take a blinker i don't know if it allows us to take a blinker but uh cheers boys [Music] okay it definitely tastes kind of like lemon one thing i will always say delta makes me cough like a [ __ ] so if you haven't seen any of my delta videos before definitely go watch them um getting high on delta is definitely a person-to-person kind of thing okay so don't come to this video expecting me to be like oh i got so high like regular weed because i don't think that's gonna happen that's really never happened um and i'm not really a big fan of carts anymore to be honest i've kind of stopped you know hitting carts or whatever anyway though and also for people that like comment and [ __ ] like oh i took this many milligrams will i be okay we don't know i don't know i'm not a doctor i'm not a scientist you'll be fine you'll be fine at the end of the day regardless uh so that first hit was pretty tasty honestly kind of like packed a punch my chest is a little heavy uh or felt like somebody just like hit my chest really um we're gonna take a pretty big hit now honestly bro cheers boys [Music] oh [ __ ] that was a big hit all right so i've two hits i'm already like my mind is a little at ease my body is a little relaxed i would definitely say that i'm not like big hot obviously if i took two of those hits off of a like a wax pen like a real dab pen i think i'd be pretty [ __ ] high but i will say that my body is really relaxed my eyes are kind of getting heavy right now i will say so far that this is living up to its height to be honest with you because these are better than other cars i've tried we might just get high off this man let me know what you guys are smoking a lot dabbing along eating long or eating on i guess um let me know if you guys are using deltae pens delta bud uh like i said i've never tried the bud would love to try it man i'm more of a bud person i love the ritual of rolling up smoking all that [ __ ] i've i've even seen that they have moon rocks now so like that's so cool anyway let's go ahead and take a third hit off this man let's try to get a big hit i mean i want to try to take a blinker but cheers boys all right boys we just took a massive hit i just had like a five minute coughing spree i thought i was gonna die not die but puke i forgot how heavy delta could be on the [ __ ] lungs bro i forgot how much it makes me cough it's been a couple weeks really since i've smoked any dull tape i gotta say though these three big hits boys i'm pretty high like i'm gonna be real with you i actually haven't been this high on any delta a cart so [ __ ] 30 likes man we'll do a review on this i think you could probably get your money's worth out of this to be real hey cake if you see this definitely hit me up man this is good all right bro three hits i'm high i'm pretty high man i think i'm gonna go in there still and smoke like a blunt to get the the full mind effects the psychoactive effect sometimes that i love so much um we're gonna take a couple more hits man we're just gonna dip out i'm high delta definitely got me high it's gotten me high before so don't always let tell people don't always let people tell you that it can't um like i said and i've said multiple times it does go person to person so i will say that this got me high man so let's take another hit let's bounce out of here 30 likes and we will do a cake review man make sure you do like comment subscribe all that good youtube [ __ ] man uh i don't get paid to do this so if you just you know do your part and you like the video man and you watch it youtube pushes it and we get to go up in the world and i get to finally tell my parents i did something with my life cheers boys yeah i'm not taking another humongous hit man that hit just wrecked my lungs like i just coughed for like 10 minutes straight i thought i was gonna puke i was coughing so much oh dude that was terrible though that [ __ ] got me high i'm not even gonna i'm not even gonna lie boys like i would not lie to you about this like i'm a little [ __ ] hot you can kind of see it in my eyes like i know my eyes look pretty [ __ ] but like that's just because i was coughing a lot all right let's take another hit and let's do it man i'm honestly i'm super pumped that i did this video this actually turned out really good i didn't have super high hopes for it it looks kind of like a jewel kind of i don't know i like it though anyway less hit let's kind of make it a kind of big one i don't know i really don't want to die but we'll see it's for the content all right man all right boys that's it man delta got me high i think it could definitely get you high and i think beyond getting just high it would help with uh you know the anxiety and [ __ ] that delta 9 can give some people so i definitely think this uh should be for a lot of people i think a lot of people should try this [ __ ] uh yeah anyway just happy to live in a world where you know this is partly illegal and cannabis is becoming more legal so yeah much loved you

flavor it's really really good flavor-wise I get I mean to dis lit so I'm a giver like a like a nine I mean with this lit because they are you know they're more reintroducing the terpenes after they extract the oil it's always going to be a fainter kind of lighter taste but like what you like like you might not have that strong earthy green taste but you get like a much more concentrated of THC level and a bigger hit you know so at least that's you know the tale of the tape as we speak and something is really really good like I said for the price it's a really great deal um I don't really know if there's much more to say like I said yeah I want to say that's uh that's the ticket honor she's uh they've got more more they've got tons more flavors like I saw Apple Jacks there was a lemon cake which is one I'm going to pick up for sure they also had like man I forget I forget all the other ones but they look really really good like really really good so like and I'm going to try them

strain in vape cartridge form for you today pineapple express baby coming at you from the good people a good supply this is a THC heavy vape cartridge coming in at seven hundred sixty four point one milligrams of THC less than five percent milligrams CBD today about seventy six percent THC in less than a percent CBD so as I said heavy-hitting hybrid THC cartridge coming at you from good supply I'm very excited to try this out pineapple Express is one of my favorite strains of all time probably one of yours too it's classic its legendary they make goddamn movie out of this thing one of my favorite movies probably one of your students hilarious I was very excited to see this in my own cannabis shop even more excited when I found out this thing's going for 40 bucks 40 bucks for a 0.5 gram 510 thread vape cartridge that's the best I've seen in the Canadian market personally so far so I snapped it up right away very excited to check you know he's gonna show you here on the side of the package I'll hold it up for the camera hopefully it doesn't bore but it does let me know what is let me let you know what it says it says our oil what's inside cannabis distillate plant-based terpenes no additives our product the cartridge premium ceramic or anti leaked technology direct airflow system you know I appreciate this kind of information being put on the package I like to know that it's plant-based terpenes not artificial I like to know that it's cannabis dislike to know what's in the cartoon you know more information is not a bad thing I would like to see some other companies follow suit on this good job good supply I like that so without further ado I'm gonna break the seal on this bad boy and figure out how to open it again you know it is some kind of heavy little feels thick cardboard packaging here feels a little wasteful but yeah it's a Canadian market let's open it looks like you pinch the sides and push yeah there we go so here comes the reveal for y'all and there we have it um it's nice-looking let's rescue it from this package yes some heavy thick heavy-duty cardboard packaging for a little item this has got to change um yeah this is a nice-looking cartridge let me hold it up for you all there oh it's got a nice metallic finish on it silver I see a THC logo there I know as it said pineapple Express on that green band and good supply I think at the bottom hopefully that's not blurry for you more importantly though I know it looks great check it out that oil is nice and clear it's a good color hopefully it's coming through clear for you because it looks clear and good that looks smokeable I'm excited that mouthpiece condom and rubber nub oh look we dropped it and yeah it's a nice looking cartridge let's get it on the old standard 510 battery here and the excitement grows as intensifies as we screw it on I'm really looking forward to this everybody I talk know it's tasty hmm yeah that's pretty good you know his little plug there but first John just came out of the package tastes really good kind of a citrusy sweet taste on the intake there and kind of held up on the way out mixed with a little bit of a herbalist herbally kind of taste there kind of herbal and citrusy sweet wouldn't necessarily say pineapple but let's check it out again yeah it's yummy man yep so sweet citrusy taste he definitely tastes that on when they first take a drink and then the exhale it definitely holds up and yeah it's kind of horrible I like it kind of tastes like smoking flower you know it's not too bad it's a good taste in the vape cartridge you know a little distracted here because I've noticed you know this is only 1/2 fault here it's kind of a big cartridge it's dawning on me here that this must be a 1 gram cartridge because it's a point 5 gram you know this lid in there they must be making one gram cartridges in the future that got me excited so yeah breaking news one gram cartridge is coming up looks like from a good supply but you know back to the flavor back to the taste this is pretty good to get a pretty good vapor I see it's not harsh pretty smooth yeah very good vapor production and yeah that's a good flavor I'm really good to enjoy vaping this over the next couple days and as always come back but you know what I think then all right so the final verdict on the old pineapple express some good supply here you know I've been vaping the hell out of this thing the last four days I've run a readout and tell you what I like he didn't like about it I liked a lot about it to be honest favorite thing about it was a taste flavor was great out of this world spine Apple Express baby from the first drag to the last flavor holds up never waned and never weak really good really strong you nailed a good supply you did a good job I can't always say that about all cartridges the flavor held up throughout the whole thing we really get and the flavor that was there really loved it I'm big fat it's pineapple Express it's great you're gonna love the taste the effects really nice effects you know it's a little milder than you might think at a 76 percent THC level so it's not a super heavy hitter you're not gonna get blitzed big stoned out of your mind but it's a good all day strain it's a great way can be extreme it's a sociable strain very conversational motivate you get through your day really happy up with the kind of feeling throughout your day that's a good strain you know what I mean I love it it's a good strain of having a pandemic you got to keep your chin up your spirits up there's a little tank of getting your spirits up that's for sure so you know I really enjoyed it's a little milder than some people might like but I thought it was great really good all day straight it's a hybrid strain I find it to be a lot more sativa meaning like I say it's all day long stream it's not going to let you know you're not gonna feel really tired it's not gonna burn you out really good strain three four hits on this thing lasts about an hour hour and a half before you kind of feel like you might want to have another pull fantastic good job good supply I really enjoyed it only downer to this thing oh you know another thing I really like is I like the look of this I mean look at that it's just nice right it's really shiny really metallic nice look I'm a sucker for a good look looks good but let's get into the only negative I have here well I got one small negative this little green band that you got down here kind of blocks how much oil you got left in the cartridge that's a bit of a bombing event it's alright it's not that big a deal the biggest deal that I have with this is it doesn't seem to last too long it's four days later in a mountain you know what I'm saying I mean like I noticed it moved around real easily in there it's kind of a thinner oil and a thinner oil is gonna vape alittle bit quicker so might want to take that into consideration with your value proposition with you know hey it's 40 bucks 4.5 grand cartridge but it doesn't seem to last that long I don't know personally I still recommend it it's alright I mean you know I was vaping it a lot you know not as much as I have other ones that have lasted longer but you know your mileage may vary out there as always but for what you get I recommend it I'd buy it again if I saw it in a store I'd buy it again I really liked it really impressed I enjoy the price enjoy the effects enjoy the taste I enjoy pineapple Express from good supply good job I liked it so hope you like the videos

kinds of strains no we know each affects your body is pretty important luckily for you it's not as a complicated as you may have thought cannabis can be broken down into two different strains sativa and indica but before we go into the breakdown of each strains let's go ahead sleppy guys with a little bit of farmer knowledge sativa had originated from a warmer climate countries such as Mexico Thailand in Southeast Asia and was first classified by charge Linnaeus back in 1753 if you're planning on growing this in your back room without your mom really knowing is probably not the best idea you see these plants on average grew around six feet but hand getting much taller there's no sneaking around with this guy indica is on the other hand love cooler environments and was originated in the Middle East so I tip my hat to all you Muslims out there because it's my personal favorite it was classified as a second species of cannabis by Gene Landmark back in 1785 and it could grows a little bit shorter around two to four feet also takes less time to fully mature unlike sativa now that we got that out of the way let's go ahead and get into the juicy part of this video this science behind it while both strings have THC and CBD which is how we effects your body the ratio on each are different starting with sativa it's a little bit higher ratio of THC compared to CBD unlike indicas that have more CBD than TVC to keep the video short on the lowest levels THC acts as a stimulant and CBD relaxes the body they kind of work like a yin and yang of two different sides sativa gives you more focus promoting creativity energizes you and while giving you a nice head high on the other side of the scale and because are more of relaxation embodied high imagine this typical stoner who's on the couch eating food chances are he was smoking some kind of indica strains now that you know a little bit more about them when is the best time to take the strings well that one's pretty easy sativas in the morning because it gives you more energy and more focus and indicas there at the night because it relaxes your body and allows you to fall asleep a little bit faster if you're series of what my favorite strings of indica and sativa are that is a video for it next time but go ahead and leave a comment down below so I know that you're interested if you guys liked the

buying carts off the black market knowing what you inhale into your body should be priority number one and when stepping into the realm of vaping you don't want to inhale something that's gonna harm you long term so today we want to put an end to all the pleasures out there regarding bad practice and to truly answer the question what is a fake oil cartridge and how to avoid [Music] they coil cards go beyond branding and counterfeit boxes the number one question you should be asking yourself is where am i buying my cards from most reputable companies have authorized retail stores that are allowed to sell their cartridges if you're buying from anywhere other than licensed reputable companies or their authorized retailers nine times out of ten it's a fake and companies that are legit aren't gonna risk selling products to non-leap States eBay Amazon Alibaba are not where they experience weavers goaded by high quality oils sure you can compare your boxes to the boxes on the website but unless you buy from the right site you can still get it wrong also if you're buying oils on a budget you're gonna run into the same problem a big red flag is recognizable big-name brands at low prices let's face it if you paid bunk prices you're gonna pay for bunk oils but how do people get ahold of big name brands and if it's the same cart how can it be fake that brings us to fake cartridge answer number one fake oils take these sell cartridges for example defconn action calm says that all seasaw cards must have two logos a serial number and a transparent rubber ring at the bottom of the cart this cartridge is everything a vapor should look for but I know for a fact that the oil inside is fake meaning that nothing's tested and they let the name brand to sell the cartridge for them to me this is black market plus most cards and boxes can just be bought online and some people think that if cartridges and boxes look legit then there's nothing stopping people from putting their own formula inside plus cartridges can just be a replica and they use cheap metals unless you have somebody you trust a source who tests their oils you never really know what's in it from a normal customer standpoint so what could be in here was they can put synthetics in there like k2 which is a huge deal you shouldn't do that oil thickener or anything that you usually wouldn't see on the cartridge unless your oils are solvent free distillates which indicates that the substances are environmentally friendly with no des lunes then you're gonna run into terpenes in PG you want to limit the amount that's put into your oils both drippings and PG act as carrying agents to carry more flavors into your discipline because distillate itself doesn't really have much flavor and no PG does not cause formaldehyde companies only use these agents to give it their own unique formula and it may also indicate on the stickers the percentages that they use but not always think about as buying mid grade versus Private Reserve but you still don't know what a fake oil cartridge is so what's a fake oil cartridge okay so you got your cleaning lab all set up you got your formula lock down and now you're ready to start filling it up cartridges can you just use any cartridge no no you cannot in January this year of 2019 a new California State law was passed calls phase Reena saving that all California cartridges must be lab tested for heavy metals these tests are specifically for for metals cadmium arsenic mercury and lead and phase threes testings limit is 0.5 parts per million of lead allowed in your oils this is a big deal for vape cartridge producers because unless you have glass pores cartridges contain metal and sometimes the exact same cartridge will pass in one lab and fail in another causing producers to just bypass testing all together just to make a quick buck also the price of testing in a lab has gone up so people are cheating the system by avoiding it entirely so why the variation of testing there is no standardized testing procedures for each lab to follow this means that each lab extracts oil differently and if oil touches exposed brass then it may very well fail phase 3 testing so how to metal get inside of your oil cartridges well that's easy 99% of companies buy cartridges from overseas which allow up to 4% of your oils to be made up of lead which is much higher tooth into what phase 3 wants and unless you're on top of your menu this could be a problem let an arsenic is added to metals like brass which help make metal easier to mold into cartridges and oil is acidic so it eats away at cheap metals allowing particles to be invaded into your body so stop giving people reasons to ban they don't become a victim of uncertainty unfortunately some companies don't want to know how the cartridge is made because they don't want to be how reliable and there's just too much money to be made not to get inside of the oil cartridge market we can't change state law or lab test procedures but we sure can certainly change babe cartridges there are companies out there that are responding to the issue companies like Herve pur have already started innovating carts that are guaranteed to pass phase three testing and multiple facilities and are currently leaving the market who completely lead-free cartridges that vetted testing facilities in California that know how to properly test for phase three requirements the next generation of VAP cartridges might be hidden stores in winter time this year but keep in mind that cartridges made before January 1st 2018 are still allowed to be sold and could still be in circulation and states like Washington and have passed similar laws only allowing 0.7 parts per million so be aware of your state's requirements I know it seems like a lot but now you're in the know and knowing is half the battle so please no more black market cards we hope this video was helpful to you guys let us know what you'd like to see in the next video where do you buy your loyal cards did you know that metal could be in it as always don't forget to subscribe and like and we'll see you next time face", "l7dP70VFo90": "site is going I can't even read my Twitter feed I [ __ ] these people I don't live if I don't put my glasses I don't know what the [ __ ] they're saying oh my people don't get depressing it actually I'm saying psychosis is a different thing okay okay I think we are discussing overall mental health yes I mean look I'm saying this because I really think that this is something that I've made a big turn over the last few years with myself that I don't quit bathroom break yes please go I don't think marijuana is as safe as I used to think it is I used to think it was benign I really used to think there was no big deal but I have a friend that I discussed the other day who was a really confident [ __ ] muscular a handsome man that never did anything and he took a marijuana edible to go to sleep and for two weeks this guy was like this is a different guy not that I was taught it's not Rafi no a different guy he took it and he experienced suicidal thoughts and and all these he had like severe consequences I think that the human beings we vary so much biologically that to just make this overall blanket statement of what's good for you is good for me is irresponsible and I've been irresponsible as saying that well one reason it's interesting what out reason I think that alcohol is so widely accepted despite all the problems it causes and again alcohol can certainly cause problems yeah is that alcohol affects most people pretty much the same way you know if and you sort of know if what somebody looks like when they have one drink when they have five drinks got some dress I've got some friends that get those gerbil eyes you ever see when they start talking crazy but you sort of know that and you sort of know how long it's gonna take to clear your body and you yes cannabis is so different it's a really complicated drug and it does affect different people in different yes and also the tolerance has changed yes so you know people say well two and a half milligrams of THC you vape it that's like one drink for somebody who you know who doesn't use but then if you if you're a tolerant user you can use 200 milligrams in a day that's 80 drinks it's a weird drug and then there's the issue of eating it yes when you eat it your body produces something called eleven hydrogen's on a tab alight it's a far more psycho action you were all along for the ride when that happens yes you are yes and it can take days for it to get out of your system I know many people have eaten marijuana edibles and then they call me up the next day like dude I'm still hot yeah yeah so so so I think I think the legalization community has sort of said for years like oh there's basically no downsides to this there's only upsides the cops will bus smokers they'll be tax revenue all these people have a way to get high that's clearly safer than alcohol and unfortunately that's just not true I think you're right and I think the the issue that people from what I've read are having with your book or people that are marijuana advocates that think that your position is unbalanced and that you've ignored the positive aspects of THC in terms of like what he was talking about cognitive benefits for people with psychotic episodes and that you were only focusing on the negative plead guilty today yeah because I think that for 20 years people have only heard the positive right eye I think that's I think that's also I'll plead guilty that myself because I think that I've only been discussing the positives and one of the things that I've tried very hard to do and one of the things I've learned how to do from doing this podcast and experiencing criticism and communicating with a bunch of different people with a lot of different viewpoints is examine my own positions and try to figure out am i coming at this from a truly balanced position or am i trying to support a conclusion that I started out with and I'm trying to you know somehow or another back up my own work or back up my own just my own statements and and and sort of prop them up instead of being really honest and objective right it's very difficult to do listen I wrote a book called tell your children that yeah about marijuana mental illness and violence you're I don't think you can you can think that that book is gonna be a compendium of the pros and cons above if you want to tell your children the truth though you really do want to tell them the pros and cons right and you did indicate Alex you said you know we should tell people the truth yeah in the book right so you know I think that when you're telling and you're saying that that you're telling the truth and Alex I'm agreeing with you that you're telling part of the truth right but part of the truth is you know a little bit deceiving and deceptive it in some ways right you want to tell the whole truth when you tell the whole truth then you give the whole story and then people can actually make you know a good informed decision based upon that like if people are going to just read one part of the story then of course they're going to make a decision just based upon that one part they're not going to make you know an informed decision based upon all of the price and because of that people are going to make you know some very poor choices I completely agree with that but to me the last 20 years have been an exercise in the other side in the legalization side doing a very very good job talking up its arguments and essentially there's there's almost nobody on the other side there's this one I bet what's got Jeff Sessions you had the [ __ ] goddamn attorney general that's telling people that good people don't smoke marijuana that's literally a quote yeah God that little morons not an office anymore but that's that's a terrible thing to say people don't smoke marijuana there's a lot of wonderful people who smoke - is not true and and and by the way I think this is a personal choice okay especially for adults yeah okay and and you can make bad personal choices you go look I play cards I'd love to play poker I'm said that on this trip to LA I didn't get to go to a poker room but you can go a new casino and you can see people of Los Angeles but you can go to a casino and see people who've lost their houses it doesn't mean that gambling should be illegal it also means that there's less and more dangerous forms that device in your hand where you can bet on what the next pitch is gonna be gonna be a ball or a strike yeah that's more dangerous than my having to drive to the commerce and play there and one hundred percent or 98 percent THC that an 18 year old vapes is a lot more dangerous than a 5 percent you know CBD 15 percent THC product the doctor heart might suggest his patient uses once a night to go to sleep but that that's the message that you know we should be putting out there right we shouldn't just be you know focusing on one side of the story like that part you know should also be you know and in the book and like you know your book you know in some ways has made me rethink the way that I write you know because my first book was co-authored with Jeremy cost and called friendly fire you know my second book that I'm writing now is called cannabis for PT G so it's how to transform post-traumatic stress into post-traumatic growth right because I feel that and you know we all know examples of people that have you encountered really difficult obstacles in their life and some people have you know succumb to that stress and they've gone down you know the wrong path kind of thing and then other people have used that stress to their advantage and they've actually become you know better because of it and you know CBD and THC can both help facilitate that process you know when you're looking at someone like like a veteran for example you know the hallmark of someone with PTSD is someone who doesn't leave their home and they can't sleep at night so like when I see a debt in my office a lot of the times they'll be leaving their home like five to ten days a month right so when you give them CBD and this is really important for people understand CBD has been shown to decrease learned fear that's incredible right so if you can get people outside of their home because I'm not talking about again you know someone who's you know too nervous to like go to a you know at the bar with like the friends or some like that I'm talking to people who like you know it's difficult for them to go to the grocery store just like pick up a few things so you know those are the type of people that I see in my practice with CBD is really excellent for that then when you look at you know the the nighttime component you know THC again is excellent for reducing nightmares that's been shown in studies and it was even shown with one pharmaceutical drug now blown again I don't really use now blown very much because it's only one cannabinoid and I do believe in the entourage effect and using all of the cannabinoids so I don't use that that much but that shows that she she can reduce nightmares and you know if you have you have you have PTSD I mean if you talk to someone who has PTSD and again this is this comes from a clinician support of you they will tell you I will try anything and that's the same way when you get with like you know the parents of kids who have see shoes all day nobody wants to see that yeah and like Alex you know if your kids you know ever started getting getting seizures which you know I hope I hope they don't because it's it's terrible you know what it can do to people but your when if that ever happened you know I would hope that you would consider you know CBD as a potential treatment I think she's not against that I think we have to be really clear as tension like CBD you know again CBD at all I don't know I don't think anybody is I think no one really is arguing except maybe the federal government in certain levels is arguing against CBD that's probably some pushback from the pharmaceutical industry the reality is CBD has proven to be at least as far as I've read very safe and very effective for a bunch of different disorders especially those that are about reducing and have it something do with inflammation or seizures yeah one of my good friends his son has developed seizures and CBD knocked it out just killed it this is very recently you know you're somebody who's you know who's a cannabis user you obviously know a lot of users why do you think it is that people you know in legal states where they can really express a preference they can go into a dispensary know exactly what they're buying why is it that they want such high potency THC product because they get used to it your tolerance develops it builds up you know every year we do this thing called sober October well we don't do any no drinking no no pot and then we do some sort of crazy challenge me and three of my buddies and when we do it what it's it's very interesting how your tolerance is radically reduced like I'll smoke pot at the end of that month and I'm like holy [ __ ] like I don't even know what I'm talking about in the mid-sentence and I'm just bullets creaked whereas you know now like I smoked a little weed last night did some stand-up had a great old time there's no issues with it at all but I'm used to it and if the weed that I smoked last I assume you don't smoke right I do not okay if you and me were together last night and I gave you a hit of my joint you'd be still there in the corner in the fetal position gone what and the [ __ ] is going on because the marijuana is ridiculously powerful but once you're accustomed to it once your body acclimates it's really not that big of a deal the problem is you you're dealing with a lot of habitual daily users and for those people like my friend Joey Diaz there's a video of him giving this other comedian how many milligrams of those stars of death Oh Tilly like when we give Owen what did he give oh I think just one he ruined his life and about 200 to 250 oh I made a video but the day changed Owens life like literally [ __ ] the guy's head up like he went outside he vanished he's gone yeah well I think I think there's a real argument to be made it's particularly with him well I was gonna make two points on that so you definitely can develop a tolerance yeah and I tell people all the time trying to take at least one three-week break but the evidence does show that if you stop for four weeks generally all your receptors return and it'll be like you've never used cannabis before yeah and that's even with people who are really really heavy users I can go back and get the study but I mean these people are you using I'm pretty sure it was like close like seven joints a day well really heavy users and noop dogs a good example of that you know my friend Tony Hinchcliffe his good buddies with Snoop Dogg and he said Snoop Dogg just smokes all day and he just like is always high and you know you're like well what do you do when you're not high he's like what I'm never not high so everything he does he is high as [ __ ] everything he does look for that guy it's not that big of a deal and for the way he lives his life like he's just a relaxed easygoing guy it's no problem you could be high all day and live his life and he's obviously wildly successful with this strategy yeah loudly second point I was gonna I was gonna make on that too though was there does not appear to be any tolerance at the cb2 receptor so she she attaches to the cb1 receptor and that's and that's where we know we can get tolerance you know some people you know they they have some pain they use some THC and sometimes they need a little bit more same sometimes asleep you know they use THC it'll work and then we'll stop working with CBD - we haven't seen that meaning like the people who you know get get seizure control generally they don't need to increase of dose like the girl I was talking about earlier you know I first subscriber I think when she was 20 and she was by him 20 she's 25 now she's never increased her dose and she's just used the same amount to CBD for the last think we should really stop talking about CBD I just wanted to make a note on the on the Italian someone I just want to make a note that CB to the doesn't appear to be tolerance it's all yeah it's just there's just such a significant impact when when it comes to especially edible THC it's a there's a significant impact on people's state of mind and it's not always good no that's just a fact we", "cXTeIZVjjeM": "good afternoon and thanks again for tuning in to another view tube video I'm dr. Victor Chau and you're joining us at the Medical Marijuana clinic of Louisiana YouTube and Facebook pages and today we're going to talk about a topic that's very important in the world of medical marijuana treatment and in fact was the top vote getter for our next YouTube video and article so many of you want to know about the different strains of medical marijuana a lot of people are surprised to find that medical marijuana is not just one thing either strains of medical marijuana that you'll take as a patient will be different from the patient that came before you and the patient that came after you it's a little bit like taking an antibiotic the antibiotic that you take for a UTI is different than the antibiotic that you'll take for a sinus infection it's different than the antibiotic that you'll take for pneumonia so when you go into the doctor it's important for the doctor to fully understand the condition that you have and the type of symptoms that you have in order to fully utilize all of the available medical marijuana strains that we have in order to give you the best treatment option so let's talk about the underlying biology of the medical marijuana plan so this goes into a little bit of the botany of the plant and how the plant is grown so a while back the people that grow the plant the horticulturalist they've sort of determined that the medical marijuana plan the cannabis can broadly be subdivided into two different types a cannabis sativa and a cannabis indica now originally this designation was made again to aid in the growing of the plant and they found that the sativa type of plants tended to grow a little taller a little bit quicker a little thinner and so when you planted them you could plant them close together and on the other hand the indica plants tend to grow a little bit shorter bushier a little bit slower and so you need to space them out a little bit more well it didn't take too long for people to notice well in addition to these physical attributes that these plants also had very similar attributes when used medically in terms of their physical and psychological effects so the way I explained it to a lot of patients is I want you to think about it if you're comparing say a convertible versus an SUV you know now there may be some convertibles that drive like SUVs and there may be some SUVs that drive like convertibles but for the most part the convertibles will all drive the same and the SUVs will all drive the same and we find that to some degree you can make a broad distinction between the sativa strains of cannabis and the indica strains of cannabis so let's talk about that now so when someone comes in to see me and I talked to them about a sativa type effect you know what we historically think of a sativa type effect for most people a sativa type effect you can think of it as a little bit stimulating so some of the pros of a sativa type strain is that patients feel that it gives them a little bit of a cerebral effect so they feel a little bit stimulated that they're able to think clearly they're able to do things they're able to do more than without it and it also helps to give them a little bit of where their pain is improved but they're not nearly so sedated where they can't function so a lot of people like to use sativas in the day time when they need to be active when they need to do a job when they have kids to take care of so a lot of people like the city that's because of the stimulating effect so who might not the benefit from a sativa well unfortunately because of that stimulating effect there's some categories of patients that may not do so well on it so for example if you're already in a sort of a hyperactivity state so if you have for example anxiety or a DD unfortunately that added stimulation may not work too well for you so there's a fine balance between making sure that the patients get a good effect but that the effect is not too strong for them so now let's talk a little bit about the indicus a good way that I like to think about the indicus is and you may have heard this before indica short for in the couch and a lot of people when they take in because they feel like oh they're very relaxed almost to the point of sedation their body is relaxed their pain is gone but unfortunately along with that relaxation is a sort of a lack of motivation sedation sleepiness that's why they're in the couch so a lot of people like to use indicas as their evening dose when they get home they're tired they just need something to help take the pain away something to help them get to sleep the combination of two is good for that again you can see what the cons would be is that this is not going to be a good necessarily daytime choice for most people especially if your day is involved with activities and jobs and kids and things like that now if you don't you know the indica may work well for you in the daytime as well but that's usually one of the main limiting factors with an indica type strain is there just the sedation that we see from it so you may have heard about hybrids so what is a hybrid how does it work so basically if you want to think of a sativa is like a convertible you know it's fast you know you use stimulating and the indica is like an SUV it's a little slow it's a little plodding along think of a hybrid as sort of a combination of both so just like your standard sedan okay it's not super maneuverable but it's decently maneuverable it's not super comfortable but it's decently comfortable so a hybrid if you just think about it it sort of combines the effects of the sativas in the indicas gives you sort of a middle-of-the-road effect so who would be a good choice for using a hybrid well somebody that comes to me and they say doc you know I just don't want a really complicated regimen I want something that I can say daytime and nighttime not get too sedated but not get too stimulated a hybrid would be a good choice it simplifies the regiment it's something that the patient can take sort of throughout the day throughout the night it's not going to be overly stimulating it's not going to be overly sedating because a lot of the effects of this sativa and the indica sort of balance each other out but you still end up getting good pain control and you could get good symptomatic relief from the THC level of the hybrid so finally the last thing we want to talk about is we want to talk a little bit about CBD because that's sort of the final strain that we deal with now the strains that we've already talked about the sativas indicas the hybrids those are predominantly THC high strains so your CBD strains are a lot of times going to be sort of like the yin-yang symbol you know the THC is the Yi the CBD is the yang there's sort of opposites so how do we use CBD well we've found that a lot of times CBD acts as a good counter balance to the THC so adding CBD to a patient who's primarily on THC will help to blunt some of the psycho activities some of the negative side effects of the THC so even in a where we might be using a sativa and indica hybrid will add a little bit of CBD just to boost the positive effects and decrease some of that negative effects now there may be patients that are pried down the other way around and they're predominantly on CBD so for example if we're dealing with patients that have any type of inflammatory condition like multiple sclerosis Crohn's disease things like that that regimen will be very heavy on CBD if we're dealing with patients that have seizures for example autism their regimens will also be heavy on CBD because of the neuro protective role that we feel CBD plays however even if a patient is on CBD there's actually a role to use a little bit of THC because we find the reverse is true as well while CBD doesn't tend to have a lot of side effects we do tend to find that adding some THC to patients that are using CBD we will actually help increase the positive effects of the CBD the CBD seems to work a little bit better and if any of you have watched some of my previous episodes where we talked about the entourage effect is for that very reason so it's one of the reasons why when we have patients that come in to see us and even though you can get CBD from both industrial hemp and medical marijuana for those patients that don't have access to medical marijuana we feel that the CBD chemically from hemp is identical to that from marijuana but you do lose a little bit of that entourage effect when you're using your CBD strictly from industrial hemp and it doesn't have that high level of THC that would encourage an entourage effect with the CBD so thank you for tuning in this is dr.

to my website where I have over three dozen articles and videos for you to learn more about medical marijuana thank you very much", "PxL8RgmvK3I": "hey what's up guys what did do is you boy mr. bling see I'm coming back at you with another video I think I just cringed after I said that but uh anyway today I wanted to just talk about some carts uh in specific fake carts because like I've been watching a lot of other people's videos on like your views of carts and [ __ ] and anytime they review something that's like a dank vape or a dab wood or like a cereal cart all I see in the comments are over you smoking home to fake cards oh you've got no food carts oh that car doesn't have the holo graphics on it so I think that fake um I would like to just say shut the [ __ ] up cuz like I'm pretty sure everyone who smokes carts knows that all of these aren't real carts because I mean it's pretty obvious if you smoke them yourself you can get different packaging which are like fake our carts from a fake cart in general but just starting off this video all of these carts are fake these two are real though I'm just gonna show you the packaging on these real quick so first off they have the California label and that's something only some of these fake car companies can write or copy onto their packaging but uh anyway you have a sticker that clearly labels your total THC and CBD content your strain how many milligrams you're getting and what type of weed it is you have this sticker label on the top that seals the box you have this sticker label on the back that lists your THC and CBD again and a government warning all of this information is on this legit kingpin packaging even the way the packaging it comes in obviously I mean like these are long since weak but uh you get a nice little kingpin cart it looks very nice it's all high quality you can open it in case you want to take the wax out it's a legit kingpin cart it even has the like the label a you can't scratch off I just hit my camera mess up my then I think it was a shame all right so you have all of these other companies that are making black-market cards all of these are black-market cards the thing is it's just some companies do it better than others and I don't know why some companies decide to lie about what they're putting in the curt's like trap house they put a rough percentage of your THC content they put all natural high percent organic no PG VG or PE d and they even copy the California sticker the thing is trap house is an alleged company and so these aren't real cards they're fake cards but they're high-quality fake cards if I would say so myself I just finished their Venice og one and like the waxen this was just as good if not better than the wax and these kingpin cards don't hate to kingpin though these were nice um but yeah so like just because it's a car is fake doesn't mean that it's not gonna work the thing is these are full of harmful chemicals not full of them but like Oh some more but these are pure wax they're not gonna harm you these though even though they say they don't have PG or VG they do they're mixed with that it's real wax but it's mixed to dilute it in therefore you get more use out of it the way you can tell if it's a higher quality fake wax is if it moves slowly and if it's like a deep golden color or like yeah a deep golden brown um I think out of all of these carts the worst one I've had was this chronomaly skittles cart obviously the packaging is fake I never seen Khurana play anywhere else it doesn't even have like the fake California label on it oh yeah it does but it's like an even weirder one they always say lab tested on percent organic but they're not like it's very obvious when you're hitting these cards that they are mixed with something some of them here really harsh dank babes as you can see his had to change sorry about that I had to fix my camera back because I'm sort of hit it while I was trying to talk about these dang babes packaging um what I was trying to say was dank babes has had to change their packaging three times since January because other people are now taking their packaging and putting fake tarts inside of already fake cart packages which is such an insane thought to me but it's kind of good that dank vapes likes to like at least change up the way that they're selling theirs think their stuff so that people are at least getting somewhat higher quality wax under thinning that I like another thing that I like about dang vapes is that you can't open these see cell atomizers that they use for their wax they're stuck closed and that's a good thing because the fact that all of these companies mix actual THC like weed wax with VG and PG it makes it harmful for you if you take it out of the cart when you're smoking it in the car it'll make you coffee cuz it's kind of harsh it might taste really good but it's still not that great for you imagine that but worse if you take and open these car packages and then you try to actually dab the wax from them Auto break some of these companies make it so that you can unscrew the top of their carts you can refill them obviously but then you can also take the wax out and that's where you can run into problems once you burn the wax that's mixed with VG and PG on a rig it can be super harmful for you because we're not supposed to be combusting those chemicals they're used in actual vape juice that you would mix with nicotine for people to stop smoking they're not meant to be used for THC cartridges obviously you can use them and people are but I feel like people should just put out the information that yes these are fake yes they do work but you have to at least also be careful with them and know what you're getting yourself into before you start trying to like just smoke cards out of the blue and thinking that all of these these are legit I'm pretty sure even exotic like their wax is around the same quality as dank vapes I'm not sure if they're super legit but I know that their wax is not like an amazing quality wax it's decent but it's not great these trap house cards they are pretty good I would suggest them just as highly as I would suggest at King pen but only with the information that these are mixed with VG and that they can harm you and I think like my basic opinion is that these cards while they are fake are just as good as legit carts as long as you know hey I'm sort of damaging my body by using these and you just continue with the information in mind if you can get legit carts I would highly suggest doing that because while they may not like get you as high as these like immediately you might take me need to take a few more hits but these also last longer they're more healthy for you and I mean the smoke is super smooth so it doesn't feel like I was harming myself at all when I was using these cards these carts are probably cheaper and more available to you so if that's your like only choice try some of them out but like try to figure out what brands you prefer over the ones that are like sort of harmful um I feel like this video ended up being a bit of a ramble I'm sorry about that but I also hope that if you did watch you enjoyed and um yeah I'll just catch you all next time see you", "HPeCUvEf2XA": "I have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor

for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made my opponent it's just like alright you won't turn it so I have to do it like this I got to hold it that's gonna be the video guys I hope you all enjoyed make sure to check out all the links in the description make sure to share the social media do all that [ __ ] like the video comment a subscribe do all that [ __ ] I'll see you in the next video we're just gonna be on I'll see you in the next video which is gonna be on Wednesday maybe even sooner [Music]", "F1Gj0gPR_Lk": "hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day today we're gonna be answering some questions that you sent to us through YouTube or Instagram and yeah everybody's gonna be anonymous for privacy purposes so here we go question number one new to vaping what factor does voltage play in to vaping amazing question first of all I would say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than that I would say you know give customer service a call I'm sure we can take care of it for you that'll do it for today guys hope that was helpful let us know if you want to see more of these send in your questions I want to know I want to answer them but yet peace", "fVIclho0GoY": "[Music] yeah see i understand the purple lotus was started up you know quite different than i think a lot of other dispensaries and especially dispensaries in san jose were established it was just established by my by my wife and i was in a situation where i had a lot of money that i was coming into this with a huge investment or anything and just lost you know money doing in a business venture um it was kind of my first forte into business that lost a lot of money was credit card debt but we started up the shop with a very small amount of money about fifteen thousand dollars when i opened the shop i had you know just four jars of marijuana about a little less than two pounds of marijuana i mean this this place over here really set us off i mean you would have people flocking from all over this area to to come on a daily basis it became a community of people the landlord that i was leasing from was leasing to another dispensary upstairs so we had we had competition up there and all humility you know they were closed within about three months of us being there um you know we just my motto was to reinvest that product you know i sold the original product and then i made the sacrifice didn't hire anybody i worked for a year straight just myself right there every day all day and just put all the money back in the product and that increased business and so many people were such strong advocates because they saw what we were about which was first of all people love great cannabis they love great wheat so we had great weed at the good price and then we were good people we got more involved in the community and because people came every day we became you know they became part of our lives we became part of theirs also when we first moved in here i mean i would park up here every day and then at night time i would take the bud with me inside ikea bags for the first maybe three months because i didn't really have a good safe situation so i would take it with me at the end of the night bring all the cannabis back with me the next morning i said this was popping up here as much as i like to at the time say that they weren't you know people smoking people you know a lot going on up here in the parking lot we ended up needing to get a guard up here to ensure that everything was all cool everything was all cool but they came from every which way they came by car they came by bike scooter walking because these apartments right here and all this area around here you know the bus stops right there this was a community right here people are proud to say that they came here to jackson you hear people say oh i've been coming here since jackson great great great memories from this place fought hard to stay here you know didn't work out but uh this will always be the original [Music] spot we barely squeaked into our next location over on lundy it was it was a rough move i mean it was not a successful situation at all it's very tough to get somebody to lease to us during that time it's not like now it's still very federally legal and people are really concerned we paid six months in advance and got the place over here and once again from day one we had issues um you know just especially in this place this has a shared uh it's an office building uh as a shared air conditioning unit by this time we were carrying a large supply of marijuana and uh the whole buildings just stunk like even though this is not far away people felt like it was far away so this was always a place where we were waiting for white road this is you know we had white road that we were building out while we were here so we struggled through this place they wanted to evict us from day one we fought through that and ended up staying for six months while the business i don't think grew a lot of customers during that time what we did is we grew a lot of resilience during that time we used to tell them hey uh you'll find this over by the loading dock you know you know that's i believe at one point we ran an extension cord from way over here down to the street just so that we could sit there and put a light out so that people could know that we could tell them that there's a light down there because it was so dark you would miss this because this is a building that closes at nighttime except for if you're selling wheat up here then it closes a lot later [Music] this was the nicest place we had built out beautiful place it was formally been a bar and we just made it really nice restored the bar had it all set up to serve it was really right in the middle of where at that point a good portion of our patient base was that opened up people were lined out everybody they were fighting to be the first person to say that they were the first person to come through the door um you know my mom came to pictures of all of us so happy to be opening up this great location we have been working for months to get it we didn't have a lot of money evicted from the other spot this other spot unlucky wasn't working out so you know we got this set up big day our biggest day ever still had the other location open but pushing most of the people down here feeling great eight o'clock sheriff's come tell us we need to close this it just happens to be this whole area is san jose and this corner right here out of all this area annexed to the county and the city had given us a business license for the address but it still fell underneath the county zone and the county at that time it had a ban on all cannabis activity even though san jose city allowed it this was a beautiful place we put all of our resources into and they closed this place down right here it was a big blow it hurt especially after only being open for about 10 hours [Music] you know 903 was was a blessing i didn't see it at the time but blessings come hidden and you know looking at the spot there's only about eight parking spots assigned to us but see how you can make that work especially with the employees and you know us needing parking we ended up uh leasing a little spot next door for parking um and making it work we put four or five security guards there at about a 50-yard uh uh distance and they just funnel people in and out in and out in and out it was a 4 20 weekend hey what year we moved in over there and uh it was actually it was a convention there's a big hemp con or something in town and uh we did 42 42.8 you know out the door and by that time we had built our our our venue up to 30 or 35 strains good bud 42 out the door and it you know it worked so well that we just kept it moving from there we just decided hey this works and we just kept on doing it and we kept on selling at 42.8 and it became just very popular we got to the point that it was you know we were running five six hundred people a day in through what was a 600 square foot retail sales floor with eight parking spots i'll tell you man one christmas day we're the only shop open man lined up from here all the way down to the head man waiting to get inside the facility we were the only club open on christmas we've been we never closed from the first day we opened we never closed we never been closed for one day we've been open for i think it's coming up on 4 000 days in a row no matter what happened we opened almost 4 000 days in a row [Music] listen lou gehrig type street [ __ ] you know what i mean you started talking about that you know with iron man because iron man [Music] you", "BvGBi78LFaI": "the five strongest THC strains of cannabis plant for 2020 if you know your th C's from UCB TS you will recognize the importance of high levels of THC in the strains of cannabis plant so what should you keep your eye out for in 2020 if you want a high concentration of THC in your cannabis the following is a list of the five most popular THC plants commonly grown at number five there is Girl Scout cookies which is probably one of the best strains of Californian marijuana plants available we also lightly seeds as they are feminized and plants should be ready to harvest within eight to nine weeks of germination you can expect a THC concentration of between 25 and 28 percent at number four there is wedding cake which is at a keen price for such a THC rich strain this plant will give you a great sativa hide and you will find that her little goes a very long way at number three Cali glue Auto joins the list with a more than healthy THC level of around 23 percent we also like this as it flowers within 60 to 70 days and can cope with wide temperature fluctuations it was a close call but at number 2 we have Bruce Banner with origins from Colorado it was registered at the u.s. Cannabis Cup with a THC level of 28% which was the highest at the time pride of place and storming in at number one comes hulk burry the alter ego of the incredible hulk with a THC level of 27% and slightly lower than Bruce Banner this took the coveted crown because of its fruit berry and hint of citrus aromas that makes it a little bit extra special what about you have you experienced a mind fog like no other from a particular strain of cannabis if so let us know in the comments section below providing it was legal to smoke cannabis where you were time and of course if you enjoyed this

like alright guys thank you for another video your boy Shaka if you don't know who I am my name is Shaka Zulu if you see my videos you haven't subscribed yet please subscribe subscribe and if you're new to the channel subscribe cos right I'm always coming with a good vibe doesn't love my videos mat now you might not love it you might love it I don't know keep watching and you'll find out but today as you can see from the title I bought I basically bought a live turkey and cart and I bought a live resin cart and I thought the live terpene cart was a live resin cart because when I went into the dispensary I went to a dispensary out and I think my desk I can't remember what the dismiss of his name was but when I went out to the dispensary I asked can I get one of your life resin what kind of life resins you got and she showed me the live it was a live terpenes actually it wasn't my present so I decided to do research on it and find out what's the difference between a live resin car in the live terpene cart so that's what you guys are going to get today but before I get into that this [ __ ] truck is made how [ __ ] I hope you guys can [ __ ] hear me but you already know your plea kind of start this off without bond rip you guys [Applause] [Music] buddy you gotta start to vlog off right with a bomb grip diet but yeah I'm probably gonna get out the car actually cuz I want to show you guys you're not wearing that to park that I'm app so cuz if you guys are on quarantine and you're scared to come outside or you just don't want to come outside you want to be extra safe I want y'all to get to see you know where I'm at so you feel like you're outside you feel me so you feel like you outside get your join get your bongs and go on a little walk with me out here and we're gonna talk about this live resin and live Terps guys but before that let me I got one more thing to tell you guys I'm coming off on 400 subscribers when I hit 500 subs I'm gonna do a Q&A video so if you have any Q&A questions put them down below I'm gonna try not to answer your questions I'm used to just answering people's questions so make it a serious question maybe even say it's a Q&A question if you can but if not I'll like it I'll like it but I won't reply and the reason why I'm not replying is because I want it to be a Q&A question for I want to save up some Q&A questions basically for my video but um let me get out here let me get my wax pan get that live resin I'm smoking on the the nut rot live resin it's berries and cream I forgot to say it in my video last time what the strain name actually was but it's berries and cream [ __ ] way go hi guys all right guys [Music] it's actually a good amount of people out here but I'm still working under a willow tree hopefully you can see I give you a quick overview all right guys the first difference is each stretch it's different than like you know your typical shatter crumble turps because it's two different extractions it's the process it's called a freeze frozen process where they extract and extract the wax before they actually care all right so when you chop down the plan you skip the whole curing process it helps preserve the terms and it also gives it that you know that flavor profile that comes straight from the flower that I roam that days you know I mean preserves all that although they do here the plant when they make terpenes on the other hand I'm gonna talk about terpenes now they the turps cards the live turf cards are usually way more fresh and are cleaner and less harsh on your throat because they take out the fats and the lip nodes the lip node another difference also up to is you can see the layer of terpenes in the jar when they make a so like you can actually take a dab of that term because the THC content is way different in fibrous and I think it's a less THC content so it but it gives you more but if I'm wrong people tell me I'm not I'm just going off of what I've been reading about the live resin and in the Terps the live resin turps because I do have a car a live resin Terp cart I got this car is called freak n abisco I think it's called I'll show you guys later but I haven't tried to get live resin nut cart you fit me snot Benz obviously prefer libraries and more than flavors and herbs but imma try both for both II for you guys but that's all I really know know about my present look at the difference between libraries and in terms I'm not I don't know that much more if you guys have any more information for sure put that [ __ ] down in the comments you guys already know I check out cuz I want to learn more about the libraries in interns honestly and the different methods of extracting because I've been one to make my own some [ __ ] to get like a press

"EdoUnJuENuQ": "I'm gonna meet up with John Dawson from kung-fu dates to make some custom flavors of hash oil but the guests can consume music bait pens this is what we call soil tool rental product and what we're doing here is instead of taking oil and putting it on a hot nail and ad average or digitally dabbing write this is the wave of the future well let's make some vape pen cartridges dude let's do it awesome I can't wait to mix and terpenes so give you some blanks all right so this is my blank right here Glo empty cartridge right and this is called a removable center post and urine and screw the top you find your favorite oil people go with some raw okay great I just want to fill it up to this line right here right sure okay so looks like that's almost up to the line there don't want to add terpenes what flavor do you want to do so let's try Wi-Fi OG yeah sounds good to me so for that amount of wallet you need such a small money like a half of a micro drop okay gotcha I'll just put a timer all right okay so I've got that in there and yeah so I could feel from this arrange that that wall was pretty warm so that'll mix up quickly and sure I'm already getting a crazy amount of aroma Wow yeah that's incredible so now I stick my plunger stick your plunger in you kind of move it around you're gonna tear that shirt and just push it down it screws into the bottom there we go how many hits of cannabis are in one of these so you figure when we're at a half you're looking at 500 milligrams of THC now 500 milligrams in the cartridge for average everyday users that'll last a week let me say this real go sit with epic hits man I mean the flavor on this is uh it's pretty epic yeah but like I said we're travelling around the city where we're going to and from this is how everybody's going to be consuming thank you so much for showing me this up I think it's gonna be a great complement to the dinner party absolutely [Music]", "ByBSNg5cYDA": "am I the only high one here yeah you're nuts what's a comma he's the only thing I don't do and I'm stoned has come the only thing I don't do when I am stoned see it again the only thing I don't only thing guys do are you smoking something I don't you saying you're always coming when you're when I'm sober I can't stop coming indica or sativa sativa indica sativa indica 60 million Americans suffer from insomnia and indica helps reduce that what are you gonna say to those Americans life is short why the would you sleep through any of it maybe if we had fewer lazy people in this country they can actually enjoy a decent strain I think sativa is for the productive mind I don't believe that you smoke weed oh I I do very much smoke weed but I don't smoke that it would in the couch  no in the car no no that's how you remember in the car you're in the car become the couch in it why are you defending this so you guys smoke that young Republican sativa weed I smoke this stuff that keeps me awake and paranoid and paranoia is a survival trick you you guys need to calm down you need to perk up well that's kind of sexist no it is sexist so you guys smoke weed to keep you prepared for a win they say whenever someone's behind you and that's often the case no one was there ok back to basics if you ask me do I want to chill out or do I want my brain to be running running running through a field I'm gonna say I want to chill out and I think most of us probably late to chill if we get a choice what's the point of school then school tells us to think sativa does the job for us the construction of a school day is crazy year you have to do your homework well I think we all agree school sucks that's not what's on the table right now school doesn't suck it sucks when you're not on sativa so you were high throughout school how are you not how did you make it through school sativa and if I smoked indica I would be in on the floor like a stupid jackass in the floor you smoke weed and then you think about every relationship that you ever had in your life and all the people that you've touched and all the people that you've heard and also how all everyone doesn't really like you that much and that you're a burden and then you work on that and you journal about that and it sounds like your problems are um are a little bigger than wheat and it's a downward spiral sure you think real dark thoughts it's a piece of time to go through but at least you're thinking smoke in the cut you go in in the prison see there's also just a sexier word sativa you get into I don't know if you want to do that what were you doing touching my nipples and by the way I'm only wearing a shirt on this show because I have to do the again now don't do it for Jordan Jordan loves this he loves nipples he wants you to love sativa you don't have to he will have to do the things that he says name another thing the two of you agree on is this it is that all you have we love you both rock a small pause oh yeah that's neither here nor there we enjoy we have big joints and that's the point you think a penis is a joint wait no no we have big joints your big elbows and a small dick you have an elbow on him it isn't a joint it has a joint your penis has been and yours doesn't like a Bionicle yeah like a Bionicle so your dick is like a bent leg oh wait okay do you worry that maybe there's been so much sativa in your life that your dicks are now right angles my penis doesn't necessarily have bad posture it's just like always in downward dog don't word Bulldog give yourself some credit our Bulldog that's a smaller they're smaller but they're thick he's got like a can of Pepsi down there the dimensions on this are honestly a nightmare and I think we should move but am I the only High one here yeah you're not with a comma Jay's the only thing I don't do when I'm stoned has come the only thing I don't do when I'm stoned say it again the only thing I don't only thing I do I thing I don't know you smoke a lot thing I don't do it scum what does that mean I come when I was you saying you're always coming when you're not stoned but just always coming no it's just that the only thing he doesn't do when these fires come when I'm sober I can't stop coming and why you're high you can't start that's why I had the confidence to wear shorts today cuz you know you're not gonna come dry as a whistle the shape of the sativa leaf finger like leaves yeah I think we can all agree that's creepy as fingers are terrifying so if you have to choose between a freaky finger II kind of spooky warming leaf and sort of a cool not gonna freak you out leave I think you're gonna go for the one that's not spidering gonna wake you up in it what's wrong with spooky woman okay listen to this you wake up in the middle of the night Jordan okay it's dark it's darkest and it's earring there's no sound usually there's a car outside your house yeah what's you wish you can't see anything and behind your head Oh God you feel like a tinkling tinkling spindle II finger come behind your ear and trace the outline of your ear with her spindle II finger mom where why are you here are you scared it's a woman spooky or is she fine where are you scared that she's gonna grab your neck so the idea is that that spooky finger is more like sativa and indica sort of like someone just kissing your cheek and falling asleep next to you like a soft hug mom why are you in the couch now that has nothing to do with marijuana I'm touching your nipples here I'm touching a lot more touching the nipple stop it like how was your shirt loose but your nipples so prominent well because I had the sound guy on me putting the wire through here you can't not get excited if you got soft nipples then you're all soulless

alarming breaking news report about vaping it's a new piece of the puzzle that may explain the mysterious vaping injuries we've been covering here on the show from double lung transplants to even death I mean big complications is the culprit black-market THC the chemical in marijuana that gets you high and listen products are being sold to unsuspecting customers that have no idea what they're buying may be lethal senior legal and investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden brings us this as an NBC News exclusive our investigation took us to downtown Los Angeles where in a 12 block radius we saw dozens and dozens of storefronts advertising vaping products we're in pursuit of what black market operators come here for the empty packaging and cartridges that they fill with cheap and often tainted substances sold as legitimate THC products within minutes we score we were able to go in one shop one-stop shopping by these dank VAP containers the packaging and a hundred of the cartridges into which you can put whatever you want there's no ID no tax no nothing and it's counterfeit marijuana babes like these that may be making people sick I do believe that I was given black market stuff and I do believe that had a had an effect on me Fabian says his lungs were slowly beginning to shut down he ended up in the emergency room I couldn't breathe I couldn't talk I really couldn't even move my hands so what is lurking in these black market vapes and are the legal ones even safe no one not even the FDA or the CDC had tested the actual vapor people are sucking into their lungs until now we revealed those results Cynthia joins us what exactly is marijuana vape and how do you compare it to the typical East cigarettes or tobacco baby ok so a step backwards vaping is just taking a liquid of the compound heat it up and then that vapor is what you suck into your lung so if it's nicotine like a Joule which has 80% of the market that's tobacco THC the active ingredient in marijuana it's made into a liquid form and then it's heated up and then you suck that into your so again the cartridge looks like this that's what we were buying that's what we were buying on these are the ones we bought on the street so we bought for a hundred bucks we bought a hundred containers and a hundred of these so if I'm a black-market manufacturer of THC oil I'm in business when you walked into that store yeah what actually transpired what was the conversation like you said I got a hundred bucks when you got for me did you have to sort of lead him along how'd you hook that the fish well the first thing I would say is that we had our choice of dozens and dozens and dozens of stores in downtown Los Angeles all of them selling these kinds of illicit products and so we said hey we want to buy some containers we rolled off a few of the illicit names that are popular dank vapes is one you've got it right here dank vapes it is associated with many of the people who got sick it is not a legitimate brand there is no company called dank vapes so the black market on this which is what's concerning to me seems to be dominant there doesn't seem to be any way of digging taking them out less consumers are unsuspecting well even more insidious there are legitimate brands that aren't contaminated of THC oil that you can buy in states where it's legal and these counterfeiters make boxes and carts that look exactly like those legitimate brands so the consumer has essentially no idea what he or she is going to get so the Mac market operators fill empty cartridges with their own substances and then they're selling them as legitimate tested products but what exactly are they putting in there and is it dangerous Cynthia brought the stuff to a lab to find out if the chemist a flabs in Los Angeles considered one of the top marijuana testing facilities in the world can a safe executives Aaron Riley and Antonio Frazier explain they've come up with a brand new test we wanted to design a system that would be able to provide reproducible results to do something they wish the government would do analyze the vapor produced by illicit THC oil Canas they've tested seven THC cartridges from licensed dispensaries and six from the black-market we come back the shocking results from the lab [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I'm back with NBC News investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden and for the very first time a new lab test is able to tell us exactly what is in the vapor produced by THC oil when you vape what's actually going into your lungs to remind everybody what you tested okay we tested seven legitimate products these are licensed brands from licensed dispensaries and then on the black market we tested six black market these are listen what did the kind of safe lab testing show was in the vapor coming out of it okay there were no contaminants in either the oil we also tested the oil previously either the oil or the vapor here if that was used at the temperature that's recommended we can talk about that let's say that the lowest temperature or lower temperature lower temperature because guess what when you crank the thing up which is what kids do because it makes more vapor Oh carcinogens yeah so not safe anymore not safe anybody know what happened to black market cartridges even when it was turned at the right power setting on the low side okay under the best set of circumstances this stuff is dangerous it's contaminated this is just you're asking for it you vape this stuff you're asking for it well they're stealing your money it's not surprising they would steal your health well what percentage of America is given products that are counterfeit yeah you're asking questions really hard to answer because this is the illicit market the black market it's underground law enforcement is having a really hard time getting a Tanz around this think about it I mean the FDA isn't testing this stuff why it's not legal across the country so the FDA doesn't have the authority to test these brands but you know states are doing the best they can but the best they can it's not good enough in my opinion because we've got a population doesn't appreciate I just the things I've read maybe it's a quarter maybe it's half of all the stuff is counterfeit it's being brought basically from a drug dealer all right the THC oil let's go through exactly what kinds of things were found in your testing by the way it's state of the art and I would applaud you for doing this because our own government is in doing this we've finally got the answers from you well some of the things none of them good carbon monoxide formaldehyde pesticides well we're in the counterfeit stuff the ELISA stuff for rat you find a couple things that surprised you yeah it'll surprise you to cyanide yeah you don't want your kids breathing that stuff you just don't or yourself and vitamin E oil which is a little bit confusing it really sounds healthy but what they want though is the consumer to think it's real THC oil so they mix it with vitamin E oil why they pick that one because the viscosity the thickness is the same as vitamin E oil so these are really crafty dastardly criminals so let's talk a little about vitamin E because I think it's exam it's emblematic of the problem here we all know substances like pesticides and sine are dangerous let me talk about it but vitamin E sounds healthy right but when you inhaled the vapor with vitamin E in it it goes into your lungs right at the high temperature it's converted into an oil to a grease in your body once in a long some say that it coats the Airways and when it does that then coats the Airways it starts an inflammatory reaction making it really hard to breathe the information in the oil get into the tiny little sacs these little sacs alright of your lung they're not hard to treat now the CDC thinks vitamin E is that big culprit behind these marijuana vaping deaths and injuries but we're no unsure and if these black markets your products are being sold like this the question I'm having everybody is what can people do to make sure that they're getting something that's safe well don't buy illicit products buy from a licensed dispensary is one thing I just want to add a little bit to your vitamin E oil here's so the Mayo Clinic as you know did a of testing on 17 patients who had that vaping illness and they discovered that the lungs of those patients looked like someone who'd been exposed to mustard gas so it's why it's important they're only state regulated marijuana dispensaries in states were its legal right to your point the government won't regulate it because it's only in these states so when you look at the country if you're in a red state maybe you're buying marijuana from a legitimate place right if you're in a great state guarantee or not then if it in the red states from Cynthia Stella me is there more of the illegal places illicit places than illegal ones which means you're buying the stuff from drug dealers they're not legitimate sellers I don't see a difference between two groups so you've got another big warning which I wanted to point out which is the temperature warning just make that really clear to folks so when we tested the legal product that didn't have the contaminants that are horrifying the cyanide and other things cranked up higher they produce what the lab told us were carcinogens but you know if your kids are doing it tell them making those big vapor puffs is just not worth it it could be killing them so if you're not buying THC cartridges for a licensed dispensary in states where they're illegal here's the picture again right you're buying them from the drug dealer don't do it and if your vape pen is an adjustable temperature setting don't crank it all the way up because it's dangerous lots of data support in this now use the low power setting Cinthia wonderful reporting thank you very much you can catch Cynthia's reporting on today and NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt and be sure to check out Cynthia's latest report the results of a year-long NBC exclusive investigation where she uncovers an underground army of child laborers in Africa they are digging up a mineral being used in everyday cars planes and cell phones that's where I'll use them we'll put a link to the special report on dr. oz comm I'll be right back [Applause] [Music] be sure to subscribe to my channel so you don't miss anything and remember to check back often to see what's new", "I34PPDal-vk": "in this episode of the modern cannabis we're gonna be talking about indica and sativa and hybrid you know those three weed strains one makes you all energetic makes a queen house and one makes you up to the couch and sleepy and naptime but is it really the case I hear a lot of different versions of the story we're gonna dive into the science and to the reality of those topics tonight with the monarch Animists we have Jerry in Austin and myself Troy from fortunately Bebe's own we are your three modern cannabis and tonight we're gonna be we're gonna be vaping a bunch of weed and exploring indica or sativa what do you what do you guys have a pin on tonight go ahead Austin I'm gonna be vaping on the one form from Planet of the vapes and I have the vortexes sitting here and we may pull off the sticky break we'll see how long this thing go all right oh man yeah I'm rolling with the one as well but I'm sticking it on this thing I got a chance last week the polar blast this guy was there with these ice mugs for bongs and he packed some full ice and he had a little you can smoke with it but he has a little little kind of gone connector here so we can put the one right on there it's a perfect little walk around with some ice cold so I'm kind of stoked right now I got some hippie Crippler which I believe is an indica dumb and it Hybrid feels that way we'll talk about what that means that's a pretty cool contraption Jerry I'm diggin it so you're you said you said it's an indica dominant hybrid I think so it feels that way to me so in the traditional strain definitions of cannabis they always say that cannabis has like two different species of sativa and indica but in reality it's not really species of the plant it's all it's all one plant even hemp is the same plant at plant as marijuana but as far as the indica and the sativa the traditional wisdom kind of says that indica makes you you a Orpha body high in sativa is more like a mental euphoria but how do you how do you see those results with what you're vaping now you said it's an indica dominant hybrid would you say those effects are a reality you know it's all about how we communicate and you know we've had got this anecdotal thing like you said sativa indica and the hybrids and and what they mean and it really from experience it's a way to communicate there's some other guys come out with some new ideas but typically when I say an indica dominant hybrid I mean something that's gonna kind of take it down the middle I'll get I'll get some good head high as well as some some little bit of body feel but then towards the end I get a little sleep here and a little more cow cheese so you know like about a ninety minutes a two hour ride that kind of goes like that kicking ass I'm gonna be vaping on both I I went out and I chose a very strong known sativa and a pretty strong indica so I have Sour Diesel lemon cush going on here and then I have purple punch for my indica and I'm gonna vape sativa first and I've already been then I've already been vaping sit even already have kind of a mental high and halfway through the show I'm gonna switch to an indica just to see how things go Austin I know you have a lot more smoking background I know you're you're a full time vapor now and you're also in a legal state so from your past smoking experience yeah have you have you ever even been mindful of indica or sativa or notice the difference in the smoking world so I would say that I've noticed a difference but I couldn't tell you what it was you know I just because being in this net time you know I can't just go to the store and say hey I want in the car hey I want sativa I just get hey let me put some material in my blunt let's bump this [ __ ] and I'm gonna go play some video games either I'll play video games all night or I'll play video games I'd fall asleep you know so but I did I do notice though that there is there was a difference because I remember sometimes I would get like anxiety just like a whole bunch of [ __ ] anxiety from from certain strains and other strains I just felt a lot more relaxed and wanting to watch some some movies and [ __ ] heat some chips and call it a day until I saw burn up a little bit so from from the smoking days I don't think I ever paid attention to be honest with you yeah you know from for me and I remember my smoking days it was a lot of the same and I think there was two different highs that we had but it wasn't it wasn't so obvious like there was like the high where we'd get out and and and do demolition derby on the righthand lawnmowers at this farm and then there was a time where we would just all pass out on the couch and just you know watch some dumb movies but we never we never really associated it to different strains we just kind of thought it was more of what are we in the mood to do like we always treated canvases hey we're gonna go get high we're gonna do something whether it's gonna be watch it at watch a movie or we're gonna go [ __ ] around and I still treat it that way even though in the vape space I do notice a pretty significant difference between sativa and indica I just power through it no matter what you know I was today I was doing some more research on on the differences just because I wanted to have more of an understanding of what the traditional wisdom is right and I came across these articles I'm gonna read to you some of what this article said and it says it gives me examples of both the Innoko and the sativa and it says the major qualities of indica medical strains include increased mental relaxation muscle relaxation decreases nausea decreases acute pain it increases appetite and it increases dopamine which is a neurotransmitter that helps control the brain's reward and pleasure centers and they say that that's that's used mostly for night time and then there is the major qualities of sativa okay are in anti-anxiety antidepressant treats chronic pain increases focus and creativity it increases serotonin which is a neurotransmitter involved in the regulation of learning mood sleep anxiety and appetite and they recommend this for daytime use so upon reading that you know that that really kind of breaks it down to me and like I said when I would back in the smoking days I can relate to both of those back then I wasn't paying attention like oh this is what it's making me do but I can I can remember that there's definitely a difference I just couldn't pick and choose when I would get that difference yeah I think I think a lot of that is the differences are one there they're subtle I mean if you take a super strong sativa and compare it to a super strong indica you you make the very biggest difference but everything in between is is really just kind of in between and even a lot of sativas that I buy and and I have the luxury of being in California where I can walk into the store to the dispensary and look at oh these are the 15 sativas and these are the 15 indicas and these are the 30 hybrids that are in between in reality almost all the sativas are also in between and almost all of the indicas are also in between like all of the strains always have kind of some of both like there's there's not a lot of strains that are one end of this thing that makes sense because now somebody will tell me what strain I'm getting right and they'll say I'm getting blah blah cush for example and I'll go to leaf Lee and see you know what is the most dominant traits that I'm gonna get from this plant and even it will say creativity and [ __ ] energy but then it'll it'll it'll show some of of relaxation you know I'm saying cuz you have the bars where it just shows you how far on that bar system graph you get from each of these things that that are prominent in the strain and there's always some some of the other yeah that's a cool set I like to where they break that down and make it really easy for you to kind of check it out sometimes I look at it and I wonder am i setting myself mentally by by you know what I made am I am I am I gonna create that now you be yourself the placebo effect yeah there you go there you go so I always wonder about that cuz I mean they really are I mean it seems like everything's some sort of a hybrid look man I mean I'm I'm still in a state that just became legal and I still don't know that I really trust some of the stuff that I get here I just got a whole bunch of blue dream and it just looks like whatever you know I just you know and I literally got it just because I thought it would be and I wanted to see if it was whatever so the one thing we've learned about the whole indica sativa hybrid thing is it's really not as cut and dry as the three labels make it out to be and when you get into the science it's really about the terpenes and the entourage effect of all those different terpenes and cannabinoids because there's hundreds of them every every cannabis plant every kind of a strain there's hundreds of different terpenes and cannabinoids and every every strain has a different combination of them and those different combinations all deliver in effect so even if one strain has grown in four different environments at four different regions with four different soils and four different climates that same strain will essentially have slightly different turkey and cannabinoid profiles because of because of the way it was grown and give you a subtly different high or majorly different to it depending on the strain don't you love organics I mean the possibilities are endless man I just love that you can take one strain and come up with all kind of different things just based on environment and it kind of mimics us man we come out as little babes and the environment just beat us up and runs us around and then we're a certain way you know and you know they focused on THC a while ago and everybody's always about how much THC is in this thing and I go man I'm so sick hearing about that I mean this is the first thing we discovered a while back and it's all we know and so that's how we measure it and then we started noticing CBDs and so they start you know tracking that stuff and oh look at the medicinal effects and then all of a sudden it was it a few years ago that the terpenes started making a big difference and all of a sudden that was all that mattered and now I'm here in southern flavor noids are gonna be you know the next thing and it's just there's so much going on in this thing we don't know I honestly think we don't know what's up I mean we're at the tip of the iceberg on this thing so we could all like get passionate argue sides about something but I think it's all gonna get re proved or disproved or deeper figured out later and we're all gonna be wrong about most for you guys that are there listening or watching if you're wondering what terpenes are myself personally i had to google it i wanted to i wanted to get more information on what what terpenes are and what I found is that terpenes are the fragrant oils found in plants that determine the character and effects of cultivars I believe Cu LTI VAR s cultivars we're never in a question mark that one they are found in all living plants not just cannabis terpenes play an essential role in wine aromatherapy and perfume because of the psychoactive effects of certain terpene combinations that stimulate aroused or sedate so that's where like you were saying troy the entourage effect the different the different terpenes are gonna give you different effects regardless of if it's indica or sativa dominant terpenes play a big role yep yep absolutely yup we don't and we're only tracking like about a dozen of them right now there's there's tons of those as well I mean that's what I love about it is every time we discover some of this stuff we go look man how much we can figure out with these 12 or 16 and then there's like another couple hundred in there messing around - let me tell you what's I know I just got those plenty of the babes one today and I've been i've been using it man and I'll tell you what this thing puts out [ __ ] clouds it's got a little a session time around here and I let it sit at 4:30 with my CBD in here and I just and I just roast it man you can give some [ __ ] clouds out of this thing you're gonna be relaxing from that bad action there I like it yeah man this same thing is filling up this little polar thing over here with these good little design men when it comes to like customizing your high and choosing like what kind of energy you're looking for I think that's really where vaporizers shine because when you smoke a strong sativa you can still get really stoned and versus we're just smoking at us and in the could harder tell the difference when you're smoking when you're vaporizing you can isolate those temperatures of the terpenes and cannabinoids so you're not not boiling off the sedate of cannabinoids you're kind of selecting your high by choosing the temperatures and I forgot where this was going really high I forgot what I was saying CBD actually CBD does vape CBD does vape at 4:30 100% I actually pulled up the chart that we will make sure that we can show you during the video but I found a chart online that actually breaks down the different compounds are in the THC you know lets you know from from 220 degrees all the way up to 450 one which is combustion alright so you know we've got from 220 where releases THC a a strong sedated anti convulse event all the way to combustion which is 451 where it states that the fire it releases toxic chemicals by producing smoke into the air and the good thing is with these vaporizers especially the battery-powered vaporizers is we can actually control the temperatures in which we've a bath so we can medically or recreationally extract the specific contact yeah and get those charts are getting nicer man that's that's pretty sweet I like how I laid that uh yeah I really like this one you know it's different from smoking you know you smoke and you basically poof it all goes up and you destroy half of it and then you get the rest of it all at once and when you're vaporizing you can you can dial in certain temperatures that only go so far in terms of what they're gonna to liberate and that was one of the draws to me when I first started vaporizing because you know like like we were talking earlier you just get whatever you can as far as herb on the street and you don't know what you're getting and and it's hard to get a sativa but but I could take any of those hybrids and they're always hybrids that I could get and throw them in my vape and keep it at 350 to 390 and really have that heady daytime social cleanup thing that I thought I was chasing and then I could keep the rest of it for at night I bump up the temperature and use the same or at night and and they'll be my night cap and I still do that now I've got a I got a whole dish over here right here that's everything that I've baked at a lower temp and I'm gonna beat it up later at a higher temp and that's been one of the great things about vaping for me is being able to get the flexibility from from the machine that I wasn't able to get on the street from the way yeah I think I think that's absolutely right man and it's almost like vaporizers are a better tool for customizing your high than relying on indica versus ateva versus hybrid and all that [ __ ] for a lot of people because you can you can vape an indica at lower temperatures and not get sleepy high and you can vape a sativa at a higher temperature and get the sleepy high because I I do it all the time on accident and that's well it's really cool to like like what you just touched on Jerry is is the temp stepping where you can take any strain vape it at 350 save it for later if you want to put it back in your vaporizer turn that [ __ ] up to 400 and extract the rest of the compounds that are left over so you're not you get everything almost out of out of vaping and and what's even I cost my lungs up earlier and I thought I muted but I didn't these mics are setting us up but uh that that's another thing that I really love about these vaporizers man is you can take this material that I've been using for a long [ __ ] time and you know now with with my current knowledge I've wasted so much material just by burning it and and just burning it alone waste the [ __ ] material because of the fact that you can temp step by by going at a low temperature from let's say 450 to get your Cleary 15 that's what I meant 350 right then going to 400 right and then you just so happen that if you really want to you can save your avv and then make edibles so like you're really extracting everything that you possibly can out of this [ __ ] miracle plant from these vaporizers and for instance I mean I got you got the butane vapes like the vortex or the butane vape like the sticky brick we can't really control temperature but with with this planet of apes one for example you can they have these things out there where you can really customize or hi and extract all all of everything this planet has to offer I just want to say that that scream you hear right about now is pakalolo don't worry man I got you I got you my man pakalolo is moderator at [ __ ] combustion and he's been preaching this forever about these these temp charts they're getting better on the web like I said but but they've had some that are out there forever and it drives them nuts because people come on and think ok then at 370 we're boiling this off in this other [ __ ] ain't and you know we're dealing with an organic structure that is is interwoven as depths and and as we vaporize we start on the surface or the outside and then work our way in and and if you're gonna convection vape and you stir it then you more exposure and different things and so it's not as cut and dry as I set it at this temp and I only got these compounds but anecdotally you can kind of draw the line in there and it works I mean for me that line is three nine D to 400 if I you know below that I get one thing and above that I get another and and and and it is a sativa indica kind of effect but yeah it's not as simple as just pushing a number in and getting it but but those effects are there man that's so true I don't want that a lot my first because I was using it you know medicinally trying to vape during the day and and solve my my focus issues try was trying to trying to replace adderall with cannabis which at first I thought was impossible but vaporizers and sativa made it possible and then as my tolerance built up I realized it's not just the sativa it's it's just just the cannabis that's amazing yeah we've really got a lot out of the temperature thing these days and actually one more thing I want to say about temperature stuff I was about a year and a half ago I was at a show talking to the guys from ghosts and they were doing some research I run into some where basically they were saying that the terpenes the in in in in in our plants start to get destroyed at about 350 degrees Fahrenheit that's when they start to get destroyed though that's why the the first temple net vape started out at 3 30-somethings 338 or something like that because they want to make sure that if you really wanted to get everything and that you could with all the Terps let's let's have a temp that won't destroy anything hit that first and he can move on up the the chain there and so that's kind of I was fascinated by that and I started trying to figure how I can incorporate that in my vaping controlled and I started out with a herbalizer blowing up a bag it I'd started at about 335 and hit the fan and let it blow up a bag and then I just hit the UP button and it hold it in and just kind of scale it cuz I think it goes so fast and over the course of about 45 seconds I could scale it at the top get one bag that kind of had the full spectrum and man I'm telling you they were taste and thick and I'm an amazing like it really was just a fuller bodied experience and so that's why wouldn't that volcano came out and I saw that program was like dude they made some little that'll automate this [ __ ] and it's really cool I recommend anybody who wants to [ __ ] around with full-spectrum vaping especially if you're doing the bags or something start below 350 and and catch everything you can I I think I I think I noticed a little stronger sessions yeah definitely if you if you stay at 334 or in that window for a while you get you get all the mayor seemed I think it is I think it boils up for like 334 it's supposed to be the most euphoric and psychoactive one and if you stay at that temperature you you keep it without destroying it and you can also isolate it but I wanted to go back to what you were talking about with the ghost and what they were talking about with with SERP II and destruction there's a lot of data out there and I want to point out that looking at data points and applying them out of context or in a different context and other than what they're recorded in is is is dangerous you know there there's some some bad decisions that get made looking at weird little data points and I've heard I've heard from vape engineers and vape CEOs you know tales of I go if a vaporizer is blowing vapor out your lungs and it's being wasted that came from it from a data set somewhere to you know somewhere he they looked at data and said oh this is this is indeed THC and cannabinoids therefore you know it's a wasteful wasteful thing to exhale vapor I just wanted to I just want to point out that data can be until many stories I took a bag once because I was like I'm gonna find a [ __ ] out I took a bag and I had an empty one next to me and I inhaled from this one and exhaled into that one and I just did it until the freshman was done I was like whoa and then I took that second bag and it was like moist or humid you know and it in and and and it didn't really do anything for my hi I was like I don't ever want that [ __ ] again I remember shotgun hits I wonder that if that really works I don't know like it at all I'll keep my vapor fresh thank you very much go through all these [ __ ] trouble [ __ ] rebreather vapor so I remember in one of our previous discussions you guys were talking about a nose test some tests that we can use to to identify whether it's a sativa or indica heavy strain can you yeah that shit's dope man this this guy max Montrose out that the trichome Institute is uh he's the guy I was kind of referring to early in the show man this kids on to something he's trying to redefine how we how we how we how we describe cannabis and from from sativa indica to a broadleaf and a narrow leaf marijuana whether or not you get into that and all those other stuff I don't know that's against linguistics but this nose test thing is Isla [ __ ] JIT and I'll put a dollar in the jar it's the [ __ ] did and I think the kid needs to get credit for it Troy and I lucked out and got to take his class out there in LA I think last year and man it was a lot of fun I learned a lot of good stuff man it was really cool interpreting class is what it was interpreting 101 by the trichome Institute that was a incredably insightful and educational day man not only do we get to hang out but there are so much amazing weed content and the biggest take home for me I mean aside from the indica sativa like oh whoa okay this is really how it works is this nose the nose test is what max calls it and here you can see like when you when you sniff you sniff your jar of fresh nugs you can you can kind of get a feel of where the where the cents hit your nose I should switch back to myself because I'm using my [ __ ] hands and stuff so when you when you smell your your nugs you kind of base the where the smells hit your nose like the impact of the aroma so here I'm sniffing this Sour Diesel lemon cush and it's the sativa which you should be feeling up here but in reality it's kind of hitting my nose in the middle so in the term of this the spectrum it's more of a hybrid than it is a sativa even though I use it as a sativa and it gives me more of a sativa effect on the flipside this this purple punch what when I inhale this for one it's like straight-up purple I can feel it like right here like the sides of my nostrils and the flare like in the Bell like I can that's where I can smell and feel it it's it's it's down it's down here and that is more on the the true indica of the feeling so an indica dominant hybrid you'll feel it here and here but if it's like a super strong sativa you'll get it up in here but even even with the solicit Eva's that I've found I still get some in the middle and in the lower part have you have you had a lot of experience with sniffing your weed Jerry yeah man since that class I've been playing there's a lot of fun man and it it works man I mean I can every time I'd go to my buddies and he pull out this big bag I go let me see and just and all you have to do is pay attention to where you feel it not what you smell not how it smells just where do you smell where do you feel the sensation of the smell which which never occurred to me before never I was like what the hell is this kid talking about and wow yeah it really is and when you feel it down here because it's it's it's it's lower I think of it being more grounded more of an indica as opposed to higher more in the head like a sativa and you just kind of go wherever you feel it on that scale and and you in and if you do it a few times and you really notice it you'll get to the point where then then you just don't even think about it you can smell it and know what's coming it's really cool yeah that was cool as [ __ ] how you just describe that like when lower lower in the ground and higher into your head like that's that's a great [ __ ] description and I just pulled out I just pulled out my CBD lifter which is supposed to be a sativa and I feel it I feel it like like here and even with the CBD fantastic yeah and that's that's cool [ __ ] yeah it was real cool when they first did that class and he taught us that technique he unfortunately he didn't have anything to demonstrate with and I had was funny I had ordered weed and I had weed on the way but it didn't get there in time when I when I got home that I was so excited to try it almost all of them kind of had the same impact in my nose and I was disappointed I was like is this really a thing because I bought I bought some sativas and I'm awesome indicas and they all kind of had the the same very similar then but then I found a few like the the XJ 13 and this green crack that hit real high open here and then I found some purple punch and this blueberry muffin xeno type thing that has a real low and yeah man sure as [ __ ] and then when you vape those that consistent temperatures you you do get more of those highs do you remember what he said about how to sniff it he had a little he had a method for himself that worked where he would like kind of go and they need and then he come in and do a short and then I forget what but then he'd go three pulses and I think the last one was uh he was like going out of like four or five different ways to smell it and I mean I can imagine if you don't know what's going on watching somebody do he's like what the [ __ ] this kid making fun of wine people in that moment but I could be wrong I don't know there's somewhere I don't know where they are I was like look at a good Tuesday but really what I do is I don't have that method down but I just I really just I breathe yeah exactly I just keep going at it in different ways until I feel feel it in the right place I do it similar to how you know inhaling or you're snowing coffee or something else though it's you a sniff test on you know that's that's super cool especially when when getting material that does not have a label on it old and those illegal states man gold I mean you got here you have that knowledge you can go into your guy's place and know what's up you can pick stuff feel totally I wish I knew about the sniff test when California dispensaries were still cool where you could go in and they had the big jars and you could actually like put your face in the jar and pick nose with chopsticks and wait a mile you can't do that oh I think there are still dispensaries like that but they're not all like that anymore like all the recreational stuff is like prepackaged and childproof and yeah you don't get the sniff your nose if you're buying you're good to say this year or I am is comes in a sealed package see it the old medicinal ways were pretty [ __ ] awesome this is dope so let me ask you this question I've always tried to figure out how can I remember these different breeds of cannabis both Innoko and sativa and somebody told me one thing that registered was with when you when you think of indica think of in a couch yeah and then obviously sativa is just opposite of that so you're not gonna be in the couch you know that's kind of a cool little term I heard back in the day hell yeah man tell you that that's that's one thing that I've always I've always remembered I've always used that as well in the couch yeah right sorry we're not using the leaf terms yet man I want to help the kid out but nobody understands me when I talk his language is I know man and for a while I tried to like I tried to pin it like every time I would say it's a TV I would be like oh this is a narrow leaf marijuana it's a sativa and then every time I would talk about indicate this is a broad leaf marijuana and then you got to deal with the haters in the comments right yeah are there haters that met that say some [ __ ] when you have every time dude there well it should be all love me and we're we're all goddamn smoke some weed and have a good [ __ ] day preach preach be like that why isn't it come on man can't we all just get along spread [ __ ] love vape owned with compassion I'm officially switching over to my purple punch with the g43 actually I had one little bowl of it earlier in the BAP cap and it did slow me down but I can still feel my my mental snappiness I want to go to a legal state real real bad just so I can be just so I can go and get some branded labeled [ __ ] and just try it well I get the effects that they say is on the [ __ ] lay people I don't know because I've not tried it I just want to try it and see how it goes yeah that sounds really fun man hopefully it's not depressing but at the end of the I'll still be a happy camper regardless of what effects like that it is cool just to buy legal weed just to walk into a store and buy buy a weed so liberating the first robbing probably more than the first six or ten times that was that was I was still giddy like the first time I bought it how I was giddy you know the first time I bought three ounces at a time I was like I don't think I don't think I've ever bought more than an ounce at a time I used to buy two or three ounces sometimes up to five ounces at a time and I would buy from this dude who he lived in Humboldt and whenever there grows would come down he would load them up in his car and he would have a big big bundle in his car and he would list this [ __ ] on weed maps like I would find it on the internet and text him and he would come up and he would show up in my garage and he would display all he would he would start pulling out these big outs bounce he's like oh I got you know bubblegum cush I got this and I got this and I got this and I got these you know and so I pull them out and smell them and one day I had a table in my garage and he probably had 20 different ounces and I was like pop them out and smelling them you got a UPS delivery the UPS guy like oh I got a bag oh cool when I was excited for my package that's hilarious so it was so surreal what's real boy dave has moved away he's gone man so I'm now a dispensary boy I've been going to couple them around here and it's it's it's been fun getting the sativas man I'm starting to get some things I like I uh I've been going to true leave and I like this um this member berri they've got is a great hybrid these guys here sunshine cannabis did a pot called Gainesville green which I'm partial to haven't been a gator myself and man that was a great sativa to walk around with man that was one of the I gotta get another one of those that was good I think those are some kind of strains that I'm digging these days that's cool member berries member Berry is good I always like to have both like I always like to keep some sativas and some indicas and I and I do well not right now my tolerance is so high that I deserve a bit high temperatures and then just go for more of a quick thing where the temp stepping and going for efficiency right you're kind of getting right to it aren't you yeah I'm gonna hit this g43 yeah these all of my indicas right now are extracts actually and the same thing I went to truly even got one of each and now there was a shatter and a crumble and uh the rosin and I got them all in because so my sativas are flour my my indicas are extra nice big Oh hideous Oh God in the g43 I'll tell you one thing man I haven't figured out edibles yet on this stuff III took I made some some butter the other day with it with a pretty good hybrid man I ate a big lump of it man I made like a butter sandwich man I was knocked out dude like two hours later I was on the couch like I'm moving I'm going anywhere I've passed out for a while woke up still grogs it was crazy it's crazy grogg so I don't know if you can get the same effects with edibles or not but I haven't haven't any luck with it have you Troy as far as getting sativa indica and edibles I'm really good you brought that up and it's not on not on our list of topics to talk about but I was actually just thinking that while I was inhaling this because I've actually read some some [ __ ] I think strain central is one of those guys who says like all edibles are just edibles like there is no sativa or indica edibles I don't know if I fully believe that I understand that there's going to be some loss of those crucial terpenes but I don't think it's it's again I think it's one of those things where there's there's some data that shows and then people go oh yeah blanket apply this data to everything and data is is contextual so III think there are still indica versus sativa effects in edibles I think in your experience I won't honor what you've experienced well I've had very mixed results and I and they haven't been promising but there are there are some this brand of gummies that I buy where there are indica gummies and there are hybrid gummies and nurses he become easy I can eat a bunch of the sativa or the hybrid gummies and be [ __ ] awesome like I can be high and I can be awesome all day and I when I was in Illinois I think I went through five five hundred milligrams or so the indica gummies from that same brand will put my [ __ ] to sleep well so not crazy coughs elected to sleep well they they make me so comfortable that I just like oh my god I was gonna die was gonna do this thing but the couch is so [ __ ] comfortable I'm just gonna you know yeah but me it could be placebo it could it could be in my head I don't know I don't know yeah this is interesting I'm not I didn't even think of that just because I can't I don't it edibles ever I mean I think it's actually goddamnit I mean there's they're chemically different you know what I mean so in terms of but in terms of making your own edibles that's something that I should experiment with that I've been doing my own edibles with concentrates who's making my own edibles with with like a grandma shatter our grandma oil sauce whatever and just quickly decarboxylated and making it in viewing it with butter but that's something that I can test I think I can get some sativa super-strong sativa concentrates that will challenge you should you should you should test it and then we should talk about it in a faded episode or something and see and see what the results are because I'm curious to know if that is a that's something that we can shed some light on I've not really mess with to me edibles myself to be honest with you we can she make it modern cannabis episode about it Jerry you're in a legal state and you can have that holes right you know I can I can buy some not as good a selection as you a lot of tinctures but I can I can make anything you know I can go buy a sativa and you can make it out of it or something wonderful I think we should do an edible episode where we take a bunch of edibles and and try to and try to get through an episode yeah well we need a we need I need to goddammit I want to I want to join this oh we're doing this fun well I guess I guess we'll try to figure out something for that episode but thank you guys for listening and and consuming this content wherever wherever you

into a movement where we can share what it is that we all enjoy which is a modern way to consume cannabis even if you smoke we got to get you it we got it we got to get you to try to try a vape but you can still smoke it you can still smoke it that that's a good topic for us to talk about next episodes yeah well I mean the purists versus V beam as an accessory and smoking as well you know man plant lovers yeah man all plant lovers man all plant lovers are welcome any who find us there subscribe share this with people that you think want to hear it we have some really cool episodes our most recent one is obviously this one if you're listening but the one before this one is a CBD episodes and I think I want to try and share that and spread that to as many people as possible because there's some really [ __ ] phenomenal content in that CBD episode because you don't have to get high to experience the medical benefits of of this plant so share that with some peeps let us know what you think about this [ __ ] we're about to give faded that is another episode where we go live and we just get faded wee sesh with you guys we talked with you guys and you can we can answer any questions that you guys may have there you're gonna want to see that man because I got a big old beast over here heated up he ain't seen yet that's what she said", "PYGYZFQHHPE": "Okay, so you've heard the term: cannabis\nterpenes, food grade terpenes, and \"fake\" terpenes. These terms have been widely\nmisused all over the cannabis industry. My name is Drew, owner of MrExtractor.com, and I own one of the largest terpene companies in the country, and I\nam here to set the record straight on what \"fake\" terpenes, food grade terpenes,\nand cannabis terpenes really are, and what they really aren't, in this week's\nepisode of; \"Fake\" Terpenes v.s. Cannabis Terpenes, on The Terpene Institute. Alright now as I've said, these terms\nhave been widely misused all over the cannabis industry. So let's go ahead and\nstart with what people think they mean, okay? And the way that they're being used\non social media. Now, cannabis terpenes are terpenes that have been extracted\nfrom the cannabis plant. Usually they're not individualized. They are a cannabis\nterpene profile, which is basically a bunch of terpenes mixed together that\nsmells like cannabis. Now the industry uses the term; \"Food grade terpenes\", in\norder to describe anything that is a terpene that is extracted from a plant. Make sense? Now, \"fake\" terpenes, we don't even know what that means. That's a\nballpark term that is applied to anything that is not a terpene that is\nextracted from the cannabis plant. Now I'm gonna go ahead and break down\nwhy this doesn't make any sense. Now, first off, food grade terpenes, again like I\nsaid, are used to describe any terpenes that are extracted from plants. But guess\nwhat? Cannabis, it's a plant. That means that inherently, terpenes extracted from\nthe cannabis plant are also food grade terpenes. So basically, you've got two\nsets over here that are both food grade terpenes. Now, \"fake\" terpenes over here,\npeople use those to describe synthetic terpenes, and terpenes that are extracted from other plants that are not cannabis. Which means that, over here you got \"fake\" terpenes. So you've got; terpenes that are extracted from plants, rolled over into the cannabis plant.\nYou've got terpenes extracted from plants, rolled over into \"fake\" terpenes, none\nof it makes any sense. People call it \"food grade\", you're not even supposed to\neat this stuff, all right? So, where does it go from here? What we need to do is understand what the differences actually are, and what\npeople are trying to express when they say the wrong thing. All right, so let's\nstart over here with what \"fake\" terpenes should be. Now in this group you have\nOrganic terpenes, any terpene that is extracted from a plant is the same\nchemical terpene. It is the same thing, whether it comes from cannabis or\nwhether it comes from a pine needle. What you have over here;\nsynthetic terpenes. Now synthetic terpenes are when a chemist, or a\nchemical company, takes a bunch of base chemicals, mix them together, and forms\none terpene, let's say alpha-Pinene. Now that same chemical company would\nmix a bunch of different chemicals together and form a different terpene\nlike, pinene- beta-Pinene, let's say beta-Pinene, or Humulene, or Limonene. Then\nanother company would mix those together and create a profile from them, like a\ncannabis profile. The problem is is that these are synthetic terpenes. They are\nman-made terpenes. They do not come from any plants. That is what we should be\ncalling \"fake\" terpenes. If you're gonna call anything a \"fake\" terpene; a synthetic\nman-made terpene would be \"fake\". Now, on this side you have organic terpenes.\nOrganic terpenes are anything that is extracted from nature. Now, let's say\nLimonene. Limonene extracted from a lemon, or Limonene extracted from cannabis, it's\nstill Limonene. It's the exact same Limonene. It does differ from synthetic Limonene\nover here. But, whether it comes from cannabis, or pine needle, or a lemon, or a\nblade of grass, or whoever it comes from, that is the same alpha-Pinene in\neither one of these substances, okay? So, how do you understand the difference\nbetween cannabis extracted terpenes and food grade terpenes, terpenes that are\nextract from other plants. Well you need to have a difference in terminology. What\npeople really want to say; is are these cannabis extracted terpenes or are they\nnon-cannabis extracted terpenes. The whole food grade terpenes thing, I don't\neven know where they came up with. That should just be x-nay from our vocabulary.\nIt's not safe to use and it's not correct in describing the product. So,\nfrom now on, I propose that we call everything terpene related that\nis extracted from cannabis; a cannabis extracted terpene. And everything that is\nextracted from plant; non-cannabis extracted. Now, we can get into this a\nlittle bit deeper about food grade terpenes. That is not a safe use of that\nword. Make sure to watch my video on food grade terpenes. Food grade implies\nthat it is food, it is edible. Now, I don't recommend eating terpenes and I\ndefinitely recommend you watch that video, but uh, that's a whole other story. So, understand the difference, \"fake\" terpenes should apply to synthetic\nterpenes. Food grade terpenes shouldn't exist. We need to call cannabis extracted terpenes, over here; non-cannabis extracted terpenes. And MrExtractor.com;\nI create terpene profiles, I combine organic terpenes, extracted from\ninexpensive plants that keeps the price down, and combine them into a cannabis\nprofile, that is organic in nature with the exact same terpenes that come from\nthe cannabis plant. The only difference is mine start out at five bucks a gram,\nthese start out at two hundred dollars a gram. These are obviously better in taste,\nbut ours are really actually pretty good in taste. So, if you want to try them out;\nhead over to MrExtractor.com, hit me up, I'll probably send you out some\nsamples. I hope this answers some of the questions. The Terpene Institute that I\nam creating here is just a common-sense approach to basics in terpenes. If you\nneed a college education, go to college, but if you want to just make money and\nmake some good products; you found the right place. Make sure to scroll through some of the other videos on The Terpene Institute.\nLearn as much as you can about terpenes, learn how to buy them right, how to buy them at the store, how to smell them, how to create your own pens, and do everything\nyou need to do.

I was like no III try different weeds all the time and like I think I was going through a phase where I was like you know I'm not sure without I'm not sure about that one and the wedding cake hit that week it was like holy [ __ ] oh here we go another really good one is dosey doe you ever heard of that one no that's actually like I've heard a lot of the names I haven't come across that one yet no I got I get it off he sends me a callus like I'm like because I'm like is like top customer so he sends me a list things like which one should I get this weekend like he'll give me like the list of like what different ones right and I gotta be like oh I haven't tried this one yet or if there's one that I liked from before our big yeah that was good that one again yeah yeah like out of lo another like like I said my one favorite is dosey doe yeah it's like a stray quad I'm not even sure of the growers but it might be the Cee like the cannabis extract guys yeah those guys I got one thing I don't like is like when I did like the like the og and then they add a name to it and I guess I Oh G breath and you get it and it's like like I never like when I first like the same thing I'm saying my wedding cake when I first tried the truth of the true Oh G I was like holy [ __ ] I what's going on here all right and then like like I try like oh like oh ho g breath and it was like okay this is all right like what it's like there's nothing I guess until there's a lit up site yeah I don't know like there's a lot of like peanut butter breath going around to like I've seen it from a few different people however I know my one whole night is he gets like the good quads but personally I'm not a fan of the peanut butter breath at all I don't really like to smell I love I love paint cush I love the dosey doe and and you feel like the probably the purples like the Purple's like usually like though never been a fan of the purple push like uh I find if I like smoke too much of am I am I'm hammer on

maybe like spread it out you know yeah I had a purple for a bit oh my god that's right hearing a boom yeah I'm like almost like that like want to do it my way is like I got in a jar and like sometimes I've got my next bag before I come before my jerison but like always leave the stuff in the bottom of the jar and I'll push it all in like topple a jar so then like at one point I started getting layers of like different big different kinds in the bottom of my jar was like you could tell from looking at the jar I was like okay there's that way and there's that we didn't like so when I could to see all the different shades lay and [ __ ] yeah when I probably like chisel that all up and like wait like put like cuz I just it all up and grinded it all together and I put it in a joint hold it like mixing weeds like it's like I think I'll give you a kind of like yeah we we could you a similar high but like what these bud each one mud is gonna have a different effect yeah you don't mean like you can be smoking some really good high-grade and you can get immune to it and then you can just get some [ __ ] cheap ass no door but it can [ __ ] rock you pressure like I've had it happen many times like I used to get the seed weed for my cousin like [ __ ] gotta be like over 18 years ago and like it was good it was full seeds but like it was [ __ ] so good yeah holy [ __ ] II think it was full of seeds that were kind of like using this kid you know I've actually had like a lot of those weeds are bad but I've actually had like a good weed like that before I've actually experienced that were like it was like okay there's a lot of seeds but like it was rare like I think I've only haven't happened like once or twice but did have a lot of seeds and it was so good I was like but it's happened yeah I had so I had some master oh maybe about five years ago and it was full of seeds but it was [ __ ] bomb like I still got a bunch of seeds but I'm like what do i do do I try to grow them because half of them are probably either gonna be hermaphrodite or just straight-up males yeah like there's gonna be like that very slim to none chance you might get that one female right right I am

for fun when in fact both are needed THC is also a valuable and effective medicine with the exception of Delta 9 THC vital cannabinoids have a very weak binding action at the cb1 and cb2 receptors so THC and CBD work best when they are together along with the many other compounds found in whole plant cannabis it's called the entourage effect another of the chemicals affecting the plant are terpenes terpenes are short chain isoprenes that are the building blocks of essential oil in the plants they're responsible for the fragrance in the strains dr. Ethan Russo believes that cannabinoid terpenoid interactions produce a synergy with respect to treatment of pain inflammation depression anxiety addiction epilepsy cancer fungal and bacterial infections in other words terpenes are very important to the medical effect of the plant here are some common cannabis terpenes pining Lin Ahlul Bayt Acharya filling and Mersin pining is actually the same terpene found in pine trees so if your patient is allergic to pine trees they may want to avoid cannabis that smells piney Lin Ahlul is also found in lavender so it's thought to have a sedate of effect but tests on aromatherapy don't show that this is always the case once again it's inconclusive results and it seems like the combination of terpenes has more of the medical effect than any individual one so should you recommend strains to patients probably not once again the strain names don't mean anything and just as with aromatherapy inconclusive results come from studies on terpenes so unless you know something specific about a cannabinoid about a particular strain lab test results are going to be more important than the strain names to the patient so here's an example of where you might want to recommend a particular strain the cannabinoid THC v has been shown with some promise as a vasodilator therefore we sometimes suggest that migraine patients who do well on vasodilators such as I'm attracts and ginko or feverfew try a strain known to contain THC v such as Durbin poison", "FEDCHb49ei4": "HAS.

and indica and a hybrid plant now if you're looking for a more basic education like sativa Activa or indica in couch check out my original video basic cannabis education so first let's talk about the three species of cannabis that we know cannabis sativa cannabis indica and Cannabis ruderalis so back in 1753 the cannabis plant was believed to only have one species and it was Swedish scientists Carl Linnaeus who discovered it and called it cannabis sativa but later in 1785 French scientists - jean-baptiste Lamarck discovered a second species and named it cannabis indica and then in 1924 a group of Russian botanists discovered a third species this hardy and fibrous plant containing little to no THC was named cannabis ruderalis also known today as hemp looking first at the cannabis indica plant cannabis indica plants are more suitable for colder climates with shorter seasons originating in India cannabis indica plants were found in Nepal Bangladesh Pakistan and Afghanistan a growing and flowering cycle takes three to five months and cannabis indica plants usually grow to be about six feet tall the smaller structure and shorter growing cycle of the cannabis indica plant makes it easy to grow indoors that brings us into the cannabis sativa plant cannabis sativa strains originated in Equatorial countries like Colombia Mexico Thailand and Southeast Asia a fully grown sativa plant can grow up to 20 feet tall outdoors and has a growing and flowering cycle of almost six months it's because of these factors that a lot of cannabis sativa plants are crossbred with their cannabis indica cousins reducing their height and growing time making them a lot easier to grow indoors but as many home growers know it's not just about the plant climate soil type fertilization methods and harvest times all affect the plants chemical composition so even if it has the same name as a string you've had or the cannabinoids the flavonoids the terpenes could all be different keeping a journal or a log of the different strains you've tried and any testing information you might have on them will allow you to start to tailor your medication around your specific needs and furthermore you'll have the data to replicate those feelings down the road now when it comes to cannabis ruderalis botanist tend to disagree whether or not it's its own species or just a subspecies native to areas in Asia Central and Eastern Europe and Russia cannabis ruderalis can grow in practically any environment and flowers automatically within one month of being planted now these flowers are not very big and produce little to no THC and a very small amount of CBD as well cannabis ruderalis also only grows to be about two and a half feet tall so to recap whether a strain is a sativa indica or hybrid does not determine whether it is energizing or sedating however this belief is so deeply rooted into mainstream cannabis that most patients make their selections based on this information centuries of crossbreeding these species and subspecies of cannabis means that most cannabis nowadays is a hybrid of some sort even if you could find a pure sativa or indica strain it's the chemical composition of the plant that will most dictate the kind of experience you'll have while the placebo effects can play a large part in the way that a particular strain makes you feel the main factors are the strains chemical profile your unique biology and tolerance your dose as well as the consumption method this is why it's so important to have access to the test results of the different strings you try knowing the percentages of the cannabinoids and the abundant terpenes will give you the best chance at predicting how a certain strain will make you feel Wow I hope that gives you some insight into the different species of cannabis out there and as always if you learned something today please like and share this video for everyone to see next week we're gonna talk all about terpenes what they are they're important and go over some of the most common ones found in the cannabis plant so make sure to hit that subscribe button and the little belt beside it to be

watching have a great day", "hP8fpE9fGBI": "[Music] so look what I've got here look at this beautiful tight butt of not gonna tell you what it is yet because today we're gonna talk about the top ten in because in Los Angeles and I couldn't hit ten and it's really hard to do that so today we're gonna have a top 15 and this one is the winner and we're gonna load a little bit into vapor Cup real quick I've already got some in there we're just gonna put one little bit more in there and we're gonna push it down and then we tamp and then in the end we're gonna stick this down into the vapor Cup and alls it does is release the water vapor from the plant and you're gonna see this experience will stone you to the bone with flavor and turps you can't imagine it's such a different experience I've been using flour for probably longer than most of you guys are even alive that are watching this video and I'm telling you I never used anything better than this device this is the most enjoyable way to use flowers you can even imagine so coming in at number 15 is a relatively new flower for me it got a lot of play on weed entertainment people like this flower it's by fire society it's called Muerta this flower has 25% THC and I liked it but a lot of people came and loved it so that's why it made the list it's not just about me people that make feedback everyone's feedback matters I share all these flowers with all my friends so I really get a very varied opinions and coming in at number 15 is marked up by fire society if you haven't tried this one you're having it or try this one you might like it but we're moving up to even stronger and better flower in my opinion coming in at number fourteen we have something called Tahoe og it's by 3c farms this flower has 22 percent THC and I got this an hhc down in Van Nuys and I would say this flower is one of the strongest flowers of all the flowers that I bought it it didn't make this list because it's strong this flower is strong and it's good this is a really if you see tahoe OG 3c farms and you're a heavy hitter this is your flower heavy hitters you gotta try really really good and it comes in at number 14 on my list of the best indicas in all of Los Angeles but we're moving up and coming in at number 13 we have a flower by big Allison gas house called northern brights and I reviewed this flower really early on and it didn't make any delicious and then someone actually went and watched the video and made a comment and I watched the review back and this flower got the nine and this flower has a great taste and it was a bright happy focus stone this is a good one if you see Big Al gas house northern brights definitely worth the trying and it was my 13th favorite indica that I've tried in Los Angeles but we're moving on up and coming in at number 12 we have something from the jungle boys called jungle cake and this flower is a heavy hitters 30 percent THC this is the best of the drama boys that I tried it's a super sweet taste it's strong if you like jungle boys you gotta try the jungle cake and it was my 12th favorite indica that I tried and I got this at TLC dispensary down in Boyle Heights I ran in there and I ran out of there and but we're moving on up to number 11 and in number 11 we have one of our favorites Billy Kimber oh gee and this is by garrison lane twenty-eight percent THC and this flower is a heavy hitter a lot of the heavy hitter comments of people that make comments they thought this one hit the spot so a lot of people when they can't find any flower they're like where's the Billy Kimber right and maybe that's true this flower 28 percent THC the slobber can test all the way to 30 it's not for lightweights this is a heavyweight flower if you're a heavyweight and you're looking for heavy flower Billy Kimbrough g'bye garrison Lane will hit the spot but we're moving on up to even better flower coming in at number 10 by Master P Master P o G and I got this at receded discount care givers this flower is one of those funny ones all the batches I've been using this for a lot of years it's not even flowered for me but the patches are definitely not consistent but if you go down there and you ask the bun tenders what they're using a lot of them will tell you master P ot some of the batches of the search through the roof this has 24 percent THC and if you're down and RDC that the best ones that I tried are the jack rare and this master P oh gee Master P oh geez definitely worth the try coming in number 10 of my favorite indicates master P oh gee but we're moving up the list and coming in at number 9 we have something from insane called insane oh gee and this flower I love oh geez and I love oh geez because og is just it's it's it's a description of the flavor profile and the OG tastes like ammonia they have a lot of variations could be sweet it can be sour but the really really true orgies are heavy ammonia taste it's very pungent and this is no exceptions to heavy pungent taste this flower is 31% and it was awesome this is a really good OG but one thing I'd like to say I've bought this a few times not all the bachelors are the same so it can be good to great I'm giving the flower number nine and maybe you would even be higher if the batches were more consistent but it's a hard game you know even I'm in the know and to get the batches consistent it's really hard to do it you really got to know how to rotate your product around really good and that's not easy and I know most of these growers don't know how to do that next up coming in at number 8 we have something from can'tit called blueberry crushing and this flower is moved down the list a little bit only because people are making comments that it's not as good as it used to be and this flower that I'm having that I'm showing you at 27% THC and it was incredible it had a great like light blueberry muffin taste but it was super strong and had a clear head this was a very good flower but I can see cuz I bought other batches that weren't as good as the same batch as this batch and you can tell the batches because they change the labels up the purple label this one hoo-hah was just awesome so I still recommend blueberry muffin ah this flower and the taste the feeling really good it was my eighth favorite flower here in LA for an indica can't eat blueberry Crofton but we're moving on up coming in at number seven by Team Elite genetics is cookie dough and this flower was another one that I reviewed very early on and when I went back and I looked through my flowers and I realized that I gave this flower the nine and I tried oh I'm missing the ship on this one this one's really really good and it is if you see cookie dough you will love this flower it will stone you to the bone it'll grin your face out it is fantastic 26 percent THC and I got this flower at the doctor green thumbs but I never see this brain that doctor green thumbs anymore the last time I bought it I got it at buds and roses so they carry team elite genetics if you like this brand buds and roses has it once in a while but we're gonna move up the list and coming in at number six we have something called Khalifa Kush and I'm telling you people don't talk about this flower but it's fantastic and it's from Fire Society this flower has 27 percent THC and I got it at dr. green thumbs and this flower was sweet really sweet I'm out of a per cup I am Telling You Khalifa Kush and vapor cup the like that's a wedding they love each other it's sweet it's smooth it's a great vape and it will stone you to the bone I love it and coming in at number six Khalifa Kush if you haven't tried it it's definitely worth the the try this is a really good flower but we're moving on up and coming in at number five we have something called Wawa co-op I top shelf cultivation and top shelf has really beautiful flowers I mean the look of the flowers the cure of them it's really good these guys are good cultivators really good job this flowers thirty-one percent THC and it's the strongest that I tried from top shelf yet it's got a suite tout sweet and sour taste and it's all that if you see whoa see Willa don't buy one eight by two it's a really good one that's what I did I bought two I didn't buy an ounce of this they don't even think they had downs for me they wouldn't let me buy it but I bought two and I have one away so when this one's gone I still have more I'm really excited about that whoa see whoa top shelf I got it too dr. green thumbs comes in at number five but we're moving on up I'm coming in number 4 we have marathon og Nipsey Hussle 's namesake and this is a really good flower and I think the name is appropriate his dream was it's a marathon it's not short term and this flower hits the nut this flower is long lasting and it's cruising and if you want a flower that can take you through the day marathon og is good but it's strong so don't think you're gonna get a lot of stuff done but it's great for daytime it's great for nighttime it's strong you feel like you're floating along what's wrong with that little magic carpet ride right Marathon on J rest in peace nipsey we love your flower but we're moving on up so we're gonna stick this straw into the paper cup and you can see it's gonna heat up just the flowers it's gonna release the water vapor next up we have number three and these are the really really good flowers Gary Payton og lurkin fierce on the packaging this flower has 23 percent THC and this was the best cookie strain I tried so far now I bought this in July of 2018 and I bought like maybe four ace of it and so I put one away so I would have it and I shared some with all my friends and everyone loved this flower but what I hear from the street is this flowers being grown other places other than Maywood and it's not the same I don't know that to be true and I don't want to spread any rumors that's just what people are posting on the web and I could see there's a difference there's a lot of people that said I got the July 2018 it was awesome now it's not the same I don't know that to be true but for me my badge is a Gary Payton get the third-best indica and I hope the cookies people see this because they should check into this if you want Gary Payton strain to stay top notch you need small grow you need a grower that only does Gary Payton there's a lot more tricks than that and I told you I'm willing to help Gary you got to have your flower it needs the love this is an awesome strain cookies did you're right this flower is a winner coming in at number three Gary Payton but we're moving on up and I would say something also these indica flowers I think if you look at the group this is the best grouping if you look at the sativas the hybrids in the end because this is really really great flower and coming in at number 2 we have grandiflora supercharger and this flowers a little bit different than all the other flowers every one of these flowers I pick for a reason this flower has supreme focus and it makes time go by fast and I would say you're actually a little bit smart with this flower and it really does supercharge you this is a really really good flower is it super heavy no but it's heavy enough the sides got 24 percent THC it's in the market right now I got it a dr. green thumbs and I was just I love this flower this is one of the flowers I bought it and the next day I went down at bought an ounce and I brought it to a bunch of my friends and they you know what they all said they all came back and said that's one of my favorite strains I've ever used so you want to try a granny flora you got a tri supercharger winner this flower is fantastic and it was number one last time I just moved to the numbered number two this time cuz I'm moving them around a little bit but this could be your number one it is fantastic supercharger grandiflora coming in number two burden to number one and I'm still going back to my old favorite I'm still hopeful it comes around again number one I'm giving it back to the organic Gardens IRG Mac one because this flower of all the flowers of everything it's number one on my favorite flower not just the indica it's the winner of everything of my favorite flower of all the flowers list and I'm telling you when I use this for the first time it grinned me out all of a sudden I had the perma-grin smile and I called a friend I said I found one I found one because it's really hard to find flower like this now I don't know if I owed you can do it on the next batches and I'm hoping they can you know it'll stay good for a while and then eventually a lot of flowers go south unless there's small boutique grows I'm telling you these industrial grows it's really hard to keep the quality really really hard but if you see iog Mac won this flowers got the game it is all that it will smile you out tastes good its euphoric winner and

purpose we do not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand video today yeah again we got actually a brand new brand that I've actually came across on ease before and I've actually you know I've wanted to review it for actually some time now again everybody this is an 18mm educational purpose podcast it's a review I don't condone the usage of these products nor I do not try to boost to sell these products and also we do not sell anything on this channel and again everything here is legal offer 18 and up at cannabis patients you guys are enormous good so today ladies and gentlemen we got a brand new brand to a review it's the old pal brand so I'm not promoting this product or anything like that this is just literally just a review I actually got this full gram $35 crazy huh we got some sativa check this out right here look there's actually some old pal this is actually from 510 which I believe is Oakland I think this is actually a local you know I think this company is actually in the bay keep that out and this is actually the cosmic sativa flavor it's a full sativa you know it has about eighty percent THC which is actually pretty [ __ ] good again everybody this is a $35 gram believe it or not I actually bought this and freaking off off ease and you guys already know man ease sometimes we kind of tax it check the [ __ ] out quick little test want to show you guys that this [ __ ] is look at that stuck for sure no hot water first hit now you lie you guys every time I take the first hit of this cartridge whoa I get laid man I feel this [ __ ] it's a sativa so usually before my morning my morning job you know I wake up take a couple puffs and I go go over to my morning driving [ __ ] you know and 9:00 I'll have one or two puffs literally just leaves me faint like I can already feel it right now I haven't even smoked today today I literally just skipped earlier today I don't really smoke just because I want to make sure I do these reviews with starting with sober but yeah look one thing I really do like about this product again I bought this off ease actually I got to 2 grams for the total price of $70 that includes taxes and delivery so I'm just like dude if this was a $35 full gram imagine if you actually go to like the legit old pal warehouse or whatever they're actually selling these and you buy you buy some stuff so I don't think I've ever seen these you know in the club but sometimes I'm like hmm that's very interesting it's a classic shareable cannabis oil cartridge this is shareable and it definitely is shareable because for the price and again a lot of people are gonna say oh it's fake it's just not no this is not fake this is I legit got this from the east service and they're for sure they're approved they're completely legal and it's not no neighborhood plug this ain't no neighborhood plug [ __ ] so it's crazy if a neighborhood plug [ __ ] is trying to sell you a [ __ ] for gram for like dirty dirty like $30 do that shit's fake as [ __ ] I smoked them before we actually reviewed up a car to do the super Lemon Haze one of my boys got with cool little fake cartridge or whatever and you got it for like pretty expensive but usually if you guys get this from like a a delivery service but it has to be legit though cuz I feel like some there are a couple like delivery services that are just not legit thought a homemade [ __ ] that could might not be healthy for you but please look I don't know if this is true or not I've heard this from a friend that's like a late punch tastes really good too um but I've heard that smoking like I guess fake cartridges or I don't even know if I even talked about but I'm pretty sure it's fake cartridges I guess there was like a youtuber like a weed youtuber some guy that made videos dude I'm pretty sure I don't know where the hell here is this drummer I don't know where it came from or I just don't I don't know but I believe in the obviously you know because it could have been fake cards but I guess like someone passed away from like smoking cartridges and I'm like dude I'm pretty sure it's not gonna be no [ __ ] cannabis you know like legal cartridges had to be some like fake [ __ ] you know I do know someone that bought like four cartridges for like the [ __ ] low and then with fake as [ __ ] dude like there was straight-up hot dog water personally me I know a lot of people that actually do like the old pal they like it because one so I don't think [ __ ] you know proof let's prove it right here look at that that should go it even has a little little sticker we are in California completely illegal dude and this [ __ ] gets you [ __ ] blasted i've only took like what like three four ribs and i'm ready list [ __ ] man but i really do i honestly everybody I appreciate everybody that our clinic everyone that's clicking on these videos man I appreciate you guys so much man because if you guys don't know I do have a main channel and I used to blog and like do pranks and all that [ __ ] back days ago days ago I used to do I gave me videos but that channel is just so mixed up with so much [ __ ] content random content that I got to the point where like I took a break and it just like dinah fell off I'm gonna try to revive it I've been trying for a while now you know but I was like you know what I'm gonna move on to something a little bit more different something a little bit you know like an educational type video if that makes sense so yeah but if you guys want to go check that [ __ ] out go down on my description it's my main channel 120 k subs you know and I actually reached 120 case subs like back like three oh [ __ ] it's gonna be almost four years ago back in like 2016 could've been I got a million right now [ __ ] up but hey [ __ ] have this for a reason right [Music] [Music] like I do appreciate everybody that's clicking on this cuz I know YouTube doesn't like cannabis videos and educational kind of this videos and [ __ ] but I do see that there's a [ __ ] large community there's a lot of people a lot of of age people that want to just watch you know like smoking videos educational cannabis videos type [ __ ] you know and I'm just like doing YouTube should just have its own little like section for that [ __ ] bro you know it's like I don't even wanna tie these videos if you guys see ads okay I'm telling guys this right now if you guys see ads on these videos it's literally [ __ ] YouTube putting videos and [ __ ] cuz first of all I'm not even [ __ ] partnered to me by the time you guys are watching this I don't think I'm ever gonna get this channel partnered honestly I'm definitely gonna be giving away a lot to like I can't really do like [ __ ] weed giveaway since I can't be like pack you know a shitty [ __ ] you know it's a places where like it might not even be like 100 it's legal but it's like you can't like [ __ ] receive it through the mail type [ __ ] you know like on some Canada [ __ ] it's like that legal [ __ ] hear in Caly it's not legal legal like it's get to the point where you just do it you could [ __ ] just smoke a blunt and a smoking area in some places you know people got bitched cuz let me smoke your cigarettes a bunch of tobacco products that [ __ ] [ __ ] kills you dude straight up it literally has a fat ID label that says this shit's gonna give you cancer and it [ __ ] stinks cuz you're [ __ ] smoking like cardboard a [ __ ] you know no offense to everybody that smokes cigarettes if you guys do your thing do what you got to do but I'm telling you right now that is a bad hat bad [ __ ] habit you know and if you guys switch over to vaping and all that vaping [ __ ] quit that [ __ ] brush it's also bad for you too bro and this cartridge probably bad for this too so I do not recommend any type of smoking but again this is for an educational purpose you know my personal review on this [ __ ] but a real [ __ ] though everybody that's watching this man you guys are first James 2nd Janet no matter man everybody like check this out we all got to go to a [ __ ] struggle like it doesn't matter if it's like the struggle is red if the struggle is blue of distress I don't even know I'm saying if the struggle is a triangle a square [ __ ] lid that made no sense that's the path you know that's for your life and [ __ ] but see if you're trying to grind you guys trying to come up be successful in all that [ __ ] I was gonna be a shitload of obstacles so when something's happening in your life that's part of it you know that's an obstacle you gotta face this [ __ ] to get to where you want to be in [ __ ] but damn it have like these crazy eyes like [ __ ] ideas and everything that I want to say on camera every time I say it I'm just look by the way follow me on Instagram I'm crunchy or go down in my description and go I don't check out all my social media I got Twitter snapchat all that stuff I'm gonna try to convince you guys to just chase your [ __ ] dreams take a jade tastes like it takes your passions like it chase your passion you know because in reality if you guys have a talent either if it's [ __ ] drawing you know [ __ ] writing us you're good at writing stories you're gonna like painting you could you're good at something Here I am not knowing how to [ __ ] explain myself but it's like if you guys have a passion or a talent or a hobby you guys are really [ __ ] good I meant pursue that [ __ ] right because I'm telling you guys right now bro you nowadays bro it's the new this is wearing mm about it be 2020 anything is [ __ ] possible that you could monetize absolutely everything bro [ __ ] what's that kid's name [ __ ] Ryan something to bear such the little kid that reviews [ __ ] toys for YouTube dude if he could do that and earn like [ __ ] close to 100 mice where he got like over 50 million dollars a year bro and income or more maybe like 40 to 50 million after taxes because if you got close to a hundred thousand then probably take like half that [ __ ] or even more um holy [ __ ] dude just from revealing choices so if this kid could review toys and become makers it's [ __ ] more more time like millions of dollars then you guys could [ __ ] monetize everything bro it's like you too bro YouTube is like the perfect way to just show off your personality show off you know your talents and [ __ ] there's a lot of people that could take pictures of cars they go they like you know fix cars or all that shade there's car channels shoes - actually I know David got kicks on in person and he has like he's like a sneaker head you know he [ __ ] he reviews sneakers he paints sneakers he customizes sneakers and [ __ ] like that and he's pretty funny he's a funny guy this dude [ __ ] made YouTube videos and then he [ __ ] all of a sudden from just showing off shoes at him making shoes and all this [ __ ] like customizing shoes and [ __ ] painting them all that [ __ ] he got into an eBay commercial true started by the way and I mean that [ __ ] just sounds like what the [ __ ] oven broke YouTube is like a [ __ ] stepping-stone to like this [ __ ] bro crazy like I'm trying to do that bro cuz I know everybody does not want to live that nine-to-five like [ __ ] that [ __ ] you know but if you guys do I'd beid obviously if you guys make like a couple you know small like six figures and [ __ ] and you guys have like a good job with like the benefits and all of the [ __ ] then I understand you know 9 to 5 is for you but exist you know you worked hard you got to where you wanted to be and [ __ ] and that's what's up you know respect honestly but then there's other people like me bro just [ __ ] hate I just don't like that nine-to-five [ __ ] and it's not that I'm lazy you know it's just that I really don't like I just find it so trying to upgrade myself trying to upgrade this this this brand you feel me so [ __ ] y'all shut the crazy-ass video don't even know how blood coughing oh [ __ ] we're reviewing this [ __ ] [ __ ] takes you great to give you guys a good taste

another one and this one well it's different i'm honestly not sure if i have done a vape pen review on this channel um if i have i completely forgot but it was probably on this same exact strain because well this is one of my favorite strains but before we get all into all that guys this is a medical marijuana channel i'm a medical marijuana patient here in the state of florida and this channel is designed for those over the age of 18 if you're under the age of 18 grow the hell up each day shut up so here we go guys this video is probably going to be coming out after the how to clean your glass video so if you haven't seen that make sure y'all go up here somewhere go check that out but long story short guys if you've been paying attention on instagram at the real marijuana mic or you just been paying attention here you know that a couple of weeks ago i ran out of my allotment when i went and picked up that ounce of weed a couple weeks ago i had already used up my concentrate allotment that's why i actually got that ounce because i didn't have any concentrates so when i picked up that ounce i used up the rest of my flour allotment now people can ask me what the hell is allotment allotment is just the amount of marijuana i'm allowed to purchase for instance every month i'm allowed two and a half ounces and i'm also allowed 14 grams of concentrate i've already made a call to my doctor to get that from 14 to 21 so that's what's up it shouldn't be a problem anymore plus i got that nut smasher machine coming so i ain't got to worry about them i'm going to be pressing my own concentrate soon and i will be making plenty of videos with that machine guys so stay tuned for that i also have an email that should be coming here today um so be on the lookout for that as well but topic at hand here this fake pen so long story short i woke up today i'm like dude i need something because last night i scraped all my bowls i smoked all my resin i woke up dry today so i'm like do i need to figure something out here uh just because honestly guys i've been smoking for so long without a break that it it already in the few hours that i hadn't been smoking dude my anxiety and anger level just crazy so i love mia indica this is a hybrid but still either way so i woke up on like dude let me try to see if i can get a couple of carts you know so i put two court two two orders of the mimosa and so and i'm looking and then then somebody hit me up and i was like oh [ __ ] that's right this falls under inhalation so inhalation you know like smoking all that i already used up all that so i was like [ __ ] what am i gonna do i'm like screwed i'm just gonna show up and maybe they can help me out so i get there i'm like listen i have an order for two cards i don't even know if i can get them my allotments up she's like listen you have about point five four of you know allotment left i'm like oh i bet so i went to the back long story short guys i ended up being able to pick up just one of these cards okay now the vape pen that i'm using is an open vape oh oh pan vape the letter o the word pen and then vape oh pen vape all right this is my go-to vape honestly guys i i haven't really experimented too much with vapes i usually just find a product that works and kind of just stick with it to be honest um but i'm not sure if i did a review on this if there if i did just go look it up try to maybe type an open vape but i don't think i have if i haven't i will make sure to get a review up on this soon but uh i picked up five grams of mimosa which is honestly guys i have not tried every single card i've tried maybe a handful if that's mimosa is by far hands down my absolute favorite card in the world i don't i'm sorry but the flavor on this is just nothing but sweet sweet juicy oranges like the taste it melts me bro every time i taste this and i know that sounds really weird and [ __ ] but i'm just keeping it a buck i honestly guys could suck on this all day pause i'm not trying to be like your girlfriend but i usually put this this has three set up though i say that for the review so as far as the mimosa goes guys this was coming in at 86.7 something percent and i'll tell you what i like it i don't like okay about vapes and why you don't ever really see me vape okay and i'll just give it a book the thing the number one thing i don't like about this is this it's right there at all times okay so wake up out of bed gotta take my morning piss damn that piss has turned into a [ __ ] time for breakfast [Music] oh that was good need to smoke i just smoked after i ate but i need to smoke like that's the issue guys it's just all at all it's literally here at my hip at all times i'm at work i'm in the bathroom at work i'm talking to somebody at work like that's the only thing i don't like bro i'll fly through this thing okay like these are good like if you got a low tolerance and you just don't dab and [ __ ] portable dab right here but if you're like me you're diving every day you're smoking every day like you're going crazy ballistic i'll fly through this it won't last me long this is a half gram and this cost me 48 okay but i will say this i love these for the convenience and i more importantly dude i love these for the flavor okay if you smoke for flavor and you don't do vape pens bro you're missing out on a ton of terps okay i believe the terps on here are like four and a half percent okay so it's just flavor every hit now i don't really draw too long because as i said i'm out of my allotment so this and the uh syringe of true clear which i'll be doing a review on as well stay tuned for that um this has got to last me till the 23rd which it probably will obviously but i want to keep that mentality so i don't burn through it regardless keep that tolerance still kind of dropping a little bit you feel me all in all guys mimosa is the way to go if you're looking for just taste on a vape pen man that's the only one i go to bro i don't really trust nothing else you know i was gonna try some sunshine cannabis but the flavor on this bro i can't you know i can't give it up i'm hooked but i love y'all i appreciate y'all like i said if you haven't seen that glass cleaning video go check it out and i'll be putting out that banana kush true clear syringe video as well and i just appreciate all the support guys 600 followers on instagram organically is crazy in a three month period to me and uh almost 140 already on youtube real crazy so i just appreciate it man don't forget i got that nut smasher coming so you're going to be seeing plenty of nug smashing videos concentrate videos um i got that email coming so expect that to happen a lot of you know melt shot videos i'ma step it up and i love y'all so make sure y'all hit that bell tell me what you're smoking on where you got it from where you're coming in from i'll see you on the next one", "LuuKvfonSis": "Angell Tiger is a speaker and activist and an entrepreneur she works with the LA cannabis medical task force and runs her own cannabis edibles company known as Ruby doobie and we've got a lot of Ruby dooby goodies in front of us right now angel thanks for thanks for joining me thank you for inviting me Dave yeah I'm very excited to talk to you because I've wanted to do something a little more in-depth on pot for a long time and and you brought pot cookies brownies let's get into this stuff first okay and then we'll talk about the history at legalization what do we got in front of us these are some of the things that I make sweet dreams brownie it's a dusted with a little bit of sea salt on top it's about 57 milligrams here so 37 milligrams of THC what does that mean so you you ate that how do you feel after well I personally would not eat a whole brownie right I would have half and that's plenty for me but it really depends on your own metabolism and your your how experienced you are and it can differ on depending on the day and on how much you've eaten that day right and doshas dosage guidelines very you know I've seen recommended dosages between 5 and 15 milligrams for people or some who want between 20 and 30 and this is all sort of unchartered territory for a lot of people because for a long time you know I think I said once on the show when I got my weed card I went in there and I said you know they showed me wax they showed me oil they showed me edibles I said well do you have any just weed you know green buds like old fashioned weed and that made me feel like old I got a guy wants a smoked weed but this is sort of the new thing right well you I think not as many people are familiar with edibles but it's been around and it's a great way to make use of the whole plant because really what when you smoke you're smoking the flowers the buds mmm but you still have all of the leaves and the trim and the small buds and all of that has a you know active ingredients in it too and that's primarily what I used to make my goodies and here's a peanut butter brownie ginger cookie the crew is very excited by the way I'm happy ginger cookies credible cookies and chocolate chip cookies and I make cakes and other things too lemon bars yeah so you make all this stuff and this is for people that may want the medicinal benefits this is for people that may want the recreational benefits it doesn't matter to you right like you're selling it then and yeah it's nice of someone alleviates some pain but right well I work with the dispensaries I work with a handful of dispensaries in my area so I am a member that's that's providing edibles for my fellow members sure and you know you can't really you you can't in California you still have to get a doctor's recommendation to even go to those dispensaries right so my sacha hard it's not it isn't right and and it's tough to make the distinction between what's recreative to distinguish between recreational and medicinal because if it's if you're using it to relax at the end of the day and to de-stress hmm that's me that's it isn't it in some ways yeah all right so let's get a little bit into your story and then we'll talk about business and legalization and all that chef so you got into weed basically I think you were smoking it recreationally but the reason you really got into this was because you were having migraines and pretty much the Western medicine that you were trying just wasn't anything right yes but I think there were two forces that kind of both intersected and and drove me into cannabis definitely my migraines I I've had migraines for many many years and about ten years ago they started getting a lot worse and more frequent and I was trying all kinds of different medications I had a steroids injected into my neck to try to get rid of them I had some prescriptions that were so strong that they require that the triplicate prescription you know and nothing helped me I mean lots of times that the drugs would irritate my stomach so much that I would feel worse sometimes they would just knock me out and that's how I was survived my migraines no and cannabis is really what allowed me to to continue living and manage them without having to check out for weeks at a time or days at a time so that definitely treating my migraines was one forest and also a desire to simplify my life you know I am I was working at the XPrize Foundation I was a chief of staff there and you know very rewarding challenging position but I just felt that there was something missing you know I I wasn't spending very much time with my son who was two years old at the time I would have to travel a lot and I just wanted to create a change in my life where where I would not be so dependent on on a check grow growth my own food and cook my own meals and and rather than pay someone to do this and that I wanted to do those things I wanted to be the one with with my family right so that's really interesting so it wasn't just I want to get stoned and have a good time you got into the edible garden thing which it was nice you were growing weed but you were also growing stuff to actually eat and to lead to feed your child we were growing in at one point we were going enough food in our garden that it was too much for us to even eat I mean neighbors would come and we encouraged our neighbors to come and tomatoes artichokes peppers eggplants collard greens charred kale I mean we still have you know lemon trees apple trees nectarines oranges it's a beautiful thing to just go outside and pick your food and you know you don't have to get in your car yeah yes you can't get anything fresher than that yeah it's funny I have I mean I live in LA - and you know I have a little outdoor space with a little garden and even if I'm just plucking tomatoes or something I find that very therapeutic oh it is so just that action of doing of growing something for yourself whether it's marijuana or a tomato or a pepper or something even right there connecting with nature this is all intertwined with ultimately you going into this business I believe so I mean it's wanting to simplify wanting to be more in touch with nature you know it's so easy to get disconnected from food and to know what food looks like when it's actually growing I mean when I when we first planted our garden it was with the help of a nonprofit called la green grounds and we had 50 volunteers come out and help us plant our front yard and our parkways and I was intimidated because I had never tried to grow food before and I didn't know how it all worked and it's I'd never put my hands in the dirt and planted anything and to watch things grow and to be able to feed my family that way and and help you know feed the neighborhood it was an amazing experience and food food is medicine you know cannabis is medicine I mean I really don't see much of a difference right so you see this green thing that grows naturally from the earth like all this other stuff that we eat you see that just sort of as an extension of every other thing but the city wasn't that thrilled right with your your garden so here you are a person that sort of takes life into your own hands on your own property and the city of Los Angeles what did they do well okay going back a little while I what got me inspired to plant the garden as I watched a TED talk by Ron Finley I don't know if you've heard of him the gorillas garden against gangster garden oh okay yeah so um the whole idea of that he presented growing your own food is like printing your own money I mean there were some things that just resonated so deeply with me that immediately after I saw the talk I I got in touch with la green grounds and said I I need to learn how to do this how can I volunteer and it turns out they were actually looking for an LA resident to plant a garden and the timing was perfect so we planted we were selected and that's how we got our garden so yeah the city though didn't want you to do it it's something all right so Ron when he when he did his TED talk he had planted an edible garden a few years before mine and was sighted and went to City Council and made the case that you know it doesn't make sense you should allow people to grow food on their on their parkways and the City Council at that time agreed and said that they would work to change the laws in fast forward two years later I plant you know we plant our garden and I was operating under the assumption that it was all good right the the changes were in the works but a few months after this we were cited I mean a guy came to my house and kind of aggressively said you know all of this has to come out and you have 48 hours to put it all back to the way it was and so this had nothing to do with weed just to me know this is known squash yeah oh yes eggplants oh yeah things like that so that because we had the support of a lot of you know la green grounds and Ron and it was easy to to get attention drawn to the to the issue it had been going on for some time Lopez from the LA Times came out and and wrote an article about our garden and it it helped bring the City Council's attention back to this issue and not long after that they did change the laws so you anyone in LA can can grow fruits and vegetables on their on their Parkway before you had to there was only a short list of approved things you could grow right and if you wanted to deviate from that you had to I think filed a request and I think was like $400 to even ask just to ask to use your own property yeah your own yeah and then you know you might not get the approval yeah so now I think the way the law reads is you can grow whatever you want except for some some fruit trees are not allowed to be on the Parkway but it was it's a huge step right right now as long as you have a medical marijuana license you can also grow eat I'm guessing you can't do that in the front of your house though I don't think it was it would be such a good idea probably not a great idea all right well I don't want to get too into the weeds on that one antenna but I thought it was an interesting way to start because it shows how marijuana and legalization and medicinal uses and all that are so tied into our legal system and then we can get into some of that stuff so alright so you have the migraines you start saying all right I'm going to smoke weed to make myself feel better how long did it take to figure out what worked for you what actually was the right strain and can you talk about strains a little bit well you know I I know with some conditions people look for particular strains you know I think okay so there there yeah let's do let's do one away yeah when you talk about cannabis there there's cannabis indica and sativa right I sit there they look different physically like sativa plants are usually taller and leaner thinner branches and grow better in warmer climates kazar kind of shorter and bushier and hard ear besides that indicas are usually they help to relax you most people will use them at night too as a sleep aid or and sativas generally will give you more energy let you keep more focus so more people will use sativas during the day because you can still function all my comedian friends that get stoned on sativas and write all day yeah exactly right and then within okay so you have strains that are either indica or sativa or they can be a hybrid and then each particular strain has its own profile how much THC is in there how much CBD is in there yeah and so let's unpack that a little bit so THC is the psychoactive are correct and CBD is is it's the medicinal part is there to describe that THC also has medicinal properties but it is the psychoactive a element CBD is is cannabidiol it's another cannabinoid those aren't the only two I mean there there are others and but CBD does seem to have most of the medicinal value I mean it can it can it's been shown to stop some tumor growth it's you know it's great for pain relief its reduces inflammation you know it's I mean I have a friend that takes CBD well for anxiety right and she told me all she does literally is it she's a little dropper in the morning she drops like two drops of every time that's it it doesn't have the diarrhea and vomiting and thoughts of suicide and restless leg syndrome and all the other crazy things that come with all the commercials that you see on TV for all these other antidepressant it's it's there it's so gentle I mean it has so many benefits and has never killed anyone um mentioned that at the top I've never murdered in yeah yet to happen but it's it still boggles my mind that a plant first of all that has so many medicinal properties so and besides medicine I mean what about you know renewable energy and you know paper you know I mean it's it's strong it's a strong fiber I mean replace so many things the fact that we look at it is such an evil thing I don't understand yeah how can I can tell it it truly boggles the mind yes yeah yes all right so we have THC CBD and then you have the indica and sativa and the hybrids of that so for the medicinal stuff let's just do that first people if you didn't want to get stoned but you just wanted medicinal benefits that's where you would use just the CBD is that right um okay CBD yes you you want that but there's been a lot of research research that shows that CBD alone is not as effective as when you mix it with THC meaning that it's the whole plant that you want to treat you with not just taking a one piece of it um I think it it's referred to as the entourage effect because there's so many elements and they all kind of work together so people who are looking for CBD are usually looking for CBD rich strains or in some cases you know like the concentrates and things like that but I think for the most part you'll find that they're more effective when when there is a little THC in there yeah so when you found the right one for you well first up how long did it take for you to find weed that was like oh these migraines are dying you know I didn't even think about weed as a treatment for my migraines because when I get bad migraines I would get very nauseous dizzy a smoking pot was the last thing I thought would help me really but then I I did read that it helps and for me it's it it relaxes me enough that I mean it it helps the nausea and also it helps me control the anxiety that comes along with with the onset of a migraine I don't know if it's like two things attacking you at once if the migraine but then knowing it's coming now you're said oh my gosh about that yes and the need to try to hit both it treats both of those things yeah yeah yeah um all right so then you started doing that it was working when did you say all right I could make a business out of this or I got it I gotta tell people what's going on here well you know a friend of mine was baking and I was fascinated by it and so I would look up recipes and send them to me you should try this you should try that and he's finally he got to the point where he said you know what angel you should try it so I started experimenting and that's how I got introduced to making edibles and then I started trying them because well honestly I tried a few edibles and hated them I mean this is going back to like 2008 or something I mean before they had perfected right the brownies in the cook exactly I mean at that time you'd go to a dispensary and you'd see stuff that was just in like Ziploc bags and you know totally unappetizing to look at and oftentimes didn't taste very good and I mean I found myself in those early days just sort of like you know eating it real quick and just hoping for the best when now it's like literally it's like going into a great Baker oh you can get any anything pizzas sauces so chocolate bars can be any I can think of yeah you", "AWVTn9tPCmo": "how you doing guys here we are at loud house hemp and once again beautiful huntsville alabama uh if you ever had a chance if you ever had ever had a chance to come to huntsville come through give us a shout we'd definitely like to see you anyway guys what we're talking about today is another delta eight product another one of our now this particular one right here so you can see it let me let me take it out so you can really see the the cartridge now this is one of our newer it's all ceramic as you can see i'm trying to see here i'll ceramic one milk cart you see i've been i've been hitting on a little bit this is one of our newer delta egg carts that has cannabis derived terpenes this particular one today is gorilla glue and the terpenes are sourced from clear nation man let me tell you what clear nation has some of the cleanest just phenomenal tasting terps bar none uh now i'll tell you there are some other there are some other companies who do see co2 extracted terps which are terpenes like clear nation but clear nation is is definitely one of the standouts and uh i tell you what guys i appreciate everything you do with these terpenes again it's gorilla glue from clear nation shout out to clear nation we love you guys keep making great quality terps uh because this changes this when you when you're using botanical terpenes even though they can they can be good they never quite capture its namesake say if you get a blue dream and it's botanical but not actually pulled from blue dream there's a qual there's a quality difference no matter how good you do the job i haven't seen one yet that can that can uh match a co2 extracted terpene of the of the same namesake so like i'm saying you can have some botanical terps that are really good really tasty but they'll still be a little harsher there'll be there'll be something dimensionally flavored dimension just not there uh something about the actual cannabis itself or him or anything that's being taken from just makes it night and day so we're gonna hit this right here and this of course this is a gorilla glue terpenes inside our delta eight of all ceramic carp definitely definitely uh [Music] that's good turn the pad a little bit that is tasty guys i i just don't every time i hit this i just it just it i get new layers i just get new new new that little nuance of flavor that you just can't get from botanically extract extracted when it comes from the and and clear nation uses the top colas i think it's called colas tycos the very top of the of the uh where the but where the most concentrated amount of terpenes and everything else is in the actual cola uh the top of the the very top flower these terps i again once again claire nation thank you because this makes our carts even better let's do it again oh my goodness i think i'm gonna cry now literally this this is this is you know it was already good the our gorilla glue four that we have that's potato turps is already pretty good but this right here oh my god i mean well you can see i've been we've been working on i mean this is like a test for all of us here in the in the shop but guys i don't know what to tell you and i'm even going to tell you how much these things run for a one meal delta eight can a cdt which is a cannabis derived terps cartridge ship within the united states 19.98 now right now we've got three different uh canvas cannabis derived carts they're gorilla glue said orange kush orange kush and [Music] damn sunset sorbet something sorbet anyway there's three of them there i can't remember which one though we knew that i hadn't had a chance sunset so sunset something i believe anyway guys this is great uh i hope you get a chance to get some they it is all they all these are limited runs because cannabis derived terpenes are very expensive compared to botanical terpenes so you know we're not going to have a ton of them all the time we're going to alternate between you know five or six different terpene profiles maybe having two or three at a time oh man i got to stop because the delta 8 is kicking in and i don't need more delays my system for today anyway get on this our new 1mm ceramic cartridge canvas drive terpenes delta 8 a delta 8 cartridge with cannabis derived terpenes 1998 ships anywhere within the united states if you can't afford the the uh the cannabis dry terpenes we do have the botanical derived terpene uh cartridge as well and it's only 14.98 and that's shipped to yeah it's free shipping so 1498 for botanicals 1998 for cannabis derived terpenes so there's a difference and it's nine day and it is worth the extra money so uh you know if you're on a budget that delete cart with the uh botanical drive terpenes is gonna be great too just this is just a it's a next level type of jump you can't even make you can't even really i can't really express exactly how much of a jump it is from from a botanical to to the canvas drive terpenes but again i'm going on over seven minutes now i don't want to keep you guys know you have a uh it's hump day it's wednesday enjoy anyway it's great to be talking to you here at uh excuse me at loud house hemp and again we will be back hopefully maybe today at least by tomorrow we'll be back home and give you another review of something anyway have a great safe day talk to you then", "YCyGzJxl9ww": "what have y'all back again with another video all right so this one as yourself in the title I did it the right this time actually went to the store and I picked up a stoked battery see I didn't know it was called a battery I thought it was called a Carthage bake sale I'm learning I'm learning not it's alright alright this is so I can get people on YouTube noticed check out my channel everybody loves weed so why not and I'm gonna California's legal my big fan of it but like I said last time you know five beats breaks great great staff they was super cool in and out a few minutes everything was all good so I'm gonna get right into those one I got said this is the granddaddy purp actually got it this time so they say you have to click it five times to turn it on there we go you gotta see that again to to preheat it and it goes for 15 seconds and then you can start it's like seven o'clock in the morning and then once this dusk thinking you good to go so right this is my first time doing this y'all joining me on this mission here we go but a lot of smoke to it pretty easy hit though tastes like we know Oh while I'm waiting let's go again um I did the cookies and I flipped up the video I accidentally hit stop instead of pause but it was actually good like I was laughing my ass off and um maybe it was a hilarious time so I don't know how much is I'm supposed to do before he kicks in so I'm gonna do one more all no possible superheated every time even there's not much instructions and his these things I guess he think everybody's professional I don't think I supposed to preheat it every single time but hey I got on the lowest heat setting something that's good to go let's go I'll be more smoke no I don't know how much supposed to do don't know I'm like it takes kick in no I don't wanna do it too much cuz I want to be no it's not bad they don't taste that bad I don't smell it it's number one thing I hate about we did you just stop and I got a childhood weeded out the summer in my room so my reason I didn't like weed infested because of my childhood incidents when we for people with weed I should say so I've never really been a big fan of it but and perhaps the I prefer these over the actual light anyway because people who is bad when you walk around the store he's my lecture we is not very appealing you know to anybody at last eh oh but me personally it's just interesting so this is much about option 66 percent THC in this almost 67 phone right yeah maybe I should pause the for a second it good sound like kicking I guess maybe I'll take one more rook we I'm not gonna preheated this is definitely the one if you want to be Klaus this ain't one for you well maybe I should turn the heat up that's medium heat that's how he hello back to media oh I accidentally preheated I'm trying to go back to media meaning me know two three it's so easy cuz you doing it three clicks one two three and it just wants to preheat right so here we go I was a bit more smoke so maybe medium heat is better so I'm gonna take a chill pill on this one all right so it's been about five minutes and put a little bit up the onset going on here on my hands felt a little weird right now that's a little bit of a weird feeling right here and my feet total heavy so he's kicking in I guess is the cookie it took longer to hit but it was like - I think this is gonna be chill - but hope I do too much - that was suck but I'm gonna come back in yeah just a little bit before I forget don't forget to Like and subscribe on my channel is gonna be all butts different stuff it's more of an informational channel a little bit of comedy and in there I'm saying subscribe you never know what you're gonna get from me I'll be back in a second it's kicking down a little bit more my dog decided that he wants to be in the video we need that but it's been about eight minutes and I think it's our hit is pinky uh-huh maybe it's gonna be a delayed onset of something oh no maybe I need to take how did he I don't know so I'm just gonna chill for right now and uh I don't wonder how much he'll for a second see if it does anything more nuts I've got this all right so it's been about ten minutes now there's X am just a little bit a little it's a little Lucy none too bad the cookie definitely hit harder when he hit that much just undeniably I found a perfect balance to a cookie and a half as good for me right now I was like a really good one Oh laughing in my face I couldn't see my face it was a good time but yeah I think he's hit his peak I'm not gonna test anymore I might try again tomorrow just to see if I do it on the different heat will make a difference I want y'all to see the first time ever on camera y'all witnesses y'all join me on this little wee trip preach about oh yeah again you know five these brakes they legit with it the end of Central Coast hey yeah that's the end of this I hope y'all like the video sorry it's not as glamorous to somebody's other youtubers I'm just using my phone if you happened is your first time watching this I've been around too since about 2007 so I'll meet out criteria to be a real youtuber I'd need more subscribers so I'm doing stuff more stuff to tell us that I I guess to more people so I'm going this once I get more it could meant I can make things better this is my first time actually doing outside my car so you usually do my videos and I cook oh I got pretty much a desk lamp for lighting my line is probably like crazy for one local branch somebody Oh youtubers yeah anyway rambling check out in the next video", "DzVOnvVoz84": "[Music] what's good job welcome to another episode of taste today we are gonna do skittles as promised man if you don't know about those kiddos you really need to get up on a man let's get to this profile so skittles is a combination between grape ape and grapefruit and together they make a pretty potent indica dominant strain in it is bred by Terp hogs did we little something about third-gen family up in that mix but most websites do tell me that turf hogs is the original creator and breeder of this strain but when I was in the Bay Area a few weeks ago man stopped over at the Garden of Eden over in Hayward man and pick this up so up big that's from a man MC some of the medical uses are stress a depression a pain insomnia and fatigue and man let's just get into somebody sensitive all right so for the senses we always start with the smell man but this is gonna be a little bit of a challenge for me I have been under the weather for the last few days so my sense is my olfactory glands all the [ __ ] aren't working properly but I mean they don't call it skittles for nothing man essentially it is a very very robust berry fruit smell you open the Pajar it literally smells like a bag of skittles that you've opened up but it's weird because it has that sweet berry news so it smells like the skittles month it has like a little twist of little funk you know a little bit of punching it pungent in this a lot of berry and then a lot of pungent is what I get from what the websites tell me it's supposed to be sweet berry in some grape I can get the grape and the sweet clearly but I think that those berries just overpower or it could just be a combination of all of it kind of giving that you know like a bouquet smell this just smells pretty good alrights take a closer look I ready so let's get a closer look at these skills and you just bright green bright bright green not as many trichomes as you would like to have seen is what I always said pack the trichomes man well not this time I did read that it does test in on the lower end from THC but it does give you a really really heavy body because they attack a dominant and then on top of that a lot of it's gonna be in the terpenes man the terpenoids the flavor packs a punch you definitely get the grape and the berry flavor when you smoke it really excited to see how it tastes like through my vaporizer but probably not the best strain to be squishing just because I'm not sure if your return is gonna be a lot mine expert but that would just be my guest based on its notoriously low testing for THC again my experience is I get high I don't know doesn't matter for test at 15% doesn't matter if it test at 30% if it gets me high and it tastes good it's the job but yeah man take a look at it again bright green is what it's really known for and its flavor and it's smell profile yet not too much the THC haha now's the fun part man let's taste of this month alright so now that we've got a closer look at it and we smelled it there's only one thing left to do and that's taste it so yeah man let's break this bad boy yeah when you when you break it up I mean it's just stronger that berry smell is just even more in the forefront the sweetness the combination of the sweetness and the very smell and that grape smell really makes it smell like skittles again it's probably wise guys name [Music] Wow it's weird strong orange definitely the fruit flavor but the fruit pout like the fruit flavors range so I get that sweet Baroness but I got an orange also but totally why they call it skittles very delicious [Music] very tasty on the exhale you get a lemon the inhale I got an orange and then kind of as it sets on that palate on your taste buds then you can really get that great really get that berry that's sweetness I really like the taste strong strong fruit flavors into the name I mean let's get so if you watched it before you know how I do this it's my little 510 rule uh-huh chief for five minutes see how it affects my mind see how it affects my body chief again for another five minutes ten minute mark we see how it affects my mind see how it affects my body a lot of these hybrids definitely changed at some point throughout the process man so let's get to chief in and I highlight you a five-minute li alright y'all so the five-minute mark is not a bad assessment right here buzz buzz it's a very very potent out the gate indica my eyelids like feel beautiful right now I mean it's been five minutes bro and I just been hitting the [ __ ] and [ __ ] now my eyelids are happy so super strong indica right out the gate flavored that flavor profile was something else man if you like a very fruity sharp citrusy very kind of palate definitely for you but um you puff it away and I'm a highlight shot in another fact I'm and so at the ten minute mark a little bit more energy I feel like I see what they mean about how it helps with fatigue it really just read out the gate hit you hard with a heavy indica but then it kind of lightens up at the end on that back end it's not as heavy but that but I can see why they say it's not like a couch locker but definitely a strong indicator on the less man with a strong flavor profile so let's uh let's get into this overview myth I'm and so let's do a little bit of an overview so skittles a cross between Grape Ape and grape fruit bread biter pogs and I purchased it over at the Garden of Eden in Hayward California man it does have a medical use medical uses for stress and depression pain insomnia and fatigue it is an indica dominant strain with a sweet berry and grape kind of flavor palate to it I want to say that it has a little bit of a citrus in there not I mean more specifically when it comes to the fruit definitely I kind of felt like an orange on the inhale and you like a lemon lemon zest on the exhale so yeah some other notes are it did take first place at the 2016 Emerald cup and then first place indica in the 2015 cannabis cups in both San Francisco and Michigan man so skittles is no joke and ain't nothing to play it around with I actually got an in-house genetics cross of skittles by silky Johnson man so once I get a free plant count space I will be popping over over these of course I want to thank all my boys and my brothers who helped me out with my projects man

non-profit that helps medical cannabis patients with medicine costs medical cannabis is a safe effective medication that is never covered by insurance we believe that all patients who need medical cannabis should have affordable access to it today i'm talking about hybrid strains hybrid strains are loved for their combination of effects they bring out the best qualities of two strains vary the most in variety and effects and are widely available in hundreds of strains so let's talk about medical marijuana hybrid strains there are three main types of medical marijuana strains indica sativa and hybrid indica strains are known for their relaxing sedative effects and are usually associated with deep body relaxation and best for nighttime use sativa strains are known for their energizing effects associated with a cerebral mind high that provides focus and creativity and promotes sociability hybrid strains are created from cross-breeding indica and sativa strains meant to bring out the best qualities of each strain they provide more balanced effects in the areas of relaxation and energy hybrid strains are said to be the best of both worlds for this reason they are usually separated by indica dominant hybrids and sativa dominant hybrids but can also be 50 50 hybrids which would be the most balanced strains indica dominant hybrids are generally relaxing but not sedative and won't induce sleep sativa dominant hybrids are generally energizing with a relaxed calm tone 50 50 hybrids can provide very balanced effects between relaxing and uplifting if you find the sedation or intense relaxation of indica strains too intense or the energizing effects of pure sativa strains too intense hybrid strains are the way to go generally hybrid strains produce a combination of effects from their parents the two strains that were combined to make the hybrid they will produce more of the effects of the dominant strain either indica or sativa and less of the effects of the second strain whether it be indica or sativa unless they are even combinations that provide truly balanced effects hybrids are classified as sativo or indica dominant and then further broken down into percentages or parts of a whole for example a strain could be sativa dominant with a percentage of sativa and indica such as 90 10 90 sativa 10 indica as well as 80 20 70 30 or 60 40. this will be the same for indica dominant hybrids 50 50 hybrids are those very equalized strains not dominant in either sativa or indica generally the higher the ratio or percentage of sativa dominance in a hybrid the more energizing the strain will be and vice versa the higher the percentage or ratio of indica dominance in a strain will produce relaxing and more sedative effects by this action of combining strains hybrids can produce the widest range of varying effects leaning either way and are the most difficult strains to make generalizations about as with all strains generalizations about strain types and their effects could vary for any one cannabis strain these generalizations are a good starting point for choosing a medical strain based on the effects that you want and the likelihood of what a strain will produce it is important to look at the individual strain and its unique cannabinoid and terpene profile as well as the thc and cbd ratios in choosing a medical strain consider all of the cannabinoids and terpenes their effects and their medical applications as this will contribute to how the strain treats a medical condition and individualized effects it may have you can find a complete free downloadable chart of the cannabinoids and terpenes in cannabis and their medical applications using the link in the description this will help you further consider the individuality of a strain to choose a strain that best meets your needs generalizations about strain types and their effects are based on years of accumulated user reports but due to restrictive marijuana laws they are not backed by clinical trials it is very important that you look at the individuality and uniqueness of each strain to find what works best for you since hybrid strains are bred from two other strains their plants and buds can also look very different combining the densely packed indica bud qualities with airy lighter sativa bud qualities the plants can also range in size and height hybrid plants have the largest range of varying qualities there are hundreds of different types of hybrid strains there is usually a greater variety of high cbd varieties in hybrids over pure indicas or sativas as well as many high thc strains some well-known and popular hybrid strains are trainwreck og kush girl scout cookies skywalker ac dc and canatonic ac dc and catatonic are higher cbd hybrid strains ac dc is a popular very high cbd sativa dominant hybrid with 20 percent cbd and 1 thc it also has low levels of cbg with such high levels of cbd acdc does not produce a high or intoxicating effect and it is very popular for pain and other symptom relief without the high being a sativa dominant hybrid acdc still produces energizing focusing feelings that promote socialization but with relaxed tones high cbd strains like ac dc are popular among medical users canatonic is a 50 50 indica sativa hybrid that has equal cbd to thc about eight percent of each making it a one to one ratio with this 1 to 1 ratio catatonic produces a mild high that is manageable although a 50 50 hybrid the effects are more energizing promoting creativity and socialization but still with relaxed tones one-to-one strains like cantatonic are good for patients who need higher levels of thc but don't prefer the intense high trainwreck and og kush are sativa dominant hybrids wreck is an 80 20 sativa dominant hybrid with about 20 percent thc and less than 1 cbd it is popular because it combines the cerebral mind high of sativa strains that are energizing and promote socialization and creativity with the deep body relaxation of an indica strain og kush is a best seller bred from chem dog and hindu kush it is almost a 50 50 hybrid but slightly more sativa dominant at 55 45. og kush has about 20 percent thc and low cbd it is popular for the good balance of uplifting effects that are also relaxing skywalker and girl scout cookies are popular indica dominant hybrids skywalker is an 80 20 indica dominant hybrid with about 18 percent thc and less than one percent cbd as an indica dominant hybrid pretty heavy on the indica side it is known for mellow effects that are relaxing and even slightly sedative girl scout cookies is a 60 40 indica dominant hybrid that is won a few cannabis cups it has about 20 percent thc and 1 cbd girl scout cookies is more balanced and produces a strong relaxing experience that still encourages happy uplifting feelings and socialization these are just a few of the many examples of indica dominant sativa dominant or 50 50 hybrid strains as you can tell hybrid strains can produce very different effects it is always necessary to look at the individual profile of each strain closely when choosing a medical strain you should consider both the strain type and the thc ratios as well as other cannabinoids and terpenes in a strain to choose your best medicine these factors will help reduce the time it takes to find your best and most effective medicine when considering thc and cbd ratios high thc strains will produce high euphoric effects high cbd strains will usually not depending on the ratio a 10 to 1 or higher ratio of cbd to thc will completely eliminate any intoxicating effects one-to-one ratios may produce mild euphoria you can find more information on these topics and choosing a medical strain using the link in the description

buy fifteen hundred flowers to have this information and this list is so good because i get a lot of tips every day i post one flower in my review and then people give me tips to buy the flowers so now because it tips the flower picks are through the roof and the list is through the roof and this is the winner this is number one but i'm not going to tell you what it is till the end we're going to start with number 10 today and we're going to go to number one and i'm telling you this is the list of lists if you're hunting flowers follow this top 100 i'm telling you it's a winner winner chicken dinner and this is number one so let's start the countdown coming in at number 10 from alien labs is something called baklava and i got this at buds and roses in studio city and it's a hybrid and it's got 25 thc and this is one of the flowers that i was looking for and looking for and finally it showed up and it's always great when something you have expectation for meets expectation and baklava is good and it is strong and it's got focus and it's got you for you and it made it all the way to the top 10 to number 10 coming in at number 10 baklava by alien labs but we're moving up to even better flower coming in at number nine we have something called biscotti by connected and this flower is good 30 thc and a hybrid i got this at museums and i'm telling you once you get to this level of flower all these flowers are good so the top ten can be mixed around a little bit i have my favorite and we're going to talk more about those later but coming in at number nine is something called biscotti by connected cannabis it was my ninth favorite here in los angeles if you see biscotti it's definitely worth the try but we're moving on up coming in at number eight if you can imagine we have another connected strain and this one's called connected gushers and the gusher seems to be good amongst all the different cultivators i don't know why but the one of the good ones the really good one and i got this at museums this is a hybrid with 30 thc is connected gushers if you see it it's definitely worth the try this flower is awesome and it was my eighth favorite here in los angeles but we're moving up to even better flower coming in at number seven we have something from top shelf cultivation who wants to guess what it is right it is whoa see whoa this is a good flower 31 thc it's an indica and this flower is top shelf this flower will stone you to the bone it is got focus it's a good one i liked it and it was my seventh favorite that i've tried here in los angeles whoa see woah top shelf cultivation is a good one to try and it comes in at number seven but we're moving up to even better flower coming in at number six and i love this flower i really do this is from the cure company and there's no props here to anyone even though we always have respect this is all about the best flower and coming in at number six we have the marathon marathon og nipsey may rest in peace your you live on as a flower it is a marathon this thing will last you all day this is a good flower it's an indica it's got 26 thc and i bought a lot of this flower this flower is consistently good so far for me if you want something that can last a whole day it's got you for it makes you stoned enough this is a really good one but i think my favorite part about this is it really lasts a long time 26 thc my sixth favorite marathon og by the cure company but we're moving up to even better flower and it's looking like connected's doing pretty good here today we got another one by connected covenant number five guava times biscotti and this one was a sleeper to me i really like this flower i marked it higher than the gushers and the biscotti i thought this flower was fantastic i got at the museum's dispensary and museums how's it connected that's why i run down there this flower's got 24 percent thc and it's a hybrid and this flower is euphoric and fantastic let me turn around so you can see the name this flower is absolutely fantastic if you haven't tried the guava times uh biscotti it's definitely worth the try and it was my fifth favorite flower of all the flowers 1500 of them here in los angeles but we're moving up to even better flower top four number four we've got a bag product and all these people that are in the top that are bagged shame on you you should know better your product is so good why can't you give us a jar right coming at number four something from mad cow i ran all over the city there's three dispensaries to get it and you can see this is an unopened bag because i got an ounce of double up mints this flower has 38 i think 0.85 thc oh my goodness and i'm usually scared of such high thc flowers but i learned not really this flower the first time i tried it i felt the young stone again and you can't do that all flowers if you get a really good one it can't consistently do that but it was able to really stone me to the bone and i'm like oh winner winter chicken dinner double up mints made it all the way to number four i got the the artistry uh down in uh west hollywood they're really nice to me uh this flower is an indica and if you haven't tried the double up mince by mad cow grab this one it's in the market right now this is the one to try this one get it you know get it it's a good one and coming in at number four double up mints by mad cow but we're moving up to even better flower coming in number three is the highest of all the cookie strains and i think this flower's got some controversy going on people don't understand cookie says indoor versions and outdoor versions and cookies also has figured out that it has to be a certain level of thc otherwise they've got to dish this flower out to someone else who can grow it better because we saw this flower on cookies called gary payton the glove comes in at number three but we saw this flower go all the way down i think to 16 thc and then people say or 18 people didn't like it right but this one that i've got in my hand is 23 the original drop from july 19 i was able to get like three ace of this i still have one unopened eighth and this flower stoned me to the bone in the right way that i'm like oh my god they did gary payton so right with this flower and then i ran with the bulls and i went down to cookies down in melrose and got the 32 version of this and i could see that the the buds looked similar the feeling was actually the same but the more you went on the 32 it became not as euphoric and more heavy and more heavy or this one the 23 you could keep going on going on it was really fork and if i picked them i did a comparison i picked the 23 but it's all good you could just do less of the other one and have the same feeling coming at number three of the top 100 strains in los angeles gary payton cookies i love this flower but you got to buy right don't buy the outdoor you got to get a thc 23 or above and you'll win with this flag that's what i think but we're moving up to number one and at number one we're gonna stick this flower down into uh vapor cup straw and coming at number one oh no excuse me number two we're only on number two i made a mistake but so good stony mouth is never good right coming in at number two we have such a good strain and i got this is the dr green thumbs and it's funny as you really fish around all these dispensaries and you get something and you look at the packaging and you hope that the product inside is just as good so this is called the gushers just plushers and originally i bought this as the plushers and it was good and then i didn't know it was the same product someone told me gushers just plushers is plushers they just wanted to make it sound a little bit different than everybody else and this flower is from big owls and gas house it's got the cool watery oily background on it it's a hybrid it's got 31 and this flower grinned me out i heard it was in the market and they were only selling ounces well if you get an ounce of this you're in you know business for a month right it's a good month worth of flour if you see the gushers just plushers by big owls this is the one to get get this one it's real good and it was number two out of my top 100 flowers out of 1500 flowers this one got number two but we're to move on up to number one and number one no one seems to be able to knock it out of the door it's impossible this thing is much heavier than the flowers it's more euphoric too iog mac one this flower's got the game and that's what this butt is right here you can see iog into organic gardens and let's walk around here mack one indica full body indica and it is this flower right here we're gonna put find a nice spot for this maybe we can put it right here and we'll put it right in the front here to winter buddy you get a front spot this flower right here the first time i tried it it grew me out to the point where i called a good friend of mine and i think i found the best flower of the year but it turns to be the best flower since i've been doing these this is the winner iog mac one and someone posted it it was in rancho cook among the other day and i declared from a delivery service and i declared i don't know but in the end people posted yes it was a small drop of this we just haven't seen it in la and i know everyone uh wants to try this including myself because i've only got one unopened eighth left otherwise i'm done man that's it i got stash blood and an unopened eighth but this is the one to get so you could see iog mach 1 that's it right there that's the terpenes the cannabinoids the water vapor the oil vapor and this flower is about to take me to the moon in such a good way this is a really strong flower if you're not a heavyweight this is not the flower for you i've really seen it take one friend of mine and put him into a state where he's staring into the space comatose and but he was comfortable it

post it below the video come on back i'm the doctor party on my [Applause] [Music] friends [Music] you", "dkVXBlWhJcQ": "what up YouTube issue boy dmt back here with another video today in this video I got my vape pen wax pen a battery my pen whatever you want to clothing use I call them pens on wax attendance that's just me that's what my channel is about my wax pen or my feet like I say babe oh yeah bust it out brass knuckles pin just pulled it off of the wall so it's fully charged and I want to bust out got the lighter because you never know all these cartridges sometimes they're a little too thick you got to heat it up just a little bit to get it to get into the wick now there's something about these cartridges that most people don't know and it's called priming the cartridge before you actually use it and I never really knew too much about that and so I saw someone do it before what I saw someone do it and I actually do my own version of this but I didn't even know that it was actually a thing like I didn't really know for sure what's up and he said priming so I'm gonna show you guys what's up with the priming how to prime your own wax pen and I'm using on let me actually do a close-up what I'm using today is a premium oil lemon of G not from any specific brand it's just I guess some people just make it for themselves which I actually wanted to do a video talking about that just have like a question or answer or just a rap video on the whole thing about packaging and how some of them aren't even actual companies it's just people who make the packaging so to be anyone using the packaging making their own cards so babe carts and just sign them as like that so the shop that I go to though they're very trusted so the people who make these for sure trusted like they were the people that of the shop wouldn't be accepting them and so it did get dissipated and didn't really meet standards of most cards that they have there and I'll do some future card videos of actual friends that you exist but so far right now we just have a lemon on G and it's a hybrid do a close up right now one gram but specifics are different lemon OG got the lady just looking down looking nice and blissful packaging is nice everything's they got the whole silicone rubber pieces lemon energy like I said premium oil flip it around has four watt max mmm don't really know too much detail about the watts I just know that the voltage that my pen has it goes up to four point eight so I guess what it means is for voltage maximum if you go any higher than that and I'll burn it but I believe that it's 3.6 3.6 you don't want to go any higher than that because any burns the cursus it doesn't actually [Music] California representing various bystanders 510 threading hybrid let's get back into the video and let's go ahead and test this bad boy out but you guys could know how I feel about it and maybe you guys can get a better idea on what you guys okay [Music] [Music] okay let's get into it [Music] battery is off lay do five legs one two three one by this is that it sir class now the trick is that you want to see the bubbles I'm just gonna do right here I'm pretty sure you guys so as you can see [Music] so there are no bubbles what's the letter [Music] I have to make a lot of bubbles come on what you do is as soon as you start closing the button-down you breathe in suck in blow out suckin blow out and then the third and sucking let go of the button and then sucking as much as you can and then blow up and you're gonna see a bunch of bubbles come up and then after that you're a probably wanted to suck in without you can pressing the button one more time like pretty hard I will demonstrate and after that you'll start seeing that levels are just showing up better priming techniques but so far that's what I use and after you do that you get fatter if you get super fat rips you're not really waiting on anything and if you start it off not frightening when they may just get that there you go now hold down [Music] [Music] probably the best part [Music] that's not hard [Music] you can try that process one more time if you don't see too many bubbles coming up just Paul did suck hard and then some hurt again usually it should be good I'm gonna go ahead and start over times to make sure he's good [Music] there is no more bubble chilling here there's actually one little baby one Miche butt [Music] hitter repeatedly and then soak your wish and you should be good to go [Music] [Music] [Music] I kind of want to see cuz 3.6 is when I actively affects the terpenes or whatever their strike I think that's what it is the turkey [Music] pretty fabric without burning the church too much you still get a good taste [Music] [Music] [Music] good [Music] [Music] but I would love to know if you guys [Music] this supported EMT but that's what that's it that's all I have for you guys today this your boy DNT back here with another video like the video if you enjoyed it comment something down below something you enjoyed about the video also comment something that you would like to see in future videos and subscribe if you're not check back a notification bell thank you guys for stopping by appreciate it much love see you guys later good night good morning good day peace peace", "eDn3wTnbsE8": "how's everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we've got a much requested one for you today so do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it well this also applies if you happen to purchase one of these questionable cartridges and it fails how do you remove the mouthpiece to extract the oil I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail 1 mil or 1 gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges that being said let's take this to the deck ok well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sail brand that is a batch code on the bottom alright this is another one this one here does not state sea sell across the bottom but on the base it does say sea sell m07 9 this is also a Jupiter distributed cartridge so the first things first we're going to take a pair of vice grips common write scripts and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this collar right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged that one was a little bit difficult I'll apply it to this just to stand it up and they'll have a go at one of these other ones all right I will show you again on this one here I said this is a C cell you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it alright now I'm gonna apply this cartridge to this battery just for a stable base and I'm going to open up this gelato right here and warm it up to dispense it into this cartridge okay now here is the cartridge we are going to refill all right here is the mouthpiece for the cartridge perfectly fine a couple of scratches on but that shouldn't affect it in the least here's the distillate we will be applying to it I have warmed this up substantially just to ensure that it does flow rather well into the system you simply place the applicator tip on the syringe twisting it to ensure that it has a good seal you put the syringe tip down into the cartridge and then just begin to apply the fluid all right there you have it as you can see the original line of the older oil right there at the bottom of the new oil coming down to meet it okay take that off the bottom there and see it's sinking down there very nice we didn't get a protective silicon cap for these threads right here apply it to the threads take the mouthpiece that came off of the cartridge put it over the top and it will it will not go on all the way that's a good thing that means that the seal still works it will not go on at this point you want to take a precision device and apply pressure now as you do that you will see this seal disappears and there you have it let's take this back up top and see how she does all right and here we are back on top with the csail refill that we have here now as you can see the oil has got down to the coil has mixed with that heather oil bubbles are rising to the top let's take this protective cover off the bottom of this hook it up to a battery let's see what we got shall we well there you have it that's working like a champ looking that of oil through there I can get that a little bit of gelato flavor from that distillate that I put in there it's very nice well there you have it that is how you can remove and refill one of these cartridges to extract the oil from it what you're going to want is a slightly longer blunt syringe tip and I have a few of those a slightly longer blunt syringe tip such as this one right here as you can see how long that is that would definitely get all the way down to the base of that and you would be able to extract any additional oil that happens to be in a cartridge where this this cell has failed this one no it's not failing all it's working great well thank you so much for tuning in this has been John with TMZ connoisseurs you be sure to remember to subscribe and give this a thumbs up if you liked it and tune in to some of our other videos to see if you like those as well thank you so much this has been great you have a nice day peace", "7H3pe-bJxqw": ">>> >>> IT >>> IT IS >>> IT IS OUR >>> IT IS OUR MISSION >>> IT IS OUR MISSION WITH >>> IT

empire of illegal drugs that's the description of a massive THC vape cartridge operation busted in Kenosha County investigators say they saved about a half a million and a half dollars of illegal drugs our Hanna Jewell is live with what's been found so far and how this all started with somebody's worried parents yes is this one of the largest drug operations you've had in Kenosha I don't think it was but of this type it's the largest we've ever had and as far as I know it's probably one of the largest in the country Kenosha County Sheriff David beth says the THC vape cartridge operation was being run out of a house and paddock Lake and a condo in Bristol Beth says they seized THC products with a street value of 1.5 million dollars focus was on making money sheriff Beth says two brothers 20 year old Tyler Huff Heinz and 23 year old Jacob hoppings are both facing multiple charges for illegal drug violations that's just the tip of the iceberg in this operation search warrant served at the residences last week led investigators to find more than 31,000 illegal THC vape cartridges almost 100 thousand unfilled cartridges and dozens of mason jars filled with THC oil imported from California they would take a syringe and they inject it into the cartridges the sheriff says they also found guns marijuana buds cocaine pills and $60,000 cash investigators say they may never have uncovered the covert business if it weren't for a couple of parents in Waukesha who tipped them off to a THC cartridge they found with their son I asked all parents out there this is a perfect opportunity and a friendly reminder to have that conversation with your kids six deaths have been blamed on vaping nationwide many more injuries federal investigators are stepping in here now to see if any of those cases are linked to this case here reporting live in Kenosha Hanna Jewell Fox 6 News", "DQdLk5uEQOI": "so as far as the way the board set up let's clear one thing up first and then I'll explain sativa and indica we actually if you more appropriately flavor labeled on the wall sativa like effects an indica like effects in the sense that we are not making as strong of genetic arguments as we are affect argument so now why am I making that clarification well so sativas are the classic plants this is a if you look at this this is what a sativa leaf looks like right it has many little fingers on it like the palm of your hand on their slender City bizarre from tropical areas that is where they came from sativas actually tend to have properties that are energetic they can be focusing they can be they can make you happy they can have mood altering effects those are some of the really common effects for sativa plants on classic examples would be something like Acapulco gold or Nigerian haze these are typically from very warm parts of the world equatorial right indica plants but on the other hand are oh and sativas tend to grow very tall that's another thing that's interesting about them they also tend to take longer to flower on it because on the other hand tend to be short squat plants they have much fatter leaves often fewer leaves so we're a sativa might have nine leaves or even eleven seven usually as a minimum it's rare for an indica to have more than five leaves on a hand on an upon a little particular stock um often even three is not that uncommon because that leaves darker color typically shorter plants bigger buds higher yields but in a compliance tend to be sleepy or body relaxing or both um they tend to be used a lot by people who are having issues chronic pain because of the body calming properties although of course that's just that's kind of more of a common wisdom as opposed to you know there are no pure journals there's no scientific you know double-blind tests or anything like that because marijuana is only get legal for a very short period of time know something take a long time to do but those very general properties of the difference with the Teva and indica exactly those are proper those sort of the main questions that your average person who's just maybe making their first for a potshot they come in and they say oh I'm interested in buying some ganja but I don't know what I want right and in my opinion the correct next question from the budtender should be how do you want to feel now marijuana is highly individual so what makes me feel one way may not work the same way for you but conversely that's where your journey should start and usually we get folks who will answer well I'd like something to make me happy I'd like something it's kind of energizing I'd like something kind of mellow I'd like to relax I want to sleep those are common answers and then and then it's very easy for us to then turn around and make some suggestions depending some of the twos personal preferences like sometimes when people say they want to be mellow they like actually are totally happy with being stoned meaning feeling kind of slow with a little bit stupid right if you're into that you could go to soup stream which definitely have that little extra stoned kind of capacity that's that's one of those things is kind of funny our language has actually made two words for sativa and indica it's high and stoned and you don't even people don't even realize when they're using those words that they're really referencing sativa like effects or in the collective X because it doesn't hit languages with sativa like effects make you high like if you want to feel energized and like go out and do things you're going to be out dancing and you want to have that kind of euphoric energy you get high if you want to be sitting in you know your living room with the Allman Brothers on eleven you might want to be stoned you might want to be just out and relaxed and maybe you're having your drink and you're with your friends and you're all just kind of zoned out and enjoying it and that's a totally different thing being stumped", "PWRlTdwZbFY": "the top 10 strains of cannabis as voted for by you our wonderful subscribers [Music] having checked through all the great comments you've been leaving us and to mark our momentous rise to 10 000 subscribers we have created a definitive list of your top 10 favorite cannabis strains we do just have one question to ask though how can you tell how good a cannabis plant will be just from looking at a few of its seeds after all you only look at the seeds don't you that's what you bought them for so we did some research as to why you may have found the seeds of each strain so enticing and decided that it must have been on their potential potential that is if you accidentally happen to drop one of the seeds into a pot of nutrient rich and moist soil that is located in a warm place under a light bulb and that was also located in a well ventilated place so where shall we begin at number 10 on the list you voted for train wreck though starting out with a train wreck may not seem such a smart move especially if you enjoy travel this one's popular because of the powerful high and few negative side effects it seems to have a reputation for generating creativity and many comment that it has helped migraines general pain and arthritis gelato comes in at number nine with a word of caution for the uninitiated as this has a powerful hit physical relaxation seems to be the overarching theme while the ability to still function normally is a definite upside sitting at number eight on the list star dog is a winner with those of you who are looking for a good thc level at around 20 percent you guys seem to feel that this is a good choice for those of you suffering from fatigue stress or anxiety at number seven future one seems to hit the mark with those of you who are looking for something that leaves you feeling seriously relaxed apparently also helping to reduce feelings of depression a few of you mentioned the word chocolate and not just because of an attack of the munchies on to number six we have amnesia haze so how did it get its name maybe because it's high in thc and low in cpd levels the citrusy notes seem to go down well with you as does the boost of energy that gets delivered northern lights seems to be another popular choice with you and enters the list at number five perhaps because of its potential to reduce stress and counteract sleeplessness the slightly lower thc level makes this one more sophorific and more likely to create a feeling of blissfulness we're beginning to detect a theme here as this is another great strain that apparently induces a great feeling of being relaxed and happy rumor has it that this plant will also flower after just 45 days which is pretty quick in our opinion so maybe a good variety for those of you who are impatient girl scout cookies makes it comfortably onto the list at number four thanks to its ability to help users deal with pain while providing a full bodied hit of relaxation and mind-bending euphoria at number three we have gorilla glue also known as gg4 which has won many awards across the globe and has clearly been a big hit with you as well this is one of those highly potent strains that helps to deliver a thumping dose of euphoria and relaxation which will leave you feeling glued to whatever you are sitting or lying on bruce banner is near the top of our list at number two and works quickly with a heavy hit and then settles down into a euphoric and creative buzz it also seems to be popular with daytime users before we move on to the coveted top spot voted for by you it would only be right to mention a few honorable entries sour diesel didn't quite make it on the list but deserves a mention through its ability to make users feel uplifted euphoric and generally happy while still feeling full of energy your comments also indicated potential for helping with stress and depression we also couldn't completely leave out ghost train haze primarily because of the reports of its inducing a strong sense of creativity and ability to still concentrate heavily some of you also mentioned about its possible help with pain and depression but those prone to anxiety should give this one a pass so back to it and the clear winner is wait for it wedding cake an unforgettable journey into the land of delight begins with a single taste of this indica dominant super potent fiend of a strain its family line oozes sweet and sour earthy scents with unmistakable vanilla aromas and old skunky undertones it would seem that this one delivers the strongest high followed by a deep and overwhelming sense of relaxation now isn't that what many of us are looking for apart from loose change down the back of the sofa and there you have it and we do hope you've enjoyed this video and while these are the top 10 strains of cannabis based on what you've had to say we're sure a few of you will disagree and we can't wait to hear from you in the comments section below and of course if you enjoyed this video do like and subscribe so you too can become a cannabis expert", "zNw380j9ctY": "hey again everybody this is Ken eccentric films back at you with another strain review this will be my second recreational cartridge review of Illinois cartridges if you recall in my first video I reviewed the Cresco kosher tangi liquid live resin cartridge so for my second video I thought I would explore a different company another one of the more prominent companies that I've seen here especially in the Chicagoland area but in Illinois in general Verano and the strain I went with was mag landrace I don't know too much about the strain other than the fact that I was drawn to it because of the word landrace in there because I am a big plant enthusiast so whenever I see the word landrace it grabs my attention but the mag landrace is an iranian landrace that was originally propagated in Illinois according to verrano's website so this is a 0.5 gram oil cartridge compared to the Cresco cartridge which was also a point 5 gram that that one cost $85 and this cartridge was $77 both of those figures are after-tax so a little bit cheaper since the Cresco Koecher tangi is the only other recreational cartridge i've tried here Illinois I'll sort of use that as my frame of reference and reviewing this cart so with that said in comparing those two I would say that Cresco Koecher tangi had a more vibrant profile in its flavor however I wouldn't say this was flavorless by any means it just didn't sort of linger in your mouth as long which i think is sort of a pleasurable thing from certain carts the flavor for this one was sort of a piney spicy cookies sort of taste and it was sort of creamy in that regard but it wasn't anything super potent in terms of flavor but on the other side of the coin this mag landrace cartridge to me was infinitely more potent than the last one which was not you know a weak heart by any means in terms of its effect but this was just super couch lock inducing really good for relaxation I would advise people that have had sort of like too much of a body high before to be a little cautious with how much you use this cartridge because the the pure indica label is very accurate I would say it's very sedating so you don't get panicked thoughts but you can get a very strong body high which I know for some people can cause them to feel more panicked but yeah that's about it with respect to the price I think this one was a little cheaper but the effect was much stronger the only difference was that it wasn't quite as volatile in its flavor but that's just a matter of perhaps different strains and different processes and the other one is liquid live resin and this one's just labeled as an oil cart so I don't exactly know what it is if it's BHO or you know any other kind of concentrate but that's about it overall I'd say Verano did a great job with these carts and I'm definitely gonna try out more of their strains they have some great looking ones let me know if you've tried Verano let me know what other carts you're trying right now and which ones I should check out but thanks everyone hope you have a great day", "8KqMPMEYUNM": "what's up guys it's what he would take city back with another how to today I'm gonna teach you how to tell the difference between an indica and sativa let's take a look at the first nug oh yeah this one right here is an indica I can tell so quickly is because one the density of manag dance it's short and stocky also the indica plant is short and stocky the leaves tend to be shorter and the actual plant tends to be shorter and a little fatter than a sativa also the grow cycle for an indica plant tends to be a little quicker and the yield is higher sounds like you want to be growing the indicas ooh indica has that smell that makes you wonder is that good weed why not just a dead skunk another key way you can tell that it's an antique that is generally your purple weed is gonna be an indica the colder environment that's indicas growing is what kind of gives that purple to the but also duration of the harvest how long you wait to harvest it but generally that colder environment is where you're gonna cos are gonna grow now it's time for the true test where's that bong act well still an indica taste is a little more sweet a little tangy a little fruity that nice smooth indica taste I'm gonna give it another go and the effects of an indica are gonna tend to be a little heavier on the body and you get the body I you're gonna want to sit back you're gonna want to relax maybe eat a little mugeez but this is definitely for you know the night time smoking or you know the experienced smoker that just likes really good so you know I'm saying so now you know the true indicators of an indica I think it's time to go on the opposite side of the spectrum take a look at the differences that the sativa has to offer oh yeah so as you can see right here sativa none is gonna be a little taller way less dense a little more squishy bright day well that's a beauty the tallness of the nug is very similar to the plant right so the sativas are gonna have the taller plants the leaves are gonna be more narrow they're gonna tend to be in the higher hotter climates take a smell it's not like the skunk it's actually gonna be fruity which is weird because the taste of an indica its verdict well I showed you just about everything I can show you about a sativa and let's cut to the chase where's that bong boom sativa tastes a little earthy I would say you know pine the horrible taste but I think we should probably just try it one more time so sativas are gonna give you more of a head hi these can be your wake-and-bake smokes you know your daytime smoking give you more of a creative high so if you're trying to get out go do some stuff create something devious for you my head is high my body is high you can smoke indica you can smoke sativa at the end of the day they'll both get you there it's been woody with tank city and now you know how to tell the difference between an indica and sativa",

cush is an indica leaning hybrid and is testing at around about 20 to 26 percent THC the strain is also a cross between the granddaddy purple and the Durban poison and the effects include relaxation euphoria creativity and up lifting effects and the smell and taste is a very sweet and earthy sort of herbal smell and taste to the strain very very nice I could refer it or say that it is similar to sort of a garlicky sort of smell very interesting as I said first time ever trying it so super stoked so far very impressed let's get into another second rip and see how we go okay so as you can see

I was to give it a rating out of 10 well let's go through the high first true berry it's a hybrid but me it doesn't really put me in the couch it was more of an upper I'm more of ready to do stuff when I smoke this one compared to like Mandarin dream it's more of like a downer I'd be going into couch for that mothertrucker if you're looking for a good daytime hybrid I would definitely choose true berry over a lot of the other ones and if I was to give it a rating out of 10 I'd probably go for like a 88.2 just because I have tasted better but I have tasted a lot worse so I mean it's pretty

clean carts part two requested by brandon horsford shout out to you you know what i'm saying you know with these types of reaction videos i like to basically put the comments from the previous video on the screen so let's go right now [Music] now that we got that out of the way today is november 2nd and i will be uploading it tomorrow on tuesday but i will not be going live because i do have to take my dog tomorrow to the vet and it could take all day so uh here is this video and you know to make up for it but usually on tuesdays i usually go live i don't really upload a video so this will be for today i don't know if i'm going to be going live but at least i have this video out so uh yeah i'm gonna take a hit of this bear labs cartridge the gorilla glue 4. i do have a video on this but you will probably see it later in this video cheers boys good stuff let me take another hit good stuff all right so here we are here on clean carts we are gonna go to the new post need help with some cheap touch lists and pawn batteries uh the coach run you know what i'm saying i don't know how much this is this is a company based in canada so i don't know if the shipping fee is going to be a lot more than usual you know so um but yeah i would have um maybe the yo can as well and also the pocket uh the dash vape all good stuff just such a smooth feeling never seen this before looks pretty cool looks like a bullet or no no it's a very long magnetic bottom piece we got a california gold pin legit or not so on the last video i didn't mention that they do label the things fake or not you can see there's a fake right there so this one's fake um but honestly it's all ceramic card all ceramic cards just look really nice to me i don't know it's just it just looks really nice all white and uh i don't know smoking on that orange platinum cookies or orange cookies platinum dates from michigan potentially dangerous why the reason this is because the michigan branch of beauty has released some shady products okay that's good to know so a very cool subreddit they they'll tell you right away or a moderator will at least mark it so they'll let you know the possibilities the potential dangers of what it can have that's really that's really dope you know what i'm saying and i really [ __ ] with that and uh with the cartridge connoisseurs out there you know i would definitely you know go in this site you know what i'm saying so or the subreddit we got the dime like i mentioned dime contacted me so we might be getting something in the future for the channel you know then all that you have to prove my car is going rub it in the mods face someone just put [ __ ] post that's funny 93 thc let's just read some of these comments i mean the oil looks good but here's the thing with oil when it comes down to oil you can't really tell you know you don't have a microscopic [ __ ] eyes where you can see down to the [ __ ] the you know the atoms or some [ __ ] you know it's it's harder to tell with weed you can see you can smell you know you can see it looks like trash it probably is trash you know but with the cartridge unless you really hit it or i mean if it gives off a smell like yeah it's really hard to tell you know so just be careful let's read this is just an entire starter guy thing that accuses in defensive violence not gonna lie when you flag my dc medical bias suspect it wrestled my jimmies but you're right why did the dispensary that took my money under a state mandated medical marijuana but not follow all the rules in the program is a question i now ask and the question only serves to protect my dumbass is it all right yes sadly at least it seems to be the case based on the interactions has it been experienced there seemed to be three types of coming here to brigade the first and most obvious are the fake and dirty card cut hardware sellers who come here to push and get banned you know my poi works at krt and he says they are made by raw garden just sold out the bag i've heard that before right there's a couple hundred of these on the banned list the second is people who come here asked about fakes who were told they were fakes couldn't provide any proof to the opposite then this is the key part either responding by trolling or pushing fakes as hard as they can or by flipping the [ __ ] out and insulting and cursing myself or other users and so were banned calling me and and variations other than the course of action double down on the breaking rules of launching personal attacks and get them in there's another couple hundred of these people on the ban list damn okay he wrote a whole story i feel it you know that happens there's trolls on everything my channel [ __ ] this subreddit on every type of forum possible you know and it's just you're just gonna have to deal with it and that's why we have good moderators to just put that [ __ ] so no one else can see it you know i do have a lot of moderators on my channel and i do see some of the contents a lot of bots and stuff and it says banned by moderator and all that stuff so i know my moderators are helping the channel out because if i leave that on myself most of the time it just goes to hell to review or spam but if i leave it on itself it gives people an opportunity to get ripped off you know maybe they're not or very gullible and they call one of these numbers to order some these [ __ ] products that someone's selling on that comment you know and it's my responsibility so like i try to get rid of that as much as possible because no one wants that no oh hit me up on whatsapp and shut the [ __ ] up no smoking from that clean loud questions about extract labs delta 8 have a lot of things going for them and possibly question them they're good but delta e still seen sketch but they have live results i have no comment with delta eight but i know it's legal still i don't know if it's still legal i know it was legal or it still is and uh i have no opinion on that but like honestly if this is a legal way of people in illegal states to get high then i'm all for it you know you can buy it off the website if it's tested and all that stuff are indeed all that stuff good then i'm all for it you know because it's better than buying off the street if you can buy legal delta thc delta eight thc you know what i'm saying like [ __ ] the streets i'm not saying [ __ ] the streets i meant to [ __ ] the street cards sounded um but anyone know if crystal creek organics delta is legit it says fake right there this one was it fake as well potentially dangerous okay see they still mark it you know obviously there's not much on delta eight so it could be potentially dangerous these ones are fake as well [Music] let's see i was loving eureka and that was fake a lot of people have been mentioning um if i've ever tried eureka i've never tried eureka i've never even seen it near me um but it says fake right here so entry base cleared you know this is a legit brand i have never tried to this day um tree tree base clear i'm not sure if it's this i'm pretty sure it's this is water clear i don't think uh yeah see it real or not the worst pictures ever what was this another one of those uh plug and play copies uh just steer just be careful you know what i'm saying like they could be good they could be bad you know at the end of the day that's 50 50 and that is not good chances at all you know so heal this up with the letters no that's what he did i mean i thought this was like known you know when or when oil is hot it's very runny when it's cold or room temperature it's gonna move like molasses you know so we got the blue dream i don't know i don't know about these this one at least i don't know what that is suspicious they marked it revolution craft live resin okay looks pretty good real or fake 4 000 scans what does that mean fake damn they made his market fake picked up a lot of raw garden highest thc and they got a lot of flavors on the back is that the flavor rx what is this green dot so you know just because it's legal and i don't know it you know i don't know all this every state's legal carts okay so please just bear with me uh i don't know all of california's carts and this is the state i live in so like i said just because i don't know it um and i say maybe it's fake uh it could be real as well because i don't know i don't know all the information on that [ __ ] so it's just me reacting to the subreddit shout out to brandon for uh you know requesting it but puffing on the knife strawberry call i actually tried stizzy the other day with uh my uh my cousin's girlfriend had it and she let me try it it was a skywalker the this lit really really good for distally you know i'm not really a fan of the or like a weird like pine terps i'm not a fan of that i mean it's okay you know um but if i had to choose it would definitely be like more of a cannabis derived terpenes that's what i prefer i like cannabis derived

something from uh frosted flower they sent me out two different strains definitely excited to try these out whatever um one is called turf town and one is called el jefe i have to see that i'll show you how to tell and a better look at it um so i definitely like these containers there it goes frosted lime and you see it's terp town so this is the bottle i'm gonna show y'all it has the website right there it has a little um if you want to get the lab results there you can just um scan that code right there signature hemp flour 18 plus i think it's 21 21 plus now i'm gonna show you some of this flour but first i'm gonna smell it and see what this smells like i'm gonna do both i'm gonna do both the reviews in one video um now i opened this turf town before it and it smelled absolutely amazing i'm gonna get like these two big buds in here so i can show you real quick it's very pungent on the smell um almost reminds me of a hawaiian haze but like indoor very um very earthy and fruity yeah very earthy and fruity whatever i can't pinpoint what kind of fruit damn i want to say like a berry or like a berry or cherry i'm not sure i'm very hard to pinpoint whatever but let me show you all the budget real quick whatever it definitely smells amazing though look at that guys but it's definitely like very strong on the on the as soon as i opened it and i smelled it it smelled amazing little bit better zoom in on this okay as you can see it's covered in orange hairs dude yeah this is some fire guys like definitely some fire i believe they said this was indoor i'm not sure about the other one if it's indoor or not i'll have to check it out in a second this one's called el jefe this one's in a bigger container though i don't know if it has more in there again this is from frosted frosted fire it says this is their signature hemp flower so i don't know if this is indoor or not so we're gonna check it out right now and what's cool about these they come with the dehumidifier packs keep them um you know fresh make sure they're not they don't get dried out or um what's it called make sure they don't get dried out or they don't get too um too much moisture it keeps it balanced [Music] it's most familiar but i just don't know what [Music] it's not left there it's like um imagine like again like incredible hulk or maybe like a sour space candy definitely like you get like um almost like a coffee like like a coffee earthy smell um definitely a little bit of a diesel and like i said my my terpenes when i want me smelling terpenes and trying to smell exactly what it smells like i'm not the best at it so yeah don't quote me on that but that just reminds me of like the whole like i've ever seen have you ever smelled hulk cbd or um like sour space candy getting a closer look at this whatever it definitely looks really really good um it's a little darker let me show you real quick so y'all can see what i'm talking about so there's definitely some very good nugs whatever the trim job on both of these are amazing um covered in trichomes a whole bunch of orange hairs it's just some of them are a little darker which is not it's just all cbd and thc has different tones in color whatever like purpose is a little darker and purple um you know start um like og kush is brighter and a whole bunch of orange hairs and citrusy each cbd and and thc is different but both of these strains are amazing they um i definitely love the trim job whatever it almost looks like i'm holding three different types of [Music] now this the cbd isn't as is it as intense as the turf town i definitely might prefer the trip tunnel with this one um they both they both look amazing don't get me wrong the turbo talent just has um like i said everyone has preferences whatever when it comes to like you know kind of soda or beer whatever you know it all comes to um preferences and definitely these are two really nice cbds i can't wait to try them out i got my bong right here so i'm going to try this out guys we're going to try out the turk town first um um so i got my impact whatever of the turf town let's try it out guys this long i haven't used it in a while it's kind of dirty [Music] [Music] definitely packs a punch um like i said in other videos before whatever usually whatever i don't know about y'all but whenever i take a hit of thc or cbd um you can tell right off the bat if it's like gonna hit and give you effects right off the bat and definitely like that one you can tell it's very potent very uh very strong um it doesn't hurt the throat it's very smooth whatever but it definitely like if you get a big enough hit you're gonna you're gonna cough um but in a good way um i want to say it's like it's like a really earthy piney kind of taste to it with a very small hint of like fruit um not like it's not like hawaiian haze it's definitely like it's it smells like kind of like hawaiian haze but not like not really and this is the only thing i could compare to all the shipments for labor day they literally just got like a hundred dollar bill and just put put it in one of the the orders to thank their customers and which is pretty cool you know that's pretty awesome the company could do that get back to um their customers especially in like the times that we're in right now and you know a lot of people are struggling all right so i got el jefe packed up let's go ahead and try this out guys holy [ __ ] now i packed the punch god damn [Music] oh this one definitely hits hard bro like hey [ __ ] we don't we don't know virgin loves like me to see you probably be okay okay i just [ __ ] lit it up okay i just [ __ ] lit the boat i can't ever hit the hit like a bow and he lit the whole thing that's what i was doing like an idiot so um so i took a smaller hit i'm already feeling both of these dude like honestly i'm quitting it somebody said in my other video i was like smoking moon rocks on my balcony but like i was like looking around because people were like like walking around and somebody like a couple was staring at me so i stopped smoking because like i'm on the balcony overlooking the riverwalk and um yeah pretty much somebody was like i watched your video when you're smoking you're smoking whatever on the balcony and now it was giving me like crazy anxiety i was like damn i know my anxiety was giving other people anxiety um yeah dude i definitely like these um the cbds whatever the el hasta is um uh if you get that'll happen make sure to don't hit it too hard because i literally i lit the whole bow and i [ __ ] just both of these cbds are very potent they definitely have a lot a lot of flavor and um definitely you can smell the terps uh terp town is a little more stronger on the smell and hefe is a little stronger on the head and uh they both look amazing on the buds whatever they both have are covered in trichomes you know beautiful trim job uh nice selection by the company um so i appreciate them for that you try this product whatever i'm gonna end the video here guys thank you everyone for watching i definitely recommend these two cbd's uh i'll give turp tum a nine and a half i'll give it um i'll give it eight um yeah just because it was a little darker and it was a little harsh in my throat um turptown is amazing i like i love it um anyways guys i hope you enjoyed the video leave a like and a

my batteries and cartridges inside of my car because I couldn't take them to work and then when I came back from work I would always have leaky batteries leaky cartridges and that was really before I looked into proper maintenance of my oil cartridges so today I wanted to share a few tips I've learned along the way that I'll help you get the most out of your oil cartridge oil cartridges are great great for my producing they preserve your contents for a lot longer like most devices it's the small things that go a long way save you time save you money frustration but you don't want to take advantage of this by refilling new oils in the same oil cartridge do not fill your cartridge more than twice why is this bad to do well if you keep refilling the same cartridge over and over again it can cause leaking clogging lots of paper production thick oils will begin to harden on the wick and you won't be able to vape new oils properly stuck in an endless loop pulsing for good drawls and there's a special circular inhale for things like that especially you'll burn the cotton and the oils and once that happens even the best tasting oils they won't be able to mask it I like to think of it like oil in a car you wouldn't want to change your oil too often without changing your filter and the cotton inside of your atomizer is like the filter in your car you can go and get new oil but without changing the filter you never really have clean oil don't do what I did and leave your cartridges inside of your car or any hot place for that matter I know it might be convenient but for most you out there a good rule of thumb is heat bad cold good high temperatures can not only degrade the oil taste and potency but it can cause leaking the best places to store your oil vapes are cool dry dark places like a desk drawer or a refrigerator put the rubber plug back onto the bottom of the cartridge and start it ideally in a dark place around 70 degrees Fahrenheit or less but don't go too far to the extreme to the other side when stored in the freezer because that can create moisture inside of the cartridge so avoid heat and avoid freezers but now when you take your cartridge out of the fridge the oils gonna be thick and all thick oils need to be primed first priming your new oil cartridge is going to make the difference between the first hit being smooth and magical or dry and burn the nasty teetsi oil is thick so you need to give it some time to soak into the atomizer here's how to do it make sure your oils are at room temperature if they're fresh out of the fridge pull the cartridge in between your palms for about two to three minutes to warm it up if you're loading an empty cartridge only fill it with a small amount so if you run into problems you don't waste all your oil take about five polls on the cartridge without the battery being attached what you're doing is simulating vaping and pulling a little oil from the atomizer then attach the cartridge to the battery and give it a try I recommend pulsing the battery here it's the best way to ensure that you're not burning your oils if it's still too cold go back and warm it up and then try it again so there you have it guys those are the main ways to get the most out of your oil cartridge dont refill it more than twice always prime your new coils and always keep them in a cool dark place to prevent it from leaking on you keep in mind that not all cartridges have wigs some only come with ceramic or glass cores it's your responsibility to know what you're buying it's always smart to clean the bottom of the cartridge before storing it with cotton swabs or alcohol wipes that way when you take the rubber cap back off you can see if it's leaked hopefully these tips helped you guys where do you personally store your cartridges if you have any other questions leave them in the comments below let us know subscribe to god vape for more videos like this thanks for watching peace", "wc-pup7l8I0": "[Music] so i got early today and they say the early bird catches the worm and today i got up early because i ran down to woodland hills and they had the drop for scottie pippen's flower and the reason i went to get this is not necessarily because of scottie pippen even though i know he's a great basketball player and got to play with michael jordan right uh but it this is my backpack boys and you put scottie pippen and backpack boys together and you figure these guys can do something good right it's got some let's check it out so i ran down there and by the time i got there there was already a line around the building and i would say i was you know three quarters of the way back it was a big line and it went really slow and it was really hot and at one point i was thinking is it worth it to stay it was hot there wasn't any social distancing people were smoking cigs in the line and i didn't want to say hey stop smoking you know not good right but we were there we had our goal and that was to get scottie pippen flower and i got lucky because a nice oops a nice person named alex who i guess works at cookies he does something with cookies uh was able to help me get in there because i was about to fall down the doctor was out of gas crazy right and i learned i can't do that anymore it was a long line it was really hot it was uh a lot of people all wanted me scottie pippen i just actually wanted to buy the flower but anyway you could see i actually got it and look how beautiful this flower is and i would say this flower has a very unique look amongst flowers it's purples and greens and browns and really incredible so we're looking forward to trying it today and so let me load vapor cup straw real quick i already got two scoops in there i'm gonna put one more in that's about three this is a sticky flower so it's not really going to fall out anywhere we'll tamper but you don't really even have to and you can see if it falls out it falls back into the grinder and i'm gonna stick this down into the vapor cup and what vapor cup does is it's gonna heat that flower that's in the end of the straw and it's going to let off the terpenes and water vapor and it's unlike any other thing i've ever used and i would say this thing has really good airflow and in a minute and a half the feeling and the taste both are incredible and from that one little bit i'm gonna get 12 draws and if someone really wanted to draw it out you can get 20 draws of flavorful flour anyway so scotty bippin comes in this bag and you can see it's got his number on it it's got a signature and it says backpack poise and five points and this flower has 29 thc which is right in the right rung to be a good flower right now number one is iog which is indoor organic gardens mac one it's the number one flower it's got 29 thc and that flower just grinned me out i couldn't even stop grinning that's why it's number one and so i'm hoping you put scottie pippen together with the backpack boys you have a release of cookies they gotta be thinking let's do this really good so we've got our cup set to 330 degrees and you can see i've got the vapor in the straw so let's check out scotty pip and buy backpack boys at 330 degrees so this flower is really really really smooth it has a wonderful cure on whoever did the cure and all that is just so wonderful you can take a lot of draws the flavor stays this is like a oh gee-ish sour earthy taste but i would say it has some og in it but it is incredible out of vapor cup as a vape if you just like to sit around this is a really wonderful vape but we're looking for the best and everyone's best is different and the best for the doctor is something that's heavy i've been doing it every day for maybe 40 years right long time and i've tried a different flower almost every day most of 10 years so we really understand what we're looking for and how to describe it and i would say this flower really gave me heavy eyes i would say it had some focus it definitely wasn't hazy i would say this flower was a medium heavy weight it wasn't a super heavy weight there's much heavier flowers than this and i would say this flower is kind of a cruiser meaning it wasn't too heavy it had just enough focus and it was good flavor was good so what do we think we're looking for the best what do we think of scotty pippin by backpack boys i'm giving this flower an 865 which is a really good score it didn't grin me out it's not heavy enough to grin me out and also it wasn't you you fork enough to grip me out but this flower is a good cruiser and i would say if someone tried this they would definitely like it there's nothing wrong with her it's a great flower if you want to try scottie pippen you buy backpack boys and i'm sure a lot of people are going to try it and you can put the comments down there see if we agree i got it at cookies woodland hills but this good flower is going to be around i wish scotty pippen a lot of luck with this flower i'm the doctor if you want to see vapor cup if you want to get a vapor cup you can see it at vaporcup.com i'm telling you you can't even imagine how good it is it just changes the game it's as good as the bong was when the bong was new this is the next level i'm telling you incredible otherwise i wouldn't talk about it like i do this thing is incredible if you're looking

hitters prefilled cannabis concentrate vaporizer pens [Music] we're going to be reviewing three different products from heavy hitters today we're gonna be reviewing the 2.2 gram cartridge the one gram cartridge and we're also going to be reviewing the actual vaporizer battery pen itself so let's go ahead and unbox these things and see what we have here first off is do we have the actual vaporizer pen and this is the pen that's actually provided by heavy hitters that you can purchase that's branded by heavy hitters it includes a little USB charger plug as well as the pen itself and that's a 5-10 thread pin okay and now we're gonna unbox the 1 gram cartridge this is an OG Kush cartridge which is a hybrid but it's in indica dominant and that's the one gram cartridge and now we're gonna unbox the 2.2 gram cartridge this is the ha static cartridge and this is a new flavor it's the blue dream ok so now let's take a closer look at these individual items first we're going to look at the battery itself now the heavy-hitters battery that is available through heavy hitters and which is recommended for the device is just the right wattage at 4 watts it also has no buttons or anything on it the only thing that you can see is the logo on the side for heavy hitters and then the 510 threaded end that actually plugs into the USB charger that's the simple kind of USB charger that plugs directly into USB and you could charge that with other kind of chargers as well ok now we're going to look at the 1 gram pen and this is the cartridge pin for the 1 gram that's the og cush I'm a big AG fan so I'm really looking forward to trying this out in a minute and it's really simple it's just a one piece I know there was a little rubber cap that goes over the 510 thread there on one end but you just could discard the little rubber cap and then you see it's just a simple cartridge that threads directly onto the pin and these are sort of low wattage it's a 3.7 watts recommend it there so you could try these on other pins but you wouldn't want to try these on a modern of high wattage device okay now we're going to take a closer look at the big 2.2 grand pen and these are monsters I really like this the concept here of just making a tank that's gonna last you for a couple of weeks and also a big fan of blue dreams so looking also for it to trying this out and you can see this pin is so big that it's actually the cartridge is a little bit longer than the pen itself but it's very similar to the other pen other than the length of it it has screws right on to the end of the battery and it's the same battery that you can use on both size cartridges look at that at this like a it's like a rifle or something they're just not rifle you can see the comparing the two you can also see that the two oils look different as these are strange specific and you can also see out of the quality of the oil is very good how thick it is that takes that bubbles so long to roll up but one thing to be cautioned with and this is a lot of vaporizer pens they will roll off the table and break so be careful you don't want to break your heavy head or you'll cry okay so it now comes the favorite part the part of that we've been waiting for here at Roth house studios and this is amazing a pen if you've tried any kind of these cartridges you just can't equal the taste I really like the little light-up end there when you you don't have to do anything when you draw through the pen it lights it up and also ignites the the vaporizer atomizers so you don't have to press any buttons or anything like that it's just air controlled and then I had a little fun here to try both flavors at once that OG Kush was delicious by the way very piney a little bit of lemon but very piney and delicious and the same goes for the Blue Dream it wasn't as pioneer but it was a much more lemony citrusy flavor and just awesome the flavor on these is incredible and heavy-hitters is the correct name you can get major puffs especially for the low wattage coils you can still get major big puffs and like I said we've tried these on multiple batteries and they work good with most of your low wattage batteries but you do need to be careful not to use too high of a wattage of a battery because you get burnt out the coil in the atomizer and it won't work another thing to be cautious with about using these heavy headers or any kind of the cartridges or a lot of these cartridges especially the high-end strong ones like this is that you can find yourself overmedicating very easily because it's such a pleasant experience it tastes so good and it doesn't make you cough and choke that after a few hits you may just find yourself staring out into the window aimlessly and forgetting what you're doing so be careful not to over Medicaid and don't drive or operate machinery obviously anytime but especially in the case with with these heavy headers because they are appropriately named-- you will definitely get very very high off of these all right very easily super high quality very premium premium oil right here [Music] so that comes to my review or my rating for the heavy hitters and I'm gonna give it five stars I really can't find any problems with it the only problem that I have is you're gonna be upset if you let it roll off the table and break it which is only a testament to the product itself just top-notch product so I would like to say thank you to heavy hitters who sent out these pens for us to review if you'd like to learn more about heavy hitters you can check them out online and you could also ask for them at your local dispensary I hope you enjoyed this review of the heavy hitters solvent free concentrated cannabis wax pens if you did please hit

video peace", "NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "zEnOWYG-J7o": "[Music] hey everybody welcome to another episode of you dude my name is bud I am here today to show you a new cannabis strain sometimes I I do I like to do just regular reviews where I kind of talk about a strain a little bit sometimes it's fun to do growing projects or what's the best list and looks like that's that but you got to get down to the the roots here of just straight up reviews once in a while that's how this whole channel started so anyways today we have a headband that's the strain the THC is 19.3% and the CBD is 0.1 so very low in the CBD and quite high high ish in the THC but so high this is a indica it's kind of usually it has really big juicy nuggets it's not like good I know you would call that but good like bag appeal or something you know when you get a bag and it's got nice nuggets in it so this one I only saved a little little guy here and actually only a portion of it but you get the idea that this is just like a little chunker but oh the smell is just amazing really cheesy there's got a good cheese nose to it a little bit skunky slightly to almost salty like a salty salty cheese you know really really nice smell and then when we break this guy up that's gonna just bouquet as soon as you open the bag with some of something like this it's pretty skunky and cheesy it's really good so headband refers to it's not anything to do with like hippies or any of that crap it's more to do with the sensation that your head feels as soon as you smoke it it's like a press and you're on that in your temples it feels like you're wearing a tight headband sometimes so it's pretty it's pretty I'd say intense it's not for a very stop for a beginner because that could be something that turns people off of smoking pot in the beginning when they get a little bit too high or you feel like the sensation like that it's not always what people are looking for but for experienced pot smokers it's definitely something that makes you remember why spoke did in the first place it it you get used to this the feeling of being stoned so it's nice to once in a while have one that kind of like okay flicks on a light switch with you and that's this one for me headband okay I'm gonna grind some of this stuff up here yeah good stuff well one thing with this is it's like quite I'm gonna say quite sticky when you're put pressing it down into your grinder so it sometimes gets caught up in the grind and but it rolls usually really nicely because them get being quite sticky okay here we go oh I can smell it already it's just like it's that classic it's a classic smell this is like when I don't know I don't know what it is it's maybe a nostalgia thing or I've had this dream before in the past but there's something just it brings me back to the the old days when I first started smoking pot it's really really potent really skunky the kind of stuff that you you know I'd have to bring home and put in a ziploc bag and then like an airtight container and then inside of a jar just to contain the smell from my mom and dad smelling it but yeah it's it's really like the skunk the cheesiness turns into a full-out funk and it's nice so it's like I've said this before but it's kind of like incense you know I I personally love the smell it doesn't offend me whatsoever I think if anything when I smell you know people smoking pot in public it like it brightens me up a bit but some people are offended by it some people don't like the smell at all so hey it's kind of too bad I have a little plate here where I'm keeping all the like the spares so I can have like roll some splendid joint it's kind of thing it's like a Solera bat okay here we go got a decent sized joint here let's try it out mmm there's you know there's actually a little bit of it's a little bit spicy on the flavor I would even say there's not a lot of like fruits going on or anything like that a little bit mentally - mmm actually almost slightly chocolatey to taste delicious but again for people who are maybe buying this strain for the first time on the website the Canadian or the BC website whatever province you're in just beware that you're you're gonna buy these products and not know how they're gonna affect you especially if you're a new novice so is that what it's called there's novice like someone that's good okay a beginner I'll say anyway but 19.3% THC mmm mmm a couple of a couple of good puffs and you already like already I'm starting to feel that buzzy pressure in the head so it's it's interesting I personally like it not everybody does but it's also one of these ones that's really good for if you're nauseous it's a good one or if you're you're having problems eating it's a good to induce hunger one thing though it's very very cottonmouth your mouth gets really pasty and dry so that also I think is another nostalgia thing because when you're really stoned and in your own kind of head with it and then you got that pasty tongue kind of feel extra stoned so some people don't like that it's kind of a throwback for me and it reminds me of the good old days of the first couple times and listening to music especially it's just just amazing so anyway my name's bud click like subscribe if you have any comments or if you've tried this strain but I forgot to mention that this is by pure Sun farms so it's interesting some of these products being here during the kovat 19 and Emma can kind of stuck indoors most of the time I wonder how many of these companies are going to be around at the end of this who knows anyway thank God they've considered it a essential service here in Canada okay thanks for joining me talk to you soon all right [Music]", "bMAm5vZKV0o": "okay there's a short video of the carts that were made especially for me this is a i think one called cough strawberry cough and then in a little slide in full box i can close the damn thing doing this one and that time so there's no information on the box so it could be wholesaled and these are made especially for me and then of course i just place them in my boxes this box is a little worn we've opened and closed it trying to get it right so that is our delta eight thc vape carts one milligram", "GDgj4zVNub0": "so we are going to be doing a uh cbd versus thc delta 9 versus thc delta 8 blind test we're gonna have my friends try out these drugs and see if they can tell the difference between them uh this is purely for entertainment uh so let's get right into it by the way if you don't know who i am i'm chris with cbd extract and if you haven't tried our hemp flour before do me a favor and hit the link down below and you can grab an eighth of our hemp flour completely for free it doesn't cost you anything all you got to do is click the link down below to claim the offer let's get right into it we're not going to tell you what's what okay oh we're going to we're going to tell you at the end but for now let me ask a couple questions okay uh how long have you been smoking like a year and a half year and a half okay about six years six years quite a while yeah that's quite a while how experienced would you say you are with weed but i am not good at knowing types quite a lot of experience so i'm a big dabber so like um i get a lot of different profiles like i tried to switch up my strains and stuff and switch up like in because of a hybrid so okay i like to get a lot of different like experiences so i'm pretty well versed and he's from the uk by the way wheat is not legal there at all so he has [ __ ] weed [ __ ] weed in [ __ ] england they don't even have cbd weed there if they do they have to label it as tea because they they don't even allow cbd weed there so this is the first cartridge uh you're going to have to guess if it's delta 8 delta 9 or cbd and also you know just feel what you think about it tastes like ginger um it's interesting like it tastes like a flounder tastes like actual planters i could do your own i feel nothing it just tastes very like not strong but you can tell the flavor no but that just tastes like the ground it tastes like the ground yeah what cannabinoid would you say this is um it tastes a little bit different from like most cards i almost want to guess that's delta nine i really don't know i don't know cbd i'll i'll say this is cbd for now but i might change my mind so okay i don't know i get like a certain like throw hit off of the actual thc and i felt like slightly different but i almost can kind of notice some effects i could just be liking a placebo so this is the next card [ __ ] tastes a lot more like what i would expect a cart to taste like oh there we go right off the bat i noticed it's super clear i'm just looking at it it looks pretty concentrated and i can i feel like i can almost kind of feel it off of that suit and by the way on these parts we're doing a curveball because not only are some some of them delta 8 or delta 9 or cbd we're also some of them are botanical terpenes and some are going to be cannabis derived terpenes so we're going to talk not super vibrant flavor like if there's any terps in this i would guess it's you know minimal what do you think about the taste this is um this is delta eight would you say it's an indica or sativa i'm never gonna tell you that all right yeah whatever i get in the currency but it's just for like the flavor differential not really the effects i never noticed anything different [ __ ] does it hit strong though like i smoked delta 8 before but this is kind of different this is like that tastes very strong in the back of my throat i can feel that [ __ ] just yeah it's definitely there um this is delta a that's delta a i think the last one might have been delta nine because starting to fill that a little bit i'm gonna guess delta h [ __ ] i don't like that one like nothing like i can't taste anything really just tastes like is there a throat hit to it nope no throwhead okay it's fruity yeah i don't know and it hits good like very smooth it just tastes like him like i'm chewing grass taste reminds me a lot of like actual distillate like um delta nine still i like this one it seems to look a little bit like it unless it's just like terps although it does look really thick i don't know it's good though i like that one so would you say cbd delta 8 or delta 9 on this one um i'm pretty stuck in between delta no no no this is delta a not cbd i don't know that was delta nine which one the one that i just did was delta nine the first one cbd because this is way weaker than the last one right i'm not tripping like this has to be delta a i don't know you tell me man i think there might be like some cd in there too you think there might be cbd yeah yeah i think like the last one is more like pure delta eight if i had to guess and then like this one there's like some other additives i don't know it could be completely wrong but i don't know how you know the difference between [Music] [Music] okay hmm is that one clogged too they're all i feel like all cars wow that one hits more it's in the bathroom oh that one is like peaceful this is like taking him right before getting to bed i don't know whether it's thc cbd abc this is like not the strongest thing it's not the strongest like the second weakest in terms of like first impressions right but this is like i could smoke this like a lot you know like i could wake up a lot of bed and take a hit you know i have to prepare myself for this i don't need a big breakfast [Music] this is very casual this is delta r that's delta all right uh yeah or delta yeah delta nine here okay i always get it mixed up then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah interesting i don't know i don't know what this is but it's not dealt to mine not about the man no okay so final verdict finally uh which one would you say was the strongest out of all strong ones one two three or four probably two two three two two no i lied three was this one yeah three okay interesting and so and out of the one two three four which one is cbd which one is delta eight which one's delta nine [Music] cbd was the one with the little white cartridge uh delta nine was the second one and the first one was whatever okay cool am i right nope you're completely wrong so out of the four which one do you think had like the best flavor to the worst flavor um i would say the first one had like the most diverse flavor like i could just like pick up like those things going on in it and i think that one would be the seemingly one the very first one i had um and then the second one there wasn't a whole lot of flavor but uh it seemed like there was a high concentration of thc in it whether it's delta eight or delta card and then uh the third one you gave me it was a lot like the first one but it just had like a little bit more flavor okay cool and then what about the and then the fourth one we just talked about that yeah yeah yeah that obviously tastes like almost any card up there interesting all right well hey that's you were actually spot on that everything was right oh okay then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah and then this the third the middle one was dr eight and then the last one was the first one yeah okay we got that right i did she got everything right yeah oh my god yes so there you have it

making some trays like this [ __ ] goes in the dark hang on oh well it does glow i didn't set it in the light long enough what power on okay so daylight it just was sitting in the dark so these are hello it glows in the dark hello here's another one hello hello hello glitter and this is icing on the cake i'm actually just plugging my own products because i got to actually excuse me sorry because i have to actually pull one of them out to get my product that we're going to be reviewing today hey this is an iso state so i this actually is not an iso station it's a pencil holder and i turned it into an iso station so i will be i'm making these too so i put the q-tips in here i got some alcohol in here and look it holds dab tools carb cats that have that long thing on them and vape pens so with that being said let's talk about today's product system so we're on a little bit of a sunshine cannabis kick so let's talk about south florida kush which is a hybrid by sunshine cannabis this is our vape cartridge it is co2 distillate i am pretty sure as well if i'm wrong correct me in the comments because i can't find the box hi editing nietzsche here uh yeah so i did find the box and uh this one was clocking in at 82.834 thc point zero three eight nine cbd for a total of i don't know like almost 83 percent something like that but yeah i actually thought it was lower than this size what the percentages were and it is a co2 derived cart okay see i thought i remembered that okay all right but i think this was clocking in at like 78 or 79 percent it was it was pretty good percentage-wise so uh i've been holding on to this to do this little review so i hope this battery isn't dead because that would be shitty but we're going to take a few hits off that and then let's show you the next product hello it's some strawberry switchblade true wax i have just a little bit left it smells really good i don't know the stats on this guy because it used to be they used to have them on the labels and now they don't and a [ __ ] throws boxes away there's that so let's start off with our south florida kush cart and let's take a taste i bet it's gonna die see i like the way this tastes it's been a tasty cart he's yeah he's trying to get me hurt right here if he jumps on my back i have two palmer do i not i have two paw claw marks on my thigh don't i yeah i do because the cat jumped on my [ __ ] leg he's like come here there's that good job woodsy oh this really does taste good yeah okay i can't i actually like i don't know i i'm surprised that i feel it the way i do i really am because i mean i i smoked a bowl like an hour ago so this is new and i've been smoking this all week but i usually smoke it with other things i eat edibles but i i ate edible this morning i haven't eaten one together today so this is straight up smoke here i'll do one more for good measure for science yeah science it's for science yeah [ __ ] right man i really like this i need to get some of this in flour they need to make this in like uh some rosin i would really like for the sunshine cannabis to come out and like rosin shatter wax any kind of concentrate would be super dope because technically this is a concentrate so i mean hey truly not duck who's that me asking for sunshine cannabis concentrate yes the last time i said something about i wish they'd do concentrates it happened i mean i'm not saying it was me i'm totally saying it was me i mean it could happen that's all i'm saying i have no business so [ __ ] right i do like that i don't know if someone correct me in the comments i'm gonna have to say that is an indica leaning city all right it's an indica even sativa okay it is an indica leaning hybrid i feel that me oh hoes in my eyeballs all right cool editing miche i really just wanted to come on because uh i picked up one of the new so i picked up the skunk ape which is an indica and this is uh the new carts from true leave it's a half gram i believe it is a live cured rosin cart so i'm just throwing in a quick review about this guy too because why the [ __ ] i haven't uploaded this video yet hey now this one this one just so you know it's clocking in at 83.94 thc 0.364 thc for a total of almost 84 percent touching oh it tastes delicious mmm [ __ ] right this tastes good i like this tastes better than the uh blue river rosin cart i had to compare the two i like this better it's super tasty man really terpy okay it's a award-winning cured resin brings out the nuance of cannabis derived terpenes from the best local strains this is a six time award-winning cartridge offers candace's derived terpenes and potency of value yeah this shit's fire fire not like i said i picked up skunk ape so i figured this is actually going to be a three fur yeah really good good job truly good job um these uh cured resin carts taste amazeballs man nice effects i mean it's skunk ape you can't go wrong i love skunk so 10 out of 10 we'll be getting again so okay back to the regular review i really don't need to take a dab with this true wax but i did say we're going to do it too first let's do that well let's do a dab of this true wax i don't know i've already been smoking i mean obviously this isn't a first impressions on either one of these products but that's the first time i i've uh because i'm usually eating nibbles and i just honestly i forgot i forgot to [ __ ] eat another one today who would have who does that i do okay there's that all right let's do a dab with this true wax strawberry switchblade i really like strawberry switchblade this wax is really nice like the consistency of it i really really liked it it almost reminded me of like uh i don't know like the the live rosin from um from grow healthy i guess it kind of reminded me of that texture in a way so let's do it [Music] cheerios this tastes really good it smells just like a taste if that makes sense sometimes they don't do that danger danger high voltage when she dabs when she dabs did i burn that little holy [ __ ] i think i made that a little too hot i wonder i was so painful hot dads who hurt you [ __ ] okay strawberry switchblade

kidding", "f-zCVt_jgh0": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at a new to us vape company and that is ocean cannabis co with their live resin uh today we are going to be reviewing their straw nana strain uh this is the one gram variety rocking 84 thc and 90 and a quarter percent uh total cannabinoids in there uh you usually see that big discrepancy in thc and tac uh when it is live resin because it has all those other cannabinoids that are usually lost in the process uh theoretically should be in here um so being a live resin cartridge uh it was on the more expensive end but cheaper uh than most live resin i've seen uh this one gram cartridge cost me i believe 63 dollars with tax in long beach california which again puts it on the uh more expensive end for a one gram cartridge but on the cheaper end for a one gram live resin cartridge uh so what are some other cool things about it well i really uh am kind of i was intrigued by their whole sort of marketing pitch and the reason they're called ocean cannabis co it seems like a pretty admirable goal to me uh they say on the back that they use all recycled materials in their packaging uh including plastic that has been pulled from the ocean uh so i looked at their website it's a husband and wife combo duo who are uh the head of ocean cannabis co uh and some percentage of the plastic that is in their packaging is pla comes from plastic that was uh extruded from the good old pacific ocean uh which is replete with plastic debris um i'm guessing you know it's probably not a whole lot of pla it's um hard to imagine it's made any kind of a dent but you know it's an admirable goal nonetheless uh so let's go ahead and get into it here this is standard 510 thread stuff so just your normal battery uh ah and here is that plastic that i was talking about that has uh some of it is uh ocean garbage which is again pretty neat i'd love to know the exact percentage the little press release i read online was pretty uh you know a little self-serving and smug but uh it's a cool again i do not want to dilute the coolness okay uh so we've got some different kind of child proofing here that i've not seen uh a line leaf with dot and push up okay so we're gonna line this leaf with these dots there's a little leaf there at the top it's kind of hard to see and it looks like it's lined with the dots and we're just gonna pull off perfect easy enough and there we are i found it curious that their website doesn't focus so much on the actual uh it focuses almost exclusively on their packaging and very little on the actual oil itself their their um their product they're trying to get you to consume uh but here it is and it does look fine that is some nice looking darker oil not as dark as some of the live resin i've seen out there but uh nice looking color nice consistency materials look pretty nice like that ceramic uh tip nice glass base and yeah looks like actually pretty decent materials all around let's get it on our battery here set the voltage at 3.3 ish and let's give it a try so here we go here is our first hit of our ocean cannabisco straw nana tasty it uh has those very strong nana e terpenes very sort of fruity and um uh yeah just a kind of a a sweeter tasting strain uh very delightful um i'm i don't necessarily doubt that this is live resin tastes like the strain there um i know live resin in terms of uh there have been some instances where companies have gotten in trouble recently for sort of deceptively labeling things uh live resin when they're not really uh that is a subject for a whole other video i don't know how to tell myself without having basically like a spectrometer um but uh i can tell you that this is still pretty quality oil uh whatever is in there and there's no reason to doubt you know they say it's live resin i'm sure it is okay well this is pretty quality oil and it's pretty strong i'm feeling it pretty uh pretty acutely after just a couple of hits there uh 84 thc so it is a high th c live resin which is nice taste is nice uh let me get another couple of hits in here i think this battery in particular has weaker draws than some i'm going to try turning up the voltage just a bit which don't necessarily do especially for live resin i'm not sure why but i've heard people say try to vape it on the lowest temperature uh you can but just to see if that'll help with the draws oh yeah there we go that helped quite a bit wow that is quite tasty quite potent let's get one more in here before we say goodbye for the moment yum wow ocean cannabis co uh this is a pretty good product i'm um more impressed than i thought i was gonna be uh i really you know i admire what they're trying to do with their packaging uh and the affordable price on this live resin especially for one that's as potent as it is uh makes this a pretty good value for a product um that uh you know the live regions usually come in that exuberant exuber oh i forgot how to say that word exorbitant exuberant no exorbitant [ __ ] i'm high [ __ ] 84 thc that right there guys is proof in the pudding the pretty the proof is in the pudding some kind of proof pudding situation it's all here uh big thumbs up from ocean cannabis co wasn't necessarily expecting the greatest things but uh really pleasantly surprised so far however like all of our wheats reviews we're going to review the whole thing all one gram here it'll probably take me about five days or so to get through it uh and once i do i'll come right back here and give you all of our wrap-up thoughts make sure that this straw nana is as fresh and tasty on the day we unpeeled it as the day we finished it that was never going to work but what will work is hopefully this for the next five days until then stay high stay healthy we'll see you soon goodbye hi guys welcome back to wheats it's been a little over four days since we started with ocean cannabis cos live resin straw nana this one gram cartridge you can see i've got a little bit of that live resin left in there not a whole lot it's actually hitting just fine i was just already out here at the ocean and i thought to myself what better time to finish our review uh our first half was really positive you guys remember i know i did really liked this stuff especially for the price and i also found their sort of recycling gimmick to work pretty well too or to uh to be um at least a a cool idea uh i'm not sure how it well it's sparing an execution but that idea of using ocean plastic as packaging is neat but the more important part is that the actual live resin is good stuff um and at that price i think it was what what did i say 55 something like that um not a bad price at all it might have been a little bit more for live resin which usually is like about 20 more or so than standard distillate so this is gonna be a big thumbs up for ocean cannabis co and their straw nana like uh pretty much everything there is to like about it um and i think maybe in the future we'll take another look at some of their products uh and then anytime guys we have one of these reviews that we like this much we like to give a little cherry on top dogs kicking up sand on my camera person as we speak how stoic is she any time we ever review that we like this much cherry on top i'm going to give you a perfectly perfectly paired cherry on top i don't know i hope i didn't mention this in the beginning the first half i might have if so that's okay because it's worth being brought up twice that is a twofer and the twofer is uh pbs's frontline documentary series all of them uh they're all amazing they come out with like 10 a year of all different kinds of topics but very specifically plastic wars from this year 2020 frontline documentary uh that is about plastic and plastics in the ocean and uh this sort of uh unbelievable fraud that is recycling plastic and how heartbreaking it all is uh but it's actually a wonderful documentary and has changed my views on plastics that is front lines pbs's front lines plastic boards something i highly recommend along with the ocean cannabis co live resin straw nana and that guys is gonna do for the cherry on top and the review efficient one today while we're out here at the ocean thank you so much to anybody who's made it this far until we see you for our next review that tractor says stay high more importantly stay healthy later you", "85-um3LmzVw": "vape that gets you a little bit more active hi friends this is clark from that high couple and i'm going to break down one of the biggest misconceptions regarding how to get high with cannabis most people believe that there's really only two directions to go whether it's like a sativa kind of uplifting or it's an indica and a couch bringing you down when in actuality there is a lot of different effects that cannabis and terpenes can have on your body so today i'm going to be covering six different types of highs the different terpenes that result in those specific types of highs today i've partnered with nevada's new mind body series vape line that has six different types of effects as well as breaking down the terpenes in each vape pod it's really great that they're disposable but they also have a recycling program very discreet very portable fits easily in the palm of your hand a little bit of like a silky rubber grip each vape pen comes with half a gram of oil which equals to about 200 hits per vape pen also flavored for each of these vape pins so you get a different flavor you get a different effect there's no accessories ready to go right out of the box cheers everyone oh okay starting with their fairy mind red vape what's really great is that this in one word is uplifting this is the kind of high that you would want to start your day with if you have a lot of work to get into whether it's emails whether it's even like talking with co-workers or just talking with clients and making sure that you really have to start your day on the right foot and the right momentum not only will they give you the same lift as a cup of coffee but it is tastier this is flavored with strawberry but with each hit i can tell that it really is there to kind of like lift me up and pet me up but let's say you've done your calls you've done your kind of mental work and you want a vape that gets you a little bit more active now we're moving into the mind dominant something that has a little bit more of energizingness to it if you want to start off your day with that morning hike that workout routine uh this mind dominant vape is definitely one to consider in a word i describe this vape as energizing and it is flavored with tangerine which i always kind of associate with just like starting off my day almost like a cup of orange juice like let's just get it going uh cheers i'd say the biggest differences between this high and the last one is that this one is a little bit more alert and speaking of orange it is tangerine flavored which more citrus flavors and then more like skunky og funky flavors with the like heavier uh like highs now that we've started with a lot of mind dominant highs let's move into something with a little bit more balance moving on to a high that has more balance and is perfect for anyone that is looking to get into some meditating into some yoga it definitely has more of a balance to it it is really great for someone that is at that like mid point of the day where you know you still have a second half to go but it's like you've already put in some work i feel like even just it being yellow and tropical flavored kind of gives me the right idea of like this is your kind of like not mid-afternoon siesta but i would say your mid-afternoon kind of like treat to yourself and also with each of these nevada vapes there's there's no button it's inhale only and you also have this light on the front so you know exactly when it's activated i love this video just like me and the boys also to quickly talk about some of the terpene differences the past two vapes were definitely more prominent in karyophiline which is a terpene that you're going to find in more hops and rosemary it tends to result in more of like an alerted kind of high whereas now as we get more into this kind of like mid-range of this high spectrum one of the terpenes that i'm seeing more is like mercy which is a terpene you can find in like mangoes and offers more of it like a calm even balanced tie but let's say you want to step away from some of the more cerebral effects of being high want to get to more of a body balance instead of a mind balance hey so with this green vape we are now officially moving into more of a like body focused kind of high i would say that this type of body balance high is definitely best when you're doing uh like some socializing um especially if you have any kind of like munchies oh man and this green one is limey flavor it's like it just took a hit of sprite or something since lime is my favorite flavor let's take a big rip and then move on to some more body dominant highs okay i am so happy that we are getting towards the end of this rainbow road of vapes because i'm starting to definitely feel more of the body heavy effects now we're moving into vape pods where i can like feel it in my toes um this is the kind of vape that you want to have in your pocket if you're doing any like netflix and chilling it's also really great for a treat yourself kind of day i love that this is blueberry flavored i smelt it as soon as i pulled it out of the box it does still have mercine as one of its predominant terpenes but it also has limonene mixed in there as well as the karyophiline and for the final effect this is for everyone that's at the end of the day they're just looking for sleepy body relief something just to knock you out wrapping up this rundown of six different effects that cannabis can have on you we are going with the full body effect classically that into couch that just like let's grow roots into our living room and just hold up because it's quarantined and we don't have any place to go in a word this high is relaxing this is great for anyone that is at the end of a long strenuous day and needs like a more full body relief like recovery and for anyone that has trouble getting to sleep this is definitely the high that you think of of oh i can actually smoke this right before bed and use this as a sleep aid it's this head to toe kind of high that's what is able to get people in that most like relaxing state in order to get them the best sleep and nevada doesn't make it super complicated i mean purple is great flavor and i'm really glad that we went in the order that we did because this is absolutely the vape to like put at the end of the journey because there's not really much that you want to do after you take one of these hits except just enjoy your night so cheers everyone oh that is such a nice sugary grape flavor to it man oh yeah that is absolutely the treat to any day and hopefully everyone watching now understands that there is a lot more to getting high than just up and down there's mind body dominant and a big shout out to nevada for making it so easy to understand how you can get high six different ways with six totally different awesome flavored vape pens and if you want to see more cannabis product reviews like this in the future all you have to do

about probably two weeks a little bit over two weeks maybe that was the last time I have smoked weed I haven't touched a blood of join edible a cart anything since that video so this is gonna be a fun one this is gonna be a great one um the reason I was gone is I had a lot of school I had to do some I was working I'm still working now but I was I was getting a lot of support on the last videos I didn't think I was planning on smoking anymore or doing any more videos but like I said there was a ton of support I'm at like 47 subscribers you guys are killing it getting a lot of feedback on some of the videos sounds like I can't just end it there I gotta keep going so yeah we're back with another cart today's car it's gonna be an indica that's gonna be God's God's gift so if you guys are excited let me know in the comments drop a like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] these channels 4:18 over 18 plus 18 whatever however you want to say 18 plus if you're under 18 well [ __ ] you can't be here but you know how am I supposed to know you probably chillin right now you little minors um anyway so right here is like I said it's an indica select elite so y'all know it's gonna be fire already and since I haven't smoked in two weeks I'm about to get dumb blasted so I'm pretty excited uh the THC is running in at ninety point four five percent here which is pretty dang insane right there lets you look at the blocks for a second and I won't focus so you can't read it but there you go it says here it's supposed to tape tastes like grape sweet and earthy so that's cool and it's supposed to give you a relaxed happy euphoric feeling so that's cool they say it right there on the box I don't have planned videos for the next few we got two of them right here if you know their colors you know whether they're in because the TVs are hybrids its blah blah blah those will be coming here pretty soon um yeah so like I said it's been a minute so might seem like a little weird of a review I'm kind of trying to get back into it trying to think of how how I did it so let's just uh let's go ahead and pop this bad boy open here ah [ __ ] so actually let me tell you because I always see hey seam reviews on whatever it is and not knowing the price so the dispensary I went to was Metro meds I here in Phoenix Arizona let's see this select God gift cart right here I paid $80 for this but it was a buy one get one basically so to 480 it wasn't a biome but they always do two for 80 deals so yeah so I got this and then I got another full gram for 80 bucks so 40 bucks each basically and then I got a eighty sativa yeah well I'll tell you guys now I got a higher no that's anyway I got a hybrid half gram here which I don't think I I might have reviewed a hybrid I don't quite remember I'll have to go back and look at those um I just was charging this pen a little bit it wasn't getting full charge and I charged it for like 10 20 minutes so I don't know that's alright though uh well let's go ahead and pop this bad boy open oh no I remember you guys you kind of got to open it from the bottom these parts because if there's some long ass fingers to get to the top for some reason and poke it out stupid ass blocks and [ __ ] blah blah yeah maybe not you know this box isn't even childproof and I can't even get through it Jesus okay there we go there we go wow it's been a minute since I have touched a cart let alone a full gram cart that is one big [ __ ] that's good okay just real quick I wanted to say this cuz I was thinking about it if I don't have a video in the next few days it's because it's gonna be hard for me to it's gonna take a minute for me to get adjusted and smoke a full gram pretty fast so I'm not gonna quit again it's just gonna take a minute for me to get this done and then put out a new one so [ __ ] I'm very excited because I mean I know it's have to give me like the craziest high in the world but hopefully it should smack me pretty goddamn well um let's go ahead and screw it on the dr. zodiacs chew Moonrock clear battery there hi you already know I like that little fine point tip better than those round ones because they get less dirty well I told you guys the type of car brand price dispensary I don't think I told you guys about everything let's uh oh except for the liquids you already know peace tea still haven't sponsored me that's okay they're gonna one day don't worry pop that open go ahead take a sip hydration break yep hell yeah man hell yeah all right if you guys are smoking on anything in the what what I guess you guys are smoking on anything let me know down in the comments I'm always excited to know what y'all smoking oh by the way if you hear any random noises like squeaky toys I brought a foster dog home again that the owners were dog [ __ ] that's another story maybe I'll explain that at one point but those are what those noises are so cheers guys oh [ __ ] you oh yeah that's that's definitely a snack you're right on the first like inhale God dang that is hole [ __ ] I definitely get that earthy feel for your version dammit dammit weird though I'm definitely feeling it already like I just thought that's weird that's weird how it hits god damn well I already like it says it's supposed to taste sweet / creepy and earthy the only thing I'm really getting out of it is is that earthy taste not getting really anything sweet there maybe I'm you know like that much sweetness that's about it so yeah you know that's alright that's alright you're not usually in the cards for for taste that's

flowers just keep getting better and better and better and this is the stash bud of number 31 and i'm really kind of sad when the stash bud is big because when the stash bud is big that means i use less of that flour and i hate to bust up a beautiful bud like this but anyway we're gonna check this out in the end i'm gonna load one more scoop of this unknown bud into vapor cup straw i've already got two in there this makes three and in the end i'm gonna stick this down into the vapor cup and i'm going to enjoy it with everybody it's going to be good time so today like i said we're going to talk about number 40 through 31 so let's get right into it coming in at number 40 and my 40 most favorite strain out of the top 100 strains in la is something from humpball county indoor called colombian cookies there you go and this is sativa it's got 20 thc i got this at the buds and roses and you wouldn't think colombian cookies would be so good but it is really good really good smells kind of like a jack herrera something like that but it's really really uh happy uh euphoric no couch lock and it was my 40th favorite strain that i tried uh out of 1500 strains it's not just unbelievable so to get to number 40 say 40 is not good oh yeah it is this flower will stone you to the bones but we're moving up to even more euphoric and heavier flower coming in at number 39 we have something from lumpy's and lumpy's got lower people like lumpy and lumpy's apple fritter i got this down at the connected uh in long beach this flower has 28 th hybrid and this is lumpy's apple fritter and i was very very lucky i happened to go down there for something else and lumpy's was on the shelf i'm like and i grabbed it and it was good it was good enough to get number 39 out of the top 100 flowers in la like i said 1500 flowers this is a good one good job lumpy but we're moving up to even better flower and then coming in at number 38 from garrison lane we have something called billy kimber og and this flower has 28 thc it's an indica and this one the batches have been kind of some stronger than others uh but for me i've been lucky i got good batches it was a good flower and it was good enough to get number 38 on the top 100 but we're moving up to even better flowers condiment coming in at number 37 we see something from cana teak called blueberry cruffin and this flower was higher up on the list in the past but over time flowers become less good that's just how it is and this flower has two but it's still good enough to get number 37. this flower blueberry cruffin by cana teak it tastes like a blueberry muffin doesn't taste like a blueberry it tastes like a blueberry muffin cooking light and wonderful it's got 27 percent thc's in indica and if you have vapor cup you got to get yourself some of this blueberry cruffin it is through the roof good really good and like i said good enough to get number 37 but we're moving up to even better flour coming in at number 36 we have something from cookies called berry pie and berry pie you wouldn't think by looking at a piece of pie on this blue bag this flower would be so good but it's really good it's got 26 thc it's a hybrid and this flower will stone you to the bone it is strong very strong from vapor cup and uh i would say i liked it so if you like cookies and you haven't tried berry pie berry pie is one of the ones that cookies that's another got so many strains how do you know which one to pick grab berry pie if you haven't tried it's a good one number 36 but we're moving on up to even more strong and euphoric flower coming in at number 35 we have something from alien labs called sharbassio and this flower's good i got it at buds and roses this flower's got 23 thc and it's a hybrid and i like this flower this flower was one of the very first alien labs strains that i was able to get and i was like oh this is good and it made me want to buy more alien labs this is a good one and it was my 35th favorite flower here in la out of the top 100 uh shabasio number 35 but we're moving up to even stronger flower yay coming in at number 34 we have a flower from insane called insane og and this is one of the best three strains from insane it's a good one this flower has 31 percent thc but you got to watch insane they have a lot of times that thc is not stable they'll have a really good flower like california cherry he's got 30 thc and then they brought the flower back to next time with 16 so when i do these reviews look at the thc that i'm recommending if it's like half that ain't the same flower pass on that flower but insane has good flowers and insane og is one of their better flowers and this flower was number 34 out of my top 100 flowers here in los angeles but we're moving up to even better flower coming in at number 33 we have another flower by insane can imagine back to back but this one is even better and it's called insane christmas lights this flower is heavy it's got uh uh 22 thc and i would have never picked this this was a tip flower it's got a little star on the top of the tree and this flower was really good and i've recommended it to a lot of people that said what should i get i said you know what get insane christmas lights it's really good right now and it is a good one it was my 33rd favorite uh flower from insane and this got top dog for insane out of this list can you imagine christmas lights if you want to try the best of insane here's your guy right here christmas lights so coming in at number 32 we have something called northern brights by gas house and this flower has 24 percent thc and it's in indica and it's from big house and i'm telling you big al's gas house really has great flour a lot of people say they can't find it around it shows up around here once in a while and you can see i review a lot of it because it's consistently good and this flower was heavy and this flower greened me out that's why i got number 32. if i had more opportunities to buy it i might like it more i only had that one opportunity and so you know it is what it is i liked it and we're going to move on to number 31 before we do that we're going to stick this straw down into the vapor cup and we're going to talk about this one butt again so this bud is from the backpack boys anyone watching the video you think you know what it is by the look huh what do you think it is what do you think it is huh any guesses this is horchata and this was one of those flowers that people got it before i did but finally it showed up and it's backpack boys horchata and you can see here is the bag this flower has 29 thc it's an indica i got it at uh dr green thumbs and it says by five points i guess that's the people that cultivate it and backpack boys has a lot of play people like backpack boys they like the brand they like the flower and when i did my multi-strain review this was the top dog is horchata and for me horchata by backpack boys was my 31st favorite flower of all the flowers i tried out of 1500 flowers to get 31 is doing pretty good like someone could say i want number one come on we're cherry picking the very best flowers from every

wanted to pop on here and talk about something I get asked about a lot but I don't really think matters so let's get into it we are going to be talking about indicas and sativas if for some reason you were a cannabis enthusiast and you do not know that there are strain categories called a mocoso Teva and a hybrid which is the combination of different strains I don't know where you've been but they are classified this way for a couple of different reasons so brief overview of each classification before I explain to you why I don't think any of them matter sativas are supposedly the creative stimulating energetic head-high very active and creative strains so you've got this category of sativas and then all of these different strains that fall underneath this category and because would be the opposite side of the spectrum when it comes to cannabis strains it would include things that are like sedated hunger appetite inducing couch lock effect very body high relaxing chill the chill stoner experience that you would kind of assume or that people always assumed cannabis gave them and then you have the hybrids of the world a hybrid can be the combination of a sativa and indica and can be the combination of two different indicas basically it's a mix it's been bred with something that was outside of its classification the reason I am not dedicating an extremely long and elaborate video to this is because I do not really believe that the sativa and indica and hybrid classifications me and Jack anymore and that's not just me it's pretty standard to use the turns loosely but to educate around how they don't really matter the illegal market of cannabis the black market if you will the origins of cannabis involve everybody growing wheat at home some people got really good at it read different cannabis strains together and that created hybrids what I mean by this is if you have a sativa that gets you really really messed up so super high the intoxication effects are awesome and where you want them to be but the risk for anxiety and paranoia and the negative effects of cannabis are also really high pairing it with an indica that is very calming and soothing and sedate of and physical as opposed to a head high you would hope that the result the hybrid that you would get from these two plants would embody the best of both of them so you would still get extremely intoxicated have some energy be able to go out and go on a hike or be creative and really use this high while avoiding some of the negative traits that come from over intoxication or sativa dominant strains and have a bit more grounding in your body and maybe a little less paranoia or anxiety and that would come from the indica plant this is the goal of breeding this is basically why hybrids existed and it all sounds fine and dandy besides the fact that that's very hard to track and record because of many reasons we back in the day had a thing was called Pure Land race strains where it was just a pure sativa plant just like you have a daisy that is a daisy it's not a daisy hybrid it's a daisy cannabis is very much the same you have a plant that is called girl stick out cookies and it was a Girl Scout cookie plant it's a horrible example because I'm pretty sure Girl Scout cookies was a hybrid but you get what I'm saying there were cannabis plans that were specific strains and had classifications and types these types and classifications were given based off of the effects of using the plant so again they were subjective to human error and individual twists because not everybody and no person reacts the same way to even the same strain so there is a lot of guesswork behind this classification system and we totally botched it because it was entirely underground breeding that was occurring so that means there was no tracking of what plants there was no testing prior because the testing equipment didn't exist yet we just bred them to get the results we wanted which is very smart and it worked created different hybrids that took the best of both of the plants you were blending together and now we have a plethora of different experiences that can be used and tailored for your experience and what you're looking for but it also means that classifying things as a strict indica or sativa or a hybrid is basically [ __ ] there is not a lot of warrant behind using those classifications anymore however we haven't developed a better system yet I am a thorough believer and not complaining about something unless if you have a solution that you can bring to the table or a suggestion to make that situation better and there's an entire cannabis industry in Canada who is trying to find better ways right now to classify cannabis than sativa and indica or hybrids we have tried in the legal industry to use things like terpenes to better predict the experiences that you're going to be receiving from a specific strain if you don't know what a terpene is there's a video left right oops up here there's a video I will link up here where I cover what terpenes are but using this specific terpene profile to better kind of guess and predict the cannabis strains effects is great in theory there's a lot of logistic issues behind that because first of all not every strain out there is legal or grown legal produced legally so there's still that to consider we also don't have enough labs in the world that can test cannabis accurately and legally for its terpene profile so it's basically not readily available for everybody and it's expensive once you actually get those logistics out of the way the science behind being able to classify hundreds and thousands of different plans based off of a terpene profile into three categories is a feat in and of itself you might have a strain that is high in the terpene limonene and assume that it's a sativa dominant or a strain that's high in line a little and assumed that it is a indica dominant there is so many different terpenes such a diverse profile on each plant each plant even if it is the same strain can have different quantities of the individual terpene so obviously it's extremely difficult to find a distinct recognizable terpene profile that are classified as indicas my best suggestion and the direction that I know the legal market has gone into is saying something like sativa dominant I probably slipped up and said it in this video already without explaining but sativa dominant strains would be a strain that would pull closer to Sistema effects it is not a clear box classification if anyone says a cannabis strain is indica like a landrace indica I don't want to call him a liar but it's pretty hard to believe that any strain nowadays especially after the movement that cannabis has gone through it is a very very very very unlikely that the strain they're talking about is a pure indica or a pure sativa or pure anything there's just been so much breeding that it's unlikely to say the least not calling you a liar I'm just saying now the cannabis industry has definitely started using terms like sativa dominant in a condiment or a sativa dominant hybrid for example this is just - I think showcase the uncertainty behind this classification you can assume this strain will pull towards an indica experience if it's called an indica dominant strain now there are articles online and people out there saying that that they've figured out the terpene profiles for all being because and they're a lot closer now than they ever have been but I would highly suggest paying close attention to the strains that you enjoy if you're buying them legally which I know is more expensive and there's a whole other video I get it but if you are purchasing it legally the benefit is is you do get to know the true peein profile if you were to keep something called a strain journal where you record these strains and the effects that you like and don't like from a specific strain through the process of elimination and journaling and paying close attention to your own highs you will be able to start to realize that you like strains that have certain terpenes in them this is a lot of work if you don't really care that much I wouldn't suggest doing it but if you're using cannabis at all for the medical benefits of it this is a great option for you to tailor your medicine specifically to you terpenes are the building blocks of the experience you will have on a cannabis string if you know if you like a certain terpene or not or the effects it has on you that's a huge leg up in being able to predict and understand the experience you're about to have and the medical benefits you could get from a string please be aware when you're purchasing cannabis whether it be legally or illegally which I'm not allowed to encourage you that don't encourage it's important to realize that this the sativa and indica and hybrid classifications are general guidelines and they work very well as general guidelines but if you are new to cannabis a big old word of caution extremes on both sides of these strains like a very very heavy indica or a very very intense sativa can give you results that you might not want starting with a hybrid is usually a good idea because the intention of hybrids was originally to create a more mediated level experience so if you're new try a hybrid first we didn't touch on a whole other new classification of cannabis which would be CBD dominant strains now I will do a whole separate video on CBD dominant strains because CBD is a massive trend right now and it deserves its own conversation but yes keep in mind that CBD dominant strains can still be an indica forward or a sativa forward experience they are definitely hybrids because they are bred to have high levels of CBD in them specifically but that being said you would still have to breed a specific combination of plants that would either be sativa or indica or different hybrids so there is still that component to the organic matter well guys that's my rant about the cannabis world industry when it comes to sativas and indicas it's a quick video it's a short video and it's but let me know in the comments below if you want me to elaborate more on the sativa and indica strains themselves I can give you some examples maybe talk about the origins of them we didn't get into the actual biological differences and difference in appearance between the strain categories because unless if you're growing you might not really find that interesting but let me know what you need to know much love my friends and please feel free to hit that like button and subscribe so you can stay up to date on my cannabis rants and such I did start a new moon series the other day so if that is something you're interested in check out the playlist I will link it again up here and I hope you have the raddest day remember you can do absolutely anything because you are badass", "ci9rQiP6gS4": "[Music] I'll just start about I by asking them you know what do you normally get or are you a flower person do you do cartridges do you come do concentrates because that's gonna help me determine what area to start with so it's usually a lot easier with flour most people usually do and usually anything that has a high again a higher concentration of CBD that's gonna be more on the body relaxed for example like my mother-in-law well she had something that was a high CBD she has really bad anxiety but it was a sativa and so she ended up getting more paranoid and so it slowed her thought processes down but then she she struggled with the thoughts that she was having and getting more anxious so it's it's finding that right balance so I'll walk them through you know we have this that's a sativa we have this that's an indica are you looking to kind of meet in the middle do you want to feel awake do you want it to put you out slow down your thoughts and hope you go to sleep so we'll just break it down in that way and then just kind of move forward from there I'll show them a couple of different products that we have and we also have this cool little light too so people can open it you know we can bring anything down and show them what it is so they can physically see it and determine if that's something that looks good to them and then I'll even have them smell it because if it's if you smell it and it agrees with your nose it usually means it'll agree with your body that's pretty across-the-board everybody kind of works that way and then that's it just close it out [Music]", "-0eHHiBAYAU": "the five best Canada strains for beginners it is not easy to definitively state which are the five best cannabis strains because there are just too many variables beyond personal preference for flavor and strength you have to take into account levels of CBD and THC additionally you need to consider yields speed of growth and type of environment best suited to any particular cannabis plant do you want to grow your plants indoors or outdoors so we have created a selection of videos for you including the five strongest THC and CBD strains the five fastest growing strains and the five highest yielding strains we then decided to create a video of the five easiest ones to grow if you are a relative beginner at number five on the list we have cynics which provides a high yield of THC at 22 percent the great advantage of this plant is that it has a natural resistance to mold and mildew so there's a bit more room for beginners mistakes at number four there is Dutch treat which has its roots excuse the pun embedded in the soil of Amsterdam it is a great indica dominant plant which makes it easy to grow indoors which provides high yields our third plant on the list is the Blue Dream which is one of our most popular seeds for beginners it's resistance to powdery mildew and root rot makes it a firm favorite pass number two and it was a close run race we have royal Queens easy bud we like this one as its autoflowering you can harvest the plant in only eight to nine weeks after germination and yields are good the best thing about easy bud is the size of the plant which is ideal for those of you who want to keep your plants discreetly tucked away in first place we have formula one Auto which as its name suggests is a fast developer which will flower within six weeks of germination it can be grown indoors or outdoors and reaches a manageable maximum height of 90 centimetres for me the one seeds are also a great price so any mistakes won't be too costly if you are legally allowed to grow cannabis plants let us know which ones you start out with and any you would recommend to beginners in the comments section below and of course if you enjoyed this video make sure to subscribe to our Channel so you too can become a cannabis expert", "PL3GwtD0orY": "hey everyone welcome back to greenbox the weed unboxing channel today we've got some simple stash sativa it has 15 thc and less than point 10 cbd and this was packaged on june 29th 2020 and then this is 5 grams okay [Music] so first look and then yeah like i said this is supposed to be five grams i do like the square containers for like stacking however getting your weed out of the container can be kind of a pain in the ass five grams exactly oh sorry you can't see five grams so looking at the bud it's a little bit on the dry side but it's like i wouldn't say it's too dry i don't think we'll have to see when it busts up how that turns out it's got a decent amount of hairs on it though and then yeah this is 15 thc you can see a bit of a coating on the nugs not quite as much as our usual 20 but you can still see nice and fuzzy not overly spongy that's why i think it might be a good good moisture like kind of crumbly but not fall apart crumbly and it's got like a sweet skunky smell more sweet than skunky though and then for like sorry i just got cut off there um but yeah for leaf color i would say like uh on the light end of medium green so it is a little bit drier than i thought it did seem a little bit more spongy but it's not like too too dry still a fair amount of crystal and decent amount of hairs so simple stash sativa is more of a productive happy high the bud in this container was a little bit on the dry side but it wasn't too dry it was a bit lower of a thc percentage than what we normally get so i did find it to be a little bit more mild but i think it'd be fine if you had a little bit lower of tolerance than i do the close-ups do show a pretty good coating of crystal over the nugs and you do see quite a bit of hairs like throughout as well i mentioned when we were like looking at the nugs before the close-ups uh there was quite a few clusters of hairs throughout these buds um but yeah if you've tried this drain let us know in the comments below how your experience was like and subscribe and we'll see you next time

guys this one is recalling please don't", "1cxl30GttL8": "I'm dr. Kelly King I'm with relief MD and today I want to talk to you about sativa and indica I run relief md here and i see patients every day that come in and as we go through our evaluation one of the things i want them to come away with is a good idea of what they're doing and and the medicine that they'll be taking so we start with sativa indica and many people don't know that there is a third cannabis called ruderalis so i used this chart to tell them about the cannabis and tell them the differences between sativa indica and the different strains of the plant so sativa is a tall lanky branched plant I call it the super model of cannabis because it's tall and it's as narrow leaves and it also has a high level of THC sativa is responsible for the cerebral and energetic effects of cannabis it is a daytime strain of cannabis it's a daytime medication if you will there on this chart you can see the different types of sativa you can have the the full sativa which would be something like a Sour Diesel but many of you may already know these names or may have heard of these names and these are real names these are names that the cultivators out west originally gave these strains as they were creating them so there's fire haze there's Lionheart there's Malawi gold now this chart is not a full representation of all the strains that are out there there are many many many strains but these are some of the main strains that you may encounter side effects of sativa included anxiety hallucinations and these are in very high potency strains so what what I would like to caution you is if you have a sativa that is a pure sativa you want to be careful with that THC content because it can induce some anxiety I generally point patients toward a leaner sativa so that is a sativa that will have a little bit more indica and as you may notice or as your experience may have taught you your you brat you tend to gravitate towards the lina the leaner sativa anyway this is why something like Girl Scout cookies is so important because it is a lean sativa so you don't have as much of the anxiety and the hallucinations and it's more of a balanced it's more of a balanced sativa then we come to indica indica is what is the strain that is responsible for the relaxed feeling the body buzz you may have heard indica and the couch so an indica or pure indica is going to give you a very relaxed feeling great great strain for nighttime use okay you want to be using an indica examples of names for different indicas would be something that most indicas are purple and we'll get into why they're purple in a minute but purple Buddha silver blue is an indica mr. nice is an indica many of you may have gone to one of the dispensaries here locally they have an indica called nine pound hammer okay indicas really really help you sleep again if you get a pure indica you are going to have some of those pure side-effects as well like couch look okay so you want to be careful number one to try to avoid end because your time use number two probably gravitate more towards the lien or indica for some of the same reasons I told you about the sativa the lean in because we'll still give you the relaxing effect without giving you that that that real stoner Cheech and Chong feeling okay that's that's probably that was probably a pure indica if any of you ever have heard about Cheech and Chong I'm probably dating myself and then there's the even split we even splits just just what it says it's a hybrid it's a hybrid of the two that is a good daytime or nighttime strain and if you look at this chart again an even split would be these blue and white so Kim dog is a good even split purple trainwreck is a good even split now let's talk about why there are so many names when it comes to sativa and indica many of my patients will come to me and say oh they gave me a sativa oh they gave me an indica well I want to know what why what you got you know did you get the gorilla glue did you get the Sour Diesel did you get the strawberry sherbert because not all sativas and indicas are created equal and you may have found even in your own experience that you like a particular sativa more than you like another petite sativa you like a particular indica more than you like another indica so if you have noticed here in Florida a lot of times you'll go to the dispensaries and you they will have run out of things partly because the vertical distribution of the the way the dispensaries are set up but if they run out of the things that you like they'll try to sell you another type of sativa be careful about that because you may like a certain sativa because of the cultivars within that sativa and what I mean by that is it's sativas and indicas all have terpenes they all have a particular Terp profile that is particular to that that that strain so you may have a sativa that may have more limonene in it that may have more mersin in it which which gives it its characteristics if you've never heard of terpenes terpenes are what are in essential oils terpenes give plants in general their smell terpenes give it their taste but terpenes also give that plant its characteristics so if you're familiar with the essential oil lavender for example lavender is full of lynn Ahlul so you use an essential oil like the lavender to be relaxing to be calm and and it's the same thing in indica indicas tend to have a lot of Lin Ahlul in them which is why they tend to be purple if you've ever if you've ever seen the lavender plant it's it's named because of its color and so that's just an example limonene is another terpene lemons are going to be found and a lot of times in sativas which again is why you see lemons and lemons and citrus plants lemons the essential oil lemon and the terpene limonene is uplifting its cerebral it's energetic so this is why you'll find a lot of limonene in the sativas depending on how the plant was grown depending on the environment of the plant depending on the lighting depending on the water depending on on on so many things during the growth phase of that particular cannabis strain is what makes it a trainwreck versus a Girl Scout cookies it's it's how these terpenes and how these flavonoids all come together to create the effect that that particular strain gives that is what we call the entourage effect [Music]", "ktNN_OGa1wU": "how's everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we got a good one for you today today we're going to be doing a little bit of a review on some mammoth labs LA wedding cake crossed with sherbert OG these are some Terp diamonds done by mammoth labs very high quality concentrate this is coming out with a total THC a percentage of 89.9% this is a high-quality concentrate made from good flour with no pesticide used in the growing process this is a hybrid I'm really looking forward to it all right without any further ado alright so here it is this is your mammoth slabs la wedding cake cross with sherbert oh gee I love the rainbow reflective logo they have here it's got a beaker turned upside down dripping oil everywhere absolutely amazing pure cannabis concentrate little hybrid seal sticker right there that you know there's been broken open with all that you think they have put a little more time and effort into meeting these edges up you know what I'm saying look at this backside that hole right there I mean it's made in the USA of course it's from Washington State has to be sold and produced in Washington State this is unlawful outside Washington State but you see right there that step that right there when you put this kind of money into your packaging you want to try to want to try to nail the seams all right that being said let's get this thing open all right the magic does its job and there it is all right that is some very nice-looking extract pop the lid off this is a hard plastic lid much harder than the softer silicone of some other products this is the new farm so I'm being a little bit picky at it has a very nice earthy aroma to it I'm not getting much of the wedding cake but a little bit of the funk from the sherbert alright that is some very nice-looking stuff all right the only a very turbid crystalline in structure a nice little rock right there all right well this has a some numbers here looking at about eighty percent THC THC am eighty nine point nine but total cannabinoids of eighty point eight for no pesticides were used in making this this was extracted with pho pho alright grow browse where the producer and the processor all right well I'm excited about this one and I'm looking forward to trying it out let's get this topside see we've got to work with so here we are back on top with our mammoth labs la wedding-cake cross with sherbert OG I am really excited about this this is the first time I'll be trying this product there are a new vendor to our store and I always get excited whenever I get to try something new especially something that has a lineage like wedding cake and sherbert two of my all-time top strains that being said you saw when it was down there this has extremely nice crystalline structure has a very wet Terp appearance and this is running a THC a percentage of 89.9% very nice no oh let's get a good smell on this too we're working with oh very nice ah has has has gone to a a very very subtle skunk mixed with a little bit of wood kind of an oakiness kind of a skunky funky oakiness but on the high end you can taste just a little bit of that would be the sherbert that funk that you're smelling there from the top lid you get just a little bit of a almost lemon but really a vanilla just a hint that's the wedding cake very complex but it is actually it is nice it's there both of those should come out really well in the in the innovate very nice light color extremely crystalline structure it's not the easiest to work with if you don't have a scoop but I think everything else is gonna make up for that let's try this out Cheers mammoth labs wedding cake crust with server doji turf diamonds very smooth hmm with that second one that wedding cake really comes out a lot the funk it book rules it over right in the beginning get a conservative a ver then on the exhale went on the reflection kind of a little bit of sweetness very nice um well this it's a very complex product but they did it very well um these guys really got some nice packaging they got some nice product I hope they stick around for a while oh I look forward to trying some of the other stuff that's for sure hmm well you guys have an absolutely beautiful day thank you so much for tuning in looking forward to seeing you next time this has been John was easy kind of source peace how's everybody doing this is John with CNC connoisseurs I'm a got a good one for you today alright well today we're gonna be doing an opening up some [ __ ] and I don't know what the [ __ ] it is Terp diamonds CBD camera it's a 2.84 the total THC a of 89.9%", "VkWO2BFFJy0": "how's everybody doing this is John let's see sors and we've got a good one for you today alright well today we're going to be discussing one of the most recent of eight bands the one here in Washington State and some ways to get around it if you do vape THC concentrates well we have here in front of us this is like it says this is distillate this is THC distillate this is watermelon flavored champagne Kush this is one gram we're looking at a THC of abrupt 78% the total of cannabinoids of 84% all right now what we have here is 1 2 3 4 5 5 grams of concentrates this is all dis little strawberry lemon-aid pineapple watermelon pineapple watermelon now what we're going to do is we're going to show you some of the workarounds seeing as how you can no longer buy a flavored cartridge in Washington State now you used to be able to just buy a cartridge much like this that is already filled with distillate at the local shop now this particular cartridge is a si sell by Jupiter research very high quality cartridge you could normally go down to the store buy one of these full of concentrate and and you'd be set well recently our governor decided that due to children vaping and some of the deaths related to vitamin E additives and THC cartridges he's removing all flavored THC distillate cartridges from the market well seeing as how he's done that we no longer have access to high quality cartridges with good quality distillate in them I feel that is not a positive thing well it also opens up the market for black markets products to enter and people to try using them instead of the much more safe legal methods as such I decided to come up and show you a couple of the methods that I'm going to use to stay safe whenever I vape now this distillate is still available it will not be marketed as a vape distillate it will be marketed I do believe as an edible that is the way they can get around this it is watermelon flavored distillate nowhere on it doesn't say that you should smoke it or that you should vape it it is technically watermelon flavored distillate and as such should be eaten okay that makes sense very nice the same can be said for the pineapple the strawberry lemonade all the different flavors so you can go down to the store and you can buy these one thing they will not come with this nifty little green tip because this is specifically used to fill up a cartridge so you will not have access to one of these that's fine now if you have any of these old cartridges that you got when they were full if you got a high quality C cell cartridge much as this one and it does not have the metal band across the top here then you should be able to unscrew the top and refill the cartridge with distillate I will show you how to do that as option number one now that will be option number one refilling a standard C cell cartridge I do not recommend filling them more than three times one two three that means you get it and it's full you refill it and you smoke it you refill it and you smoke it that should be it if you do it again it's on you that's the way I say it that is one gram we will refill in a C cell cartridge this is a company called unite vape where then is the email address that is their website that is their phone number unite vape where makes a a couple of different vape products this is one of them this is the all-in-one Evie one vape in this specific pin has a battery and a cartridge attached to it it's very nice it's one use disposable it's metal very high quality you unscrew this mouthpiece you fill it up with one half gram of oil much the same as you would do with that that's our second method now the third method we are going to use this is a pod system this is from eye crusher this particular pod system is called the Zen what this does is this is utilizes a battery with a different pod to refill to utilize to smoke with here is the pin with no cartridge in it here is the cartridge before it is filled now this is a one-gram cartridge I will be filling it up placing the lid on it and showing you how this operates now the fourth method that I will be utilizing is from a company called transferring transferring vapes transferring vapes manufactures a very different multitude of cartridges we believe will be utilizing some of their 810 cartridges this has its AIT's right here this is an 810 half milliliter with 2 millimeter inlet holes 1.6 ohm coil as you can see the size of those holes on that are very large for a thick distillate now I will be pairing that up with one of their batteries this one's pretty neat it operates on touch one two three four five one two three one two three one two three four five so that's kind of neat well without any further ado let's get right into it first things first this is the Zen cartridge or pod right here this particular unit utilizes a data cable I forget the name of the particular data cable comes in a very nice box my cursor VAP different this is the cord that they are utilizing for charging this particular unit [Music] now first things first you pick a distillate I'm going to pick watermelon open up your distillate now you want to get a dispensing tip apply it to your syringe because you definitely want to be able to accurately dispense your product now [Music] [Music] [Music] now I'm not overly showing you the full way to fill this up yeah I've got that on some of my other videos what I'm doing here as I'm just trying to show you some of the different methods that you can use to still vape after this vape ban all right now that is not the cleanest method that I've ever used to fill one of these sons of [ __ ] up but as you can see the hole in the middle is clear my above the outside edge is just like that put that plug right in there this is the top it squeezes right down and then clicks just like that that is one gram of watermelon flavored distillate in these in I don't know if you can hear that or not but is this is magnetically operated and when it connects there is a vibration allow you to know you have successfully connected it all right well there we go that is one done right there that method right there works quite well you should be like I said you should be able to order some of these I crusher Tom I crusher dot-com they different if this seems like something that you like this method right here these pods are purchasable we'll let that sit for just a little bit and we'll see how that turns out after after a bit we'll we'll give that a hit next up this one here is always a very popular method reusing an old cartridge okay there is definitely 100% nothing wrong with reusing an old cartridge as long as the cartridge is a high quality cartridge and it's one that you think works well now as such we're going to take some pineapple and we're going to fill up this C cell with it this already has some oil in it but not very much so shouldn't be too much of an issue filling this thing up alright let's open this thing up and we will get right on it all right so here it is now I would like everyone to know just so there's no confusion I uh I warm up all of my distillate before you see it hit the screen so I just turned the camera back on after warming up this distillate and that's why that bubble moves right like that because I'm about to refill a cart with it and I don't want to be here for a half an hour I never put additives in my distillate I don't use this lip that has additives in it distant need additives put into it and that's about all I can fit down in that son of a [ __ ] because it needs to uh just settle down in there which it will slowly over time in order to see it starting to so we'll set that sit there for just a minute that's number two refilling a standard cartridge this is the all-in-one I'm extremely happy with the all-in-one so far they work really good in my opinion these two here are both half grammars I'm going to be filling them up with some strawberry lemonade here so like I said the strawberry lemonade I'll be utilizing it to fill it up with and let's get this ready all right here we go once again we have this strawberry lemonade right here put the tip on tine there down take the lid off of this would be the transferring a ten cartridge with the two millimeter holes and that sumbitch is cracked right there he sits of it he just cracked that glass cartridge just [ __ ] cracked right there so [Music] that's uses his [ __ ] tits right there very very nice high quality you can tell why that shafts that big I have no idea as you can see it clearly does not have to be [Music] [Music] [Music] now we let that settle down in there a little bit all right [Music] put that lid way back on there [Music] [Music] let that sit there for a little bit so here we go this is the transferring cartridge a 10 all right they have a trans brain all right well now let's let this settle on down in there see what we got all right so here we are back first things first what we have here is four different methods for vaping THC distillate now whenever you get THC distillate and you put it in one of these pens you need to understand you probably won't be getting it back so if you put it in a bad cartridge you may lose that distillate and that stuff's not cheap it's one of the reasons I do this now first things first if you have a C cell cartridge that already had oil in it and the top screws off and you can just put more oil into it well I got to tell you that method does work all right now you will be tasting whatever flavor you had in here before and you will never really get a good clean flavor out of this because you already used it plus the coil has already burnt up a lot of oil that may have a burnt flavor to it it is what it is this one right here this is from the United Way of this is the Evie all-in-one pen very very nice here is their contact information now this is a quite quite nice pen I like this quite a bit it would like I says 400 million power battery ceramic coil very nice now this one right here you put your oil into it you screw the lid onto it and then you hit it that's it cut-and-dried very easy 1/2 gram capacity you buy it you fill it you smoke it you're done just like that very very nice all right this right here is the eye crushers in this takes a full gram just drop it right on in there the vibrates let you know what's working has variable voltage functions on the bottom of this button very nice but this is also just a hit and go [Music] this one actually has very nice flavor it's very user friendly the mouthpiece is long and cinder I haven't had a single problem with this one yet and I have used it quite a bit I would definitely say if you do like the square boxy style pod systems this one is a full gram and it is it isn't too bad so last but not least we have the trans spring right here this is another company that does different cartridges and this one right here I've hit this pin a couple different times then it works it works just fine this one that's a little harsh this one's actually quite a bit harsh I'm not sure why I looked at the voltages online and it says the Green is the lowest and as you can see right there it is green so I'm not really sure why it is as harsh as it is but there you have it Tran spring like I said transferring makes many different sized cartridges one grams half grams a couple different style batteries but I've never really honestly had very good luck with the transferring brand the C sell brand cartridges a big fan of those there is a link in the description if you would like to buy brand new C sell cartridges and utilize those that is what I recommend above all else these right here they are a half gram they are more expensive than a cartridge but they do have the battery they do taste very nice the flavors very good they are designed specifically for the cartridge that they are combined with so they work quite well these are just a couple of the options seeing as how you will still be able to buy the distillate in the syringe and you can add it to any one of these products to have yourself a nice thing that being said you guys have an absolutely beautiful day thank you so much for tuning in this is John with C&C connoisseurs we'll talk to you guys next time peace", "7jTt35Eu8cE": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another Ursa cartridge you know I'm very very happy although I did spend a little bit more than expected because I went to fee knows and it's not authentic and authentic when they had it it was $40 but at vinos it's 55 but I really wanted a cartridge so I was like [ __ ] it I'll pay $15 extra and you see if I'm not lying right here I mean the tax is killing me it was the one it's $41 without the tax but then it was like 54 with it so yeah definitely one of the the pricier cartridges I'm actually at a park right now I'm actually gonna hit a few in the car just because you know it's easier that way and then I'm gonna walk around and hit the cartridge - just to prove that I'm in a [ __ ] park okay guys [ __ ] Park [ __ ] park brother so let's just open this thing like I mean you guys already know the deal bros like I've opened this not this one but okay okay [Music] I didn't want to [ __ ] pull out the cap you know accidentally Laureus yes dope or battery I do have my dad's mate and do not have the magnetic piece on it so I'm just gonna use the side where it's cruising cheers boys who that wasn't even a blinker right this is a blueberry muffin in oh my god that show taste a pretty [ __ ] [Music] god damn holy moly cracker mode damn [Music] this is probably the the smoothest cartridge I've hit in a while if not the best or the smoothest the taste is there everything is there like I liked when I tried the first person car it was from the homie Chiron and he had ice cream cake which is a strain I didn't really enjoy as much this one has a sweeter taste of more blueberry taste obviously it's blueberry muffins and it's actually quite pleasant what [ __ ] it was just like [ __ ] the stats let's just read this [ __ ] right here so we got THC we're coming in at seventy two point one two percent it was packaged and manufactured on the channel on January 30th 2020 Best Buy same date but 2021 one gram all that good stuff not gonna lie it [ __ ] this [ __ ] hits so what I am going to do now pocket this water you can see right here guys very nice Park it's very nice outside I was actually getting pretty [ __ ] hot in that car I'm not gonna lie I want to go over there and smoke you see that boys that little stairway [ __ ] let's go there no one there and we can take some hits on the way to boys that's the thing about cartridges you could bring that [ __ ] anywhere and take a fat hit and especially with a cart like this that hits like a [ __ ] dab rig like it's a game-changer it really is you know like I honestly can't stress that enough you know cartridges are getting better just like technology with the mores I believe it's Moore's law where technology gets better every six months and technology is in everything when it comes to vapes computer it's anything you know I'm saying like the hits aren't that fat right now what you just take off let me see if I can take you about that the camera turned off let me see if I can take a little a little fatter hit damn well yeah I wanted to do I wanted to get my own orsa you know after Chiron showed me his I was just like damn there's just no way I cannot just try this muhfuckas and not buy my own it did take some a long time I would say about a month or something but it's only because Ursa hasn't been that much available in my area and it's probably something I won't buy that much often you know because $55 for a gram cartridge I know it's a it's average in LA but in Modesto that's not average that's a above average so you know I do enjoy it though I really really do enjoy it very very tasty you get the whole terpene profile of the of the strain which is good you know I wanna take one more hit for you guys I'm probably gonna call it a video hopefully you guys enjoyed it you and also in the car you could actually see the smoke thickened out here it's very spread out it's not a really good visual representation of actually how much I'm hitting but these are fat hits don't get me wrong but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I really enjoyed hitting this to be honest and making this video it's a nice [ __ ] day outside and hopefully you're having a good day so far peace out expecting company but that's ok cos don't try to prove", "1mEjkDbjO9Q": "what's up everybody welcome to the 7 10 morning show once again it is friday good morning nurse colleen good morning how are you i'm good you are looking thank you your red dress why are you wearing that red dress um it is um heart health awareness heart health awareness what it is what is the exact the exact same no i don't know you told me about this i don't know wear it on the news it's national wear red day for women's heart disease women's heart disease i believe are just in general but they were bringing attention on the news to women uh suffering from heart problems right gotcha okay so we're wearing red for that today i thought maybe it was staying there all right welcome to the 7 10 morning show uh friday edition we're going to be talking about indica and sativa today once again because a friend of mine who is very very smart scientist has sent me an article that i think we should talk about and how indica and sativa we've everything we know about it is wrong everything not even a little bit is right but we're gonna find out more about it today on the 710 morning show [Music] i saw the other ones in there i saw a national nutella day was in our prep sheet look at that that's actually today national nutella day today i got to stop looking up at that instagram camera or maybe move it down i stopped looking over there oh see over here it doesn't look so bad like when we're over there but when we look up it's like what are you looking at up there oh really down here it's like obvious that we're trying to figure out what the hell is going on but up there it's like what is that it's up there so what's up nurse colleen happy friday yeah happy friday so actually um so they did mention uh heart health this morning on the news it was wear red today um and i wanted to mention uh because cat our friend cat who just passed away she had an enlarged heart so the importance of um cardiovascular health you're absolutely right it's go red for women day yeah go and you can find out more about it for women go red for women.org they actually have a website from the american heart association get out there and do your cardio yes do your cardio watch your uh um cholesterol levels too cardio coming from the heart cardio doesn't just mean breathing heavy i don't know why they call it cardio when you're just like breathing heavy shouldn't it be like pull pulmo or something like that but anyway no no no you know the heart and the lungs are all connected like it's all systems come on with that come on this is this newfangled science don't give me your science but yeah it's very important to get out there and exercise and you know we know a lot of people who lift weights and they don't necessarily have healthy hearts because they're not doing the cardio with it well the one thing you actually need for a healthy heart that most people don't really understand is you have to eat whole cow hearts that's right like you have to eat the entire can we get the the capsules if it's still beating it actually enhances the the nutritional value if it's still beating you can actually get the spirit of the animal inside of you as well give me this heart and lungs are connected nonsense rebecca you have blood in your lungs and like air in your veins how is that possible oh boy absolutely not all right so what do we have today what do we have today wow we have um some are our we don't have a strain of the day no no we have a cultivar of the day oh because we're going to try and start changing our terminology and i'm going to get into why fancy i'm going to get into why we're starting to change our terminology too okay because that's cultivar would be the more proper tournament well not only is cultivar the most appropriate term it's the it's the technical term um and is more specific than strange but strains actually refers to um viruses and different types of fungus as well so when we start talking about mushrooms we're going to start talking about strains properly right because the strain would be the actual word that we would use and since we're going to be talking more about mushrooms moving forward i think we should differentiate i think we should use the proper terminology for each because there's no real reason though we don't even know why people started calling them strains in cannabis because they're anything anything but strains those are just you know viral terms viruses and bacteria and fungus you know about viruses and fungus do we miss out this morning guess what what did we miss never mind so what do we have what did i miss so what do we have here um now i'm really lost you'll figure it out let's just move on i'm confused it's okay please help me so what do we have here now i'm really confused i can't even read get me all flustered normal hot i don't know what i said that was wrong you didn't say anything no um i was wondering what would happen to our functional mushroom oh oh oh actually oddly funny that you should mention i was just about to excuse myself and go grab that i was hoping you would kind of get it as like a little side like hey did you miss that this morning you want to grab it for me without letting the whole crowd do you see this headphone thing do you see this it's okay so so even though it's like it's like on top of my head stuff still goes right i just i just thought maybe i'd thrown it away i've been known to throw away my doses before so you know to make sure i didn't miss it all right so well while i get your uh well i grab your lion's mane for you yes you're a functional uh lions man over there check into um i'm going to hand you this cure leaf cultivar of the day is brandywine it smells really good brandy wine i'm gonna put the put up that banner yummy yummy from uh the cure leaf put that up while you uh roll that i'm gonna run over here one second while you talk about nutella or not i'm gonna say we also have the medtender of the day today okay i'm sorry of the week i'm sorry sorry med center of the week we are going to need um your input soon for your favorite med tenders and why but we'll set up a system for you guys to nominate people we'll set up a system so you guys can uh come and congregate uh i'm gonna be setting up some

are they and then they maybe read the first half of the headline maybe it used to be back in the day people would read the headline yeah you have to be a good headline writer yeah but nowadays it's like no people like just maybe will read the first few words but they'll just look at the picture mostly it just makes you pop up in the search i painted my nails green you did i'm loving it you should because it looks great yeah i feel a little bit like a strawberry got your limes made over here thank you very much sir you're welcome i was uh i dropped the ball on our uh on our nourishment this morning i was just afraid i had thrown it away because there's times that i do well it doesn't look like it's a uh um it doesn't look appetizing put it that way no it's not not in that form anyway no it's not we gotta um stir-fry it maybe stir fry maybe that'll help um how's your mic is your mic not positioned properly do you want a position differently no i think it's okay ryan i'm just wondering because you were messing with it before i just want to make sure that you're comfortable no i'm good good all right and i'm playing with mike's lately so you know how it is any excuse to grab the mic uh so getting that getting that rolled up for us there so what are we talking about the indica sativa fallacy interesting huh yeah excited to learn about this stuff yes i am i was excited to learn about so some of it i knew a lot of it i did not you know a lot of it is a is a history lesson and a lot of it is stuff corroborating stuff that we already know all right you ready to dive in is everybody ready to dive in i am i don't have any music to like dive in now into our story indica versus sativa so back before the days of the internet right it was really easy to start kind of um what i used to call conventional wisdom right so you could kind of say what you want and then people would believe you or not there was no way to really corroborate stuff like i was wondering do kids today still have like that that dude that just pretends he knows everything she's like oh yeah like the cliff clavin kind of guy and just like oh yeah it's widely known um i'm gonna say yes because and i'm gonna reference pablo and the oil in the rv because i'm gonna refer to us as kids these days [Laughter] pete was filling the oil in the rv and he overfilled it and he says pablo you think that's okay paul was like yeah it'll be fine neither of them know anything about well i know you shouldn't put too much oil there pablo was trying to convince me they're like yeah it's great it'll work but today like kids can like you can have like oh yeah i know that you know like back in the day was like how are you gonna tell i don't know but now he could be like hey siri is this guy full of [ __ ] right right basically you can just look everything up right so that's how kind of a lot of this nomenclature and a lot of these things got started with marijuana because not only was it was there no internet to corroborate what people were saying but there was you know a lot of it is underground so a lot of it you couldn't corroborate anyway even if you tried you know so a lot of it was clandestine but now you know legalization is like taking hold we have the internet and you can find the real information as opposed to just believing what you've always been told right and we have an epidemic of people just believing stuff that they've always been told can we just talk about um green for a minute what's your what's her name again oh my god marjorie green marjorie whatever little bornean word is i don't even care to know or reference her properly but she um they led me they allowed me to believe false i was i was allowed to believe false things i was allowed to believe false things she says come on uh my favorite was the the news reporter pronouncing it qannon this morning yeah like it was rhiannon's sister or something that was really funny like chewing excuse me man if you're allowed to believe stuff what's next what's next for us if you're allowed to believe that and the yeah that goes along with that especially when your license to public office on that note you're allowed to believe that indica and sativa oh you know indica put you in the couch and all that good stuff but you know you're allowed to believe whatever you want yeah exactly so indic and sativa are are common classifications of two types of cannabis and they they have um we call them different varieties that produce narrow or broad leafs or leaflets um and then we assign the effects based on those things so oh look indica has these broad leaves and a put you in the couch and sativa has these narrow leaves and it makes you gives you more energy it was my favorite it gives you more energy yeah just not right i mean have you really known cannabis to give you energy i've never had a strain that was like you know like a cup of coffee i was like you know what yeah that was like a bang name that bang stream no no never had one but the fact of the matter is that when they started naming these things right in 1753 carl linnaeus was essentially aware of only one type of cannabis the european variety which was cannabis sativa and later in 1785 varieties from india named cannabis indica were named by john baptist lamach so they were named a completely different times they weren't named to differentiate necessarily from each other but from where they were found right so what we're now learning about the ethnobotany of cannabis is that it's much more than just two and there's a correct way of describing the plant physical characteristics through horticulture uh taxonomy or there are proper names to call these things basically is what they're saying um so at the time the names were designated to differentiate how it was to be used right so this is how indica and sativa those terminology was used originally ship sales canvas clothing all sativa right interesting cannabis that was coming from india was used more for medicine and what we've been calling sativa for years for years is in fact narrow leaflet and drug type or nld and indica is broad leaflet drug type bld the drug type of course meaning containing psychoactive thc compounds where narrow leaflet hemp nlh and broad leaflet hemp do not contain thc oh look at that keef that's a lot of keef that's like keeper sutherland over there so the only true sativa the only true sativa no false sativas is the european industrial hemp variety that is virtually void of all cannabinoids and is grown for its biomass and seeds everything else has indica bred into it to give us the cannabinoids we want when we consume it and that goes for cbd as well cbd rich cultivars are in fact drug type plants they're not the industrial hemp type plants that people typically correlate with that you know so many people think that because a plant has no thc it should it has to be high in cbd you are a goddamn genius what are you doing over there are you rolling that in keith hi sure good lord i love you i told you how much i love you i love you look at this can everybody just pause for a moment and look at this beautiful woman in this red dress rolling that that beautiful cone into keith wow my goodness just added a little bit of uh extra potency you thought i looked at first yeah i did that's what that's why um i i've got it to stick on there i've got a funny feeling in my pants can you pass me used to climb the ropes and gym clothes you guys see it yeah we've got a selection of lighters to choose from do you care to taste it we're prepared today for once we may not have been on at 7 10. we were prepared 7 11 i think close enough can we just digress for one second we were in 7-eleven and they didn't know what price the coffee was that we were trying to buy so i was just throwing out numbers i was like that's five bucks and then i was like it's 7 11 cents and she goes what if you knew the price why didn't you tell me i was like it's a goddamn joke it's a 7-eleven why did you get that but it was five dollars but it was five that was just my first guess see i should do pricing for these companies because i know what i know what it should be i know what people want to pay so you might be surprised to learn that in the india sorry even you might be surprised to learn that india has both short fat leaf leaved plants and narrow leaved plants taller varieties due to their location on earth did you know india was a fairly large country it gets cold and hot there imagine that [Music] so if you go to northern india you'll find uh typically short bushy fat leaf plants what we normally call indica and if you go to southern tropical peninsula of india you'd be seeing the narrow leave the drug varieties which we would mistakenly call sativa but they've never been out of india so they're indica interesting a yes sure is what we really mean when we say indica is that the plant is northern and short flowering varieties have dense nugs to protect them from the cold that they're used to feeling right so that's what we're really referring to when we when we talk about indica having these broad leaves bushy plants we're referring to the fact that they're you know medicinal not necessarily where they come from because you know we're using the names wrong because you have you know non-medicinal varieties that also grow in india so equatorial tropical varieties grow taller produce spinely buds that allow for airflow to allow moisture not to build up and that's what we falsely call sativa this is widely widely misconstrued and there's no test to say a plant is 75 sativa and 25 indica those numbers are a fallacy do you get those numbers right so if they right i think i think that dispensaries need to get away from that because that generally is the first question they ask are you looking for an indigo or sativa where they're getting those numbers from like oh this is 75 indica whatever is just looking at the lineage looking at the the makeup of its parents right and we're going to get into how um we should be looking at the parents of uh of the different cultivars so the leaf structure does not dictate how the herb is going to affect you when you smoke it it's the terpenes that direct how the high affects you nothing else harvest time dictates effect just like drying and curing but it's all about terpenes right it's all about preserving the terpenes all the different types of extraction right it's all about preserving those terpenes right so that's why that um the live resin vape so select live resin vapes they're frozen right because they're trying to preserve those terpenes right that's what it's all about yeah so why would we put so much emphasis on preserving those terpenes if it was all about the indica and sativa right right so the terpenes are what really matters and to your point i think we should have some discussions with some of the dispensaries here about being able to shop by terpene being able to look at oh my god that would be such a better way to have it set up it doesn't take that much if you look at the back end of their websites you should be able to sort that because they have filters and stuff for their products you should be able to sort if they input the data somewhere right the terpene content if they add that layer of data you should be able to sort by it no problem like a category or which product so you should be able to sort by that and then you can layer that with effects that are proven from those terpenes so you can then start shopping by desired effect as opposed to in the sativa which are i think are so it's just such a terrible way to to classify these things when there's so many varieties like back in the day when you only had a couple of choices it wasn't that big of a deal but now nowadays it's like there's so many different choices and it's a bad indicator you know i'll smoke an indica that gives me anxiety which isn't supposed to be because it's an indica nine pound hammer both of us gives us anxiety and then one time i had purchased um 50 milligrams sativa thc capsules hoping that they would give me energy but they just knocked me out understood and i've and i've had that same racy kind of effect that same racy kind of feeling from very labeled sativa strains like ak-47 and green crack but it gives me the same feeling as like a nine-pound hammer which is supposed to be a heavy indica right so we need to get away from some of this nomenclature and being a marketing guy i can see its appeal i could see the appeal of having a simple choice like you have all of these strains in front of you i get analysis paralysis when i'm looking there i'm like i don't know what i want there's so much if you can dumb it down a little bit and say okay well do you want one two or three you know indica sativa or a hybrid right then you're able to get that person to choose faster and out the door right simplifies the process but i like the idea that you have with the different terpenes so you could have remember when cure leaf at um the fmcc had the um smells the diffusers yeah the oil diffusers that would be so awesome if you had like the different products with the different scents you know so you could like oh yeah i want limonene today i want mercedes you know i also thought another good marketing strategy would be like they could do what uh jimmy john's does and so free smells invite people to come in and smell that's a cute idea right because you can do that now with those little jars and you have these specific stuff that you have there for people to come in and smell and just invite people to come in and have somebody outside which is really cute no i think the the emphasis has to be put back on terpenes um well on terpenes to begin with because it's been about um you know the lineage has been what dictates you know how things are named and how they're marketed so essential oils i mean that's what they work off of is the different terpenes that's basically what it is but not for enough different effects the the strain stuff is like a marketer's dream honestly you can do anything you come up like look you have wedding cake and you have this and you mix them together and you come up with another clever name like another fun name you know i mean like you can do that all day long who wants to give that up you know it's so much fun like to see all these crazy straight names that come out but at the end of the day they don't really tell you anything at the end of the day they're just telling you um you know it's just another you know way to market something and i said this before about where the strain names are they used to be stuff like green crack and because it was clandestine they've completely changed to marketing terms it's like naming food that's why you have strains like brandywine tapes it sounds like [ __ ] it's gonna be good because i like brandywine that sounds like it's gonna be good you know what i mean so it's it's a name that's very like you know layer cake makes uh who's not gonna want a layer cake just like wine right cupcake wine doesn't taste like [ __ ] cupcakes nothing close to a cupcake it's actually not very good yet people buy it because it triggers something they think of makes them think of something like it delicious right cupcakes are delicious that should be delicious right people think i'm crazy but it's true well you are crazy but you know well yeah right i'm crazy but this stuff is true and you'll see five years from now believe me everything i say comes true in in all a good time it's not a joke see what ha oh well can we can we just break off for a second and talk about i said what i said about med men's stock yesterday and what happened yesterday yesterday morning med men's stock was at 17 cents i mentioned mad men stock right what happened during the day jumped up to uh 27 cents 10 cents 60 increase so if i would have bought a thousand dollars worth of it i would have made 600 bucks yesterday just on med men listening to my own advice yeah my own advice yeah right when will you listen to your own advice this morning this morning i've got my trading apps downloaded get some get some dodge coin garen said he was gonna buy some dodge coin he's the third smart smart person that i know that's bought dodge coin so i think it's about time to do that he's the third smart person that you've known yeah like really like people that i consider like geniuses there's two other people that i follow online that also said something about dodge coin and i was like okay and those are people that are usually very like science you know and it's like you know like like like lawrence krauss you know like like really really smart people and you're just like really um and then another guy says bitcoin's gonna hit a hundred thousand this year and i believe it especially if elon says anything else about it yeah i think it'll happen it's at 30 000 now that's a huge increase that's like three you know almost almost four x three almost four x i sent ilana a message this morning we all need to send him messages so he can help us with our movement to educate the nation every day cannabis and psychedelics just keep tweeting at him we need that tesla rv tweeting adam and tag us we're trying to spread the word i think it can do it i heard that they made a tesla version of the knight rider car kit what didn't they do the uh volkswagen bus yes and if they can do those things then this should be no problem i mean they are sending people to space that aren't even [ __ ] astronauts so right so we need we should be able to fly this even though we're not piloting a tesla um tires that don't go flat in ac that works you tell me that we couldn't get elon to make us a a scale version of the rv from spaceballs you tell me he wouldn't make that yeah he would jump on that in a [ __ ] heartbeat we just have to give him the idea and he'll do it by himself and then we're gonna go nationally and spread the word to use cannabis and psychedelics and uh we're gonna save all the people opioid problems and mental health issues and we're gonna go save everybody we're gonna save the world yes okay we're gonna save the world and uh we'll bring some one morning show at a time bring nutella with us it's great that it's nutella day because it's one of the best things to infuse it's got fat and sugar and just drop some distillate or rso on there it's good stuff right yeah speaking of we never made it over to get the um ours so yesterday correct we did not therefore we cannot demonstrate no but we will have to get some later we do have that giant cone though we can demonstrate that i was gonna say i kind of want to show that so we went over to levels which next friday a week from today we are doing the show live from curaleaf in west palm right the new care leaf location um it's on okeechobee and jog yes and then at 4 20 that's gonna be at 7 10am and we'll be there till noon and then at 4 20 um we're going to be at levels smoke shop in west palm and that's on military and southern right we'll be there for a few hours and be a bunch of dispensaries and a few clinics out there i know but we went over there and lexie's there lexi uh with stoner girls we went over there the other day in anthony told us we have to try this that is ridiculous do you guys see that that's insane see the box that comes in this is the box that comes in that's crazy if you can't if you can't see like what we're talking about on the podcast it is a called a cubano from vibes one extra wide cone what fits in there like an eighth it looks like maybe even more yeah it's huge looks like more like maybe uh eighth and a half what would that be i don't know five grams maybe five grams maybe a five gram joint five grammar i think that's the way to go pretty big pretty big that's what she said where's your rim shot i don't have so um we have not talked about the strains versus cultivars yet so right that actual term the actual term strains or strands a lot of people say strands and i'm always like strands you idiot it's strains duh it's actually not either yeah right that's funny um it's just like you know calling a cheetah a tiger because they're both wild cats but you know you have to look at what you know like what we're talking about the word strain comes from microbiology like we said before it describes a genetic variant or subtype of bacteria fungus or virus and since we're not talking about any of those things we should use the correct term which is cultivar which is defined by the phenotype versus the genotype in horticulture so other terms such as variety or cross are still better than strain and it's an honest description of actually what took place but it's less specific so if you sprout 20 seeds of a certain variety those seedlings are crosses and then each of those seedlings would also be its own cultivar so cultivars are very specific so you know if you look at it in marketing terms you don't want things you don't want to classify things that specific because you want some when you're trying to sell something you want them to expect something like you want to have a brand that's supposed to produce something repeatable you know so unless your brand unless your your brand is change like it's always different it could be um you know it's kind of hard to to to market a specific uh cultivar but you know what i see does that might be doing that is a grow healthy because they see they nate they number the batches yeah so it's like jelly bean one two three four five six m so those are all different cultivars of it and have uh that to me makes it so much more confusing like i'd rather not even know that because then you have like the point you have like the different varieties you know whatever and then you have different numbers in each one like are you just remember all that right so that's that's kind of the point that's why we're not so we don't drill it down so much is because it makes it much more difficult to understand that then take a lot more research and stuff to um you know kind of you know why why are we classifying in the first place it's so that we if we like something we can go and try and get it again right that's like base that's the the application of the knowledge that we're going for right so let's try and find what works best for us what works best for other people um and it's hard to do that with stuff that's so so so specific but that is you know technically what we're doing we just i think we just need a better way to classify things i mean what i take all from this is uh indic and sativa worked well for a while but i think we need to get into something different probably based on terpenes i don't think you can go total cannabinoid content because then again that's going to get too confusing but i think if you start naming things not so much based on where they come from and the lineage and you base you name it on based on the chemical structure so you know this much of all these different terpenes this much of these cannabinoids and that within a certain threshold is called something right it's called you know and no matter where you find that no matter where it was grown how it was growing whatever if that's the chemical composition if it's within those ratios then it's called that right you know that would be kind of a way to go about it but i think you need a big data set to do that you know you need a lot of a lot a lot of info i think they would have a lot of info especially if you look at like leafly and what are the those types of like they should by now right yeah crowdsourcing reviews they should be there so barry we're going to check on the comments right hey now that we're a half hour in over here we're going to check on our our comments and go up to the top over here yes and we'll scroll down what's up micro d and danny and todd and sherry carrie the pips martha chris tara james chuck what's up everybody ronnie wendy oh we have our our med tender of the uh week our med tender of the week yes midtender of the week and we haven't we haven't told them who it is yet we haven't told them have you told him no oh i haven't told him ah whoa we are actually headed up to um to jacksonville later today as soon as we um finish the show and get the rv and get packed up oh okay to jacksonville we're doing the show we're doing a special saturday show tomorrow we are i have to wake up tomorrow i wasn't aware of this who who not only do you have to wake up you have to drive up there first who authorized this and we're staying um somewhere in jacksonville beach so yeah tomorrow morning 9 10 the show is going to be live over at um vita canyon jacksonville vita canyon jacksonville and i'm i'm pretty excited to be back up there okay i liked it there was gonna be nice and chilly some great specials i'm sure and we'll be there until about noon yeah and then what and then we are going on a tour of the grove oh vita can't grow i believe i believe that's uh in the afternoon so yeah we're going to lunch and then around two is when we're doing them tour yeah oh yeah yeah we're gonna be uh do we have time for a nap uh i don't think so but we don't get up as early because this show's at nine ten instead of seven times nine ten which so we could sleep in a little bit on saturday because why would you be up at seven cent on saturday you gotta sleep in sometimes we look really sleepy this morning we do i feel like we do i don't know ah that's one thing about our our large monitors is that this show james i need a coffee refill i still have a little bit in here just a little bit oh sherry's birthday happy birthday sherry happy birthday sherry if you guys don't know sherry has the um is it pure romance um because valentine's day is coming up so if you guys are looking for some um fun gifts yes sherry can help you out there you know sherry i saw something that you might be interested in and it was there someone was doing edibles and like sex stuff like a package like a like a box yeah yeah oh like a monthly package i don't remember if it was monthly or not i'm trying to remember but it was it was like it came with like brownies and like all sorts of like edibles and stuff and like one vibrator and you were like what no they should do like um like that little micro d that i have or the the rose with the flower in the middle and make that into an edible that's i think that would be a great edible i'd pay 50 bucks for that edible sherry how can we get in touch with you if we want to go could you make it roast beef flavored you like that roast beef sandwich huh so harvey stays in business so sherry how can we get in touch with you if we wanted to uh get something from you do you have a website or is there like a something yeah we'd like to know who hoo-ha i think um you should make you know those little micro ds into uh but they should have like a cadbury egg yeah you know oh my god with cream in the middle yeah yes yeah yeah yeah infused cream in the middle it has to be warm oh my gosh like the lava cakes like the lava cakes exactly exactly that exists somewhere you know that right somebody's done it it's a silicone mold you could probably um just made like a canterbury microdose that was so funny i forgot how i got there but all of a sudden i was finding myself looking at pre-rolled catnip joints apparently that's a thing because there's kitty crack and all sorts of stuff for cats yeah yeah towards like stoners apparently yeah very interesting i mean i think that's like a natural connection though catnip and it's like all these spaced out cats and stuff and just like yeah kitty crack i was like yeah uh sherry if you give the link to your website we'll reshare it yeah we'll put it up on the screen if you want to type it in there yeah yeah yeah kitty crack kitty crack um so i don't wanna i don't wanna alarm you okay please don't because i know how you get about these things but the texas department of public safety yeah said an amber alert was issued for the chucky doll what from child's play that is funny um and people received this this amber alert for chucky seriously i think it might have terrified a lot of people um so it was sent out to subscribers of the texas alert system three times last friday and it says it was we he was wielding a huge kitchen knife blue denim overalls multi-colored striped long-sleeve last seen wielding a huge kitchen knife come on it included photos in the alert come on who did someone lose her job over there that's crazy so it was a it was actually a test that they were running and it accidentally went out three times three times not just once about three times you know that's that's that that happened where it wasn't so funny in in hawaii where they had the uh missile scare remember a few years ago no they had they had an accidental alert that went out that said that there was anything oh i think i remember yeah and there's like all these crazy stories about people like you know panicking i'm sure you guys would be like panicking going into bathtubs like crazy [ __ ] yeah i think that would probably be a similar reaction if i saw there's an amber alert for chucky no way you're silly oh i want to eat this nutella so bad on this world nutella day i think we need to eat some nutella today but we also need to exercise um it's actually pronounced nutella nutella according to their website see that i'm going to say nutella because that makes obvious sense to me because it's nuts and ella jesus i'm gonna complicate things by changing how it pronounced [Music] you silly you look lovely today thank you very much is there a joke of the day today no james would like to know james would like to know i see those comments over there but it is pay a compliment day oh is it you guys are wonderful that's my compliment you compliment me every day you remind me of myself when i was young and foolish it's interesting to see you all informed opinions as you go you ready for uh the big game did you see that they resurrected uh wayne's world for a commercial for the super bowl no i did not they look pretty old really i bet i bet i'm feeling and looking pretty old myself oh you are not stop you may feel that way but you definitely don't definitely doesn't come across on the exterior uh especially since like you know [Music] they're getting older and who's getting older who not me nobody is time is completely standing still i'm definitely not good guys that says this bird is calling harley and then mars is kakai i love when you say it the way one does okay uh we should definitely have one on one on one talking about some psychedelics cumin that was funny look gray hair is exactly ronnie tickle bitties is that um what tickle bitties that's not uh goddamn what was aaliyah aaliyah i don't know if that's her or not but jordan she was like my second daughter she lives around the corner wow her name was aliyah and he used to call her take old bitties that was nick david i don't know if that's her enough but that'd be really funny if it is and if it's not even funnier what what earned her this nickname my son is gay okay so it's okay it's tickled but i know so it's not harassment if they're gay but i wonder if that's her probably not they're probably saying all right sorry is that a common thing i guess yeah i think oh gosh okay that's freaking hilarious yeah it is hey leo what's up so um did you know that in the 1700s people would put butter in their coffee very interesting aren't they doing that again today they are coffee right they are yeah and the bulletproof coffee right put that mct in there put it in your coffee not in your vapes yeah exactly exactly mct is um a medium chain triglyceride makes my stomach queasy so i don't like that but butter is good you know we should put in here again should get some more of that pure leaf topical if they have it yes you're right i agree i always put that in the coffee yes maybe some mellow i used to eat it by the spoonfuls you'd used to eat a better spoonful that's right yeah yeah put it on anything put it on uh hot dogs did you put on hot dogs once hot dogs i don't eat no did you put it on toast or something remember the uh italian sausage we had that italian sausage you remember i put it on there yeah you put it on there i don't remember oh my god that was too much that's hard to come back from did you guys see that what happened that was funny oh that was really funny i'm so happy that we don't have to rush off the show today yeah yeah it was uh i i felt like the shows were so punchy i was like all right we're done i was like they were so compact less like uh oh yeah what are we gonna talk about next but i am relaxed like more like that i don't have to you know jump off anytime soon i feel like we've been steady at 40 having to monitor the uh [Music] um um do you have goosebumps yeah you usually have goosebumps i don't know you can get them on your face you know you can get goosebumps on your face did not know that i didn't i didn't read this thing at all today actually i know because i sent it to you like five minutes before the show yeah i had no time to read it so [Music] so i'm asking you like rhetorical questions you don't have to you don't really have to answer unless you actually already knew some of this stuff like did you know taco is spanish for plug no no no so that's why they have taco tuesdays get it do you did they know that when they set up the soccer tuesday pretty sure yeah that's really cool because they're uh spanish but uh i would i wouldn't know that i have [ __ ] no idea but they must have known that i would have no idea it makes total sense taco tuesdays now i feel stupid for not speaking spanish well enough so now you know there's a little shout out to taco tuesdays if you check them out on instagram um and you'll see what we're talking about oh cracking the neck there tuesdays the same they do um kind of karaoke too right or is that not the same oh i think they're all different and they all go to each other's events and stuff you know so they're all uh kind of i don't know they're all the old the thing they have in common i think is hip-hop or that kind of karaoke was fun but some of the other stuff like some of the taco tuesdays look like i don't know they're at a strip club or something yeah yeah yeah yeah so a little different of an event yeah the most fascinating thing that i saw on this one was that mosquitoes can dodge raindrops [Laughter] do they see stuff in like slow motion language well they would have to be able to right that would be a really cool like scene to do in like a pixar movie like yeah like dodging raindrops i wonder if it's in the b movie it's sort of it sounds like it should be yeah right if i feel like there was a part of the um uh honey i shrunk the kids when the sprinklers go on or that one or like ant life or whatever that is ants i love ants because it makes these kid made kids watch a woody allen movie which is a straight up woody allen movie like he's got a very formulaic kind of movie it's a straight up woody hollow movie just in cartoons with ants with sylvester stallone like it's hilarious who would think to make that somebody with a with an open mind oh my gosh what's up do you see the uh first one it takes 600 cows to make one full season's worth of nfl football it's crazy that's okay that's crazy well if we took the hearts of those 600 cows and fed them to people then we'd have less heart heart issues right i think right right right it's all right 600 cows is nothing 600 cows is like [ __ ] the lunch rush at mcdonald's at mcdonald's that's 600 cats yeah really yeah [Music] yeah i wonder how much it costs to make the seasons worth of baseball gloves probably more yeah i don't know that's a good question yeah it's a lot of baseball gloves but also a lot of footballs it is a lie and here's about here's what i would imagine there's more gloves than footballs can i can i ask a silly question though what well there's a lot of footballs like they keep changing them yeah i like to use the same one over and over again they come out with like a literal like they have like a little truck and it's got like a whole basket like in the back like a little pickup truck yeah full on the side of footballs field at least they did back in the day um but you have to think each player has more than one club this is true very very true plus yeah yeah there's a lot but um the thing that i'm having trouble with here is why would you need cows to make pigskin oh my god i have no idea are they not made of pictures really they're not made of pigskin why the [ __ ] do we call them or maybe they stuff them with the gap the same people that came up with strains and indica and sativa it's ridiculous michael's enjoying the strawberry diesel shatter from cara leaf delicious chicken wing shortage see this one i'm saying where are all those chickens where are all those full chickens the chickens with no wings no wings wingless chickens running around flopping around because they're all off balance i got no wings it's awful we should start a anti-wing coalition stop d-winging these chickens um what's up i'm tired today yeah yeah yeah but you too though right you uh said you didn't sleep too well i did not sleep too well at all but i'm not tired what do you

i get all ready and then i can't tell a joke i'm excited for this um this weekend i can't scroll down anymore oh here we go because we can't scroll down you can't see the answer neither can i so we'll ask the question to all of us okay one study found that when a team loses the super bowl this business will see a 200 percent increase in that city the next day when a team loses the super bowl this business sees a 200 percent increase in that city the next day what is it either gets you think it's bars i think people go out drinking i mean i would think that i feel like that's the first thing that comes to mind but it's probably too obvious got to be a diff a better answer more a more counter-intuitive answer is everybody drinking the night before because everybody would be drinking if they won or if they lost right yeah what about um like takeout maybe movies i don't know um let's see what people are guessing how about nooses gun sales gun sales increase 200 percent puke thanks amberley um yeah matches they like to light stuff on fire trash pickup trucks is 200 that's great i can't imagine what it could be i have no idea i mean i don't know is it it couldn't be jersey sales right it'd be the opposite movies gun sales bullet sales let's see what is it we're gonna fight we'll get we're gonna reveal it reveal we're too excited to wait cell phone repair oh my god that's good glorious it's so obvious now i didn't even think of that that is hilarious sherry says weed sales weed sales what did we talk about right cell phone repair oh hey marvin that's too goddamn funny cell

looking at me like i'm crazy let's see where we'll party i don't think super bowl parties let's go to b-dubs we go to some random jacksonville sports bar i think that could be fun i think everyone should have off monday what's monday it's the day after the super bowl oh you think it should be like a holiday i think that's a good idea yes exactly i used to actually go to the super bowl used to be a big deal every year for me because i had to do a lot of work around it even if i wasn't going there i had to do press releases and every year the big thing that i had to do was the nfl schedule our broadcast schedule i had to announce who our announcers were well look i'm on the other end of a microphone now that's funny that is funny yeah and it's funny because i come a long way i don't have a very you know compared to all those guys i don't really have a great radio voice i love your voice not like marv albert i could i couldn't even possibly like even imitate those guys and then all the former you got to know all the former like nfl guys who are also analysts and stuff who don't have great voices to begin with they do so much like [ __ ] um testosterone that their voices get really deep and they have these great radio voices by the time they retire right oh look the pips are doing the game oh the pips are having a super bowl party i love that hi i think you know what in our rv park would probably have a big um they'll probably be all people like watching the game like in the rv though i'm sure yeah yeah that would be cool to go over to the pips too and i know mike and melissa are going to be up there and doug's up that way and rob and rebecca and pablo and a bunch of people are going to be up there a bunch of people bunch of people um but so we have this uh tomorrow at vitacam and then we're going on the grow tour and then um wednesday's cure leaf grand opening right now um and the other thing that i'm going to be doing or we're going to be doing today is we're going to be outfitting our big green bus to actually host the uh show inside of it you know in a better way yeah you know so we could pull up and do interviews if we want to you know yeah we're gonna we're gonna paint the table yeah yes i'm gonna okay so we have an idea the table in the rv we want to get like a big green bus logo or something and that that we're going to put the resin down and put it in the resin but in the meantime we're going to paint it black until we get the leaves and things that we want to put in there sounds like put in there yeah so we have a few things to do before we leave today right so um the main thing that i want i want to be able to do is i want to be able to pull up in front of you know like a congress person's house and have them come out and do a podcast like right in the bus and i think that would be a lot of fun that'd be really good i'm cool with it as long as they're wearing a mask and we're on a mask i think it's cool yeah double mask yeah open the windows so we just got to work on like the the you know building that out oh today is um cure leaf grand opening in um saint pete what today is a cure leaf grand opening in st pete

would love that [ __ ] right could you imagine if we had like a whole show and people like came up on stage and got there like uh yeah yeah yeah yeah you know their recognition i actually had a color guard come out and one of the flags was like a weed flag i feel like florida the united states and a weed flag yeah um you wanna move this over so you can see it oh no i just wanted to see what wendy was saying she was asking if mushrooms can help can mushrooms help with depression funny you should mention that yesterday last night i almost had a breakdown because um i tend to procrastinate things yeah and i procrastinated securing some web domains that i really wanted yeah and i have my information logged in on that computer and i was always looking them up on my phone i was like all right when i get to the computer i'll get them and then i would forget and i went to go get i was you know i was sitting here i was like you know what let me go get those right now because i'm not going to forget again and i went over to get them and three of the domains that i had set aside and i have screenshots of them being available because i'd send them to you remember yeah um were taken already so i was like really like losing it yeah but one of the websites that was not taken yeah that i still have yeah is uh mushrooms for depression yeah or magic mushrooms for depression yeah yeah oh that's funny i didn't realize yours.com that upset over that i was one of them one of them was a brand that i really was i really wanted to develop like not so much i really wanted to develop but i already devoted so much mental energy to figuring stuff out around it and envisioning things and hell would work and all sorts of stuff and now i have to like kind of like back up back out of that and that's but what really bothers me is that it's not just that there's like a lot of things i procrastinate yeah so i want to make i want to not do that because it's examples like that that are like that smack you in the face and should be you know a wake-up call to fix that kind of stuff and that's that's why i was you know more upset but it's um i do still have magic mushrooms for depression that's awesome and i think that and that's a that's a long chain kind of the idea behind that is when people search magic mushrooms for different i think it's magic might be just be mushrooms for impression um when they when they type that into a search that'll be the first thing that pops up yeah yeah mushrooms definitely help with suppression i don't know if you guys know but i suffer with extreme depression extreme that's not what it's called what is it what was it called that had another word what the dip remember they went with the ketamine it was like the study was on some sort of depression i can't remember like major depressive major major that's what it was mdd it's a disorder but yeah no so i have really severe depression um and it's really the only thing that's like really helped like help top like i feel like cannabis like helps make it like manageable tolerable but mushrooms actually fix the issue it um it feels like it's actually healing my mind and we're starting to think clearer and like just have different types of thoughts and ideas and i think it's it's um it's hard to talk about it just in one like one narrow way or whether it's like because there's it's good for depression if you use it at you know like a big macro dose of yeah and you do um a lot of inner work right when you're thinking about stuff that you wouldn't ordinarily think about and the mushrooms help your brain connect to itself so you figure things out like you never figured them out before um and there's another aspect to it which is this micro dosing which on a daily basis just makes you can make you just feel better like you just it doesn't you're not in that that depressive kind of mindset right um and it's you know i don't see the i haven't seen anything that's like negative right you know about it you know i've been you know trying to research that stuff as well yeah i haven't seen anything negative about it other than you have to kind of have some right right so so uh right they're not legal technically right certain places or not but there are like shaman and different places you could go to do them go to harvard you go to cambridge studies you can pack the can have it yet and take some mushrooms yeah so there's different um methods of microdosing so macrodose should be done like every once in a while um but there's different methods for microdosing there's uh one method is where you take take a microdose one day and then two days you do not take it and then you take it again and then two days off and then take it again two days off and it's supposed to be like ten percent of a macro dose so macro dose would be like 3.5 to five grams um and it's supposed to be ten percent of that so it'd be like point three to point five um but we actually do paul stamets method which is five days on two days off because the one day on two days off was not enough for me so five days on two days off and you don't really feel it i laugh so much more i feel really happy but other than that i don't feel it maybe gives me a little bit energy but yeah the heroic dose is anything over five like five to seven i i feel the same way yeah um but i also feel that it depends on what strain you have absolutely yeah because you know i think you want to be consistent with something yeah um yeah danny is a great source danny mcdevitt he has a lot of experience with uh mushrooms yeah yeah a lot of knowledge education does he have anything a lot of reading i don't believe so i don't believe so unfortunately yeah we um i wa i want to grow some shiitakes for sure shiitakes well we're also taking lines maine and the cordycep is really good too um i've met with a nurse practitioner yesterday and she's taking the turkey tail for immunity no i read a study there like doctor nurse yeah yeah yeah yeah she had her phd and nurse doctor yeah in nursing i don't know if you guys knew but nurses could also be doctors she has a phd in nursing which is very interesting but um i forgot what i was saying wait nurses can also be doctors what yeah nurses can also be doctors you're gonna blow some people's minds like doctorate nursing that sounds sounds made up gotta be gotta be truthful sounds made up there is a formula by paul stamets paul stamets has that movie it's um fungi uh fantastic fungi is the movie and his website is fungi.com and he is the host defense um the host defense mushrooms the brand you can get them through amazon too but he has like his own combination i think it's like seven or twelve different mushrooms and there's different combinations that you can get but i was reading an article earlier that said that eighty percent of the people who um have got coveted um had low vitamin c yeah which i'm one of those people so the functional mushrooms certain ones help you boost your immune system and i am also taking vitamin d yes uh you're getting all the vitamin d actually no i'm taking some too you're not getting it all the time [Laughter] [Music] are you taking sub two are you that's right i don't know what are you talking about it's really good for me and i don't get enough sun yeah phd nurse um paul stamets has more uh it has a micro dosing formula with other ingredients that enhance the micros yeah you can go to his website fungi.com watch fantastic fungi is a great movie um the reality of truth is a great movie yes it is spirulina interesting we have some of that here really spirulina huh hmm i used to take that it's like algae it's got protein in it it's gross it's horrible you know what though you won't taste any mushrooms say that danny has this crazy method of like putting uh is it lemon juice in there i don't know but we've we've done that and it was we were it was a pretty fun night i'm still a big fan of the tomato sauce the tomato sauce was really good we put it in tomato sauce and it was like just ended up taste it and it wasn't even warm it was just like cold to me it's not like we put it on a chicken cutlet or anything no we just just shoot it back cold tomato sauce in a cup i mean not when i think about it my stomach but but it's good tomato sauce it hit it really well it was good tomatoes because that already has like chunks in it you know so it didn't feel out of the ordinary that's how the italians do it let's throw it right in the sauce there just put it right on the pizza the mushrooms mushroom pizza man back in the day it's so funny when i think that how i used to micro dose back in the day did you yeah like and not even think about it right you were just taking them i was just like i'll just eat one yeah and i guess it's almost like those things where you self-medicate but you don't realize you're self-medicating you must have anyone's energy anyone's cannabis use is self-medicating really you know what's funny is i was thinking about it the other day and a lot of the stuff that i think when i started figuring things out about life and like all happened when i was like started taking mushrooms like around that time and i didn't realize that like what i was doing and maybe that's what helped me with my depression as well because i was at the same time um that my background and stuff yeah interesting interesting really interesting see and i guess i guess weed is a gateway drug because the only way i had mushrooms was because people treated traded me for weed that's funny so i'm freezing oh yeah yeah you ready to go i'm all right yeah i need to go put some socks on all right then he's freezing over here all right everybody we'll see you guys tomorrow yeah tomorrow at 9 10. special saturday show i'm excited i'm gonna go take like a one minute nap all right peace", "xe7vZw0Mx7Q": "hey i'm back time for another review today's review is of spinach white widow the indica dominant hybrid and i got my thing here loaded up ready to go total thc is 22.8 also looking at the white widow review on the lyft.co website and it's saying this frosty anytime hybrid is known for its woodsy and floral aromas yes definitely woody definitely floral comes from the strains my syringe whatever found in mango lemongrass hops in time and cure filing and sorry i don't know these words using a bunch of fancy words carol filing and a little little turpin profile what the hell white widow wow i mean exhale i got a very spicy flavor to it white widow is reported to produce a cheerful soothing conversational effect i don't know these all just say hybrid so none of them say in the cursitiva dominant so it's kind of like i have to ask to make sure that's what i'm getting because i asked for it any kid dominant [Music] yeah this is like the second or third or fourth spinach the strain that i've tried and they're all pretty good what's it just kind of like the name spinach doesn't like scream weed when you see this if you just saw this you might not immediately think this weed also my first blaze of the day though 3 30. i don't normally place this early yet but i'm not just reading people's reviews it's kind of funny packs a big punch for a small price big high for a little money great but gave me crazy munchies this is a great for getting buzz but not safe for your fridge i don't know i've never really noticed different strains making me more or less hungry it's like any strain i try i get hungry no matter what's trying to try i'll it'll make me hungry gently i've never really had anyone that was like not made me hungry as you can see my cat went into the cupboard for no reason because there's nothing i've never heard white widow in general is like a pretty good strain people it's a well-liked strain white widow has been described as among the most popular strangers in the world this is what wikipedia is saying now hybrid percentage was interesting i never really like looked up what google says when you just you just google the strain itself not with spinach just saying white widow and even right here there's like things on the side of the screen that show you stuff higher classification hemp origin netherlands hybrid percentage brazilian sativa plus south indican south indian indica scientific name cannabis sativa plus indica white widow i just ate something so i wonder if they'll make me want to eat again but i don't really need to there's my session and it was my first session of the day so so you know it's got a bit of a heaviness but nothing but nothing but not too bad that you won't can't do anything like if you wanted to do stuff after this to still be good if you wanted to chill out or go outside it's a nice relaxing high i mean it's indica dominant so it's not going to make you crazy energetic like i still feel almost as chill as i was before i just have a head high now that was a good one though white widow spinach about this at sweet tree cannabis on seventeenth ave my first time going there [Music] you gotta say that right next to papa john's pizza or something maybe it's not even there anymore i don't know but it's next to like a circle's k or whatever good place i go there again they got like a returning customer point system so that's cool so anyways get some white widow and have a nice chill high", "akyKHTB0qH4": "[Music] let's go youtube ministry boy man fellow signing him back with another video today I'm at Windy City cannabis it is a dispenser that sent home word you got to pick up a couple parts get wedding cake and I'm also about to grab our train Hayes or something like that but I'm gonna go grab two carts and then on my door review like usual although swaggy this way Corin C&I are some people like super cautious steel stick another wine but it's not as bad as when we go ahead last night he is why it shouldn't be much of a late a wait they got it like a little thing going on right now when you just you order online and then you get a time where you come pick it up at so I'm here at my time right now to pick it up I got the cards this is Ronald like I said wedding cake I'll just do some b-roll but another one ghost train hey that's what I got ghost train Hades I know something but I think welcome got like 81 percent to eighty seven percent I got both of them it was overall pleasant experience with the city Canada so give it like two thumbs up pretty simple I know this really fight doesn't matter to other people in other states it should like that because they're dispensaries aren't like that they don't operate like it's a banking [ __ ] but out here in [ __ ] Illinois act like the Spencer is our bank and you know there's like a security door behind a security door behind another security door what is good YouTube and we're back like I said I just got back from Windy City cannabis right now I got so this is what I miss using to smoke this is not a really cheap doesn't cost much at all pay my five bucks for it like I said ended up getting two carts I got like I said got wedding cake and the guy goes try and I used about 500 milligram how finally just short of what I usually do but this joint called and they don't costing me 65 on top of that I ended up paying my 75 attacks in other words so and I know what in other words robbery bro this is it right here waiting cake do some b-roll [Music] [Music] again this is Verano now use this sticks hit this [ __ ] that's that join us is it right here or on tone beep anyway this little thing screwed a [ __ ] in here reason why I got this one in particular could this convene I could just stick this in my pocket I'll take it with me looks to go it's smaller but yeah hey slow bro it's a smooth pen I just probably last me a month I use mine tickling too however they have much for you as far as like a player for flavor program which I taste this [ __ ] one more time I can't really taste much out of this I'm not really getting like a cake taste oh no matter like look up and let you guys know like whether that actually works I don't really taste nothing cake wise as far as like wedding cake but uh I do feel something is usually pretty instinct with cars it's just like this literally just like smoking flour which has been my experience still early just like smoking flour so yeah I just be starting to feel some already that first day I took what was pretty was pretty damn massive but yeah and that man I'm gonna let you guys know I like I said hey buddy taste it tastes just a bit sweet but I outside of that any taste nothing I'm for real but eighty percent THC it is a hybrid I saw an indica and sativa and yeah other than that miniature boy man I appreciate you guys supporting the content two channels still steadily growing steadily growing and I'm just nothing but appreciated appreciate it to you guys and I've been in my experience that Windy City cannabis I give it two thumbs up as far as like I had like a bad experience I went to security guard but outside of everybody was cool most people was cool just like one little bit it didn't really blow it I still recommend though they're cheaper than the ones are that's gonna say that cuz they have yeah overall great experience I give this to thumbs up with them filling it for sure outside that man should I pick although I'm out under that this pan yo and I feel like my face is melting off right now", "4AvISpz3z_E": "hey welcome to cannabase IG's today we're taking a detailed look at how to use 510 oil cartridges with vape and batteries this episode is brought to you by New York vape shop you can find all the devices that were using in the demonstration today at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with the code rough 3 first we're going to take it look at the anatomy of a 5-10 cartridge first I want to talk about the tip and the tips are pretty much a up to you like however you decide which is your preference is they come in all types of metal they're come in ceramic and they come in wood so the tips are pretty much straightforward next we're going to talk about the tanks the tanks themselves are what holds the oil and they're usually half a milliliter to one milliliter and sometimes the really big ones like the two gram or 2.2 gram heavy hitter cartridges can be really long but referring to the tank is the actual part of the cartridge where the oil is inside of it the two part and then there's the oil inlet and sometimes they come in various whole sizes you can see the one at the top there has a little bit larger hole size than the cartridge there at the bottom and generally for the thicker THC oils you probably want more of a thicker hole then there's the airflow if you can see at the very very bottom this is a bottom airflow and you can see that the airflow hole is right there in the threads at the bottom of the device other devices sometimes have them at the top near the tip and so generally one is either a bottom airflow in most cases sometimes a top airflow and then there's also what they call a variable airflow and you say the case here the airflow is adjustable at the top there so that's the one one thing to consider as well as part of your cartridge and the last and perhaps the most crucial part that we're going to talk about there's here at the base and that is the atomizer and the atomizers are usually either wick or ceramic and the wick they're okay but preferably you probably want to use ceramic today's you get a lot better even distribution better flavor and you see the ceramic heats the oil as it passes through now let's talk about best practices one of the most important things when it comes to using your 510 cartridges with a pin is to use the right voltage setting and you can see generally if it's a variable voltage for these kinds of pins that will vary somewhere between three and five volts and that's the appropriate range for most 510 cartridges but if you're using something like a box mod like the steam cloud that you see here that goes up to sixty watts it's going to be way too much so you're going to want to bring that down to like five watts or to the lower settings and to make sure that you're using the proper voltage or wattage another thing that you want to make sure is that using the proper airflow type you can see this is a bottom airflow device but used on this box mod if you pull it all the way in there there's no air inlet and so for this is the type that you'll need a top airflow so there are types of devices that may not be compatible with certain types of cartridges so that is one thing you want to make sure that for instance of this case you'd want to use a top airflow device and a variable and would be even better and you can see here - this is a bottom airflow and on the bottom airflow there will be a little bitty notch where the air would be allowed to flow through at the bottom of the device so you just want to make sure that you're using the right kind with the right type of device another thing is that when it comes to your empty device you probably just want to throw it and not throw it away but you want to refill it and not just keep hitting it because you're going to burn it out so when you get done with it either go ahead and toss it it's done or stop hitting it until you're ready to refill it or you're going to burn it out another thing is when you're putting in your pocket you really want to be careful with the tips especially with the ones that have an exposed tip and rather than sitting down into a sleeve because if you leave it in your pocket you can do something like this a lot of times it'll bend the tip over one way or the other can expose the electronics and cause you some problems so if you're going to be putting it in your pocket you might want to go with a device such as this where the cartridge sits down inside of it like a sleeve and the last tip we're going to go with here is to make sure that you keep your battery charged or keep a backup battery so if you have a nice pin that you like to use you might want to keep a little cheap on the side that you can have always kind of have as a backup by your charge in the other and that pretty much brings me to the end of my tips and

medical is what strain should I use to treat my insomnia now it's a it's a great question but keep in mind that strains are very diverse and they can vary even from producer to producer or even within the same producer so what we recommend is to take a number of different factors into consideration first and foremost insomnia is not generally an isolated condition it's usually comorbid with other conditions and that could be chronic pain it could be anxiety it could be depression it could be any number of different things so when you're treating your your insomnia it's important to look at these these other conditions as well and treat those now also keep in mind that everybody is unique in terms of their physiology and how they react to drugs so what may work for Suzy may not work for Joe so it's gonna take likely a little bit of trial and error to find the strain that works best for you additionally we also have cannabinoids and turkeys which are extremely important to look at so you've probably heard the descriptions of indica dominant strains and sativa dominant strains those terms are becoming less relevant as there's been so much crossbreeding but they still are good as general markers and what we find is that indica strains know more people report having success treating insomnia with indica strains and that may be because of a terpene called mercy so mersin actually is a sedative itself and it seems to work synergistically which with THC to help promote sleep so when you go to a dispensary important thing to look at is to find strains that have mercy and content so over 0.5 percent or above is typical for many indica dominant strains and that can run up to 3 percent sativa strains sativa dominant strains on the other hand tend to be far less than that and oftentimes people find sativa dominant strains to increase anxiety and other things that may affect your sleep so look for strains again that a rich have a rich terpene profile ideally Rick mersin don't go for high THC because high THC can actually increase anxiety and other things and can cause some sleeplessness a restlessness when you're trying to get to sleep if you have any other questions like this we invite you to join the sana health lab at Zana health lab calm where you can continue your clinical cannabis journey with access to all sorts of free resources we look forward to seeing

too go and check them out i try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now instead of show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with tom ford kush so this is a really good strain i can tell by smelling it it almost smells like the white wedding which was a really good kind i tried from the liquor store and it was like 40 something bucks for three and a half it was like really really good so let's smoke the big joint i roll to this and take a nice thorough review of the tom ford kush so it is an indica and it's 25 thc which it ain't the highest but it's up there so let's light this up [Music] [Music] i rolled a little bit of tight little tight but it's not the weeds problem it does have a very nice taste though [Music] so it has like a actually really sweet taste but it actually tastes really fresh too so let's pull a butt out and take a nice look at the buds too so this one here this is a very nice size bud let's take a nice close look at it so it's like a very nice color green with very nice hairs lots of crystal on it it does look very good so this is five grams but it's very compressed so there's one nice size buds and they all the other ones are about just medium sized butts but they are all very nice and it does have a very strong taste it tastes very delicious the best way i could describe it it's oh no strong flavored but it's really sweet and it's like strong flavor but it tastes really fresh you know some weed you can taste it it hasn't i don't know it just doesn't taste that fresh but this has a very fresh taste to it it's hard to explain but it does taste very nice like i said it's an endica it's 25 percent tom ford i definitely recommend it if you get a chance to try it out i've ever met oh i can't talk i recommend this kind too it's pink island kush i'm pretty sure i've done a review on it before but it's a very nice kind too so if you ever get a chance to try the island pink skunk it is pretty good too it's 25 indica as well and yeah it's very good i'll take a bite out so you can have a nice look at this kind as well because it's another really good kind i do enjoy it has kind of more of like well it says skunk so it has more of like a skunky smell to it but it has like a very nice taste to it it's a little sour tasting but it tastes very good and deathbob is another good one too but i've already done a couple recommendations or a couple reviews on that i'm starting to feel pretty good up this stuff already it's definitely a good strain i'll give the taste of four out of five at least because it's a pretty [ __ ] good taste i was maybe even yeah i'll say four out of five it is a very good taste and i am starting to feel pretty freaking good so let me know down in the comment section if you have any recommendations you want me to try or if you want to see me do a review of it i'll try to get it out and we'll try it out so with that oh yeah i wanted to say if you i know i already smoked i didn't get a chance to review i smoked i was impatient but this stuff the willy wonka or willy's wanders by diamond it's a very good type of shatter i definitely recommend it sorry my dog does trying to get out or whatever so we'll end this off soon so i can take my boy out so with that i'll give the um account rating it doesn't look very big but it is very packed buds are nice and hard so i know this will get a good a good amount of it so i'll give it a three and a half out of five for a count by a four and a half a four out of five for taste so yeah i definitely recommend it you get a chance to try out the tom ford go get it for yourself or the willy's wand is shattered that's that's pretty good too it's by diamond concentrates so go try that and let me know

be taking some millenium extracts blueberry which is a 70 percent THC and we are going to be putting it into this cartridge which as you can see right here is an eye crusher JC 1:05 standard 510 thread cartridge all right well let's heat this up and get it on okay prepare the oil you're going to fill the cartridge with take your cartridge remove the mouthpiece now you're going to want to take your applicator and put it as far into as possible then slowly begin to dispense your oil into the cartridge [Music] if you have a very thick oil you'll see that it takes a while to move farther down into the cartridge that's just something that takes a while to do make sure you get as much of it as far down as possible we're going up filling up the rest of the cartridge once it is full leaving a little bit of space [Music] take your cartridge would you know filled with oil put the mouthpiece back on it's over screw it closed now we're going to take this cartridge and let it warm up a little bit and that all those bubbles float on out of there so here it is all ready to go this is the eye crusher JC 105 as you can see right there I crusher it's a very popular 510 thread Partridge we are going to be trying this out on our ego - very nice battery we've had for a while all right let's try this thing out for function [Music] all right well there you have it nice smooth flavor on it seem to work good got some nice function on it all right well these can be found at vape parts Mart calm you make sure you swing over there and have a look at them if you're looking for some cartridges to refill they've got a very nice widest orbit well thanks for tuning in uisidenav salute wonderful day peace", "R5PhrxL2nhk": "[Music] hey guys how's it going welcome back to our Channel thank you for joining us today we will be looking at three different plants a lot of people have asked that we show them some local stuff so we're going to show you three local high grades that we have mystery seed a B and C and they're just basically some different strains we are not sure exactly what strains they are but they all are local grown and we will see how these come along so you guys stay tuned okay guys so we've got three different strains of local high-grade weed hair at least we think that there are three different strains based on how they've grown thus far we've got mystery seed a which appears to be an indica dominant strain because of its wider multi-finger leaves we did not top this plant just yet we let here grow a bit just so that she can get a little bit talk [Music] second up we've got mystery seed B now this plant seems to be a bit of a hybrid we've topped this plant very early on and started some low stress training to increase both sides as you can see we've got a strict training routine and last but not least we've got mystery seed see this plant appears to be a sativa dominant strain because of its skinny multi fingered leaves sativas generally have a longer flowering period you prefer indica or sativa let us know in the comment section below so now that you all have a bit of background they're going to transplant these kids into larger pots we've already transplanted mystery seed a because it was growing so quickly we put her into a seven gallon fabric pot but the other two will be going into smaller regular pops okay guys so we've got our pots and it's time to transplant mystery seeds B and C the hybrid and the sativa we use our standard transplanting technique while applying Ruling powder to help the plant through the transplant if you want to learn more tips and tricks about transplants and rooting powder be sure to check out our double og cursed girl video if you like what you're seeing so far please smash the like button and subscribe because we do this every week [Music] okay guys so now that transplant is complete we will simply write down the plots and make sure that it's clear of any harmful debris or bacteria we will also water the plant at the roots just to saturate the medium and to activate the root powder after the transplants so a few more days have passed and today will be defoliating and low stress training plants a and C the indica dominant and the sativa dominant plants we won't be doing anything to the hybrid plant P because we already top and start in low stress training from Young [Music] you we will also not be topping either of these plants just yet we may still top them at some points in the future but for now we're leaving them to grow now bear in mind when you defoliate your plants they do look a bit bare or naked but they usually bounce back within a few days we also had to use a lighter and a toothpick to create holes in the plant pot to attach our ties for your stress training he also did use some garden wire just a hole now in the lower branches [Music] [Music] all right growers and that's it for today's video until next time thank you so much for watching please smash that

an authentic bag right here i paid 41 out the door for this shopping mall so yeah let's just see how much should i pay yes 40. 40 99 you see that for a full gram cartridge not bad not bad so this is ambrosia this is their nug live resin line and uh yeah as you can see in the back all that good stuff the the percentages i believe it's uh eighty percent exactly well not exactly but that's what they put it and also the manufacture date and all that stuff is uh fairly new about three three months old so not bad date of manufacture is a bit older i think april so but got the nug family i haven't had a nug cartridge in a while i've only had one of their cartridges i forgot what strain it was but i just remember that it was a actually a pretty pleasant experience um i did enjoy it and it lasted pretty long so i'm excited to try this other one and uh let's just see if i can find my battery all right so if you didn't know by now i lost my chill battery i dropped it in the hole when we went to sf you should have seen that video by now but it's unfortunate but we got the press slide right here so you just okay well it's a ceramic heating core as well so that's pretty dope and also nugg.com if you guys want to check them out so just pull it out to use attack wow okay you got the logo right there let's do a little box little thumbnail action hopefully it's getting it go up go down right there so we're going to be hitting it in my dash vape retro you guys already know the deal and uh yeah this is looking pretty good i'm not gonna lie screw that bad boy in let me know if you've tried nug before like i said i've tried it only once and i really enjoyed it it lasted really long compared to these other cartridges so uh i'm pretty excited let's see i haven't used this battery in a while i've been using my chill one so cheers boys oh very very smooth you can you can tell that ceramic heating oil works because i do not taste no burning sensation very very smooth hit it's very very comparable to an erza i'm not gonna lie wow let me take that hit again this is the ambrosia by the way cheers boys that's a blinker for a blinker it's not as fat hits that i'd uh i'd normally see from other live resin cartridges um but the taste is there wow i feel like i could probably like do a five second hit and then a blinker and that will do a pretty decent size hit which is what i'm gonna do so hold on oh there you go wow that is really enjoyable so would i like i said what i remember from the other nug is that it lasts longer than other cartridges so i'm hoping this one lasts just as long because i'm really enjoying the flavor here uh for 41 dollars is generally the price of what you get from typical live resin cartridges uh except for the exception of urza which is like 55 to 60. but this is good i'm not gonna lie like i'm honestly it's one of the better tasting live resins that i've tried lately lately and uh i don't know where i'm gonna be placing this but i know it's on my top five nug is definitely on my top five uh from my last top five video i said i believe it was four or three um i just feel like maybe buddies edged it out a little bit because they had more of a selection and it's a bit cheaper but this taste like i've been on a bad roll right now of buying products and not liking it and honestly i'm kind of happy that i bought this uh this was like the only one in the display that they had left that authentic so i knew that maybe out of all the strains that they had of the nut cartridge that this one was the one that was chose the most and honestly i'm glad i chose this wow i'm really enjoying this and look at it i think i barely even touched it and i just did maybe like two three blinkers maybe two let me take another hit for you guys so like i said the hints aren't going to be as fat for you know blinkers on other live resin cartridges but not [ __ ] bad not [ __ ] bad i'm probably gonna take two more hits off of this and then and then we're just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed this video if you haven't tried nut cartridges i've tried two out of i've tried two of them so far and it's been two out of two [ __ ] a hit so uh i'm gonna take two more hits like i said cheers boys enjoyable so also i'll post the link to this battery if you guys are interested in that i believe the cheapest that i've seen it was like 15 to 20 i don't know and then there's obviously uh shipping involved but nonetheless very very good battery from daz vape shout out to them always supporting me um yeah just uh i don't know i'm happy about this cartridge right now i'm ecstatic that i bought this cartridge i was gonna buy another buddy's cartridge because i did lose my buddy's cartridge i was gonna buy another train wreck but then i was like let's just try something new and a nug well it's not totally new because i've done a video on their their uh i forgot what strain it was but it was a good strain i'm gonna take another hit for you the last hit and then we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video you know like it subscribe if you haven't already if you want to and yeah i'll take this hit cheers boys all right guys peace out [Music] [Music] you", "hy-SxCzqW6I": "YouTube went up lit up we got a box from wax liquidiser like that just made me so happy rather a big oh gee cush Terp Terp this must be original probably because they're giving me all the Terps they want me to make a Terp one so I'm sure this is flavorless another original sweet mixing container mixer we're gonna take a look at this Sour Diesel [Music] needles rocks liquidiser thank you so much I'm gonna make some sweet videos and another company today came its CBD five it looks like a pen and a couple happy cartridges I don't know if the CBD is inside of it or what or something so it's just fate there's some super nice adjustable tanks these are official tanks so I'll use in tanks with the wax liquid that is so it's pretty much worked out pretty good that's a sweet tank all right guys you guys Rock subscribe wax liquid thousands of videos coming up court judges", "25ZPhrmHCNs": "holy [ __ ] that one that one was hot I'm excited to have my hands on this so I can finally give it a try this is the 710 labs life resin pod I've had a lot of 7-10 labs concentrate to my day but this is totally new to me I haven't even opened the box yet yeah comes with a little instruction manual and the pot got a live little peek C logo they put it on all the cartridges I always just pull it off I'm not gonna lie it looks like there's pretty good stuff in there it looks super thick I usually [ __ ] with 7/10 labs so I expect this to be a pretty good experience here's what it looks like with the battery that you have to buy separately because I don't know any other battery company that makes up pod for this this is [ __ ] weird I don't know any company that has a pod like this and I don't know any battery company that makes a battery like this so this is super unique I don't really think that's a good thing but let me try the pin out before I voice my opinion [Music] that's pretty smooth really doesn't have a crazy taste I hid it until it wouldn't let me hit it anymore it's on a full charge I don't think this battery changes heat settings but it does have like a light indicator here and when it's green it's above 50% then when it's 20 percent to 49 it'll go to blue and then it's at red when it's below 20 percent battery so that's kind of cool you can know where your battery life is actually at all right that hid a little better in swears usually the first date of a car or a pen usually the best one and then it just gets progressively worse but that second head was way nice done the first one I want to point out the definite difference in color between the box and the actual pen like this is a actually angry oily color and then on the box it looks like it's like bright yellow I've had the Z or Z before I thought it was called C Oz but the guidance offender told me it's called zoz so I've been going with it when I dad did it tasted a lot better than it does out of this pen but this is their cure for which is like their lower level actually believe it's the lowest here I think they just do it 1 2 3 or 4 so that might be one of the taste isn't that great it's not bad but like I've had some cards recently where I'm like damn this is so [ __ ] flavorful and there's light pressing cartridges this is a la Crescent cartridge and I'm really not getting a crazy flavor up [Music] definitely starting to feel the effects a little bit and then nice little head higher I do want to say it is very smooth this is a waste another hit that I really ever expected out of a cartridge this is definitely some new technology I really don't think I like it though like this battery shape I do really like actually it's pretty sleek but the charger and the USBC and like who has that I mean I actually like you so I guess I can't fish but I have one USBC charger in my house and I have like 50 normal USB chargers I don't think a lot of people have USB C charges just laying around like a couple people do but not like the vast majority which is I think what you should still hate or - I know 7/10 laughs is more of a higher-up company but it's just like they were like how could we make this as difficult as possible let's find a pallet battery that nobody has ever used before so people have to buy the battery now let's give them an annoying charger like I don't know I feel like they were just like trying to be annoying when they were making this battery but for all I know in two years this battery is going to be the standard and I'm probably gonna be eating my words and they were totally ahead of the game [Music] this really doesn't give you a long blinkers man the design on this pen is definitely cool it's pretty trippy I like how it kind of wraps around the side of the pen so each side you get a little bit of something like doesn't have that weird no sniffle either I just realized you know how sometimes when you smoke a cartridge you're like really tickles your nose this is not that at all the total THC is 80 point four one percent and the total CBD is 0.1 nine and eighty percent THC is pretty high for a pen actually a lot of especially on the black market a lot of pens though a 97 percent THC and a cartridge and it's like bro if your pen is 97 percent THC like it would not burn them those wicks that is not possible honestly anything above 80 is not gonna burn very easily in a normal cartridge so I've always been wearing when I've seen like 85 90 percent even in the PA market I've seen it before I've seen th see that's like 95 percent THC just to live like tested in a jar and it's like a [ __ ] Rock I just don't see how I could possibly get that in the cartridge damn that is actually Sunday pretty hard now yeah dude 710 labs get your [ __ ] baked sorry for the lack of content on my page recently you guys got some big things on the way I don't want to share them until it's officially out but I'm super excited to share with you what I have going on with popcorn in the near future and obviously when I was in Denver the last week of it we got my dog spayed so I was actually like kind of busy being attentive to her and then since I've been back I've been getting my house ready because my girlfriend's actually moving in with me her lease is up in September but she's just kind of over being in Colorado so she's gonna fly here with Piper next week so I've been getting my house prepared because I've lived here by myself the entire time which there's enough space for both of us but I've definitely spread out all my [ __ ] so I've been consolidating stuff and you know just getting everything prepared so when she moves back here she can just move right in I was thinking about doing another Q&A video too so if there's any questions you have you can leave a comment in the YouTube video I'm gonna try to pull as many off yours I can oh my god man I'm setting to get pretty [ __ ] big I'm not gonna lie oh my god feels good to be back you ever get like so big sometimes that you feel like you're like a different person so and you're like wow I like literally feel like I'm like an alter-ego all of a sudden like I am not the same person I was 20 seconds ago nothing really anything serious it's just like you were like in a bad mood and now all of a sudden you're just carefree like well it is like Jeff too has arrived it is a whole new version of me I remember the first time I took a gigantic dab it was like four weeks into that like I was thinking blobs but like I don't like a half gram that like it was ridiculous and I remember like I was so high but like I was almost tripping if you guys have seen the movie the masks where Jim Carrey has like this alter-ego were he like puts on a green mask and he's like a totally different like crazier person I felt like that was me oh whoa okay I am the man in the mask right now holy [ __ ] like I am lit but usually I'll just get super awkward what am i honestly I'm super awkward when I'm sober it's like a social anxiety I have I just I don't know I don't know what to say sometimes I don't know what to do like what I do with my hands work put like what the [ __ ] I'm just weird brah but please if you ever seen me in public and want to say I feel free to even though I'm a little after it I really don't mind I think it's going to meet you guys it kind of helps but I face the the people I'm making videos for and all I are super [ __ ] chill I don't know what it is but everyone haven't met it's been like nothing but kind of friendly Beckham I say what's up oh but I'm curious how long this is going to take the bat out still looks like there's a decent amount of oil in there two giant air bubbles on this side really doesn't have the best taste though like the highs nice it's okay when you actually think with just a glee about buying your own separate pen having to have this whole separate pot system it's just too much the flavor was alright at first but it's really really lawful flavor it's like resin it's not dis Calypso it should be a little bit better flavor you think but I am getting so high yeah I really honestly think I'd rather just buy gram of 7/10 left like Ross and the BIOS pen and battery I feel like at least at the cost of what it is now I feel like this is going to be more of a gimmicky thing or more for like the heady boys that just want to have it but really isn't for like that everyday smoked beer like this isn't really something you need to have oh I guess where these blinkers aren't too rough on you I'm trying something to spend in one sitting but I don't know if it's gonna happen guys this really shouldn't taste as bad as it does for the amount of oil that's still left in there there's gonna be a long day boys holy [ __ ] that one down what was i that [ __ ] hurt oh my god that was intense but double records how you do it boys oh my god [Music] oh yeah it tastes like [ __ ] that - we'll just burn through it right oh my god I'm getting so I I have to be getting pretty close to the end there's some giant air bubbles in there please and soon and drops in this video if you take one second just like like for me I would really appreciate it it goes a long way you'd be surprised what a like would do so if you're watching any of my videos and you like it please click like I'd really appreciate it this one's for everybody that clicks like triple oh my god hope you got oh that hurts a bad one I do that goddamn whoo it's weird how a pen high is so much different than like a weed high it's looking at joint we're so gonna pen like if I took this many hits of a joint I would be a totally different high it's not like I'm not high though it's just that like a joint just hits different and like weed dabs just hit different than pens I don't know what it is I feel like if I took it dab with the amount of stuff I just smoked chances are I'd be higher off the dad I don't know though maybe that's just me god be suck no no I to die one have so many levels of emotions on me so I'm like this is awesome it's like it's okay it's like all right that's pretty cool it's like this sucks like this isn't such an emotional roller coaster I really don't know how to feel about these when I had the live resident of the cr-z it was way tastier than this like I was actually like my blood how pasty it was I was like wait this is Rossum like that's how good I thought it was and then now I'm like hitting this pen only yeah this is trash I don't think I've ever had any string of seven ten laps that was Tier four so maybe once they hit Tier four it is really just like the bottom of the barrel but there's so many better things you can buy at the dispensary instead of this and RJ even from 7-10 labs like the amount of money it cost for a battery and the pot itself it's like just by a grandma live rosin it'll go a lot longer and be a lot more enjoyable like this this sucks no cold is this telling me I don't see it anywhere dude the amount of information Colorado gives you is nuts like versus Pennsylvania like this is the one thing that blows my mind this is the kind of information you get out of one of your most popular Colorado companies you know you get the THC CBD batch number yada yada in Pennsylvania they have the date of his package do they have like a code for the person who packaged it they have the THC the CBD the CBN the CBC all that [ __ ] there's so much more testing in Pennsylvania you really have a better idea what you're actually smoking when you get [ __ ] from PA it cost so much goddamn money though [Music] this thing's hitting hard however it tastes like [ __ ] dirt getting up triple I'm so so almost empty you can see my hand oh my god I decide to ever oh my god you guys I'm

"6dzOkUqLt54": "hi I'm Ellie K and this is a Florida marijuana video exclusive [Music] in this video I'm going to talk to you about a medical marijuana product that's made and sold by truely which is a medical marijuana dispensary here in Florida the OG have a party room truly is the medical cannabis product meant for use by legal cannabis patients here in Florida while truly offers many types of cartridges and vape systems this particular cartridge can be used with either a Mystica battery or a pen battery such as the silver pen battery from tree leaf og cush is a hybrid strain meaning that it has components of a sativa strain and an indica strain many hybrids can be described as balanced oh gee coach is actually originally from Florida while oh gee push is from Florida originally it's actually gained a lot of popularity on the west coast now I'm gonna share with you what I think about the product myself and what I thought when I was trying it out in vaping the OG Kush strain beverage my take on this strain is that the taste is very unique it has an earthiness to it with woodsy pine and almost a lemony sort of zest feeling to it it's very very earthy it's a different taste for sure and the buzz is awesome I like it a lot the effects of the strain could be described as uplifting euphoric and happy each time I've used the og frustrating that I've been satisfied with the balanced pleasant effects my anxiety fades away but I feel clear enough mentally to not feel intoxicated or overly sedated that's something that I like a lot in this strain is that it helps with my anxiety and if you're someone who also suffers from anxiety at all or PTSD you probably know that there's kind of a fine line between finding something that helps you to relax without making you feel too tired to function and I love oh gee coach because I feel like that's kind of it's it's one of it is so who is this product good for I'd say that it's really good for most patients honestly in my personal opinion like I said it's very balanced and it can provide a great clear-headed morning daytime strain feeling for you with you just take a few drag two draws and then if you take a few more depending on how you dose this product you can definitely achieve some more relaxing effects so to unwind at the end of the day it might feel really good for you to take this product legal medical marijuana patient myself and some of you suffers from anxiety a lot I can say that I'm really grateful that I found this product because it does definitely Road that relaxation and that euphoria without taking away from about taking away from your clarity and your ability to enjoy and take in everything that's happening around you in life I don't think it's about a lot of streams but I will tell you I really do think that the OG Kush is an anytime string if suited for daytime nighttime whenever you need relief with your cannabis products in Florida as a medical patient I'm Ellie K for Florida marijuana net", "5_j1gkyZgLc": "[Music] you", "zVQruAIpxWk": "[Music] welcome to wheat entertainment and we love talking about grandy flora strains and this bud is something called yada da and it's really a unique looking bud but it was crunchy dry when i got it i opened up this bag and then i set it down and now it's even drier because i think i got this thing i don't know three weeks ago a month ago it just sat in the back i don't know why i didn't review it but i didn't do it so today's the day for yada da and let me load my little scooper into vapor cup straw i've already got two in here we're gonna add the third then we're gonna tamper and we're going to stick this down in the vapor cup then we're going to talk about yadda da yada comes in this bag and i got this at cookies maywood i got this at the apples and bananas drop down there i ran down there they held that for me and there were some comments on wheat entertainment so i grabbed it when i was down there and this flower has 26 thc and people are asking for the package date and uh so i'm going to give it that but to get that date i need a magnifying glass because my eyes aren't so good anymore so this is the package manufactured it is 9 29 20. oh no wonder it's so dry it's been in this bag for months right and you know what's crazy you would think that they're saving money on the jars right so at least they would give us some kind of moisture pack in here so these flowers when they come out of this bag are more fresh so let's say i got this the beginning january was harvested three months before crazy just crazy but anyway it's not about the dryness i don't wait for that so even though i note it that has nothing to do with my ratings my ratings are all about the something something and everyone's got their own something something that they're looking for but what i'm looking for are heavy flowers with focus that could grin me out i have to stay active i have a lot of responsibilities have to take care of i need flowers that can let me do that now i'm also a heavy hitter so a lot of the flowers even though i call them focus flowers they could stone you to the bone but it doesn't necessarily do that for me but certain ones do like the couch lock flowers but this isn't about catch lock i'm not looking for those type of flies this is about focused flowers that can grin me out so today it's jan dada turn to get the review we're looking for the best well let's check it out so you can see that's about amount a time it takes for vapor cup to work you can see that right there that's the terpenes the cannabinoids the water vapor and the oil vapor you can see it condenses right on the straw it takes about a minute and 20 once this cup is hot and also a lot of people have vapor cup so make sure your cup is hot if the cup is hot you need less time in the chamber if it's a fresh you just start it up you're going to need more time in the chamber and that's one of the things when you get vapor cup you got to learn use but i love this thing this thing changed my life but today it's about yada da so let's check it out yada da by grandiflora at 330 degrees out of vapor cup let's do this again so this flower's got a light og taste with a pungent pal but there's much bigger pungent pals than this one but it has it and the pungent pal it's i'm gonna say it's something like the chicken wing you know when you go buy chicken wings you smell it it makes you kind of like the ammonia taste people say ammonia but if you try vapor cup i'm going to tell you it's a pungent pal this flower took me a lot of flour to get stoned actually but it definitely got me stoned this flower's strong enough but not super strong and i thought it was good so what did i rate yada da i'm looking for the best and this flower you know at first i'm saying it's not strong enough but i used a really lot of it i used up half an eighth on the session i mean i really used a lot of it and in the end the feeling was actually kind of good it wasn't heavy it wasn't you had focus or didn't have focus i would say it was like a cruiser a little bit i wish it personally would have been a little heavier this flower gets an 8.65 which means it's a good flower if you're not a super heavyweight yeah it's a try but for someone who's a super heavyweight this flower may be not strong enough for them it was good but there's definitely better out of granny flora if you want to get a vapor cup this item right here and i'm telling you instead of smoking your flour up and joints get one of these things that little bit of flour that i put into this cup can last you 10 minutes and stone you to the bone i love this thing makes so many opportunities for use i love it and you can see it at vaporcup.com if you want to see my favorite picks you can see them on wheat entertainment.com that site's just getting updated right now it's going to have my top 100 strains in la out of 1500 strains i tried this is my journey i'm looking for the best thanks for joining in if you have a tip for me leave it below the video i'm the doctor i post every day but sunday it's my day off party on my friends [Music] you", "gA_u309IDA8": "welcome to community cannabis review today i'm going to be reviewing an avatar or avitas cured resin a cartridge all avatars as far as i know are single origin extracts and they make um distillates cured resin and live resin carts and pax pods as well so they're super high and super high quality from what i've seen so i haven't tried one before just do the price tag but i've been wanting to try one for a while so here's here it is and i'll give you a close-up and then try it out and let you know what i think [Music] let's try this thing out and read it um talk about it so forth so this is made by avatars which as i said seems to be a pretty high-end brand i've wanted to try them for some time um the strain is cherry og which i looked into it seems to be a mix of cherry thai afghan and lost coast og which all seem to be pretty old strains so this might be a fairly old strain as well this is single origin hybrid cured resin meaning it all comes from same grow of cherry og you're not getting a bunch of different growers people's cherry og so that adds to the price tag of these carts that's pretty exciting though uh that just makes you feel that much safer with what you're getting and know this proper um the strain and everything about it really it is cured resin i opted for cured resin over live resin because i'm actually one of the probably one of the few people who i think i like cured resin more than um lime resin i like i feel like generally a more complex taste and it has more more terpenes that live resin is usually overshadowed by like beta miracin pint um limonene a couple others like that where some of the heavier ones seem to stick around in the curing process and get more interesting ones so anyways um very nice looking packaging as you can see very sharp um these are i think 40 recreationally um i got mine i think it was like that'd be like 32 med and then i got 25 off that bringing it down to like i don't know what uh eight dollars off that twenty four dollars or so i know it's like 36 for the live resin then a little cheaper than both of these for they also have ultra which i think are distillate carts all of them are single source they're all a little pricey they all look really good so that's probably part of it oh okay let's get on the back first on the back you got cherry og one gram thc coming in at 82.3 percent or 823 milligrams for a container cbd is at loq um you've got 10 total terpenes in this and um okay and then you got thirty percent of that ten percent is beta cardiophiline i guess i'll just say that um what it is of the total thing it should be three percent beta cardiophiline one point nine percent selenidine one point one percent pinene one percent limonene one percent cedrol c-e-d-r-o-l i'm not familiar with that one that's exciting um nine point zero point nine percent humulene zero point six percent alpha cedrine and then alph um zero point five percent alpha terpenial so as you can see pretty complex and also a lot more terps that you don't really see so often oh weird anyways that's someone going down the street that's cool so this was made on what is seven um march april may june okay july i'm terrible with months sorry this was made on july 13th 2020 and tested on july 15th a little bit older than the other cards i've been getting but still not old at all really in the in cards i start wearing one they're about like a year older um you got light scale labs report id they even have the report id on here so you can look up their um lab reports how cool is that um and then they got the uid so you got everything there all the general info a lot of info on the terpenes which i like and potentially more if you look at light scale labs who they run a lot of tests or a test for a lot of companies around here a lot of the good ones especially i see use light scale labs and some lower end ones we'll use rose city but i don't think there's any real like correlation uh i think it's just a lot of lower end companies have a lot of like lines and brands like mana and lovely and um a lot of things like that so they probably just use the same people usually all right so when you open this up you got this which is super cool i probably should have showed you a close-up but i'll take a picture of it and post it in here too um let's see if focusing helps at all not too much but that's all right so what it says says avatars natural additive and flavoring free no pg vg or peg which is um okay i don't know i just uh don't remember the what that stands for but it's often used in vape vape juices and whatnot that says for best results store upright at 65 to 75 fahrenheit ensure the battery is fully charged for best taste use a 3.7 volt battery not recommended for refilling okay um and then you got same stuff but in like a little picture form got full battery 3.7 volts i think that's just the cart with a little up arrow saying store it up right and then at 65 to 75 degrees fahrenheit and then you also get this interesting thing definitely will know if you ever got a fake if anyone tried to fake these because these are pretty intricate little packages so you got that which kind of holds it up oh wow i'm gonna have to use scissors which luckily i have some right by yeah it looks like you gotta use scissors to open this there's really no easy way to open that might be able to find a way but i don't really see the need to so i'll just slice that and here you are really beautiful oil in there very very clean looking i know nothing wants to focus on this but that's alright and i'll take that sticker off like i always do very nice looking looks vaguely cloudy on the camera but it doesn't look like that in real life it's very very clear so again you get a jupiter c cell high quality c c-cell very no leaks or anything like that so all good jupiter is always fitting my vessel jupiter's fitting everything i swear those are some of the best cartridges you can get all right so it says for best results 3.7 volts which i'm 99 sure is going to be the um the middle setting on my vessel so let's try this out cherry og beautiful vapor production as usual with jupiter c cells that taste is so good damn that is a good good card right there it's already one of my favorites right now that's so good just an effect on everything so far or we'll see about effects i mean but like taste and vapor production that's smooth in the lungs and everything wow that is a solid cart high quality right there these might be like my new favorites a little pricey so it's hard to grab them as often but that is seriously good so it's a pretty clear taste too that's when you get i guess i don't know if it's from like single origin or just the quality of the production or what but i mean i have no problem like getting a good taste off that very very much like you got a very like earthy taste to it i lean heavily for earthy on this one which is weird it says it's mostly cardio filling um let me get that yeah now it's kind of like a not not very spicy because all the other terps and i don't know if it being cured matters at all but it's not a very spicy but it's very like earthy not very herbal but like very earthy um and then you got some nice cherry undertones see where they get the cherry from um yes i'm just like sweet cherry tom um i would say cherry because like usually there is definitely like a berry taste i'm not quite sure what ter what terpene it is but there's definitely like a berry taste that cannabis can produce and it usually reminds me of blueberry or like rasp kind of like raspberry but it's definitely like a heavier berry like a blue or something like that but this one's a lot sweeter and like a light way so it definitely reminds me of cherry i mean you can just see the vapor production on that that is intense it's got it they got it dialed in for 3.7 volts for sure that smells so good too that just like very light cherry after like an herbal tone or i mean a earthy tone that's crazy how clear that is so you know i buy a lot of i don't buy like a lot of low end cards except for the hushes but i don't expect flavor from those but these are just a whole whole different level um i didn't think about it till afterwards but these i think 40 bucks wreck we're a half gram these are four grams but we're a half gram half rock hash rosin cards i think it's live hash rosin that goes for 45 so next time i'm gonna buy one of these i might just go for a half gram live rosin to really get the best cart because but otherwise i think solventless these are some of the best cards their live resin cards are probably incredible um but i prefer cured resin as i said all right i'm close this video out thanks for watching everybody thank you avatar for making beautiful beautiful oils and great extracts like and subscribe um click the notification i don't know if you can do that do all this stuff that generally subscribers tell you to do i mean youtubers tell subscribers to do thanks and have a great day", "XngLtlXh0bg": "yo hey guys and welcome back to my

everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we got a good one for you today so if you keep up with my channel you'll know that I review a few different cartridges well in the last week I planned on going hiking so I picked up a couple that seemed to be good quality I picked up a pure which is premium ultra refined extractions limoncello alright this butane processed 89 percent for a total of 90 so it's a 90 percent THC cartridge or you know basically alright it's all it says and I also picked up a brand that I'm really happy with this is a Jack Herer this was a sativa from canna clouds hashtag kin of clouds 502 and this one here ninety one point seven percent THC or cannabinoids with the THC of 83 and TCA of 7.5 worked it out that's good cuz point twos right there alright this is persue stand produced and processed by eh farms this was done by eh o alcohol solomon extraction okay so we've got these two different oils we've got a butane processed oil we've got an alcohol processed oil both of them seem to be good there's one ever the other difference this cartridge right here is produced by C cell this is an M 528 Jupiter okay now this came from the can of clouds very nice this particular cartridge here this came from the pier this one as you can clearly see is an AV D cartridge I think we can see the model number underneath it looking at AV d 0 6 to 9 RP 1-800 - okay now well I was hiking I was utilizing both of these cartridges as they have different flavors and different effects and I was enjoying them immensely however I noticed before too long that my AVD cartridge which you can see right here this actually has a little bit of oil on the end right there and see it's actually caked all the way around the base of it here no for comparison we can get the C cell right here no oil in any of the pores the draw ports very clean very nice no you may think that this one was used quite a bit more than this one and therefore that may have been the cause that's not true I was utilizing them both through this vape mod battery it has a very simple magnetic connector you screw onto your 510 thread cartridge it is draw activated works very nice big clouds battery stays good most of the day not to worry now this cartridge which is only my second AVD cartridge that i've gotten recently has started to leak this of course is a C cell cartridge if you watch my videos you will know that I get C cells regularly for an example there are some of my cartridges from the recent days this is my only other AVD as you can see something is inside that cartridge I don't know if that was done when it was filling by the processor or if that was something left in there in the construction of the cartridge I'm not sure but this is my only other AVD I decided not to utilize this because that is an unknown factor it could either be from the processor or from the manufacturer but that being said these are all C cell cartridges they all work exceptionally well see cell C so C cell C so C so so that being said a VD I'm afraid I'm gonna have to buy another one and see if it does the same thing I am very happy with the quality of the can of clouds cartridges there were no massive temperature differences maybe 2025 degrees they were not sitting in the Sun at any point in time nor sitting in a freezing area this is something that does happen and it does occur so shop around a little bit watch some more of my videos and don't just watch my channel watch some other channels to see what they have to say about different cartridges that they've had experiences with because not all these companies are available in all the states that being said this is John with C&C connoisseurs you guys have a good day and I look forward to seeing you again peace", "1lcsp4kGkHI": "guys I'm or Bradbury I'm smoking boob mmm hey you welcome to my quick review a juveniles girls this is what I do smoke push pass and shatter - go and check them up I try them off for you if you like rap you will like my nose now let's tear the show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with blueberry buddy review check it out so I rolled up a nice fat joint of it we're gonna do a nice analyzation of it and see how good the buds that I'll pull them out so you can take a good look at it and yeah we'll just give it a nice review and see if it actually tastes like blueberries to see how strong the taste is I'm telling you right now it does have a strong smell I already smell through the bag and it is a very heavy blueberry type of small to be honest like most blueberry type of strains and whatnot they don't really smell like blueberry at all or anything like that or they might have a Jenna flu or something but this one actually don't have like a ton of blue or anything that just looks very nice but it has a very strong like a blueberry type of smell really to it so let's light it up and see if it goes with the taste [Music] to be honest it actually does that's really really good and it does have a very fresh taste to it as well what's up world I just wanted to interrupt real quick to let you know we reach three under subs now so my next video coming out soon is going to be how to toke episode 5 I believe but I'm going to be showing you how to smoke weed out of one of these it's a Japanese not.we so what I'm going to be doing I'm going to be making a smoked little place a device out of one of these and show you how back to the review but it actually does have a very strong blueberry like a taste to it it tastes very nice and it came with very nice juicy buds as you can tell it tastes very good it didn't bust out too bad so let's take a close look at the bud so you can see that it's very it's a lighter colored green but it has a very nice layer of crystal on it I hope that you guys can see it good it does look very nice and it really does have like a blueberry type of smoke - it's pretty delicious smelling actually and it has very very like light colored airs - it looks very delicious you can tell that it was grown very well and that's not even the biggest bud there's bigger buds than that in there so that is a decent account that's about 6 grams it's supposed to be so really really nice account and after this I'm going to be doing gorilla tuna it looks very delicious as well so keep your eye out for that that's gonna be coming out soon as well but we'll jump back to this review so I'm going to fix the run that's going on a little bit and I want to show you guys my bird so check this out [Music] that's a little baby Bluebird that I found walking it fell off of a tall building so there's no way I could have put it back in its nest so I got it a nice cage and everything and it's doing really well now see so I'm not sure what I've got to name him yet you guys maybe could put some let me know in the comments what you think I should maybe name him I was gonna name a piggy I thought he was a pigeon at first but we searched it up and he's a baby Bluebird so what you think I should name him let me know I'm not quite sure yet but we'll jump back to this review I'm gonna give the taste I'm gonna give the taste a nice I'm gonna give it on I'll give it a nice five actually if that's taste really well the account gonna give it a nice five as well this blueberry buddy is really good strain I do like it I'm trying not to give it to hyper rating but it is just all about good so I'm gonna give it a 5 out of 5 it's really good it tastes like blueberry like it said well at least like it encourages that the guys you know blueberry but do you think that they find the taste like so very so it does I give that a check it's very good all-around good account see this is the same amount as this they're both good accounts though so I'll give it a overall fun cuz it tastes really good good account you know we're not quite done disjoint but I'm starting to feel pretty good already so I'll give it a thought I definitely recommend the blueberry buddy if you get a chance to try it Oh or if you already have let me know in the comment section if you liked it as much as I did there may be somebody who ever grew that type of strain that you had maybe didn't do it it's good but this one is very good so I'll keep with the rating of five and does taste like like very freshly - and I'll book my pushback down in the description like I always do I'll look up some facts about it and put it down in the description so you can know a little bit more about it as well and I also still have Blue Dream is gonna be coming soon and pink I would pink so it's solid pink they're both gonna be coming soon so I really hope you are all doing good and got some good stuff to smoke of your own and let me know what some of your favorite streets are or what you think that I should try out next always look at this good [ __ ] to try out always try not know if it's trains and good concentrates and whatever else I'd like I think that you guys might want to see I'm gonna try to grab so I really do appreciate everybody spends time over here at juveniles and all I really do and I hope you all are doing good but I got lots more videos so you can stay for show so bust up some more fish to roll and watch another show now I'm glad to know this is my plant progress week six as you

on their week five so they should be about this size by next week about so that's how they're doing you", "O-mn5XkUty4": "hi everyone is nurse Lalita and welcome back to my channel I thank you so much for tuning in today because today we are going to talk about how you can use cannabis to decrease your anxiety and chill out I am going to discuss the top 4 questions that I get asked all the time regarding how to use cannabis to relax so let's get right into it okay the very first question that I get all the time is can cannabis really help to decrease anxiety the answer to that question is yes so basically within our bodies we have what's called the endocannabinoid system now in short the endocannabinoid system is a large neurotransmitter network that helps our brain in our bodies communicate with each other THC and CBD and other cannabinoids have been shown to attach to certain receptors within our endocannabinoid system once that happened they produce a calming effect within our body it helps to boost our mood and then it helps to promote a positive sense of well-being so overall that will help to reduce the amount of anxiety that you are having in addition CBD has been shown to decrease communication between exciting brain cells and acts as a natural mood lifter so overall yes cannabis can help with decreasing your anxiety the second question that people ask all the time is what strains should I use for anxiety well the answer to this question is a little bit complicated because each person out there we're all different so what works for me may not work for you however I do have a couple of tips that you can use when you're trying to choose a strange work for you for the purpose of anxiety tip number one you probably want to choose a strain that is CBD dominant or a strain that has a balanced ratio of THC to CBD you want to steer clear of too much THC because if you use too much tea eight then you can actually produce anxiety instead of relieving anxiety tip number two you probably want to go towards it indica dominant strain compared to a sativa dominant strain because the indica dominant strain actually will have relaxing effects whereas a sativa strain is more stimulating and tip number three I want you to pay attention to the terpenes that are present within that strain for example Lila no mercy and limiting are known to have relaxing effects and act as mood boosters so whenever you see those three terpenes in particular within the strain then you'll know that they will also help to relieve some of your anxiety question number three what type of products should you actually use when you're trying to decrease your anxiety now I know everyone is not comfortable with using cannabis flower however there are so many products out there on the market right now that can help you consume without having to actually use the flower product so I'm going to give you three recommendations of types of products that you can use to decrease your anxiety the first type of product that I would recommend is a vape pen or a vaporizer the benefits to using abate is that within fifteen to twenty minutes or sooner you'll start to feel the onset and the effect starting to happen which means that your anxiety will start to decrease the only time to using a vape is that the duration is not that long you'll get on average two to three hours worth of relief which means that you'll have to dose more frequently the second type of product that I would recommend are edibles now edibles are easy to use because you can put them in your food or in your drink and they have a very long duration so it will help to bring down your anxiety from about four to eight hours depending upon your metabolism the Conte using it edible is that it takes a while for it to actually kick in because it's all dependent on your individual metabolism so for some people that can be thirty minutes and for other people that can be up to three hours it just depends if you use an edible make sure that you go low in slow and you do not over indulge the third type of product that I would recommend architectures now textures are easy to use and they have a quick onset when you place them under your tub that means that you're taking the tincture sublingually once you place it under your tongue you just let it sit there for about 15 seconds to 20 seconds or so and then you swallow this allows for it to have a quick onset within about 15 to 20 minutes or sooner and the duration lasts about 4 hours and temperatures can be accurately dosed because each drop Burt usually has hash marks on the dropper which allows you to see exactly how much tincture you are using the last question that I get all the time is how much cannabis should I use what is the proper dosage now cannabis dosing can be intimidating and overwhelming because what works for me may not work for you we are all made of different genetically so I recommend that if you need help finding your correct cannabis dosing you seek the help of a medical professional like a cannabis nurse we are available to help you on your cannabis journey we will guide you towards the right type of products you need to use in the right dosages you need to use and how often you should use these products however if you want to do this alone at home what I do recommend is that first you go low and slow you want to make sure that you use very very small amounts of cannabis around 2.5 milligrams no more than five milligrams when you're first starting out that way you can see how your body reacts to the cannabis and then slowly you can increase that dose until you reach the point to where you have relieve your symptoms of anxiety once you reach that point of relieving your symptoms of anxiety you want to stay at that dosage okay because that is what we call your therapeutic window there's no need to go any higher you can maintain that those throughout your treatment for your anxiety overall I hope that this video helps you guys out there understand that yes you can use cannabis to decrease your anxiety if you have any additional questions make sure you click the link in the description box and you can have a one-on-one consultation with me and I can help guide you on your cannabis journey if you have any additional questions just let me know I hope you have a blessed day", "nPK-_hqhWA4": "let me sit down in my throne what's up you guys welcome back to my channel kawaii aka coco back it again with another [ __ ] video and today's video we are trying out something new i should tell by the title i am going to be trying out this delta a cartridge for the first time if you go back like two videos then you'll see that i did a goody kind unboxing and they sent me this delta a cartridge it's actually a new product on their line their store link will be pinned in the comments or in the description down below i didn't even have a battery for this and they went ahead and sent me a battery so i was like [ __ ] yes this company is so generous yeah i'm just so grateful that they sent me this and i get to try it but yeah um before we get into this i want to explain what delta a is because i actually just now started to hear about it so i'll try my best to explain what it is but basically delta 8 is a cannabinoid everybody's heard of delta 9 but if you don't know what delta 9 is it's like the main cannabinoid and thc that gives you that high effect but delta 8 is basically just like the reduced version of that you know it doesn't get you like high like delta 9 does it still gets you medicated you know but it's not going to get you like so medicated where you're just like i'm so strong bro no it's not going to be like that but yeah that's basically it when they sent me this i was like are they allowed to send me this but it turns out that delta a is actually federally legal and the reason that it's federally legal is because it is extracted from a hemp plant and that's super duper dope and i can't wait to try this i did smoke a bowl this morning but i waited until my high wore off so i could be completely sober for this to give you guys like a nice review on how i feel and things like that as you guys know i don't usually vape i bought a couple of thc cards in my lifetime before but they were never any good but this one's like legit it came it came in a whole [ __ ] box but i don't i don't mind vaping it's a discreet way to get even though this isn't like delta 9 thc it's a discreet way to get high to get stoney and you can't smell it maybe i should do like a video on how to be like a discreet stoner if you guys want to see that video comment down below let me know what you want to see from me but yeah um this is what the packaging looks like i don't know if it's pronounced goody kind or good kind but it is a delta eight thc vape card trick with 92 percent delta 8 thc organically grown pesticide free lead free co2 extracted no thickenings no flavorings third party test it and it gives like a warning on the package and tells you that it was tested and all that good stuff also they donate 1 8 to the navajo water project so go ahead and check them out they're very affordable focus beach they're very affordable and they're super duper nice company so please go check them out and i'm just very excited to get into this i'm gonna turn it on green there we go we got a flashing green and see if that does me well but um this is what it looks like you guys it's like almost clear i'ma go ahead and puff on this for you guys hold on it's flashing but i don't know what that means see i don't even know how to work i don't even know how to work vape pins y'all am i doing this right why is it flashing does it need to be charged oh my gosh y'all i don't know what the [ __ ] i'm doing i'm just trying to do a nice review but my ass does not know how to work vape pins it's like flashing and i don't think it's supposed to be flashing so i'm gonna charge it um brb okay so while this is charging what's up i apologize my ass was not prepared today you guys oh know man this pen didn't come with any instructions so i just don't have to figure it out myself okay so while we wait i'm gonna play some among us i wish we could smoke a bow i don't know how long this is gonna take [ __ ] yes this battery charged in like 15 minutes you guys that's [ __ ] dope but it finished charging right when i finished the round of a mangas we get to try this [ __ ] let's try this distill it out i'm do it on green we got it on free flashy flashy flashy i'm excited i'm excited [Music] oh whoa i'm in pain holy [ __ ] my ass was not expecting that this [ __ ] rips honey hold on do over do over do over cut take two my chest is a heaven then this [ __ ] knocked me out damn i should have started slow hold him a [ __ ] needs some h2o okay now we know that this pin rips well let's let's see how the [ __ ] delta eight tastes man i'm crying [Music] oh [ __ ] this actually does not have a taste it says no flavoring i said that from the beginning oh [ __ ] it says no flavoring but it hits so smooth you guys it's like airy you can't even feel it in your mouth that's how it took too big of a rip you can't even feel it in your mouth holy [ __ ] it smells like like a burnt coil to be honest like what you usually get from vapes that's also one thing that i didn't really like [ __ ] with with vapes is that like it gave like a a a metal taste and like a burnt smell but this one doesn't taste like metal it doesn't taste like anything it just smells like like a hot coil because that's what's happening right here you know this is nice uh this is nice what i read is that it gives you a head and and a body high so we'll see i don't know man i feel in a head rush right now but it's probably because i uh almost had a near-death experience this rips y'all and this is only on green how long maybe if i put it on blue it would have less of a smell unless you like sniff on it you can't smell it it still has like a slight smell but i just feel like that's just gonna come with any vape but enough about the the vape pen let's talk about the delta a i'm liking it so far you guys um it's very light it's not harsh on the throat unless you take too big of a hit like i did it's pretty most definitely it's so [ __ ] gorgeous it doesn't really have a smell just the pen has a smell it doesn't have a taste if you want something like really light and mellow like with like the effects and the taste and the the handling of it this will be perfect for you dude delta a is also said to help a lot with anxiety and i [ __ ] struggle with anxiety i've struggled with social anxiety most of my life and i know when i go outside i get all [ __ ] anxious and now i can have like something very discreet because i can't just like smoke like a cbd joint outside because people are going to be like the [ __ ] is that but nowadays people vape thc so they're probably gonna know what the [ __ ] this is especially if it's in a pen then they're gonna know something's up but you know no cop is gonna stop me like is it a vape pen and it has no smell you guys oh and plus it's federally legal even if the cop did stop me it is federally legal nice i'm actually starting to feel it in my arms and my feet i started working out lately you guys and my legs have been killing me my legs feel better oh wow this is nice i'm actually feeling a body high i don't know if i'm going to feel a head high i only feel like i feel like a head rush is because i cough so hard and you know once you when you cough so hard yeah your brain gets to like posting and [ __ ] like that but i'm definitely feeling like a body calm right now like i'm being medicated it definitely helped with my muscle pain that i was having earlier today in the past couple of days dude and i'm only taking a few puffs [Music] [Music] a lot of people like to use thc to help with like headaches and pains like that i have never felt those effects from thc i've had headaches and tried to just use thc without any ibuprofen but it never it never worked for me i feel that like cbd works a lot better for pain and things like that instead of thc but i heard that a lot of people use thc to help with pain but this has actually helped with pain it's weird it's so weird how this plant works dude it's like absolutely amazing and the fact that it's not accepted by most people that could probably benefit off of it is so mind-blowing to me i feel like this would be really good for somebody that has like a really low tolerance or somebody starting off like a newbie i feel like this would be really good for them i'm not talking way too much when i'm in a good mood i talk way too much this is nice y'all man i like this a lot i feel like my eyes got lower i don't know does like all cannabinoids do that or does like just delta nine make your eyes lower because delta a probably also make your eyes lower hold on we have a phone we have um wi-fi we can google it are my eyes red yes delta eight makes your eyes hella droopy and glazed over so if you do smoke delta eight then you will also have like the same effects in your eyes because i legit feel my eyes lower yeah i'm feeling good this is like literally just like a mild not even a mild high it's just like a little lower than that bro bro i don't know i feel like i feel like i'm feeling a high to be honest i feel like i'm feeling behind i think i took a lot of puffs and it's still it's still to the tippy top [Music] yeah i like this a lot goodie kind thank you i never knew my limit and i didn't know there was like a limit when i first started smoking cannabis and i would like green out i greened out like about two to three times before and i didn't know anything about cbd or delta eight and delta a is really good for nausea so if you're prone to green and out if you don't know what green and now means it's like basically overdosing on thc but you get sick like you your stomach feels sick you get nauseous i feel like if you were to smoke this like in between hits or just like smoke a few puffs before you smoke thc then it will help a lot with um that nausea feeling oh no i'm not trying to sound like a scientist but these are just conclusions theories conclusions and theories no i just had a [ __ ] idea do a science project while high how fun would that be how fun would that be but anyway yeah if you had if you struggle with anxiety or if you struggle with like the effects of thc or you just simply don't like the effects of thc then i would recommend this to you to be honest i do feel a little high and if you just do not like that high feeling then you it's probably best for you to just stick to cbd you know man i feel good my body feels good my shoulders feel relaxed this is so good and i'm so grateful that i was able to try this out and able to keep this product as my own thank you so much goody kind thank you everybody and thank you just like you know just thanks but um yeah i think that's it i feel a little stoned to be honest i'm not gonna lie i feel a little stoned but yeah i think that's all i gotta say i give this a whole freaking that gets a 13 out of 10. most definitely i love it i appreciate it so much thank

think you guys are doing a great job you know you got some of this for the host of the show a couple of these to take with me couple of these and y'all are doing good this year I'll tell you the truth the first one right here this is our high THC version we call this highlighter Plus this is about a 80% or more THC right next to it is our rose gold highlighter that's pretty it's pretty right yeah it's beautiful it's a it's a one-to-one CBD to THC ratio and then on the right side here we've got our highlighter uncrate special edition we only made a few thousand of these things a nice matte soft touch finish it's also a one-to-one CBD THC ratio [Music] that's clean give me some pricing so these are right around $100 a piece well I guess the show is the most expensive it's right sighs I'll pull up here how many how many how many pumps in this thing uh well it depends on how big a puffy take yeah so this is the most expensive is tech break and this would actually be smart the great way to check", "fL6u_fI2bjs": "[Music] hey guys what's going on welcome back to another stream review today we are going to be reviewing gary [Music] payton [Music] and [ __ ] fact district was actually named after gary payton the hall of famer who collaborated with cookies and power generics to commercialize his strength oh man i can't wait to get into it though when i first got it and i put it in this can it smells so good it has this like almost like cookies uh girl scout cookies type of smell i mean you can still smell some terpenes in it but it's quite dense i gotta say breaks up pretty nice and you can see the tricoms on the nuts look at this right there this is a 50 indica 50 sativa hybrid with a 25 gac and 5 cbd the parents are to why or why grega and the hybrid strange snowman look at this beauty man you can't smell the turtle paints into it it's not so potent it's not as loud as all the strings that were reviewing this channel before ah but it smells so good especially we just freshly baked it it has the terpene smells come out a lot more i can't wait to taste it i'm hoping they taste like smells because it smells really good it just has an undertone of gas like like i don't know how to explain like a little gassy undertone but the terpenes the terpenes overpower that it smells so good this is often used to treat conditions like headaches and migraines or chronic stress anxiety depression hdd i mean i mean att and adhd you know literally we're going to be using a clean bow like this is the ball i like to use for my reviews because it hits real smooth and like i always keep it clean so before every review i like to put it on the solvent i don't get it next to me but you know so cleanly eating salsa that way what we taste is the actual cannabis flavor no paper and nothing like that right wow it tastes sweet it has a sweet taste to it horrible but sweet doesn't have any aftertaste so far second hit and still see i had a nice sweet flavor to it it hasn't changed it's real smooth when you hit it this is what's going down does it have a bad aftertaste or an aftertaste at all it just it tastes really good even on the third head you can still taste those terpenes nicely thirsty it almost have like a undertone of diesel i don't know why maybe it's just me but it has like a very little very undertone of diesel even you can smell that i mean the terpenes take over it takes terpenes are tasting really good right now even on the third head okay i just i just finished this one bowl and i've already started to feel it starting to feel body relaxation a little heavy i'm not saying it but it feels a little heavy [Music] i'm feeling clear minded like focus oh this is good one of the things i really like is it even took that long to hit like so straight takes seven minutes because i time them and someone will take seven minutes so it's like three so they take after two hits depending on the strain this one it hit me right away like maybe half the way the ball i was already starting to feel it and then i finished the boat i'm already filling it after the ball and it hasn't even been that long it's only been a couple of minutes so he actually hits really hard i mean really fast the height that i'm feeling right now is really good i don't feel like tired or anything like that actually feel like focus i have my body it is a little a little heavy i don't know why but i am feeling good definitely like i could sit down and start doing something without feeling sleepy or anything like that i feel a little bit energetic i think this is a really good daytime stream i feel like i could smoke a joint before work in a hurry not not work not having to worry about working slow or being like oh slow and tired or sleepy i feel like i want to do something so if i was at work i'll be working just as it should be working honestly this is my second bow i gotta say i am stoned and stoned this is not bad at all so if i have to like recap everything the boat looks really good it's dense has a great smell to it it has a undertone of diesel almost really good small terpenes full of crit trichromes everywhere as you saw in the pictures the bud even though it's already all burnt you can still taste the terpenes or the flavor of the cannabis after a couple of times lighting it up certain strains after the first hit each of three is like burnt cannabis this one even though the whole thing is burnt i was able to taste it i was it was like almost done with the bowl that's when i was starting to taste just burnt cannabis it's really smooth going down and going out no bad aftertaste really good taste actually it's like sweet for her it's like her earthy sweet uh taste to it it's really good you can smell and taste the terpenes so if i had to get this uh i would give it like eight leaves out of ten because it is a really good boat but i have better so we'll just give it eight leaves on this one well guys this is all

"hello my name is Kip and I'm the account executive for Northern California and Alaska here at Jupiter research and on this week's episode I'm going to teach you how to take apart to C cell cartridges the first type of cartridge I'm gonna demonstrate for you is our glass cartridge the glass cartridge has a twist off or a threaded mouthpiece which is really easy to take off all you do is unthread the mouthpiece from the cartridge and there you have it we do not recommend refilling our glass cartridges or our plastic cartridges due to the fact that the refilling may compromise the integrity of the ceramic and therefore compromise the experience the flavor and the taste the next cartridge I'm going to demonstrate for you is our ATP or a plastic cartridge the plastic cartridge comes with a press bit mouthpiece which is camp very evident and extremely difficult to remove removing the mouthpiece could result in damaging the cartridge the mouthpiece or result in a loss of oil I'm going to try to demonstrate this by taking a pair of channellock pliers and twisting in a counterclockwise motion you will notice that it is a very difficult process and you can hear the cartridge actually being damaged and there we go it's broken the next cartridge I'm going to demonstrate is actually a pod that fits into the uno and the dart device you will see that the pod is covered by the mouthpiece and in a way that the pod fits into the mouthpiece is flush and is press fit which basically gives you no way to remove it I know a lot of you had questions regarding the refilling of C cell cartridges and the removal of the mouthpieces in conclusion C cell cartridges are not designed to be refilled in the end acade compromise the flavor the taste the potency and overall paper ization experience if you have any further questions shoot us a DM or comment below thanks for watching", "qlLVx6IXXg8": "i like to call getting high off of these a diet high what's happening everyone it's scary carrie here welcome to my channel in today's episode we're going to talk about the truth behind vape carts and pods i've seen a lot of content covering fake carts the dangers behind them and how to avoid them but i want to dig even deeper into exactly how these products are processed and why i prefer to vape dry herb disclaimer the following video does not glorify the use of cannabis instead it attempts to be non-biased while delivering vital information disguised as entertainment now throughout this video i brought some goodies just for you guys to box this place up we've got a little steezy cart here and we just got a brand new delta 8 cart here just to show you the two different ways of vaporizing oil through a pen and through a pod and hit these while i talk about them all right cheers we got a delta nine og kush right here we got some delta a docidos right here combining the best of both worlds boom the high from a vape cart is short-sighted when compared to the complexities behind cannabis flower cannabis flower contains several cannabinoids some of which we are still discovering that all being said extracting the strains unique profile with all of its active compounds and putting it into a vape cart is very difficult without mixing it with raw thc distillate or other ingredients adding those ingredients will allow the concentrate to vaporize in the atomizer by lowering its viscosity but what about live resin carts to my understanding don't let the price fool you they are not live resin they're typically cut with raw thc distillate to decrease its viscosity for vaporization all carts have some form of an additive whether it be raw thc oil or non-cannabis derived terpenes most carts are actually made out of just those two ingredients raw thc oil and non-cannabis derived terpenes naturally derived from fruits if you look at the lab reports for these products there wouldn't be any traces of other cannabinoids other than the common thc cbd cbn and delta eight the other complex and lesser-known cannabinoids are lost in the extraction and distillation process when making these products therefore removing the full and complete high of that strain being high off of a complete cannabinoid profile is what is called an entourage effect the lesser-known cannabinoids are reacting with the thc and endocannabinoid system within our body in order to produce a more sophisticated overall high bottom line when consuming these pens and pods you are having a synthetic high i like to call getting high off of these a diet high you're only receiving thc and terpenes completely absent from the entourage effect cannabis flower gives wow now you may think so what if i just smoke cannabis flour if you want the fullest effect from flour it is best to vape it by doing this you are not burning any cannabinoids burning your flour with fire destroys up to 80 of all cannabinoids present within the plant therefore it's better to vaporize your tree in order to maintain the integrity of the cannabinoid profile wow i don't know about you but the times i vaped my flower were some of the best highs i ever had hands down when i vape these pens and pods i get really groggy and i feel like the high is very short-sighted when i'm able to vape dry herb i get the sensation that i'm trying the strain for the first time it kind of takes me back to the first time i ever vaped weed the first time i ever vaped flower it was right before i had to go to art history class i don't know about you guys but at the time art history was so boring to me all we did was look at paintings but this one time i got high off a vaping tree i got so baked that i actually started to enjoy the class typically during the class the teacher will ask all the students some questions about the art and it'll just be dead silence this one day that i vape tree oh my goodness you guys i was so high i ended up answering all of the questions that day just me i was so high i was like this painting is supposed to reflect the black plague and the emotions from that and you can tell because of this guy here being the focus of the art and due to the focal lines coming from the horizon here i didn't even realize i was the only one answering all the questions until my friend pointed it out at the end it was like i was able to approach art from a whole different perspective and since then i've just really enjoyed art history and studying art yeah and i can safely say vaping flower that time before just like really helped and opened my mind so if you haven't tried vaping flour before i highly recommend it if you vape your weed correctly your flower should turn into a brownish color and with that you could turn it into edibles because there are still some cannabinoids left inside the plant of those cannabinoids they're all activated fully decarbs because of the vaporization and ready for you to enjoy now i'm not saying i like vaping weed over smoking it i always enjoy smoking weed this stuff is pretty harsh you guys i like vaping weed more than these pens and pods because one vaping weed will give you the entourage effect and the full complete high of that strain and two it doesn't destroy the cannabinoids like when you smoke it so when would i consume these guys i enjoy smoking these most when i'm trying to obtain a specific desired medical effect if i want cbd i'll take a cbd pen if i want delta 8 i'll take a delta 8 pen but if i want thc oh i don't know about you guys but this double vape right here got this place boxy as hell you already know the drill let's release the beast i hope you learned a thing or two about vaping cannabis and if you enjoyed the video please leave a like comment down below subscribe to the channel

going to show you how to troubleshoot your vaporizer cartridge if you got it been using it and then all of a sudden it doesn't seem to be working so just like a battery you're going to have a positive and a negative connection on your battery here and that inside inner circle is going to be your positive connection and the inner threads that you see on the inside is going to be the negative connection so when they connect to the cartridge the outer threads the male part is going to be your negative and then inside the little kind of where you see the hole in the two lines that's going to be your positive connection and what can happen over time of taking the cartridge on and off when you charge your battery is that knit positive connection in between the center of the threads on the vape cart can actually recess down in there so when you put the cartridge back on your battery you're actually not making a complete connection so you can see in this video that it's pretty much flush at the top of the threads so that isn't going to make a solid connection so we have a real simple fix for you and that's going to be to take a little paper clip work it on the inside and slowly elevate that little center post so now you can see that it's just above the male threads which is the negative connection you can see the two lines right there and then when you screw it onto your battery you want to not go too tight you just want to make a snug connection so you don't recess that up in there again too far so make a connection just like that and your battery and cartridge should be good to go if you are in fact still having a problem you want to check that your battery is staying on with a steady green light if it's flashing after you inhale that means the battery needs to be charged so if the battery is not flashing has a steady light and you are still getting no vapor then there is a chance that the cart has become defective or damaged but no worries innovative backs their products 100 just take it back to the store you purchased it at or go to our website innovativecbd.com drop us a quick email and we will be sure to get you out a replacement any other questions you can always email us at sales innovativecbd.com thank you very much and hope you all have a wonderful day and uh have less problems and a better understanding of how to use this very simple yet sensitive vaporization device", "wGsPh51K65M": "[Music] hey it's mad at roughhouse to use welcome to Canada basics today we're looking at the best Penn batteries for 510 THC or CBD cartridges this episode is sponsored by New York vape shop you can find all the devices use in this video at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with a code rough 2 with a growing trend of THC and CBD oil 510 thread cartridges out there you may find yourself in the dilemma of wondering which is the best kind of vaporizer battery to use for it there's almost as many types of devices as there are cartridges themselves we're gonna look at the stylist type the flat micro a variable voltage a mini compact as well as it box mod vaporizers [Music] first up is the stylist now the stylist is the most simple of all of them it doesn't have a power button does it have any controls or anything like that is air operated and it's just usually a simple stick with a 5-10 thread on one end they are compatible with most types of cartridges and are really really easy to use you just inhale and it automatically works just by inhaling through it the pros of a stylus are is they're simple to operate and usually like I said the most affordable the cons are you have very limited temperature options and usually they're small and they have a small battery capacity next up we have the micro or the flat style and you can see it's flatter it's not round like the other ones and it still has the 510 thread at the top and it fits most different types of cartridges one thing I like about these is that they're usually charging by USB and like I said they are adaptable with many different types of the cartridges pretty much any kind the difference between this and a stylus it does have a power button and many times not always but many times it also has multiple different power settings this is a Z steam cloud micro available at NY vape shop comm and it does have three different settings for temperature the pros are the micro Penzer they're affordably priced usually about 20 bucks for these they usually have micro USB charger rather than the the kind of you plug into the USB adapter they're very compact easy to hide a problem again is that they're usually small and have a small battery capacity next up we're gonna look at the variable voltage pin now much like the other ones this is a style like a pin style vaporizer but the big difference on this is that it has a variable voltage and usually this is at the bottom sometimes it's at the top though but usually at the bottom there's a little dial that you can use to set the voltage at different types and then you could use it for different temperatures different types of cartridges or just to get a different flavor intensity when you use the vaporizer these usually have a power button and rather than having multiple settings it's a variable control at the bottom the pros of these type are is that you can dial in the best voltage for your cartridge that you're using and you can use them with other types of add-ons as well - and usually they have stronger batteries than the other two smaller the cons are is that the height of it leaves the carts vulnerable and they're larger and they're less stealthy and can't really put them in your pocket as easily and this brings us to the compact style pin or them this is the actually of the Steam Cloud Mini 2.0 and these are like a side-by-side the cartridge actually goes down beside the battery they're USB charging usually and you can see that there's a little cut out there where the cartridge will go down into it they do require usually some sort of magnetic adapter that will help you adapt the cartridge and so it'll stick into the device when you stick it in there and they also require or they don't necessarily require but they work better with the cartridges that are a little bit longer and unless they have an adapter that actually extends it which some of them do I really like these kind because they're very pocket friendly the pros are that they're compact and stealthy and that insect connection it protects your cartridge because your cartridges handout in the device cons are it does require a magnetic adapter they're usually included but they're small and easy to lose and it's best suited for the longer cartridges as the small ones might get lost out inside and now we're going to look at the box mod you might consider the Box mod sort of the helicopter uh vaporizer pens it's a little bit more complicated most of the others it has a power button it also usually has a an up-and-down button to control the variable voltage it also has a compatibility with sub ohm tanks so you have a lot of vast compatibility here and you also have a lot of functions on these that you may not ever even need to use with a actual cartridge pin because they work with a lot of other kinds of add-ons and adapters and sub ohm tanks and such like that but they are so very effective for the cartridges they fit most 510 threads just fine and you can lower the voltage down to suit whatever kind of cartridge that you have in the device at the time I really like using the Box mod especially this one this is the steam cloud and it's the steam cloud box mod it's a lot smaller than some of the other ones it's very compact and really easy to use with these cartridges the pros and cons are the sizes 510 cartridges and sub ohm tanks it has most options for the power and resistance and different settings and it usually has the strongest batteries the cons are is that they are bigger and less stealthy although this is a small one and usually they're more expensive than the standard types of vaporizer pins so when it comes down to it it kind of depends on your needs if you really want simplicity and affordability one of the micro or the stylus is probably best for you if you like adaptability then you probably want to go with the variable voltage at the minimum I personally like these compact ones because they protect the actual cartridge itself and they're really really pocket friendly and stealthy and if you're a purist or if you really want to get the most bang for your buck you might want to get with the box mods and use it with lots of different devices if you want to pick up any of the devices that we use today be

[Music]", "mhCOl5F7lI0": "The first choice any grower will have to make regarding their plants is which strain of Marijuana do I want to grow There are many differences between one strain of Marijuana and another. Indica's tend to be the heartier plants. They are more forgiving \n and can withstand harsher climates better than most Sativas. They have a shorter flowering period averaging 8 weeks. Sativa's have a longer flowering period. They can take \n up to 14 weeks to fully mature. They are more temperamental variety. They are very sensitive to \n fertilizer as well as changes in temperature and humidity. Not all strains of Marijuana have the same psychoactive properties. Just as Indica's and Sativa's thrive in different climates, they \n also produce much different feelings in the user. Indica's often produce what is commonly called a \"body buzz\" It has strong dis-associative properties which make them very \n well suited for pain relief and insomnia. Sativa's are the preferred variety of Marijuana for daytime smokers. As I mentioned before, Cannabis will differ in its preferred growing \n conditions and your job as a grower is to mimic the proper natural climate as closely as possible. In \n an indoor garden, this is no real challenge. However, if you are choosing to grow outdoors \n you will need to consider the following: What is my climate? What is my growing season? The best thing you can do when choosing an outdoor strain \n is to stay true to the origins of your plant. If you are growing in a moderate climate with a shorter growing \n season, you will likely see best results with Indica dominant strains. If you are growing on a tropical climate, where temperature and \n humidity are higher and the growing season is long then you should choose a Sativa dominant strain. However, most Indica's will do just fine in these climates. Just be \n sure to watch them closely as they are likely to mature before the season is over. Many seed companies will offer specialized varieties of Marijuana that have \n been bred to withstand the harshness of mother nature. Apply what we have just learned when choosing one of these strains.", "2quA9B22k4M": "welcome to community cannabis review so originally my strategy with videos was to basically make one video per brand essentially didn't even really get into multiple videos per strains um mostly just to show you that so you got a brand you searched it up on youtube or you saw it at the dyspo before you bought it search it up on youtube and just verify that they don't make some crap or they're not basically gonna scam you for some booty that you don't want um but i've been having a lot a lot of people say that they want more videos more often and i kind of want to make some more honestly more frequently than i do so i'm going to start making a video basically every time i get a cart or a concentrate if i can or as frequently as i can to that anyways so um i'm not doing the editing on this one i'm gonna re-download my editing software and stuff but for this one i don't feel like it needs it too much because there's not very much packaging to even go over let's start with the hush brand cartridge because i was really surprised with the last one that i got so i picked up another one so um i got this one at beaver bulls where are we at let's see if i can get it to focus there we go phone's actually focusing uh purple cali cush cannabis extract cartridge try that again um this is one gram container uh contains rather 77 points 77 percent thc there we go 77 point actually the 770 milligrams dhc excuse me i can't talk today um then the cbd is 22 milligrams total i believe that puts it at 0.22 percent i don't remember how to work that i'm not thinking clearly um you got all your production info on there and then compliance labels and stuff but other than that it doesn't come with much it's very bare bones for a cart um you got the price there before tax which this dyspo does a lot do before attacks some do after etc anyways and here's the cartridge itself you can see that's some really nice looking distillate which this looks hard to screw up but at the lower um lower price points you will find just like i assume it's made from trim that's even worse off so it just requires more starting material allowing more contaminants in total like chlorophyll and just well everything that's not desirable and you know with distillation i don't know that it matters maybe it's just they got better with their process don't know what the situation is all i know is in my opinion they got better here's the you got um got two silicone caps and then you got the compliance label which i always tear off or peel off whatever and this little weed sticker got these like everywhere all right let's see if i can get some better pictures of this i got a sun lamp right now which is doing nothing but making my eyes look gorgeous nothing for the weed though um let's do some different colors put it in front of super clean um super clear what got me into this was i actually got a cart a couple days ago and it was even better than this one i don't remember the strain i think it was like um maui papaya or something like that um all right well i'm throwing everything i can't speak or grab anything right now apparently um that's the one that i was talking about same same deal basically but yeah i tried them out and they were readily better than i remember them so i wanted to make a video plus i just want to get into making some anyways so let's see if i can't taste some terpenes on this the other one was very interesting terpene wise that's also something i was grateful for they normally have some basic ass servings but this last one they had um i definitely tasted some one of the more exotic terpenes i'll say i don't remember what it was though the consistency is really nice on this dude's gotten a little better i'm using a mirror behind my phone so that i can point it straight at me so bear with me as i look that way and i hit super nice these are up there now with like what i call gold standard distillate cards because like i said distill it's hard to [ __ ] up so once you get to a certain point it doesn't really get any better it's just like as good as it gets and that's really not hard to achieve either but somehow people occasionally mess it up but you got like buddies and select those cards are just distill it how it's supposed to be done hush is getting up there they're pretty dang close now other than the fact that buddies and select have better hardware i want to say it's very close for this one sadly the terpenes i'm only really getting some pretty heavy mirror scene it tastes like a lot of purple strains for sure which that might be something different yeah these cards are solid um i just wanted to get another video out because i want to start putting out more so i hope you enjoyed this like and subscribe and stay tuned and i'll put out more and ideally better ones soon thanks for watching", "h_EAYSZGGAY": "a Florida medical marijuana patients what's up and this is Florida medical marijuana reviews with another distillate review this time coming from key relief we have orange blossom triangle Kush this is a highly tasty strain coming from Cara Lee if orange blossom triangle Kush really highlights what I believe are some delicious citrus notes even when dabbing I even tried it out a high temperature for a fat dive and still felt like I got a tasty citrusy hit I love the color to these distillates from cure leaf as well I don't know why this darker color just makes me feel like it's actually got cannabis within it I know a lot of distillates out there using food great terpenes and everything but I actually truly believe that cure leaf uses full cannabis terpenes people online have actually said that cure leaf is one of the only dispensaries in Florida that doesn't reintroduce the cannabis terpenes back into the distillates they're actually left in there through the process and a lot of the other dispensaries like I said are using food great dirt beans like Sir Tara truly I believe even somebody said move and rise as well and when that happens when you add food great terpenes you lose out on that whole entourage effect with the mixing of the different cannabinoids and the can of it bacon cannabis based terpenes it's just a sad thing that a medicinal dispensary is doing thanks again for watching

everybody it's better okay now what's up miss Jacobs how you doing I certainly hope everyone's having an absolutely wonderful time I'm gonna get up and get a precision hammering device here real quick with which to set the caps of these particular cartridges but I do not have a vise right here handy with me here I just use that I can have a c-clamp I guess I'll use a c-clamp that's always an option I don't know as it is smash it see everybody hit that thumbs up while you grab a hammer alright hey thanks everybody for tuning out I really appreciate that I just ran way per second this is not a hammer I'm aware of that what this is any of you who care it's a very old number number ten snap-on half-inch breaker bar from about a hundred years ago and I'm gonna use it to smack the [ __ ] I always got this should work out great for everybody that means it'll bring guys in just a little bit here is the distillate that we will be filling it up with very nice very nice very clear extremely high quality it's lit there's some Jack Herer there is the carbon is that we will be filling now we fill this up just below that silver ring that's got a drain down there but that's what the old thin oil machine is for number two ooh very very nice very very nice all right now to keep these from leaking which one does you want to cap them as soon as possible you want to push that down get it almost all around there get a device and set that cap just like that you want to get it put that cap on there press it down until it's almost seated then you want to give the device and you want to set the cap just like that I know that looked extremely technical and all that [ __ ] but don't worry you can do this at home yeah [ __ ] try this at home why not I don't give a [ __ ] so anyway the cartridges that I use the cartridge all I use are actually a C cell by the brand SM Oh our East s'more s'more is the parent company for the brand sell lots of different companies make cartridges and they say this utilizes C cell technology well C cell isn't just technology it's a company and it's a company that invented the technology and they invented it like 12 years ago when they started the process so these johnny-come-lately [ __ ] they come out here they try extruding their ceramic to make these coils and it's just not healthy some of them use metals that are not the pure some of them use low quality materials is what it is what you want to do is you want to buy high quality empty cartridges all right you want to high quality because whenever oil sits in a cartridge for a while if it's a poorly made cartridge with low quality materials it can leach heavy metals out of the cartridge and put them into your oil you will then bait those heavy metals and it is toxic to you not the kind of toxic that people are in the hospital for right now that's a different ship but this is a slow build-up steady toxicity of heavy metal poisoning uh just it's not healthy for you won't necessarily hurt you but it's not good for you that's for fucksakes sure I continued constant use is definitely bad for it so well the cartridges that I use are all csail brand most all of my cartridges from Cecil do come from Jupiter research which is one of the four authorized distributors of Cecil products in the United States of America if you are getting C sells more brand Cecil cartridges they're coming from a communist buying them directly from one of the distributors hopefully and those card dishes should be good now I'm not going to show you the bottom of the cartridges because there are four different brands cush Supply Company Jupiter research can of solutions and three win understand all of them have different logos on the bottom it will say C cell it will say a batch code and then it will say a business name that's all that's all it says I'm not going to get it into the people about the thickness of the font for the writing of this texture of the [ __ ] all that [ __ ] I don't care all right I don't care there's plenty of research out there I have shown you a million times on my own channel and with the [ __ ] system being the way that it is right now I'm [ __ ] lucky to be doing this right now I'll tell you what didn't really watch you but we didn't need some cartridges filled up and uh everybody's got up everyone's got a damn who are horny on about about [ __ ] babe cartridges when in all reality babe cartridges aren't really the problem all its poison it's [ __ ] poison from these goddamn companies I'm sorry sorry poison from these goddamn black market people that are pushing this goddamn [ __ ] out on the streets to kids and people that don't know any damn better that's what it comes down to and it's a goddamn shame that uh that it actually yeah [ __ ] you know I say it's a shame but it's not it's the [ __ ] the same as everybody knows that it affects the most ah the most unprotected first you know what I'm saying like kids they're trying to babe the trying to keep it away from their parents trying to keep adults are trying to keep it away from everybody that's intelligent enough to say hey what are you making on whereas if they were like 26 then they'd be like hey man what do you make it on to do like this I'm like man that's some [ __ ] man let's see this baby was just cool you shouldn't be David on this man bullying over there kid like you literally they hide it and [ __ ] and then that's how they get sing cuz they're [ __ ] stupid they're [ __ ] stupid and that's fine you can't blame them for being stupid they're kids and they're stupid and that's what stupid is but uh the more information you get out there the better it is and uh I'm not I'm not overly overly big on the cartridges per se I don't like the way they hit all that much this is this is decent quality oil and these are good quality cartridges you know it is it is what it is um so I went down and I talked to a lot of a lot of the people that work in the in the stores around here there's only about four different stores around here but a lot of the people I don't know a lot of the people in the different app farms the floors right in second [ __ ] turn back [ __ ] told you and two people left two people see this is actually this is a dab syringe terpenes this is not technically speaking of vaporization product right I mean think about it you can do a lot of [ __ ] with this you can do a lot of [ __ ] with this um matter of fact what I like to do is draw as much of this back out of the tip as possible lay it out on its side kind of and then let all that stuff cool down there and then I dab it cuz it spits tasty [ __ ] you know and a pretty good dab of some high calling this looks pretty bitchin pretty powerful stuff so oh but that being said you can dab that stuff straight out of that syringe put it on a tool davin right into your rig all day long there's no damage is done there there's no problems with that at all none it's perfectly fine haha so technically technically since this is advertised as a dab syringe you can still sell it whenever they outlaw flavored vape materials because this isn't a big material in it's a dab material and you don't put down materials in vape carts man that's unacceptable I mean I just did and you know sometimes sometimes it works you know I'm saying but but but but that's not all you can't you don't have to just label it as a DAB syringe or some like that what most stores are gonna do to ensure that their continued stock the stock that they bought is allowed to be sold and it isn't a straight fire sale on every product that can be utilized in a vaporizer pen to keep that from happening as they need money to you know everybody that everybody's in this further for a dime you know they're gonna be changing all of their distillates on their menus from their vaporizer concentrate menu they're gonna be changing it over to their edible menu this is e what this is this is a food additive this is an edible see I'm saying you put this in some brownies you put this in some pizza I have multiple videos showing you how to utilize this as a food additive as an edible therefore you recategorize all your distillate as an edible as opposed to a vape tanker or vaporizer pin refill both you're golden okay I was a little iffy because one they do come with this syringe tip and that tip is specifically designed so that you can insert it into a cartridge right so like okay okay how's that gonna work like ah that's why they label it a dab syringe some people are gonna dab out of that straight into their rig you know what I'm saying they don't want to touch that plastic to it so it's got that metal tip on it I just dab dab wipe it off and you're good to go you know what I'm saying there you go now what it all comes down to in reality of a dead end of the situation it comes down to hate hold up for this [ __ ] and you go to the [ __ ] judge and you're sitting in front of the judge and the judge is like so you had a vapor a flavored vape in refill it's edible you just put in a cookie or a cake or something or you can dab it right out of the dab cheap doesn't have to go to vapor card riser but the company can sell it strictly as an animal and if I as a goddamn citizen decide to put it in a vape cartridge they can't stop me they can't stop me so you can't sell specifically designed for vaporization flavor difference but you can specifically there's nothing for human consumption flavor distillates all day long so that's a little bit on on that so there will be starting tomorrow I do believe at least in my area there will be a I think across the board massive discount on all flavored vape cartridges I'll probably pick up a couple you know what I'm saying they make some pretty good flavors you know they got some pretty good [ __ ] and all these are I mean the governor of Washington is [ __ ] having a knee-jerk reaction from [ __ ] that is happening in the [ __ ] 30 goddamn states where marijuana is illegal and he's taking it to a whole nother level like let's say oh oh down south in Alabama somebody makes the moonshine it makes a couple people go blind right well goddamn well how did is corn whiskey whole [ __ ] let's man all corn with whiskey in Washington State what the [ __ ] what why what that that's over there he [ __ ] that's somebody else that's some other [ __ ] in another area like they're not even selling you know over here like why the [ __ ] would you do that that doesn't make any sense I mean especially considering our vaporizer market is sealed like a [ __ ] drum you hear me nothing in nothing out we didn't know distillate from other places no distal it goes out to other places straight up straight down if somebody got sick from this let's why should say they could track that [ __ ] Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam you hear me it's [ __ ] she's deadly I guess all right well there you have it that's me doing what nobody should ever do because it's bad for you you guys have an absolute zone to keep your reclaim under your neck yes I do jingles I do indeed as a matter of fact I do indeed now what you're gonna want to do you're gonna want to take boiling water boiling water you want to take your nectar collector part and put it in a pan of boiling water you know I'm saying take some tongs and flip that [ __ ] round you know said all the [ __ ] did all the oil will melt you know what I'm saying and most of it should swishing it around a little bit be pushed out and float on top of the water and you can get it to come out of the rig using boiling water at that point you can cool the water down the oil needs to be floating on top or down to the bottom and you can take it off a little dab tool put it on some parchment paper smear it out and let all the water evaporate and then you can pick that up and you can dab that that's perfectly fine if you do it too soon it'll pop a little bit from the water that's in there but uh boiling water will extract all the claim off of the glass very well other than that you can use a very very high grade alcohol preferably a 98 or 99% pure alcohol and if you do check the additives to make sure any of the additives are only watcher only water no other additives pure alcohol and water is only what you can use at this point you put that in the rig shake it up it will dilute all that [ __ ] pour it out and you can let it evaporate off in some sunlight the Sun will evaporate the alcohol very fast or don't do this nobody do this I saw an idiot do this one time he almost hide so don't do it but this is what he did he poured it on a plate or at a pyrex dish take it outside strangle with a fire poof it'll light up blue flame really clear be careful because you can't see it'll burn the [ __ ] out of you because you can't see it may get the dish really hot you don't want him to burn more than four or five seconds like poof 1/1000 doesn't blow it out that way the claim doesn't [ __ ] burn off but like I said don't ever do it you'll catch your hair on fire get your shirt off fire you're gonna catch face on fire you're gonna be a dumbass Sarah's gonna laugh at you I will laugh at you do you hear me so boiling water very high-grade ethanol alcohol let it evaporate off this is two ways to catch your reclaim and recover it that I know of that I have used before ah I hope all that [ __ ] made sense um that being said by the way if you're gonna put it in boiling water don't like put it in a rolling boil that shit'll just boil over and [ __ ] it'll hit the edges of the handle duster [ __ ] but you can scrape it off the pan and even still smoke it you know what I'm saying doesn't mean it's not hot anymore okay [ __ ] it'll still stay over 200 agrees for quite a while especially up of a good thick pan you know what I'm saying anyway and they just spin it in there and you do what I said do what I said - and I said it'll work it'll work it'll work it may not work the best but you will be able to recover something you will be able to smuggle with no ill effects other than some hesitancy and pop it haha that being said you guys have an absolutely beautiful day thank you so much for tuning in happy 4/20 everyone um I hope you did enjoy me pulling some oil out and filling up some cars it is um my wife really likes the cart so I do that for her you guys have an absolutely wonderful day and I will be looking forward to seeing you on my other channel wagon bang with CNC connoisseurs at 6 a.m. tomorrow have an absolutely wonderful evening thanks again so much have a good day peace", "Sitq2um1_7s": "toriel on how to use a cannabis vaporizer alright so with these products it's really nice you don't put a lot of soot or anything like that into your lungs it's much lighter feeling than if you're smoking it all the time and a lot of people don't know how to use these they're very simple so when you go to the store you're looking to spend about you know thirty to fifty eighty dollars always what we call a base of your vaporizer unit they're going to come packaged like this alright so depending on what brand you buy they all look a little different but from the same function you get your base and a charger in the box you're going to screw your charger into the base just like that and these Chargers just slide into simple USB ports you could charge them on your computer you can charge them to where you would plug your you know your phone cable right in there and then this this adapter will just go right into the wall then your vapor ends charging or you plug this right into your computer and now the base is charging okay so very very simple and the charges will last you you know weeks or more so once you get a cartridge once you get a base you're also going to need a vape cartridge which is a extract of cannabis oil and you can again get these in sativa indica hybrid or all CBD oils for example this is all CBD and this is a sativa product so again very simple simply screw the vape cartridge right into your base alright just like that and you're literally ready to go alright so then to use this product you simply depress the button hold it there inhale on the device take one puff see how you feel about five or ten minutes later and then repeat until you are at the level of Medicaid you've reached the level of medication that you wanted to consume and are feeling comfortable just don't use it before you drive besides that that's really how the vaporizers work it couldn't be simpler again if you want to detach this you can detach it be careful to not let the oil leak out if you're going to just rely on this allow around I usually try and set it upright or put the kite of the cap back on and that's really truly it with the vaporizers we that they're incredibly efficient and convenient way to medicate", "UDKXFg1ymvg": "[Music] what is going on you [ __ ] bunch of stoners my name is yay one man in today's video we put up a poll on the Instagram and the facebook story and the majority of you are keen as [ __ ] to see

grown and cultivated on earth for millennia scientifically cannabis is classified in the family cannabase e genus cannabis it is widely thought that indica sativa and ruderalis are either individual species the subspecies of cannabis sativa typically indica comes from southern Asia and extends north to the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan sativa comes from equatorial regions of Africa and North and South America all of the variety types that we grow are hybrids of both of these land race or heirloom strains it's rare to find a true land race indica or sativa in the cannabis industry there are many physical characteristics of the plant that can help you identify if the variety type is indica hybrid or a sativa hybrid the plant structure differs greatly between indica and sativa with indica plants having shorter internodes and thus a shorter stouter plant and sativa plants having longer Internode's and taller lengthier plant structure the leaves of both types also differ between indica and sativa hybrids indica leaves typically having thicker leaf fingers and sativa leaves having skinny fingers these differences in plant morphology point back to the geography where the landrace strains evolve each hybrid variety types can have a different effect a sativa high is generally very mental and energizing while heightening creativity alertness and focus the indica high is generally more body dominant with relaxing sedating and pain reducing effects you", "UFRmzkDwSWc": "Bammer TV what's up family and welcome back to bamboo TV and today we're gonna talk about well cannabis we're going to talk about the three different types of cannabis I bet you didn't know there were three so the Latin name for cannabis is actually cannabis sativa and then it has two sub species known as cannabis indica and Cannabis ruderalis ruderalis what are the heck did that word come from so canvas ruderalis is actually from the northern parts of asia and europe probably you know around the Siberia area in Russia now this frame is unique because it is one of the only known sources of the autoflowering gene the autoflowering gene and Nate enables the plant to go into flower mode without the use of a photo cycle otherwise known as a light cycle so instead of switching your crow lights from 18 hours of light in six hours of darkness to twelve and twelve these plants will automatically start to flower under the eighteen six they don't need an actual that'll meet the actual indications from the light to trigger the flower mode cannabis ruderalis is a lot shorter compared to indica and sativa it usually grows around foot and a half to two and a half feet high and it the buds that it produces are dense but very few and far between the branches are what it's mainly brought up for in its production of hemp cannabis ruderalis is also being used to make certain hybrids of indica and sativa strains this would effectively make them autoflowering strains while maintaining the characteristics from their original plan either you know sativa or indica so what that means is it's a lot less work for growers if they have a ruderalis hybrid because that plant will automatically want to produce buds and stir that flower cycle as soon as it reaches its maturity date between 21 and 30 days now ruderalis is considered by a lot of scientists to be a descendant of cannabis indica which is the cannabis subspecies that primarily grew around the India region in the southern parts of Asia cannabis indica is known to be about three to four feet high at the appropriate harvest date with thick bushy colas and closely spaced branches cannabis indica is probably one of the more popular varieties of cannabis only because it does give you that relaxation and it does give you that control over your anxiety and it could also help you put you to sleep cannabis sativa is almost the exact opposite of cannabis ruderalis so this plant is going to grow anywhere between four to six feet tall the structure of the plant is going to be a lot more open a lot more loose the leaves themselves actually are a lot thinner in shape compared to ruderalis or indica cannabis sativa typically has a higher THC content the flower production might not be as high as cannabis indica but overall it does have all those euphoria effects that we're all running after it does help you maintain focus it can also help you with your anxiety throughout the day it's good daytime smoke in my opinion so overall we have three different varieties of cannabis we have cannabis ruderalis cannabis indica and Cannabis sativa there are some people that think ruderalis is a direct descendant from cannabis indica and ruderalis is now being used to crossbreed with indica and sativa in order to make autoflowering hybrids that also maintain a high THC profile these plants might grow a little bit shorter and they might have a little bit less of a yield compared to their sativa or indica parent but the auto flowering process will ultimately save the grower a lot of time in energy I hope you guys learned something today I hope you enjoyed the way we've brought this out to you and remember guys for everything else weed and weed related keep it here I'm Bama TV", "W1NjxQTd24c": "to the clouds pass to the stars let's all get welcome to juvenile stars enjoy a show hey you welcome to my quick review a juveniles girls this is what I do smoke push hash and shadow to go and check them out I try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now let's start the show thank you for the view what's up world juveniles Stella's coming at you with noisy neighbor cannabis review so noisy neighbor is from heaven Street I got that at the liquor store it was uh I think a little over forty four three and a half and it looks very good and very strong it is a twenty two percent THC I mean it mostly came and one nice looking bike though it doesn't look like it's the biggest account but it is a nice size button it was pretty packed so weighed it pretty much came with was this big bud and just a little when I rolled the joint with so it does have a very very strong smell though it's really strong like lemon type is smell as well but it's almost like a lemon meringue e type is Tate as I type it smell sorry but it is a very very strong smell and if you take a nice look at it it looks very very very delicious it has a very nice layer of crystals on it as a very nice color so let's light up the joint that I rolled and see how good it is so it does have a very strong lemony taste as well but you taste like a little bit of like sweet like meringue type it tastes like I was saying the smell has the taste does have a bit to it does taste very nice and it's 22 percent THC with its a 0 milligrams the CBD button does seem to be really good so far like I said it wasn't the best looking at cow but it does bust up pretty nice and I want to say the taste and the smell kinda justifies it it does look very nice as well it does justify the account because it is a very very good story I can see and taste that already and I picked this up too it is since I wizard the sensi wizard that's gonna be coming up next it's 24 percent THC wet point 7 milligrams of CBD so that will be coming up next keep your eye out for that that was from the liquor store as well so we'll go back to this review I'll give I'll give it a nice nice rating for the taste because it does taste very delicious it doesn't look very nice as well I can't get over the smell and it's such a beautiful smell to very strong like I said almost lemon meringue like smell to it and plus the taste is pretty similar too oh yeah and I got a recommendation that to try to start writing No maybe with the five boy scale instead of ten so I'll start doing that I'll give the taste of five because it does taste and smell of five because it does taste and smell Bom I'll give the count more of like a 2.5 2 or 3 because it was didn't seem like the biggest account it was pretty expensive but the taste and smell make up for it I'm starting to feel pretty nice already we didn't finish it yet we're only quarter way through but I am starting to feel nice so far and I'll but some more facts down in the description of the video about this strain like I've been doing the last video the last few videos I'm pretty sure this was an indica I'm trying to see but I do not see it on the container it usually says on the container whether it's an endocrine sativa I'm pretty sure this was an indica but I'm not a hundred percent actually I'm thinking this one was the sativa and this was the indica no this one's the sativa this one's indica so yeah this is indica and this one is sativa so I like either/or I don't know what whether you guys firstly whoever watching is personally like sativa or indica better I like both for different occasions but I am starting to feel pretty good and thanks for the recommendation to try on this scale I want to try it over a few videos I think it works pretty good I just do like it I think it might work pretty good so I'm going to try to continue that for a little while so I'll give the taste like they said the taste and the smell a straight thought but they can't I'll give it more of a two and a half wasn't the biggest account but it makes up for it would taste bad and it was pricey but if you try to don't let me know what you thought in the spirit I mean in the comment section let me know what you thought about it I think it's pretty good I guess I'll go and do a poem so now I've packed a nice bit of the nosy they're noisy naver into the bog I'm going to light it up to see if it's any better into the bongs let's take a nice hit of it like this and see what we get so I got a nice one there whoo it doesn't taste very very nice and you could still taste the nice like lemon he liked the P line lemon or whatever it's called man it's really really good meringue the lemon meringue really good so I'll get one more in me [Music] that was noisy neighbors I think go and try though if you get the chance it was very good very delicious pricey but I don't know for the best easily so let's show it is so I'll leave it thank you all for stopping in spending time with juvenile stuff now it's done in so I'll be back but I have to go now that we're all dirty stone but I got lots more videos so you can state with shows so bust up some more fish to roll and watch another show now I'm glad to know you", "mEhjDjxkxrI": "hi this is dr. cha thanks for tuning in to another YouTube video today we're going to talk about the THC predominant cultivars of medical marijuana so those are basically going to be your sativas and your indicus now traditionally sativas and indicas basically were descriptions of how the plants looked and grew but eventually patients figured out that they could also generally subdivide the plants into sativas and indicas based on the effect that they had so let's talk about the sativa affect a lot of people like sativa is for daytime use they generally feel that it's an energizing type of feeling a clear-headed feeling a body high basically they feel that it helps them to function better during the daytime now there can be some side effects from sativa again because they are typically energizing a lot of people feel that it can be anxiety provoking or it helps it affects them from getting to sleep at night another type as we discussed earlier was indica a lot of people like indicas for nighttime use they generally describe it as sedating lethargy inducing body relaxing so if you've just come home from a long day of work this is a good solution if you're looking for something that's both pain relieving as well as sedating however as I said before there can be some side effects if you're the type of person that needs to work a job during the day or if you have kids you're looking to take care of this may not be a good choice for you you may also have heard recently about hybrids well hybrids are basically just combinations of indicas and sativas basically the goal was to produce something that had more of a smoother effect for patients so basically something that a patient could take both daytime and nighttime there's obviously many other factors that go into determining whether what the type of effective patient is going to have levels of CBD minor cannabinoids and terpenoids indica versus sativa distinction was originally made based on the botany of the plants basically how they looked and how they grew there's a lot of variation overlap when you're dealing with specific subtypes of sativas and indicas in terms of the patient effect also there's many other things your doctor is going to consider when he goes over your treatment plan besides picking sativas or indicas he's also going to have to decide how you're gonna administer the medicine which will determine additional side effects and effects the dosage of the medical marijuana how he wants you to time the dose and so there's a lot of things that go into putting together a patient's treatment plan so that's one of the main reasons why you should look to get an experienced medical marijuana doctor when you're looking to do medical marijuana this is dr.

just indica for short has been used medicinally for thousands of years making cannabis one of humanity's oldest cultivated crops since then selective breeding amongst cannabis varieties over the generations as yielded what we know as cannabis today indica cultivars produced dense flowers and are typically short and squat with smaller spacing between the leaves indica varieties tend to induce a relaxed state coupled with strong pain reducing qualities the stimulation of appetite and anti-anxiety characteristics for these reasons indica strains are often suggested as an alternative to pharmaceutical drugs that may have a long list of negative side effects some of the varieties you may find a tree city health collective include granddaddy purple cherry pie and Girl Scout cookies

and", "aIrF63k9SvA": "[Music]", "0KJx4_C-bf4": "[Music] [Music] well guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny and we're back for another stray interview this time we got something better than we had last eight okay those are you guys that tuned in last week you got to see I smoked some weed that we didn't really want to smoke it this weed is a little bit different as Dan says we're bringing you some more cake I mean who doesn't like cake right I like cake we've brought you guys wedding cake we've brought you London pound cake this one on honestly in my opinion just our first glance better than both of those this is the lava cake from viola yep viola you know the first time we heard about them was in Colorado obviously they became friendly competition pretty quick out there and they are led by Al Harrington the Hooper you feel girls shout out to Al yeah I don't know how early he got in on that I don't know when we were out working in Colorado like Dan said they were pretty good competition for us out there as far as extracts go I don't know if I remember seeing their branded flour back then this is like 2014 to 2016 or so to viola extracts which I got this at the Hall of flour so we have it sitting on the table here just to show you then this is like their extract packaging this was some diamond sauce but again I'm doing extracts out here now too right they are but that's I believe that's what they started only doing Colorado because it was they were there Instagram was viola extracts so no and now that you mentioned the Harrington thing I do think I remember hearing something about that like the company like his grandma was named viola and that's what the company is named after so it sounds like he's been a part of it since the job yeah regardless we as far as quality goes I always liked their stuff back in the time that we spent Colorado especially live resident it was ghostly when sauce first started poppin they had a lot of really really good sauce back then yeah I don't know what the I don't know what their market presence is like out there now I haven't been back to Colorado in a couple of years but out here they've started to pop up I'd say a lot within the last year for me I've been seeing them a lot on the flower side yeah okay it's something that a lot of brands have been doing a lot of brands that especially just started off more on the extract side going over to the flower side now you've seen 7-10 do it but we've done it ourselves with turf X mile is done it and it's been interesting to see of those kind of concentrate players that try to dabble in the flower game who's been coming with the heat it hasn't yeah I mean definitely their packaging is clean I really like this opaque purple jar it's almost like a flat matte purple I'm at it too great yeah great game baby and then they even if they got a dog little lower on our icon I guess you could say on the top there it's just a bunch of these turning inward kind of like our turf X drops that turn inward so I [ __ ] with that I like the weed - yes the weeds gonna just spark this Jay which is what I was gonna say let's get back to the damn review shout out to buy although they're a great company lava cake guys so this is great pie and they make Girl Scout cookies that's the cross on this and when you take a look at the close-ups it's definitely leaning towards looking like GSC don't you think yeah yeah it's kind of show some characteristics on both definitely but as far as like the way it breaks down and the way it looks at first glance definitely a little bit more cookie leaning is that Audriana rato genetics that does this well I mean yeah we're just talking about how by all the started out in Colorado so I would guess that they picked up this wrong if they're growing themselves out here they could just be sourcing it it's probably Canada auto cut out of MIT I was just a great pie and dim it yeah I mean that's what I was going off of great pie is archived great pie is it we're getting we're getting too deep into it you guard this we have some pretty good wheat in front of us here as far as the smell on it so you're calling it log a cake which to me means it's another one of these pastry slash desert tech terms which have really become popular in the last few years I've got like like you said just the cake ones that we done biscotti gelato all the stuff that's really been hyped lately tends to be strains that are named after like baked goods or like I said other desserts or stuff like that those it's always interesting to see if they're actually gonna taste like what they're named after right you know I'm saying stead of Sour Diesel or og cush it's like back in the day there was a lot more strains called that you know stuff like that what didn't necessarily describe the way it should taste like nine pound hammer yeah I'm go into that expecting anything but when it's called lava cake you're expecting it to be chocolaty kind of lava cake yeah I think it has that primal honestly man I hate to beat a dead horse but I feel like we'd only has so many like different lanes of Terk profiles and like this is kind of remind me of the dog vaults again and I swear I mean it's a lot more sweeter but like it's you know what I mean it's got that same [ __ ] smell and I hit the joint and it's got it's got a little like it's definitely our features with the dogs dogs waltz in the flavor yeah I feel like it's not quite as pervy is that but as far as like more of the more of still that like sweet skunk enos that you get from that strange that's what I'm getting with they're not not as it's in handy yeah you know it's in there for sure but like I said yeah it's like it's more creamy cakey it almost smells like a fresh-baked [ __ ] you know pie or cake I guess I guess you could say cake or pot there's great pie in it it's called lava cake so it smells like a baked pie or baked cake that's what I'm going yeah I'm getting it way more with the smell than I am getting it with flavor on this one the smell it did kind of have to don't tell me it had a little bit of that baked good things that the things you're talking about that I associate more just basically then make cookie or whatever flavor I'm not totally blown away but I do really like the look of this stuff and I do like the smell I guess I was hoping for the flavor to compare or a mine a little bit more of this I gotta I gotta smoke a little bit more of this stuff I'm not I haven't quite made it my mine yet I'm almost ready to judge it I got a drunk my hand I'm gonna pack a bomb there and we're gonna get to rate in this stuff it definitely looks the look and you know like you said the smell is there I think it could smell a little louder what's the look it does look the look but it doesn't talk to talk not just in water it walks the walk a little bit but it doesn't talk to sorry all right what it looks a look yeah I like it well if you were gonna read this stuff we're gonna break down the number hold on to that for one second where are you going with I don't know I got a handful we don't know what to do with it but I am smoking this joint right here and the flavor is good but you know like I said it's got some of that baked goods thing wrong but it's got more jobs walls to me I'm getting a lot of that coming through the flavor more than the smell and yes I don't know man I think I'm just like if you just want me to rate this overall you know I'm gonna give it an 8 I'm giving it an 8 it's good solid week I'm not bad I'm not mad I'm not mad at the purchase it's definitely I was gonna say the buzz might be the best factor you're the best part of this particular strain and listening to Utah kind of gave me reassurance that that's probably the case come on why I'm high off the great pipe and wobble shy that's right whoo like I was saying earlier it does leave a little bit to be desired with the taste I feel like it's good it is good wheat looks I'm going to give a 9 on this one smell I'm gonna give an 8 taste I would probably give a 7 and then buzz I would probably give like a 9 so I don't know whatever that averages out to I think about eight eight and a half I think it's pretty fair for this one it's good when we agreed guys it's really good when we agree we're given an eight across the board there's only two people on the board yeah I mean it's good we like I said not mad at the purchase you know I would love to pick this up just about anywhere it's good smoke could have a little bit better flavor a little bit more pungent of a smell other than that you know looks are pretty damn close I like the way it breaks down like big nugget and all your left is these tiny little stems I hardly any stem weight breaks down really really nice I mean good stuff we've tried probably what this is for me this is a third batch of lava cake I've tried from different place yeah and it's all pretty similar so I'm guessing yes the same I'm pretty sure sir although I've noticed that there's there's one I think that has like more color on it and then one of this wasn't that flight line ringing yeah I've only had the lime-green one once or twice but I think I like this a little bit better lime green purple goodish GB in a Swisher or a Dutch backwards it kind of worried anyways anyways yeah so I think we're gonna leave now yeah we need to get out of things falling apart of the scenes but I gotta pick this first pack it up if you guys are out there still watching this at this point why it would be my view our smoke along with [Music] [Music] money going and proud money going alright I'm the trend time the trip had ass [ __ ] on the planet but the city got the world watch

respectmyregion.com here today with a west coast suite tour review featuring the cure companies diablo og one gram high potency thc distillate cartridge so we're looking at 98.22 total cannabinoids on this product 94 thc uh specifically 94.7 percent thc delta 9 at 94.66 so high potency high potency high potency that's what this product is all about superior quality cannabis goods i'll show you guys some of the packaging here it's cool black white logo got the extracts added in there to stand out diablo og is a classic og strain you can get some of the testing information there on the back we've got this pretty cool reflective superior quality cannabis goods thing there and a bunch of information on the back i'd like to see the genetics i'd like to see the terpenes but they're not listed it does say that the ingredients have 100 premium cannabis distillate extract so i do like that um are the terpenes botanical or the terpenes cannabis who knows how to use attached cartridge to 510 thread battery take three second draw exhale repeat as needed so today we're going to use the vessel battery i've got um it's set on the lowest temperature we're going to see if that's enough to get the distillate to fire up um child proof packaging is currently working on me though let me try to get this open ah there we go all right so check this out you guys beautiful got this white uh ceramic tip the glass window here to see the actual oil that we got clear rubber coverings and stoppers on the mouthpiece and on the coil down at the bottom where the connector meets the battery so i'll kind of show you guys this a little closer check that out it's a beautiful product i can't really smell anything through the tip it does have a little bit of red ringage going on the top so looks like the terpenes have definitely been doing a little bit of reacting but we shall see how this tastes you guys can see that color a little bit there at the top a little bit concerning so here we go one two three four five oh one two three four five turn the vessel back on beautiful there we go all right one two three here we go one hit review talk about it i'll do a second hit give you guys a score out of ten we're supposed to do baby let's go it rips it's smooth it tastes good i do love the branding of the car i love how the cure company put their logo on the actual glass of it i think that's super dope but taste wise it's pretty decent earthy sweet spicy not a little not too much pine there's some lavenderiness with some linalool in there for sure i enjoy it i enjoy it i'll need to do a second hit to see if it's really going to be at this 98 you know total cannabinoids i'm not super duper high right now um run it here we go again i'm tasting that little there's a nice soft lavenderiness to this got a little bit of pine on tiny bit on that last one but the most part just getting that earthiness just getting this spice tiny tiny tiny bit of floral pine and a lot a lot of lineal in there this lavender-ness and so i really enjoy it i am concerned about this ring at the top when you think about the packaging date it was back in it was manufactured in january 21 2020 the date of the packaging of this product so when they stuck the card into the packaging um what was it july 16 2020 so there's a clear difference that's that six months difference i don't know what happened here with this but definitely concerning [Music] you know cartridges are tricky um but i definitely feel like merchandising and making sure that you know the product quality stays consistent i feel like that's totally achievable but as you guys can see there is some really strong discoloration let me pull the sticker off here for you guys there is very much a strong discoloration um at the very top of all that distillate and so because of that i'm definitely gonna have to give them a score in the low you know uh between a five and a six to be honest i think the product quality when it comes to the flavor the high the way that it's branded and packaged and the high thc nature i think all that adds up to an experience that should be very good um but we definitely want to make sure that we're keeping people safe and or making sure that their questions are uneasiness uh those kinds of things are not you know taken care of and or these kind of problems are just non-existent so because of that and this specifically five to six out of ten super rough score but you know like i said uh just make sure you guys talk to the bartender always ask to see the packaging day always ask to see the harvest date for a lot of things that'll help you guys avoid getting product that might be bad expired or going bad or whatever it is so jfing here coming at you guys live man west coast week 2 review we keep it real we keep it honest it's not always great but it's good feedback so i love you guys i'll see y'all down the road 5.6 five to six five point six whatever y'all want to do out of ten care

show for my smokers i really do like i i'm never going to buy i don't think ever again a distillate cart because you get that full taste in it and what in that compared to like some of the other ones like what what's your opinion i know you smoke concentrate more than me this is distillate right here right no that's live resin live resin distillate not just live resin what does that mean because well like because resin means like fresh frozen plant material yeah that's what this is but you can distill that and that's what you usually put in base and some people do that this is this is this is a hundred percent live resin vape same with this one but people do take live resin and dilute it but you can tell from the color like when you when you smoke a like a pure distillate vape it's like clear as [ __ ] like this is pure live resin because like you know being a bartender too but what's the extraction method the cold extraction method they i'm not a i need to see it firsthand but it's all they freeze dry it right away and then they use a super cold temp to extrude everything to get the whole terpene profile whereas with the distillate they're going to burn everything hot oil it down so when you're with a distillate it's like a whiskey it turns out clear and a lot of people don't realize that with whiskey that it's initially clear until they put it in oak barrels you know i was under the impression that like pretty much all these are just lit whether it's like rot live resin nug run you know but some of them they use rosin to put it because you have to like make it into that liquid [ __ ] you know and the only way to make like the main way they make those is through like chemical extraction through co2 or like butane or ethanol but even with the live resin you think because the livelihood doesn't just that just is the quality no but it's a different extraction method because the distillate is a hot method live resin i've understood is the the extra cold method at a certain temperature below the what i understand is live resin means you're using like fresh frozen materials whether you make it into distillate shatter you know they have like live resin shatter and that's made with butane you know yeah i mean but i guess maybe i guess no no no no well something because because i had because i have been and i think i guess i think where we might be like um maybe it's just a like a wordplay thing but i this i oh it is yeah it is you know but like the thing about these two i have here these live resin cards are legit i bought one the other day that was like watered down how much are those this [ __ ] was that's this [ __ ] this cart right here runs for well i didn't pay this much for it but this cart right here runs for 62 dollars for one gram oh okay i got this one for free too but they um my understanding was that it's always live resin no matter where it is it because this is not my my understanding was that a distillate has to go through the distillation process and live resin doesn't don't know yeah because that was my understanding but you're making me second guess myself well you should check it out because it might be different i know they do have some really fire rosin pens you know that's what they take the ice water extraction and they separate it and then they press it and they put it into there you know but look at the color of those compared to the other 1000 ones look more like yellow you know compared to other but that that's uh but that's rosin that's not resin right no rosin because it's pressed yeah so yeah yeah so this is different though resin is just that's like resin is what makes rosin you know so residence elaborate resins is like all the [ __ ] crystals and oils from the plant you know so but but i think i think no i think we're talking about three different processes we're talking about making a distillate we're talking about making a live resin and then we're talking about making a rosin i think that's well no they're they're all like live resin i'm just telling you that's just fresh frozen like material but no but it goes through it but you can try you can process live resin anyway no you can't though then it won't be yeah no but then but then it won't be 100 live resin because 100 live resin that's legit and i agree with you not all live resins made equal but like 100 live resin is not ever going to be heated up ever it can never be because that's not the process but they don't heat it they like they cool it yeah yeah yeah it's like a whole so that's why i'm saying so yeah so that's live resin but that's what i'm saying so that's live resin with the cool method but distillate is hot so it's they're not the same but people do die what if you have live resin just washed what's that because that's the best [ __ ] that's what's in these that this is 100 that [ __ ] doesn't come out like liquid that's what i'm doing but look look how thick this is like look at it like that shit's thick as [ __ ] dude no but on what i'm saying is like live resin isn't like goo you know it's like it's like cash you know it's like crystals it's like a so you're saying every so you're saying live resin this is interesting because i thought this is telling you that there's something else in there besides live resin extract to make it that liquid yeah yeah or else like because it's not going to be like liquid you know unless you're using like a chemical but this is like traction both of these look like something that you would press and just put in here though this one's a little more liquier but look like this [ __ ] doesn't even move like the shit's pretty solid yeah maybe well you'll have to check it out you know but i've never seen anything that's like a liquid like that that you can just press and then it's just like liquid i don't think they're pressing it they're not pressing it though but well then are they using co2 they're it's it's a whole method where it has to be below like negative 40 degrees so they're using like dry ice yeah they're using some crazy [ __ ] to push this [ __ ] out but like i mean i don't know it's just this is an interesting talk i'm just want to know if it's all natural you know but i don't i know this you know i know this one is for sure or that's what they've told me is that this one is for sure and i'm pretty sure this one is for sure and that's why like but can you do like i know you've smoked some distillate ones that i've gave you for sure like do you taste the difference does it feel more full do you feel um i don't know i don't i don't really you know it's pretty good it tastes good you know but i just want to know if it's like natural you know because if there's only certain ways you can extract i'm about to tour this facility and that's i guess that brings up a whole topic what what is natural what's like without any chemicals so using like heat ice water yeah so those are that's natural you know that's the [ __ ] you're paying a hundred dollars a grand for at the shops for like the [ __ ] paid that before i would never pay that i was like i've made that [ __ ] i've made my own live resident cash you know where you freeze your bud and you wash it in your bubble bags and it's like dabbable resin you know but it's hard to make in a hot environment because it likes to get super sticky you know this is a good conversation like it's the first time we've been on a podcast from what i know like for the most part all the like for most vapes have like chemical extraction in there unless it's like a live rosin or whatever you know but that's or it's like resin rosin just means heat and pressure but if it's with live resin that's going to like be like the highest for the best tasting and that's what this that's what this is supposed to be yeah i wish i had a different shittier cartridge because i had a couple shitty ones like and like i said i could i might even i had a pack over here that was a they said it was live resin but you look at it bro it was light as [ __ ] it didn't have this color and then after talking to some people they were telling me that a lot of people say it's live resin but it's diluted to your point with distillate so there so that's why i'm saying they're two different um things but distillate is like that's the process of making the [ __ ] out of weed they'd [ __ ] cut it with like vitamin k or something but that's where this is different though is because they don't do distillation but to your point well maybe they i'm curious how they make it because like i've seen the way they they do it with like liquid nitrogen and stuff like that where you you throw a bud in there and it like freezes off all the crystals and then you distill that down into like like a liquid like that yeah and that's where i wish that like i don't know i think that i and that's where i'm excited to tour a facility that does it so i can see and give a better answer and see what's going on but i am but to me i can taste the difference with these compared to other ones yeah there's like different there's definitely like levels of quality of those like if you go to like a legit shop and you pay like [ __ ] 60 bucks a gram you're gonna get a good one yeah you better it better be fine but it's like it's there's no guarantee that it's made with like no chemical extraction process you know because that's like i've seen the things it's like a bunch of [ __ ] metal [ __ ] tubes and pipes and you know it's not just all like water and i agree with you and you're right because it is a machine but i think that what they're trying to do but i think they're just injecting like something natural though like co2 compressed that's cold or something i don't know yeah you can do co2 extraction you know that's like one way to do it but i don't know well you'll have to you'll see you know what's crazy bro we're two dudes like [ __ ] deep in this game and we're still not a hundred percent sure yeah you know what i'm saying it's like some a newbie like [ __ ] dude what like yeah i i don't really buy those unless i'm like trying to be like super low-key and like well you got you got plans you got you got all your [ __ ] ready to go this is true buzz that mary jane i we ain't new to this for my stoners and for my cannabis enthusiasts never heard a show as good as this yeah number one it's the best bringing in many special guests in the industry of cannabis business owners to growers even artists you know of so sit back and just roll up the perfect show for

couldn't find a good place to [ __ ] let's shoot this [ __ ] video cuz the Sun is out right now it's 8:50 in the morning and the Sun was shooting straight into the [ __ ] car so I was literally moving around everywhere and every single spot that I was that the Sun was beaming but right now I just move to the back of the [ __ ] gym so I was like [ __ ] it let's shoot this video real quick hmm so guys the long awaited sativa version of guess what [ __ ] brand Alpine guys live resin are gonna be bringing us cuz you guys know that well the per for the people that have been here for a long time he has no I never really [ __ ] the sativa sativa was never really my [ __ ] because the effects that I got from sativa for some reason we're just not good I didn't like the high I didn't like the way I felt you know [ __ ] like that but as of late I've been smoking a lot of sativa and I've been I've been liking it more than usual so yeah I've just been buying sativa pens buying some sativa but here and there but and foremost for the most part for most of the [ __ ] that I've gotten it's pretty [ __ ] good man and today we're gonna be [ __ ] trying tangi bro [ __ ] tangi the infamous tangent if you guys don't know tangi is a worldwide strain like it's been around for a while but a lot of people just crossbreed it and just call it some [ __ ] but yeah guys tangi right here you got the one full gram I've been smoking on this [ __ ] for a couple days I think about like Saturday or Sunday or Saturday or Friday so right here we got the THC I see that shift focuses him but never focuses in so we're going to tell you eight hundred and eighteen point 34 [ __ ] milligrams of THC and you got one point seventy seven milligrams of CBD total in this [ __ ] so now not bad the THC percentage is pretty high I mean when it comes to vape carts they're usually all around the same [ __ ] I'm percentage anyways and then like people keep telling me like oh try these it has it has a 100 percent THC 99% to you bro and honestly I'm gonna tell you the [ __ ] truth like these these have low THC like not low low but like 87 you 86 is in the highest range compared to whether these other cards have but the thing is I've tried these cards that have like like the dank vapes 97% THC and that she was [ __ ] garbage bro I didn't even get me faded so I don't really I don't really think any of that [ __ ] matters any of the THC percentage you know it and I don't think that she really matters at the end of the day like Bud 23% tc20 averages like low e-teens high 20s and that she gets you free to just [ __ ] like I I get super [ __ ] dummy figure out but so we're gonna get into the review with you guys this is what the oil looks like it looks pretty [ __ ] clear man I love it I love the oil you guys know I'm in love with Alpine so I've been smoking like I said since Saturday so where's that Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday today's Wednesday that's five days already I've been Lennie hella people will smoke the [ __ ] and look at still above the little cylinder right here usually when you hit this cylinder right here that's when you know you're running low and need to stock up again but it's above the cylinder stuff has I want to say maybe like point two point three left like on the top part and huh this is probably by far one of my favorite one of my most favorite sativa pens by like as like now because [ __ ] it this [ __ ] lighting and keeps changing because of the Sun so we're gonna take some [ __ ] hits I'm let you guys know I'm completely sober right now I didn't go to work today I [ __ ] killed it kicking it you guys already know the deal mmm so let's get [ __ ] baked on this on this [ __ ] Wednesday morning boys Cheers if you guys are a tune over you guys know the [ __ ] deal 18 over 21 and over whatever it is in your states don't be [ __ ] on that little kid [ __ ] man Cheers all types of [ __ ] people coming back here old ass people oh that's people becoming in the [ __ ] gym Early's [ __ ] yeah so right off the bat as a really citrusy undertone the librarian just hit your chest man and gets you instant coffee it's really nice though mmm by far one of the flate like I like I like the cartridges that have a little bit more citrusy in it like if you guys know what I'm talking about like when you take a hit and it has like a little zing like a little zing in the back of your throat that's what I like about these cartridges and today you guys forgot to [ __ ] mention it sorry about that using it on the good old heavy-duty Alpine battery used to be a little mountain on there you can still kind of see it they fade it off Alpine these batteries are [ __ ] like they last me so long dude it's incredible I haven't charged this [ __ ] in like a week already I just still giving me five hits so we're gonna take a couple hits and then finish off the review for you guys the [ __ ] is this [ __ ] doing this [ __ ] [ __ ] she literally moved her car from over there and all the way next to me she parked it over there like I like when I told you guys I was moving earlier like she parked and right next to me like I [ __ ] next to me it was weird and now she came on the other side of the [ __ ] on the other side of the [ __ ] parking lot and parked right next to me and it's [ __ ] awkward cuz I think she's just staring at me to give you guys a little hot box until she gets the [ __ ] out cuz it's kind of [ __ ] awkward and I've never actually like I think this is the part in my videos where I have to get over the awkward part guys like I'm sorry but you guys are you're just gonna have to get through this [ __ ] with me and [ __ ] she's just straight-up like me in my [ __ ] car while it's [ __ ] hot box but whatever yeah she's gone so cheers that's plus one for today guys right getting over some [ __ ] awkwardness don't you guys agree and take some [ __ ] fat riffs for that cheers boys [Music] those blinkers always [ __ ] gay whoo that was good though good [ __ ] hit right there that officially got me faded one thing tip I want to bring up for you guys dude I see people taking three-second hits for second hits and they take two to three hits why not just take one big fat ass blinker in there that's it you're [ __ ] faded like that first hit that I just took was [ __ ] unnecessaries [ __ ] I mean that blinker that I just took got me [ __ ] stoned like instantly so a quick tip for you guys don't [ __ ] hit don't be hitting a little 3 to 4 seconds just hit blinkers just hit one blinker and there you go you're good so yeah guys I love the flip flavor profile I miss citrusy has like I want to say I would compare it to like it tastes kind of like a little lemony lemony lemony scent to it so yeah that's the flavor profile the Terps on this are definitely they're not the most herpes cartridges I've ever tried but the chirps are definitely there I would give it it like on a scale from 1 to 10 I say the Terps right like maybe 7 it's almost an 8 but yeah the Turks are definitely there so if you're looking for something Turkey this one's for you the high I feel really not I'm not I'm not really mellow like the mellowness is there of the high whatever whatever smoke you like whatever you're smoking oh no indica hybrid wherever you're gonna get that mellow tone so that mellow tone is there I feel I feel still very aware of what I'm doing I'm not I don't feel really feel too slow about anything so - really good hi definitely feel the feel of sativa so I would definitely recommend this guy's overall [ __ ] I want to say I would give this out of 10 probably like a 9 out of 10 mmm Oishi I mean I want to give it a 10 out of 10 [ __ ] I want to give it a 10 I'm trying to figure out what I can find wrong with it but no I'm just gonna give a 10 out of 10 [ __ ] it there's nothing wrong with this [ __ ] definitely one of the best of TV pens I've ever tried go get this if you're looking for a really good sativa go get it right now and the flavor profile everything where we [ __ ] talked about this [ __ ] so let's just get on to [ __ ] chill talk and sit and smoke sesh guys so if you guys remember the hospital I [ __ ] told you guys if I hit 500 subs I'm gonna do the halftime challenge this that's so [ __ ] goin on so for all my new subscribers I have been getting go down comment share with your [ __ ] homies get me to 500 subs and I'm gonna be doing three challenges I mean making seperate videos are not gonna be all in one video so I'll be doing the the half gram balling challenge dude this one gotta [ __ ] kill me let me tell you guys why I don't [ __ ] smoke I mean I smoke bud but I don't smoke it that often to be taking half gram bongs dude a bong ribs dude and I don't even [ __ ] take bong rips period the last time I took a bong rip was probably last year this is such an amazing flavor but yeah gonna be taking the half gram bong rip and we're gonna be taking the half gram dab challenge I might be able to do that not a lot I feel like if I prepare myself for these upcoming them for the upcoming challenge man cuz I've already been taking dabs I've been taking like you know waxed cartridge hits obviously it's not as strong as I'm a [ __ ] dab is gonna be but it's gonna it's gonna prepare me somewhat so pretty confident in that and one thing that I'm for sure gonna be doing that I know for a fact I'm gonna be [ __ ] completing the half gram babe challenge man so I'm gonna be going out and buying a half gram of some fire ass [ __ ] I'm not I was getting I was thinking about just going cheap mode and buying like like a [ __ ] cheap-ass cartridge and just doing it because I'm it's all gonna go to waste anyways you know but um I was gonna do that but I think since it is gonna be a kind of difficult challenge like half gram in one [ __ ] sitting I'm gonna [ __ ] eat something good something that's gonna be like I'll [ __ ] yeah like I don't really mind hating this so I'm probably gonna go buy an Alpine probably gonna go I'm gonna try to go get la Kush I don't know if le Kirsch has half gram disposables I might try to get one of those for the video so those three challenges guys if you guys are [ __ ] looking forward to it like I am just go hit like go hit that [ __ ] subscribe button man and then we're gonna get that [ __ ] rolling oh I'm [ __ ] excited right now it's crazy how how fast we've been jumping I know I talk about it a lot but I've been getting so many [ __ ] so's I think in the last in the last week I gained over like a hundred and sixty subdued which is [ __ ] insane and then I also learn how to [ __ ] French and hell I was just trying to teach myself how to do it but I'll learn how to do that [ __ ] not the best but you know with practice I'm [ __ ] stoned right now yeah so what do you guys have planned on this [ __ ] amazing day let me know in the comments below what you guys are [ __ ] doing today let me know if

next one peace", "h8XduReVYPA": "yo guys what's going on welcome back to another kart review um we back in the car I just picked up these cards that's why I'm reviewing them in the car I don't know I didn't want to do it at home so I have two cards here I'm only gonna review one you guys know the deal I've been recommended these a few times by a few different people I've never really gotten I could chance to buy them I haven't seen too many deals on them so I saw one today and I needed some so I was like [ __ ] it so the first one I got well the one that we're not reviewing today is the Select Ely these are the elite lives so like the live resin one this is the Death Star I got this one because you guys know I'm more of an indica or sativa kind of guy at least at the momentum starting to head towards indicas but um yeah this one's got Death Star in the name so how am I not gonna get it right by the way if you see me looking around it's because I'm in an abandoned [ __ ] mall I got these at jars cannabis MetroCenter which is the mole that's closing so it's like ghetto as [ __ ] over here anyway if you live in Phoenix you know what I'm talking about anyway the next one we have that I'm actually gonna review today is the desert lime right so this is a sativa you guys know sativas for me right now we're coming at 80 5.30% for the THC contents in the sativa and the hybrid earthy I'm sorry the indica is coming in at eighty four point eight four percent potency that's the potency I'm sorry the THC presents seventy-nine and then seventy-seven with some decimals anyway all that crap out of the way blah blah blah [ __ ] this we're gonna open it right now and take some hits always open it from the bottom I don't know why I don't you have to I haven't had a live resin cart you know [ __ ] minute guys I've had a select carton just as long cool so here it is you guys know the standard mouthpiece I select comes with it's actually really nice mouthpiece my personal favorite you guys know that I prefer it over this one right here sorry I'm [ __ ] mess so this is the Rove by the way this row of cart guys I love Rove if I see another deal I'll probably end up getting it because it is a very nice car highly recommend even this one feels heavier than the Select cart by the way I was mentioning that in my last video that this is a heavy duty cart it's heavier than the full gram or the half gram that's filled so just for comparison anyway got the half ass charged who's penny here go ahead and pop off this gay-ass cap throw it over there it's on the floor now my been alright I do not have any liquids in my car I was not prepared for this I was not planning to come here but I did so you know I got to live with my consequences here's the [ __ ] wax and you see if I figure out what a camera a little bit darker than some of the other waxes not too much doesn't move you know sorry you guys can see I'm [ __ ] sweating and if you hear background noise like a little whatever that is um it's a hundred and [ __ ] ten degrees out and I'm sitting in my car in my ACS only on two otherwise I tried it three is way too loud so bear with me guys it's gonna get hot I'm gonna [ __ ] die in this car right now doing this video but it's for you guys so yeah let's do another one oh wait another one I'm not even high I'm just stupid Cheers okay I'm gonna be honest with you guys tastes like [ __ ] and it tastes like battery acid I mean see that bubble that's right boy let me try to see through my fingers there see that bubble yeah that was already there before I hit it so I could be hitting out of that pocket but I taste it straight like battery acid and I don't feel anything yet so number two Cheers okay okay so it turns out it's the same [ __ ] taste all right it should dog doo-doo well who not a fan of the taste guys I guess you don't really go for a live resin cards for the taste so before you come at me in the comments I know that [ __ ] alright so if you've already comments it delete that [ __ ] but you know I do actually feel it no the cards would look out more well there's a bubble it's already a nice [ __ ] size bubble tune that's that's nice I guess yeah I like it not bad um to be honest I'd say I like the RO better already but I've only taken two hits so you guys know we do the traditional three here we'll take one more and then I'll judge let's see I have their seat right here I got these two for a deal normally they're like 50 bucks each which is pretty pricey but they are life resin so you guys know [ __ ] but it came out too yeah two of them before tax with 65 bucks with taxes 7059 so you're paying $35 for a half gram Carter essentially and it's not the best in my opinion I would say I'd prefer the Rose because they are cheaper by fourteen dollars I can't say anything against death star yet I'll try that one it's not mine I'm giving it to somebody who has their med card legally right no feds nothing it's all legal I bet um but I'll hit that one I'll let you guys know in the next video I might even review that one I might be able to do that I don't see why I couldn't so if that's the next video you'll see I have another cart already at home that I can review for the next one so it's not going to be too long for another upload because this one should be a couple days after the last one which is nice so yeah let's do one more hit here and then I'm gonna leave and go get some food because I am starving I get Chipotle so if Chipotle's watching the sponsor me too all of that [ __ ] sponsor me Cheers yeah so it doesn't even taste like a dab or anything it just straight tastes like you're hitting an empty heart and that's my problem with this one if you hate that battery acid taste do not get at least do not get a when is this desert lime try another one it's wait no this is a hybrid but I'm so stupid it even says on the box right there I'm gonna pinky that when I ordered it I swear to God I pick sativa I don't pick hybrids oh never mind I'm just even stupider they didn't have any hybrids it was hybrid sativa dominant and then okay I'm sorry guys so yeah this is a sativa hybrid that's the answer thank you John Trebek anyway guys I'm pretty joins I'm not gonna lie so this car for 35 bucks I'd say this car it's worth it there's a guy walking behind me I hope I don't stabbed yeah I'll let you guys judge for this one I'm gonna start raiding carts at us out of 10 yeah we'll do 10 I was gonna say seven for some reason but at its head I'm gonna give this one a 6 yeah it's a 6 for these live resins I'd say Rove since I didn't write it I'd say Rove is probably a 7 point 5 and 8 so you know I'll start writing them now that way you guys can get a judgment if you're interested so yeah this one's up in the air if you guys want to test it out I like you guys have said I've been recommended a few times not the biggest fan but you know glad I tried it any other recommendations let me know yeah other than that guys that's the end of the video I will see you in the next one deuces", "p_nAXoxpI6g": "descriptors there's just one problem the words we use to classify this plant don't actually mean anything if you shop for marijuana chances are you're familiar with these names indica or sativa indica and sativa indica versus sativa indica and sativa and I just basically call it daytime pot a nighttime pot the sativa indica binary has been the basis for how most marijuana is sold sativas provide an energetic high feeling while Perdiccas give a lethargic stoned feeling much of what we think of these things are just myths because of extensive crossbreeding how a plant today looks doesn't necessarily have anything to do with how it makes you feel used to be very easy to visually identify and it was that broadleaf varieties were indica and thin leaf varieties were sativa and now because they've been so intercropped and interbred so much you can have a broad leafed variety that is straight-up sativa in its effects and we can't do a genetic test for indica or sativa because there's no genetic sample of pure indica or sativa and we're not sure that there ever was when you have people labeling something 70% sativa 70% indica it's 100% subjective it's done by somebody smoking it and deciding that they are getting either an indica or a sativa event from indica dominant to indica set of a hybrid sounds really technical and scientific even though it's complete nonsense so people say it I think we don't look back at this period and laugh at those hipsters in the legal store selling us sativa and indica and telling us what it does and all this hokey [ __ ] I think we're gonna laugh at that even if the sativa indica labels are meaningless you would assume at least the strain names mean something when you purchase", "97TNvahlDtU": "okay I wanted to make passionate love to my wife tonight we all want to smoke a joint together and deeply connect and some fun what do you recommend so the the question there honestly would be if you are concerned about falling asleep or not because sometimes people are and if you're not concerned about falling asleep a lot of crushes tend to be the body high that connects these dreams yeah the body high that comes along with indicas can often produce additional sensitivity body sensitivity and so for example something like the sour cherry Kush or the plush berry or this well the sex cush is a little meditative but you get the idea which is you know something like this is is is very has a very nice head body high that can be really stimulating the banana cush is it could be a good choice too a lot of people find oh this is a great this is a great description here The Hustler coach so oh gee coach a lot of people find stimulating the Kim dog is a little bit has a little bit more of a head height to it so this is going to be something that is body calming fairly fairly quickly body call me with a head high but then the head height wears off that's one of those other things that's interesting in hybrids is that very often when they have both sativa and indica characteristics the head high part wears off more quickly than the body high part and the body high part is a part that that makes you feel relaxed and maybe sleepy so a good hybrid like that would be a good choice but yeah if you're really looking to bond with a partner though to some people actually really enjoy things that are way more energetic if they're having a night in and the goal is to make sure that they are you know kind of connected and focused and attentive to their partner so that's a completely different way to go but that's that's the next you know the next question with a goodbye tenders they'll be like okay few problems with falling asleep when you smoke in because because if you don't then you probably go that way he goes an indica dominant Harbor", "dIs1XpetjuA": "[Music] what's up guys simplicit here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another delta 8 video this cannabinoid has been really really popular lately you know a lot of people have been stumbling upon it you know my myself included i stumbled upon it not too long ago i've been uh told by many of you subscribers to check it out i've made previous videos on canon clear and i kind of commented about it being pink and it was just totally unknown to me but apparently delta 8 thc gives the oil a slight pinkish hue and that's what makes it pink but you know i was ignorant at the time i didn't really know what delta 8 was and many other people probably don't know what the [ __ ] that is too you know people probably don't even know that we smoke delta nine you know and it's good that these videos a lot more of these videos are out on youtube because you know not a lot of people are willing to read nowadays especially on like scientific terms and all that stuff delta eight and all that stuff so it's good that videos are out here you know so many videos are being made right now on delta eight and you know let's just make some more you know because it is a cannabinoid that's been known for a while but it's barely getting studied right now and i do have my delta eight cartridge right here as well let me just take a hit see it's a slight pink issue like i said i've been saving this just because i've been told that tolerance for delta eight does not affect your potency for delta nine so it's good to have one of these to maybe smoke during the day and then at night when uh you know i want to get that you know that slumped effect that you get from you know fat dabs of delta 9 thc but yeah just uh delta 8 is good you know uh it's barely studied right now i know a lot of people i've been talking about it's basically as popular as when cbd came out and a lot of people are kind of skeptical you know like is this really gonna [ __ ] get me high and i've seen a lot of videos where they consider it diet weed weeds little brother which are perfectly nicknames for this because it's really like a mild height compared to you know your regular delton 9 thc but let me just take a hit really really good cartridge from delta 8 hemp shout out to them once again for you know just hooking me up with some products some delta 8 product albeit you know the gummies i really enjoyed you know they had no taste of cannabis at all and they just were really really good quality candies you know if you were to give me those gummies and just didn't tell me anything i would have thought they were just regular ass candies because there was no taste whatsoever the chew for a gummy was just perfect and the flavor was there you know very fruity flavors and the cartridge very very refreshing hits it tastes like to me it tastes like 7up but i digress let's take another hit so like i said it is a cannabinoid that's been known for a while but recently it's been picking up steam there's a some rumors i don't know if these are true or not but a lot of people have been saying or some people have been saying that delta 8 is basically made from cbd uh let me know in the comments if you know a little bit more about that but i've been told that i've seen some comments and uh yeah it's just some crazy like it really just popped out of nowhere you know like all of a sudden people were talking about delta 8 thc just like they were with cbd and it's really kind of just like the same thing you know now that delta 8 thc is kind of like getting looked at by the government they might like ban it now i hope that it doesn't [ __ ] strike my videos or anything you know so if you do see that my delta 8 videos aren't there anymore it's probably because of that taking some hits off the delta 8 cartridge so i was looking up on it it says delta eight it's not naturally able to to have high amounts of thc percentage apparently um but yeah not bad like i said it is like a diet weed so if you're expecting to hit delta athc and [ __ ] just be slumped you got another thing coming as i end off this video you know just a brief explanation of what delta 8 thc is it does hit you but not as hard as you would want it to if you are uh everyday smoker of delta 9 thc but before i end this video i read up yesterday on way of leaf if you guys haven't heard of that website yet it's basically an encyclopedia of anything cannabis and it's uh i follow them on instagram and one of their posts says that they found a new th or a new cannabinoid and it's called thcp and it has the potential to be even more potent than the regular thc so i i might do a video on that i just want to like it was just like a picture with words like a little meme with like a fact stat on it or whatever maybe if i look up into it more i might dedicate a video to it but other than that you know hopefully you did learn something about delta 8 thc like i said it it is it's been around for a while but really now it's just been picking up steam so regardless if you buy these products from delta eight hemp or three chai or whatever just do your research i still heard that three chai has a cdt which is cannabis derived terpenes so i'm interested in tasting delta eight thc with cdt like i'm i'm assuming it tastes like raw garden but you know we'll see we'll see one day one day i'll get that for the channel but other than that hopefully you did enjoy this video peace out [Music] you", "bzGdyneMAzU": "yo yo yo what's up G fam today guys hoppin straight into it it's been a long week for me it's been a stressful week for a lot of people guys I don't know if I'm ready to get into the situation to the topic yet I might save it for another video you know it's still kind of early but this week has been a rough week guys that's why I haven't been able to produce any content or anything like that so sorry if you guys haven't missed it on the videos but today I'm bringing you guys a quick [ __ ] the last the last of the tree-based guys tree-based clear the best one agent orange like literally probably by far the most potent one the most the the best-tasting one and the one that gets me the most [ __ ] faded so this one right here is a hybrid I didn't think a hybrid would get me that [ __ ] up but the times that I've been smoking it and everybody that let hit they're like [ __ ] bro this is literally the best the best one ever so yeah guys this is the packaging that it comes in it's a better upgrade than what they used to have they used to have just the regular little plastic ones where you could see through and it's like right there but you know got a step your game up if you want to being the best and then this tree I suppose they come in these little [ __ ] clear tubes and all professional so yeah guys Agent Orange look at this [ __ ] um I'm more than halfway through with it already look how clear that [ __ ] is you can see the holes everything like water like if there's nothing in there but yeah guys I'm pretty much halfway done with this and man like I still haven't gotten tired of it I'm not gonna lie with the other ones with the Mendo breath with the Wi-Fi og I got tired of them pretty quick I got tired of them within like 2 to 3 days and I was just like [ __ ] do you like on time I'm just waiting for the next one so this one is [ __ ] bomb though this is by far the best one Agent Orange you guys when you take a hit of it it literally takes like alright you guys know one you guys are gonna open a brand new [ __ ] fresh orange peel that [ __ ] that first little peel and you like you take a sniff and it's like orange peel like I don't know if you guys like that I mean it I like it so that's what it tastes like guys it's nothing artificial there's no official flavoring like just like a little hint of like orange peel that's probably why they call it Agent Orange and [ __ ] it's hot today sorry guys I keep wiping my sweat off but it's [ __ ] hot today it's already [ __ ] 4 o'clock and it's 93 degrees though so we're gonna smoke on this [ __ ] I tell you guys how I feel I'm sober right now so I'm gonna tell you guys how this [ __ ] makes me feel what I like about it what I don't like about it and we're gonna go straight through the review guys so turn off the [ __ ] air real quick so you guys can see these fat ass clouds and this one actually produces a lot more vapor than all the other ones I'm not sure why but it produces a pretty good amount watch [ __ ] delicious and what I like about these cartridges men but to never it's never a boring hit like even though I didn't like the men doe breath and the Wi-Fi og that much I still enjoyed them just because it was a really strong high like compare compare it to like brass knuckles and heavy hitters and all those other shit's like this is pretty top-notch quality and I understand why you have to pay $40 for half a gram you know I I mean I do kind of wish it would be a little bit lower maybe in the 30 35 range because 40 is pretty absurd like you can get you can go out and get yourself something not as good but pretty much up there in quality for $50 full gram and this is 40 for half gram so it's kind of like you know 5050 this is definitely after trying all four of these and after having these for probably like two weeks I I'd say if you have the money go ahead and go buy it if you don't have the money don't don't sweat it you know you I'm sure a time will come when you'll be able to afford it but don't be killing yourself over this Sh it's definitely it's worth it though it's worth it like I'll tell you that it's definitely worth it if you have the money and you're debating it what should I get is it worth it yeah it's definitely worth it and I've tried pretty much for now I'm pretty sure I've tried every single tree based flavor that on the market that they have I think the only one I haven't tried it is the gelato but I'm not really a fan of gelato wax cuz you know for me I like smoking the the real weed from burner for a more originated originated from so I think everything else is pretty much a knockoff so yeah guys so we're gonna keep talking on this I'm outside the gym right now and put it I'm gonna hit the gym after this [ __ ] this [ __ ] always has me feeling good I go into the gym and I just like get in my zone and I start working out guys so if you guys are 18 over 21 and over whatever it is in your state and make sure you guys are smoking along let me know what you guys are smoking on in the [ __ ] description I'm about to turn the [ __ ] air on his hot and ya guys Cheers mmm all I ever take is like probably two to three hits max to this because it is potent like like I said in last video guys this [ __ ] has to be the most herpes cartridge on the market like the hit that you get from it it's like no other eye I've smoked so much [ __ ] in my life nothing nothing hits me this hard no no I mean other than like dabs and [ __ ] like that but like from cartridge wise this is probably by far the best one one thing one thing guys I know I know some of you guys might want to wait for this but I know they they just announced on their Instagram that they're gonna be releasing one gram cartridges and I'm wondering I'm trying to guess how much with OSHA's they're gonna cost like you think they're gonna cost the same amount they're gonna call as like two of these would cost you know $80 [ __ ] $75 but I don't know guys we'll see we'll see what they [ __ ] decide on what the pricing is going to be hopefully it's not too much because I know I know usually come B's charge for the cartridge itself because I know the cartridges are pretty expensive they're like 5 to 10 a pop I heard and then so hopefully it's not that expensive and we're gonna take one last rip of this guy's hopefully this coming week I am able to do some more content it's still gonna be a pretty busy month in my in my opinion we'll see how it goes but yeah it's good I'm soaking to be pretty busy guys but now that I'm reaching I'm getting higher in my um subscribe go and view count I know my evaders I've been popping off lately and I appreciate that I love you guys shout out for all the people watching my videos commenting on my videos you guys keep me [ __ ] motivated and keep it going and I wanna probably soon pause I started maybe this week next week I don't know whenever I find out I'm I'm probably gonna start live streaming for at least an hour to two hours a day I want to start streaming probably for at night and might be streaming the new blackout if you guys would be interested in the new color TV for I'll probably be streaming that [ __ ] and then cuz I what what my plan is now that once I hit 100 I wanted that that pretty much gives me a decent amount of people that watching me I would say you know 100 people so every time I livestream I were to get a couple like 20 30 or whatever the cases and basically what I wanted to do is just live stream and have more people from other communities like the Fortnight community come in and watching and check out my [ __ ] and let's see if they if they like my content and they go ahead and hit the subscribe button you guys know how it goes so you guys should be seeing some more [ __ ] like that I'm gonna probably be getting into more different [ __ ] I'm kind of getting over the wax game or the cartridge game because I feel like I've tried everything this tree base right here with best on the [ __ ] best on the market right now so I really don't know what to try man I know I want I probably want to head out to cookies because I checked out their Instagram and I saw that they have a collaboration with them with the G with the G pins you know guys are no little [ __ ] so you put wax pins and hit it they have a collaboration with those so I want to maybe go pick one of those up see if they're not a [ __ ] expensive there because they're shit's always are overpriced as [ __ ] to go run for like a hundred a gram is stupid but [ __ ] man that [ __ ] has me fade I don't even be able to go to the gym right now but yeah guys if you guys liked today's video make sure to go leave a like make sure to go leave a comment make sure to hit that subscribe button and make sure to share with your friends I'll be creating some

your pothead your pop-pop man here and today we'll be talking about the top 10 weed hybrids now I compiled this list based on popularity notoriety and what's this big recently through research some of these may be strands that you might not prefer but we'd be happy to hear in the comments what your top ten would be so with that let's get started with Garrett beheads choice of top 10 we hybrids let's start with number 10 canna tonic now canna tonic is a unique hybrid strains bright by Spanish seed bank resin seeds specifically for its low THC content and high CBD content a cross between a female MK ULTRA and a famous g13 haze male it produces a relatively short-lived mellow high that is also uplifting and powerfully relaxing thanks to the high CBD content as one of the premier medical

mild sweet vaguely [ __ ] citrusy flavor number nine purple crack now there are at least two variations of the strains purple crack one bred by Kelly connection claims to be green crack connects crossed with a black water male the other is bred by the vulva family using the juicy fruit in combination with green crack despite the mix and genetics both express themselves a sativa dominant with hybrids the delivery of smooth bursts of energy with an elevated mood purple crack is a delightful way to stimulate creativity are the facts that are presented with a mix of flavors ranging from the floral earthy notes of pine rush citrus fruit number 8 Chucky de banana Chiquita banana buy utopia farms makes the banana OG cut to the next level with an average Tec percentage pushing 33% a cross between parents trades OG Kush and banana Chiquita banana leads with a potent heavy sizzle which then melts into a vicious body buzz as relaxing but not sedated these cush effects continue to gain potency over time creeping over the body this powerful hybrid is an outstanding option for patients struggling to hurdle their tolerance barrier and its effects are also well suited for those

headband several renditions of the blueberry have been hybrid are known to exist which is unsurprising considering the popularity of his parents trains but the original blueberry head badge from noir cows Emerald triangle seeds is the most documented version rather than a simple cross of headband and blueberry the EGS version combines 76 blueberry Emerald og cush Cali sour D and pre 98 bubble cush

number two oh gee cush og cush makes up the genetic backbone of West Coast cabinets better varieties but in spite of the ubiquity its genetic origins remain a mystery this famed strand arrives in Los

seven which include Tahoe OG s FV o ye ghost OG and Diablo [Music] and then the number one hybrid white widow among the most famous strains worldwide is white widow a balanced hybrid first bred in

them out on Instagram at a arica vapor with a website Arica vapor calm peace out", "g-Xhg2KjIao": "I think I think we should get into that\nwhole indica versus sativa thing...  all right all right that's a good one yeah so I pulled\nup the the web page here taking a look at the the story that we've got linked\nup out there so I think it's it's interesting that well since probably\nbefore the 60s when people were trying to come up with a way to describe to a\npotential customer like hey this is this or this is that and here are some\nexamples and what do you call it okay well it's bla bla bla bla bla right I\nthink that that was all really kind of based on maybe like the scientific name\nof the plant but it also is more describing the characteristics of the\nplant like if it's a sativa it's tall or more lanky plant with maybe smaller\nleaves versus like an indica which is going to be a short squatty plant that's\ngonna have these fat wider leaves right no well that's one of the things this\nthe story covers is you know it's a term it's it's a it's a classification that's\nas old as pot itself right I mean it was the visual distinction I think between\nthe two plants and then from there they noticed certain characteristics and they\njust kind of gotten associated with it but what the story kind of goes into\nthat we have listed over at the the website is what what you're specifically\nlooking for is the chemical makeup the the chemical composition well now we\nhave technology that we can see like this strain has XY and Z in it it's much\nmore than that but what's important and interesting to\nme is how all of those cannabinoids all interact together to create a high it's\nalmost like a complex recipe where you sprinkle a little bit of this and a\nlittle bit of this and all together creates this gourmet meal well in this\ncase it's it's it's a feeling right and that in effect in effect exactly and so\nthe smells of the terpenes combined with the other\ncannabinoids really create a specific effect that well one of the things I'm\nnot be defined by indica or sativa a it's sure and you can get similar highs\nfrom both different supposed types of plant look flow for example if you had a\nsativa sorry to cut you off there are G if you had a sativa a whole hour and\nthen you had a indica flower and both of them could give you similar highs but\nagain to define it by Okaloosa Tebow will only be an uppity high an indica\nwill only be low couch lock higher yeah it's just it's too limited professor G\nprofessor G go for it sorry my bad alright so one of the things I find\ninteresting that story which by the way is I think it's important Portland\nMercury News is where we found this but right in there it makes mention that\nyeah we hear about the cannabinoids like T THC and CBD but there's over a hundred\nor almost a hundred other ones that have been identified and so it's this huge\nmelting pot of possibilities these melting pot of combinations that can\nkind of go into creating this but then also something else that they mentioned\nthat I thought was kind of cool is before I think people have associated\nlike the tannins to be more of associating with like the sensory inputs\nof the the strains such as you know the aroma or the flavor or that type of deal\nthere but there's actually evidence to start to suggest that that also plays a\nrole in the overall psychedelic effects of it does slant to it does so i\ninteresting information I highly recommend it and so here's one other\nthing that you know we could talk about is that now it's a matter of educating\nthe public and the customer can come in with an idea of hey like I would like to\nlook at a strain and the strain could maybe have these particular\nproperties to it now I can actually homed in on the results that I want to\nget from the medicine or from the the cannabis itself so right that's what I\nthink is so awesome about it is that you'll get these there's so many office\nawesome strains that are out there that have different properties to them and\nyou know you can kind of find and get very specific with in what you're trying\nto address so for example if it's muscular dystrophy or seizures or\nsomething like that user gets specific very very specific and I think that's\nawesome so do you public getting the knowledge but it's specifically on that\ndo you really like do you believe that the public is going to adopt a system\nthat is any more complex than indica sativa hybrid you know and I mean in\nMass in Mass and I think that's that's one of the downsides to it is number one\nit's so engrained into the culture as it is right now right but everybody grew up\nwith it so here's what's gonna happen now all of a sudden there's a hundred\ndifferent possibilities and I want to add uttered it that the car asked with\nyou know fifteen other things to get the exact spectra I'm looking yeah like how\ndo we how do we reasonably distill that down into something that's consumable\nwe're gonna get you're gonna get okay so look at cigarettes right sure so you\nhave camels got a whole bunch of different types they have the the\nTurkish royal they have the Turkish gold right and then all the they're all\nselling tobacco yeah and the ninety nine so they have tobacco in different blends\nsure I think what will happen is that you'll see that you're gonna get a\nindica and it's going to have the indica traits so if you will those specific\ntraits that people associate with an indica plant and then you're gonna get\nthe same thing with sativa you can get the same thing with hybrid so you'll get\na middle high you'll get a left high and a right that that analogy is interesting\nthough because also what you find in the cigarettes in the tobacco market yes the\ndistinction in brands for in cigarettes obviously it's it's by flavor whatever\nlike you have you know obviously a camel does taste different than a Marlboro\nwe're definitely you have your Lucky Strikes you've got your\nI mean all these different lately different right maybe yeah maybe we'll\nsee manufacturers taking specialties and specific combinations of the\ncannabinoids yeah and then you're gonna get the micro brew type of scenario\nwhere you're gonna get these smaller guys and they're really working on their\nstrains and they're really working on the genetics to give you very specific\nthings and they'll have a line of products that you'll be able to choose\nfrom and I think that's awesome it's incredible and the more research that we\ndo the more information that we get the more fresh information that the public\nis gonna get and then they'll be able to differentiate between one strain and\nanother strain and what's really gonna do what they needed to do for them so no\nno it's good stuff on really good stuff yeah no III like that I think it's about\ninto people will research take this article and then go out and start to\nresearch about Turkey and start to research about things CB and CBD THC and\nall the like and then you'll start to see how those effects manifest on the\nbody right right awesome all right again for more information everybody you can\nhead on over to the contact buzz dot-com well the story's linked up over there\nwe'll have show notes on this particular episode as well so there's links down in\nthe description below but obviously we encourage you to head over there and you\nknow click through to the the original article we barely graced the surface on\nall these things so there's tons more information to typically need from that\nwhat's the next what's the next step big G well I think why don't we do something\nfun", "Qv7o2axDp50": "[Music] I woke up today said I wanna

smokin pot with Steve today we're going to talk about the top 12 pots trained to help people who suffer from PTSD I've reviewed around 60 strains in the last six months and these ones are the top 12 that claim that they help in some kind of fashion so I'll give you all 12 and I have created a playlist I've done full reviews on every one of these strains and I'll create a playlist that you can go through and take a look at each of the strains and see what sounds like the kind of strain you're interested in like if you're looking for an indica purine because you know cuz you want something that will help you sleep at night or if you're looking for something that you can stay up so you're looking for you know a sativa or a balanced I'll talk of you know talk about the mix is a different in each of them each of the videos I talked about that what they do so I'll just go through the list right now just so you have an overview like I'm working from the lowest THC to this highest so from the weakest to the strongest so you figure out where you want to be on that list chem dog is number 12 on the list since 55% in dakar its THC is 19% it's that's a nice strain it's a very light light stone next is number 11 is hash plant which is 80% indica and again it's THC is 13 to 19 percent it's a pretty light stone good for people who don't smoke a lot of pot number 10 on the list is blue cheese it's an 8% into car and the THC is a 20% and what I Norris thought blue cheese is it makes you hungry so if you're having a problem with loss of appetite at the same time my help number nine Alyssa's God button it's 5050 indica sativa and the THC is 15 to 20% and I noticed when I was smoking bought the gods but that I really did salon me old a lot I just got daydreaming that if I find myself just daydreaming and so I kind of liked it Ashley number eight is cheese it's 5050 and the THC is 15 to 20% has CBD of 1% and this one's the real meltdown at the end of the day kind of plot so if you wanna get on the coaching you just want to stay there this is really good for that Nexus had headband and it's a 60% indica and THC 17 to 24 percent so now we're getting up into the more powerful zones of the pop range and headband was very I was very creative on that pot and it was fun it was a fun pop to smoke Romulan is a hundred percent indica and it's 20 to 24 percent raw melon will put you to sleep it's my favorite pot to smoke just before I go to bed puts you up like a lighting really nice for that Cinderella 99 it's 85 percent sativa and a THC of 25 percent this has been a real favorite of mine for years years it's a really good pot for going out partying number four on the list is pineapple Express it's a 60% sativa a THC of 25 percent and it's a pretty good stone yeah I'd say it's a nice stone number 3 on the list is Sour Diesel it's 9% sativa THC of 19 to 25 percent and it's a really fun party pot this is a strong pump number two on the list is white widow which is sixty percent in indica and THC of 20 to 25 percent it's great pot and leaves me happy and relaxed and number one on the list is Girl Scout cookies which is 60% sativa at THC of 17 to 28 percent and it's killer pot so now I can now you get out overview go ahead and watch them look at the videos in the playlist and narrow down what you're really looking for and really hope this helps until next time", "-HbPYGcOqRw": "all right you always get YouTube guys quick little video today man I'm not going to make this to lump I like 17 minutes its first day back well not first day back I got back yesterday from Georgia a little update today's Monday I got school right now I'm on my way to school not real quick and the as you guys can see if I tell the video man we're gonna be reviewing these new 20/20 future vapes like their cartridges but they've they call them VAP so I'm not sure why they do that so first off this is the packaging right here it's very very similar to every other packaging you know it's nothing new they do not have the lab test results on this so that's that's a negative right off the bat so this one is fruit punch Hawaiian Hawaii red so once you open it up it says your favorite vape right there open this sucker up let it go something fell out alright so alright it gives you a little plastic card unbox vape car attached to 510 thread battery to cartridge inhale 2 times so adjustable airflow ring and streamline metal tip design 20 20 V so this is the packaging right here 2020 vape it's not bad it's pretty good it's new definitely and on the packaging itself it says made with pure distillate cannabis oil 1 gram net weight lab tested certified but they don't have the lab test results nor do they have a website why you can get the lab test results so I'm guessing it's not really verified lab tested so let's pop this sucker out yeah it was pretty thick because it has some little small air bubbles right here and they're definitely not moving up so upside-down still not moving anything and let me give you guys a little close-up of it so alright here's a cartridge itself 2020 I'm not sure hopefully that's focused up enough but those are the little air flows on the bottom you can move them to all the way open or halfway close or all like obviously you don't want it all the way closed because then there's no air flow so 20:20 right there hi effect here's the oil real quick flip upside down for you guys it's a very very it's I mean it's pretty gold I'm not gonna say it's clear because it's definitely not clear clear but yeah nice little gold color not moving at all so cool so let's see take this little plastic piece off throw that away and if this is actually a really heavy cartridge dude like honestly this is a pretty heavy cartridge like this is this has to be one of the most heaviest cartridges I've had today it's probably because of the tip and then the adjustable ring on the bottom so I don't have any batteries charged so I'm just gonna have to you stick with the O's because this is the most charged so we're gonna do full air flow and then we're gonna be hitting this off of a three point five volts alright so fruit punch guys 20 24 18 over 21 and over you guys know that the old man make sure you guys let me know in the comments below what you guys are smoking on and yeah man let's get this week started - cheers guys [Music] that was a big hit nine your life whoa so right off the bat damn does she hot that she got me whoo right off the bat you get like a artificial definitely an artificial fruit punch so when you when it comes to fruity flavors like this I mean I would I don't expect anything other than like artificial flavors like I'm not gonna lie I just got it cuz it was the best one I didn't want an OG cuz I don't know I just wanted something flavorful to be smoking on you know I was smoking a lot of them like in Georgia I was smoking the West Coast cured tits and that one was really oh gee so I didn't really enjoy that one that much because I'm not really an OG smoker I like more like free things cookies things like that so oh wow that was that was hit dude all right so right off the bat the airflow on this is amazing I'm pretty faded I'm pretty high I mean right off the bat my eyes are starting to get a little bit low this is a indica so yeah it definitely has me [ __ ] I'm feeling nice right now and then the flavor like I said artificial fruit punch it's not too heavy it's very very subtle but you definitely do get taste it and we're gonna move it to the halfway point halfway airflow let's see how it hits a little bit better wow that is that is amazing I like the air flow that this is something a lot of cartridge company should do because I feel like most cartridges have way too much air flow you get a lot of spit spit back because of the air flow so being able to adjust your own air flow is pretty cool I'm gonna do this um 3/4 close so yep that's actually a lot better you turn the air on ma'am starts waiting for all this coffee oh yeah yeah oh you said yeah like five times but it's because I don't even know what it how to describe this so artificial flavoring the Terps the Terps are they're there but barely like if they barely added any terpenes it's very very subtle you don't get too much you get more of the fruit punch hit more than like overpowering the Terps so it's not that great I mean I would like it more I like a more cleaner cleaner whole you know like obviously I can't compare this to libraries and other things like that because they're not in the same category but yeah this distillate definitely isn't one of the best what I put in my top up definitely not and would I recommend this I mean here's the thing these costs pretty much the same as any other [ __ ] desolate cartridge how like what West Coast care Alpine freaking and it's in the same price point so you why not get the better product instead of getting this like I understand you know it's a newer on the market you know people want to see what the hype is about but it's definitely my final thoughts on this would be that it's definitely not worth it like yeah the adjustable airflow is cool we had the metal tip is cool you know it's a it's definitely a whole new design to me I've never seen a cartridge like this I've never seen a cartridge with this tip adjustable airflow you know and then distillate isn't bad the distillate isn't bad it's definitely there but I don't know it's just not a top quality cartridge for sure like but I'm just gonna enjoy it you know already bought it so whatever we're gonna take another pull out of this and then we're just gonna continue with some little talk and before I head out so cheers guys man that is amazing you're not amazing but you know being able to enjoy high in the morning is one of the most amazing things so yeah I'm gonna write this product the good six out of ten on the quality I mean the oil is what matters the most and the quality that oil isn't just isn't there you know it has some it has its goods it has it's bad but if that I feel like the Bad's overpower the good - definitely so 2020 you got I mean you're new to the game you know you definitely have done more than a lot of other distillate companies have done so you guys you know keep your head up keep working harder make a better oil product you know it comes with time you know everything comes with time so yeah 2020 future vape I don't know man cop it if you're a beginner don't copy if you have a high tolerance because this is definitely not gonna get you super high and yeah man I'm just gonna go ahead and end this video because I don't even know what else to say guys so if you guys enjoyed the video like I said go leave a like comment subscribe and we'll catch you in the next video guys", "oovH1YDaw40": "welcome back welcome back welcome back to our [ __ ] hey [Music] hmm all right child welcome back to another

pharmacists welcome to part 2 of our cannabis series in this video we're going to be talking about those very important chemicals that are found within cannabis more specifically the ones that are produced and stored within the trichomes of the plant now if you don't know what trichomes are be sure to watch the first video in this series the fascinating thing about cannabis is that there are over 500 different chemicals that can be isolated and these can be subdivided into two categories you've got your non cannabinoids and you've got your cannabinoids so let's start with our non cannabinoids and we're going to be talking about two of them specifically the first one are terpenes terpenes are responsible for the smell and the aroma of the cannabis plant over 100 different types of terpenes have been detected and that's why there's so many different strains with so many distinctive flavors such as berry or citrus or pine and these flavors can produce effects for users that's why you'll commonly see things like flavor wheels such as this that license producers or other cannabis companies have produced and what they show are the terpenes and the effects that are associated with it so you can compare this to aromatherapy for example since that's something you might be familiar with such as eucalyptus or lavender and just like how lavender may produce relaxing effects for a user so too can these different terpenes that are found within the cannabis plant next we move on to flavonoids now just like terpenes flavonoids are not unique to the cannabis plant hence why they're called non cannabinoids and you'll find these in many different types of flowers or foods that we eat and they all lead to this pigmentation that we see in the cannabis plant and other things such as the blue and blueberry or the red in raspberries so think of it like that most of these non cannabinoids work synergistically with the other chemicals found within the plant and that's probably something that I'll repeat throughout this video this is known as the entourage effect and I'll get to what that is towards the end of the video after we discuss all of the compounds so now let's move on to the cannabinoids while there are over 120 different types of cannabinoids there are two in particular that are found in a higher concentration that are thought to be are thought to provide the physiologic effect that's attributed to cannabis the first is THC this is the plant's primary psychoactive component which may cause a euphoric mental state or sedation in a dose-dependent manner for the user the effects produced vary and of course it also depends on the user itself but this includes relaxation pain relief increased appetite paranoia or anxiety and that's just to name a few now let's talk about CBD this chemical is not a psycho activist THC and in fact it's thought to oppose the experience produced by this chemical when added together and so it actually can decrease that high effect however research does suggest that CBD may have analgesic anti-inflammatory anti-epileptics and even NZ oolitic properties so something to be mindful of as we think about medicinal cannabis use in the future now that we've gone over these two categories cannabinoids and non cannabinoids take a moment to think about how cannabis is typically used so it's you may have seen it smoked vaporized even baked and what do these all have in common heat heat is important because raw cannabis plant typically contains in active compounds so for example it contains tcha which needs to be converted into TCA and the way it's done is through time and also heat speeds up that process so what he does is it D carboxylates that chemical into the active component producing this chemical that produces the effects that we just mentioned and that's something important just to keep in mind because there are different ways to use cannabis and most of the ones that you may come across involves the application of heat so it's just good to know why and remember it's all about decarboxylation so that's a quick overview of the chemicals found within the cannabis plant thanks for watching I hope you stay tuned to our next video in this series and see you next time thanks pharmacist buh-bye [Applause]", "euilUBKXBiU": "[Music] here with some pizza here yeah bruh I'm here with the quality cannabis is Dominic I got a sweet delicious package from true terpenes sent me this [ __ ] delicious Christmas package let's see what's in here yeah it weighs about a gram this whole bag

YouTube page and on this one as you can tell by the title of it we're gonna be reviewing a vacant cartridge is going on over all the pros and cons and a baton cards really kind of just aware I was gonna do with this video but I also wanted it to be like an entertainment video so I'm gonna have some dabs in here like I always like to know where you smoking from what you smoke like I said well I scrape this up let me know where you're smoking from what you're smoking how good [ __ ] are you getting hide it you know pass the time of the quarantine time that we're in norms [Music] [Music] step water you're probably meeting this shirt in district are the it's actually shirt I got you living illegal stay you know a lot of times there are 420 in different parts of the year they do little giveaways you know events and whatnot and I end up actually winning on the shirt from the forum unfortunately this this shop is actually closed but I got these years and years ago lately also I've been dealing with a bit of like skin allergy and allergies and whatnot so I've been wearing a lot long-sleeve trying to try to stay cool because like at times like this when I get really warm or a lot of times I'll start to break out in hives you can't really see them now but I actually had like a pretty bad or bad break out though it is what it is you know it's part of make the best of it let me know also like I said what kind of a cartridges what kind of Spanish you guys are smokin on cuz I just wanna pros and cons of love that abate cartridge for THC oil cartridge well what major Pro is obviously gonna be how discreet that they are you're not gonna have to worry about you know your parents know and your teachers smelling them if you're coming into school after you tomorrow anybody that's the main probe or what are the main pros of them you can blend in with like regular people you can hit it like a cigarette or you know like on the nicotine pens and that will look just like a regular change the oil cartridge that's a regular you know vape pen won't look like a team also how quick you can get high with them I mean I can hit this a couple times gonna be super big a lot quicker and I could if I was hitting or even smoking like a blunt or a joint or whatnot you know it's just a lot quicker method of consuming your medicine and getting their medicine so and on my opinion as a Gabbard it's on par with dabs and on par with you know any other concentrate that it's a quick method of getting your medicine and quick consumption like that it's definitely beautiful that that regard let me go to the cons of a baby pen no one con I'll say is that there's the electronic or man-made factor to it and let me explain that sometimes bees get clogged sometimes these you know they don't come perfectly exactly the same amount of concentrated distillate within the cartridge sometimes they come and they might have weeks you know I've had them this more not I think a little bit had a little bit of a leak within here sometimes the magnet might have problems in his own the part of what I'm saying is there's a slight factor then what you're gonna have might not work and I buy some weed I grow up in a joint and I put them on the fire too but it's gonna burn every time it was either a it's wet or like there's something and some a some super shitty weed or you know there's gonna be a real man I really like the reason that I've probably seen before mowing it up why does not gonna burn like there's something I've never had an issue like concentrates the same thing you know I put the damn on the email if it's at the right temperature is gonna hit right just took a damn it's always gonna be like that consistency that's the one main law that I would say but he rubbing your shopping medically on the street or whatever these cartridges themselves failure rate you know we have minor flaws it's not all the time I mean most of the flaws aren't super bad and a lot of the shops if you shop at a dispensary will let you trade it back in and most of it still there you know get your money's worth so you can get an exchange it for one that works but it's still that great evening might be out or you might be out of town when that fails and you might not have time to grab we're going back to his friends for that day so yeah I definitely say that that's one of the biggest cons over another car my dad raised will no bake carts aren't 100% I'm part of the dad they can get you hot don't write their bake but it's not a dam in terms of how it's not with the pen together you're not going to lose it like that but when you take these off or if you you know sometimes we're not having different flavors I'd be swapping them in and out if you have like just a tad bit of clutter I mean you don't got to be that messy you literally lose these things behind like a damn Rubik's Cube or something like you doesn't have to be you know it controlling or something really small so you can lose though a lot easier than I say you could lose like a [Music] I'm pretty sure people have your you're more likely to lose this than about to me that's the point of Maine with there are a little bit harder I'll say that but not too harsh but they taste foul or they don't hits me they're just gonna be it's gonna have a concentrate hit on your lung and that smoke Norris likes fans will concentrate so you're gonna cause like me when I hit them I don't coughing and I'm not trying to say it like a big girl practically I'm just used to it like that's a rap song and what my rap your favorite cheeky saying yeah that little I got that long the veteran loads you know I got a tolerance to it so I can hit it talking me perfectly funny she's not doing that bad compared to what I normally smoke but thicker clouds like you saw with that first down that's not really that dense of smoke I'm gonna get into for you guys I think I'm gonna make a good little thumbnail showing

introduce luke that's luke he is the ceo of owls and me i'm steve and we're here today to talk about fake carts when i was discussing this with you and just like fillers and anything to do with like you know make fake and you were but you you had a pretty good uh question to me you're like what do you mean what's a fake what's a fake card like a card like a cart that doesn't have anything in it you know what i use hot dog water yeah hot dog water so i mean that's a good question right so what exactly is fake so i suppose i'm i i suppose what i'm doing is i'm putting together fake bootlegged whatever because you said bootlegged is more like hey we're pretending that this is like an hour's product are we getting black ops yet i know we won't get knocked off that's that's something that's the beauty of ours because of this because of these labels here it's actually impossible no one can knock our stuff off and also it just takes too much work it's too much work like everyone they have to order everything they have to it's not something they can just do overnight at all and they have the etching on the carps and it's just like but what kind of business model is it to say i'm going to go into the fake cart business you know there's lower overhead because you don't have to pay for product you just send fake cards so well yeah i mean there's definitely money in it well i've been hearing already about fake cards for a few of the different brands and uh it's going to contain something well it does right so but i think okay so first things first what exactly is a fake card or a bootleg card so basically that is a cartridge that is not actually made by the the manufacturer right so it rather than it being like hey our carts cost this price because we've got all these employees staff marketing all the work that we put in for years this is what it is someone comes in and goes well damn i can order this packaging from china and i can do this other stuff here and i can just basically piggyback on these guys without putting in half to work and i can give a subpar product and uh i know i know the difference and so i can collect all the money now how do you spot a fake well first things first is always look to the test results uh test results is always first a telltale sign uh are the test results uh when you scan the qr code does it have the company name does it or does it have a different company's name does it have uh how many tests does that have as well if you see something like a 99 it's just [ __ ] i mean it's just they don't i it might not be fake but it's it's [ __ ] uh wait let's stop here we've already done a video on this i don't want to get into it again uh but basically there's no real 99 cards out there because you would have to you always put in terps stardudas it's not possible but anyway um so typically you you the colors are off the colors are off um the oil is off i mean you can look at a cartridge and they'll have a similar looking cartridge but what will happen is is that uh you know you'll see the oil inside and the bubble will move and if the bubble's moving it's typically being cut right again save cost say put a little bit of mct oil in there that used to be the thing in the day that people would when i get when we started with carts i mean pg and vg vegetable glycerin and propylene glycol were standard they were standard and i mean now even on the nicotine side i know that people uh still regularly use propane glycol with nicotine or vegetable glycerin or peg400 and uh i just want everyone to know that we actually had a customer that asked us like hey what exactly is this in the cartridge right they didn't it's so distal distal is in the cartridge and terpenes that's it we've never any fillers there's no no other crap in there another thing you'll see with the fake hearts too was i remember the whole scandal with all the vapes and everyone's getting sick because everyone was cutting their stuff with vitamin e acetate and vitamin e was basically looked the same your oil would be hard so the bubble didn't move and then people were just vaping junk and that's the other thing that's scary is like if you buy a product that you don't know uh where it came from or for instance somebody calls up a store they say hey i'm with owls they're going to send you some for free you want to place an order and then they end up getting subpar products there's no regulation around it right because it's fake and so you don't know what you're getting in there and especially it's not like you're buying a fake bag right you're buying something that you're going to ingest and put in your body so the last thing you want to do is to buy a product that is is not from a reputable distributor or wholesaler so i think the advice would really be to only buy from like us either direct from the store or make sure that your brands either have some way to tell you how to differentiate yours from others that's why it is to make sure you buy your product from your store yes i know it's also to wait lives it's also to where to live people who i know yes and no i mean that's not really the main thing the main thing is they want all the money i i i think it would actually be better if er taking away from the vape that you could actually just order cards directly from the the provider and know that they're legit i mean i don't really know how you tell if you go into a store and someone has like a product unless they said and i'm not trying to to their own horn here but unless it's owls you know exactly what it is there's literally no one else that even has any sort of tracking information on their products there's no way to differentiate any of them so i don't really know what other people do i mean yeah i don't i don't really know but uh there's definitely a bunch of fakes going out there and it's just important to always stay safe and that's why i like i like the amount of work that we put into our products this is the reason i'm here if you look we remember when i was working with the testing lab that's why i met you you kept doing all this testing i said this dude's legit he's legit he does more testing than anybody i know on his products well thank you thank you steve i'm impressed and that's and naturally and i think you look at the ingredients right because it comes from the start to finish right it's like like if you have good ingredients it means you have a good product made you care but that doesn't really correlate back to fake products at all so it was i went a little off there but overall i think look the most important thing here is this is that there is a bunch of fake products out there i'll tell you this delta nine on the delta nine side there's just like oh my goodness like if you have any of your friends and i know the people you at home you have you know people trying to sell a cookie's car all that stuff is absolutely a joke any black market stuff any carts black market i mean no testing it's junk i would not believe a thing i would not touch a black market card i mean if you could get a delta eight card why would you ever buy a black market brand again really i like i i i don't really know why you would take the risk when you could just buy it uh a delta a cars in general but um that's really all i gotta say on on our carts on on fake carts in general uh just be careful out there there's so many shysters and uh make sure that you either reach out to your provider and ask them always ask for owls or yeah just save yourself a hassle just ask for owls instead and just know you're no you're good and look for the testing look for the testing scan the qr code be safe everyone adios and what is a fake card i think it's good it's not fake it's not fake it's a guitar branding oh it's no brand it's a bootleg it's a bootleg and then i suppose fake", "JWdBjlArqto": "I don't really have a title for the show but maybe yo what up everybody welcome to The Daily damn i guess do they dabble the daily but i only tell you guys about a week where they dabble the daily Bailey never weak yo what up everybody here go daily never

wax interstate 710 I was hitting the watermelon all throw out there and today on the way back I ran out so I had I had this smuggled up my keister this is the terps sauce terp sauce cartridge and I

mind that I was in Mexico oh SI la neta que este SI sabe couch original so yeah thanks again to 710 interstate hook me over the hat the oatmeal with my [ __ ] dope a shirt or let me zoom out I don't

dabs next week I'm gonna do some dad's later on but I just didn't do any for this video I don't got time", "CcqVbopKY2c": "you know I do ladies and gents we are back with another review you already know it's been a couple days since my last review I just wanted to say real quick that that's because I've had a lot of stuff going on at school some really important tests and stuff I usually have really important tests all throughout the year but this this specific course in my school kicking my ass it's really difficult but we're good through it we just finished today so I'm treating myself I'm treating you guys we got a new video it's about to be smack right before we jump into this video let's go ahead and throw it out there this channel is a adult smoking cannabis channel only it's for 18 to 21 and up depending on your state and how legal medical or recreational marijuana is I'm here in Arizona I have my own medical card everything I do on this channel is legal yeah so now that that's out of the way I guess we can get right into this so I'm completely sober right now I smoked a little bit this morning awesome an old cart that I had actually was a venom acts I was supposed to do a video for that but I just like I said school was just training me I was stressed I just couldn't do it but I the two cars that I showed in the last the strange Saturday which we're still debating if we want to do Sunday or not but the let's train Saturday I said I had two carts those were venom X's I think they were tangi I don't remember pineapple tangi or something like that I got i don't remember the strain but i threw out the boxes but they were supposed to be two different ones now it's going to review them and have two two videos two completely separate videos but since they were the same it would have been useless and only one video and like I said I just was stressed as [ __ ] so I just skipped out of it and didn't do a video but we are we're here with another video and I got to cut two videos coming up here so this one and then another one the cards were reviewing on these two videos are gonna be pure earth no I don't remember exactly I could be wrong but the first pure earth cart I did actually was one of them I beated viewed videos I think in their first or second which is actually insane so if this video can be even like 1/4 or 1/2 of that that would be dopes mad appreciation so the cart we're gonna review today though is the pure earth DJ short right there I don't know if you can see that there you go um uncut VAP cartridge is a half gram I won't lie to you guys these are probably my favorite boxes I've seen out of any descent cart they're just so [ __ ] elegant I don't know it's just it's super dope um I don't know if y'all are into video games or anything like that but there's this game called destiny - there's this raid at the boss by Calvin our model remember that narrates called but this [ __ ] color scheme anyway flashbacks if you play that game but yeah this box is clean and and just like the other one they're the same box got a little pull tab there I'm pure earth it you know somehow some rep saying this or whatever [ __ ] yeah you guys killed this box gorgeous box so on the back here says in infused with authentic cannabis terpenes no PG propylene glycol propylene glycol PG I don't know what that is or MCT I don't know what that is a proprietary pure atropine and cannabinoid profiles so that's what that says right there on the back right there then there's their website and then all their other information blah blah says requires pure earth battery for use this product has been tested for potency wow that's cool so that says that on the back right there and then read above that it says right here this little like black dark black line so the extremely potent cartridge use small draws until comfortable with the effects so that's super dope I'm excited this isn't my first pure earth like I said I do not remember at all what that one was what the strain was how it hit anything like that so if you guys want to know before you see this video go ahead and check it out you know check out my channel you know life subscribe do all that [ __ ] if you haven't of course but well let's go ahead and open this [ __ ] up I think you just pull okay there's a sticker right here the best thing to use lightning cables for if you have an iPhone is for cutting a little like [ __ ] piece of corners like that [ __ ] yeah cool boom and then not a tape no that's done boom she just slides on out there and it oh no I thought it locked um so it didn't fall out but it doesn't uh box [ __ ] hollow box it's a very sturdy box so that she you know you could take this [ __ ] and eat it and not really have to worry too much about breaking the cart which is which is really nice that's uh that's a good feature to have on carts let's do a little hydration break here guys drinking another pees tea Georgia Peach you already know yall already know so here's the Box simple box right there on the front it even says it says the this is an indica dominant so I didn't even say that this isn't in a kendama net strain it's like 8020 ad indica xx sativa but you know basically indica just oh that's nice so this is a little really soft foam packaging so it's gonna be even harder to break your carts in here if you drop or throw them in your backpack or whatever you got to do that was loud I apologize for that um yeah so here's the cart so this is pure earth there on the front super dope and then here on the back yeah well cuz I'm a terrible youtuber and everything like that it says the strain which is oh I drew that [ __ ] it says the strain which is DG a short and then it says that it is an eighty indica 20 sativa so it shows you like the breakdown which is super cool it's going to pop this cap off alright there we go there's the bottom authentic see so [ __ ] you know you already know here we got the dr. zodiacs Moonrock battery here I really want to get another one of those cards just to have the battery to be honest but those cards did smack as well we just charged this one up you already know how I am when it comes to hits on the cards I think a fully charged battery is always gonna hit hella harder that just makes a [ __ ] ton of sense to if you'll think about it I mean you know but if you guys like to you know use your batteries all day that's fine I do - I did - I burned through them then I charged them for the [ __ ] video so cuz I want to show you guys the potency I had its finest so let's do one more quick hydration break here without out of what what did I just say and with that out of the way let's go ahead and take our first draw up this DJ short nice it was cheesy shortcake doesn't say it's on the bus it says DJ short but anyway guys Cheers hopefully you guys are smokin medicating along with me let me know if you are now in the comments I'm always interested to see what you guys are smoking on guys well tooth Wow Wow that tastes man i that tastes exactly like like a strawberry shortcake that's that's part guys that is that is delicious man awesome let me show you the wax here kind of got a little piece of paper here so you can kind of see a contrast there super dope so that was I just realized like that was me probably shelling off the goddamn lakhs for like 30 seconds and I'm gonna tell you why because I'm already feeling this [ __ ] hard I was facing now I just face that [ __ ] showing you guys what I actually hydrate afraid but oh I hope you guys can't hear that noise I was watching Bohemian Rhapsody outside a little bit of a Bond movie if you guys haven't seen that Mia shut the door boo boo that door shut look at that Pro youtubers - the yellow shouldn't have heard that but you got it anyway nice um back to the part I'm a big fan of this part already I'm a big fan of all my cars to be honest but this one's flavor wise right on there probably not eight out of ten nine out of ten easily potency just not one hit man that's a it's like a four I'm already gonna for pretty good so [ __ ] let me just kind of regain my breath here like nothing like hitting anything all day so I'm a little Oh what are you doing eating yeah but just gotta get a couple hydration breaks video and you'll be chillin just fine so god I feel like I have to Kaufman try get it out there we go ladies and gentlemen we are gonna do number two guys truth yeah if you guys if you guys are a big fan of like strawberries or like short like case like Strawberry Shortcake's anything relative to strawberry this is your cart um I don't think I've ever really had any any cart or anything like that hmm that was like cherry pie or no like cherry cream or whatever they short um but for the first one that I've ever had like that pardon me it's hurting me deep but for the first one I've ever had nobilis I should like a shortcake or strawberry anything definitely definitely solid it's highly

clean your equipment in between uses it tends to gum up and it works like [ __ ] so please God don't do what I do and [ __ ] clean your goddamn equipment just clean your equipment not hard now I've lost a lot of people that's amazing I did that I did that live about three weeks ago yeah I do that I smoked the wedding cake I smoked the wedding cake cartridge in one sitting with my wife we sat down and we smoked it back and forth with a nitro collector using a dab cap it was uh it was brilliant it was absolutely brilliant okay now that this tip is clean I will be utilizing the built-in syringe that is used in these who filled these cartridges with it okay first things first I do have a custom cartridge stand um but I also have a couple different methods this is about the easiest one that I've come up with if you happen to find one of these laying around it's for 9-millimeter casings all right four nine millimeter but everybody nine millimeter this is what they come in these goddamn things they just they stand up and they're just [ __ ] so perfect they just fit right in there and they just stand up so [ __ ] good they don't [ __ ] fall out or nothing they don't [ __ ] fall out [ __ ] perfect [ __ ] yeah fell out thing cause I dropped with some of this but yeah you press them in there it's the [ __ ] works very very good very good okay now a tip like this and a syringe hover glass one can be found at Bay Park mark which is where I get all my bait supplies from and they are in the link in the description below bay parts marcom as well if you would like to improve the quality of the show or help contribute in any way check out the link down there for the patreon of double tears feel free to check them out no obligation but there are some wonderful prizes available as well that being said the first thing you do whenever you've got a cartridge you're trying to fill you unscrew the lid unscrew the lid a monster lid on each of these because I got 2 grams to fill so uh that's what I'm gonna be filling this is the distillate that we're gonna be using this one is the strawberry lemon-aid what I'm doing is I'm scoring up the top of this one because this one's the strawberry lemon-aid so when I open this one the mango and I mix them up because I'm [ __ ] stoned I'll know which one is which is there a better way of course there's a better way I just chewed on the [ __ ] thing yeah I could have got a marker and written on it if I wasn't a [ __ ] idiot but hashtag not a [ __ ] idiot you know what do you do this one as you can see this one is undamaged now I can mix them up readily and be like okay I know which is which always stinking always thinking now the mango flavored works out for total cannabinoids of 87 with a total THC of 73 the strawberry lemonade works off with the total cannabinoids of 87.9 a simple point to increase which is minimal and does not affect anything in my opinion with an actual THC total of seventy seven point three the seventy-three point two and the seventy seven point three that's about four percent that that can affect a little bit but when you're dealing with numbers this large if you're smoking hip and you're smoking weed that's got four percent THC there is a difference there but if you're smoking seventy three percent THC and seventy seven percent THC well you're smoking THC so they said as you can see these are come in and syringe with a threaded section there specifically to put a tip on it whenever it is nice and warm however if you can see there's a bubble in there and it's all graduated but I'm gonna do this is the chewed-up one this one has a bubble in there can you see that bubble in there it's on the bottom all right I'm gonna set this one up right here so you guys can watch and see if the bubble does rise up in that one which it won't it's it's pretty high-quality distally I rocket ition grot rocket ushion that's hard to say Joe are you doing my friend nice to see you how's it going thank you for joining my channel my friend what I do here is I spread a little bit of knowledge concerning the lovely world of cannabis and cannabis extracts right now what we're doing is I'm refilling I am filling two new cartridges these cartridges can be bought at bay parts marcom in the bottom with some distillate some THC distillate as you can see that bubble hasn't [ __ ] moved yet that I picked up for grand total I do is 12 and a half dollars give or take 10 or 15 cents twelve and a half dollars give or take ten or fifteen cents for the gram of distillate these are 77 percent THC and seventy-three percent THC we're really putting them into a cartridge we're gonna do the mango on the right and the strawberry are on the left I know this is cross corner of you guys but whatever like I said these are relatively thick and uh it needs to be heated up a little bit just to be able to flow you know not an overly a substantial amount but definitely a little bit definitely a little bit I have a heater over here that I'm using and one of the first things I do because I'm weird and I don't know if this really helps but this is the way I do it like my shirt oh gee cush Platinum boy I ran shadow what's up everybody boos Magoo man how you doing again again again all right so here it is I remove the little plastic cap that just screws on the screws off whoop take that off that is a plug that doesn't actually excrete anything you want to get rid of that [ __ ] this is completely useless much like tints on a rock you don't need any any tits on a rock and this isn't very good what you're gonna want to do is you're gonna want to utilize the tip that's using doing that why don't I do that just yet one of you first first and foremost I actually draw some air into the cartridge directly from in front of the heater this is some superficial [ __ ] at best but in my dumbass mind I think if I draw a warm air into it it will heat it up faster because you're a [ __ ] idiot we're total check out me I don't know so first thing I do is I draw some air into it and then I set it in front of that heater and just let it rotate I let it rotate right where my fingers are so that cylinder gets no harder than my fingertips now my fingertips can take a decent amount of heat but nowhere near what it would take to in any way compromise the plastic or the oil in that in that syringe so I'm not worried about burning it any more than I'm worried about actually burning my hands you know I'm saying my fingertips are pretty tough from smoking roaches and all that but when it comes down to it I'm not gonna let myself get burnt just holding this so that's how I basically keep it from getting overly warm possibly compromising there's the syringe in any way so this is actually pretty warm right here right now it's starting to flow I just see it's starting to flow down from the top just a little bit on the side there see you leveling out okay yeah now see you're starting to flow a little bit see that's that's how I do it as a heater some people will use a lighter or a torch or whatever the [ __ ] and that works out if your syringe is glass basically kind of use whatever the [ __ ] you want if your syringe is glass this this syringe is not glass for glass refilling syringes of high quality with the tip available a tip like this that will work in almost any cartridge they are available at the link in the description bate part smart comm that is vape part smart comm feel free to go check them out if you do use the link in the description I will get a little stipend of that and it is grateful for the channel to get that it's very grateful to you what the [ __ ] ever it's all he misses all words okay as you can see now this stuff is flowing a little bit kind of like like a little bit better you know what I'm saying oh yeah nice and warm that's what I do right before I do those refilling videos whenever you see me snap and come into picture I just brought it in from the heater so it's working it's working perfect so I I attached this tip to it just like this it goes in does a quarter turn boom it's on there it's on there I like to laid it down like this and then push some air out just so that it's in the top okay right there you've got your grab you've got your [ __ ] system right here you put your system into your system right like that and then you begin to dispense it and since it is warm it should have been so you come out pretty decent alright okay there we go that is topped off pull your cirrage out and you have a little area right there you see that where the oil needs to still get down in there but as you can see it is slowly moving in that area so it will flow right into there this cartridge itself is a little bit cool compared to the oil that I just pushed into it so as of right now that bubble isn't going to move I'm gonna have to heat it back up a little bit and all that good stuff but that's that's neither here nor there that's the way that one is so you can just touch this with a little bit of the tip there and you can see it's straight out like that the distillate is it's very thick [ __ ] it's like marshmallow [ __ ] fluff now simply take your lid place it right over that and screw it down once you've got it caught a little bit pull it out of your cartridge holder and there you have it there you see it has flowed a little bit down very little left as it goes into that area um this will be heated up and we'll give it about give it about a half an hour get it all nice and warm I'll use the heater again whenever I do it but this is just an example get it all nice and warm again and uh give it about a half an hour some people say five minutes some people say ten minutes some people are idiots so uh I'm gonna give it like I said thirty minutes before I even try to hit that day hit that bad thing so my wife came out and took the pin that I was choosing to smoke with um so what that comes down to is I'm gonna do another big dab here since I don't have my pin now those of you who've been watching from the beginning here's that bubble um if you're looking at the graduations you can see that bubble has moved approximately 2/10 of a mil in in the 20 minutes that we've been talking so we'll set that down right there and we'll keep that little experiment going okay now what I need to remember is that this cartridge right here is the mango first card I filled up is the mango will set it off to this side since it's on the right and this one's on the left we'll do that now I have this box sitting here viola I don't remember who I was speaking with on one of my lives but they said something about Humboldt County and I said uh Humboldt County hell yeah and I looked at this thinking that this possibly came from the Humboldt County area and for the life of me I think that it does but I'm not so sure now because the little exclamation point with the cannabis thing doesn't have a CA on it you know what I'm saying that doesn't have a CA on it now this says that this was done by rose any labs the testing lab is Rose City labs all testing data on those dates this was picked up when I went down to California and I think it was picked up in Northern California this stuff is absolutely amazing absolutely amazing one of the nicest concentrates I have ever smoked and I have smoked a fair amount of [ __ ] dope I'm just saying okay and this these guys right here I don't know if every single batch is as good as this but this [ __ ] live resin banana split this was on point like a point on the point you know what I'm saying like crazy crazy nice I'm gonna leave that right there just because they deserve a little bit of attention for what they're putting out that being said I'm gonna read a little bit I guess I don't know if that's what they call liquid marijuana or now but this is straight-up butane extracted hash oil that I'm smoking on right here and the liquid marijuana or the distillate that I've got right here is an oil and what that's done is they use a short path distillate by the way if you would like to expand your knowledge on the entire process about cannabis and the extraction process feel free to Google short path cannabis distillation it's very easy hit the Google microphone repeat the words short path cannabis distillation and they will show you a couple videos and a couple articles concerning the short path distillation process what it is is you take your extract which is generally any kind of cannabis extracted anything basically put it into a [ __ ] thing heat it up it eventually vaporizes it all be prized at different temperatures as it vaporizes it goes through a condensation tube and then it goes through some [ __ ] and then it just eventually um condenses into a bulb different temperatures you release different Turf and different molecules of the cannabis plant some people have five seven or three different chambers some go up one chamber and what you do is you just let it off gas until you hit your optimal temperature put the tube in collect it as it condenses in you will get your heavies which is the THC crystalline and depending on your process depending on how good you are at it depends on the purity of it it is it is what it is it's very intriguing it's very invigorating whenever you watch it and you think about it you're like holy [ __ ] really and that's basically how lots of things are condensed in a distillation process it's very very very very nice I'll do a video on it eventually when I have a little bit more hands-on knowledge I love the theory of it and I can explain the theory of it but when it all comes down to it without any actual hands-on knowledge like well what happens when you do this I [ __ ] really don't feel comfortable talking to you about a whole lot about it because I don't feel informed enough about it myself that makes sense fuckin'-a man all right here we go we're doing another dab on the damage right here this is some a in cream you know I don't even like saying that I don't like saying that at all [Music] so this is some crumble that we got from Black Diamond extracts they do decent job nine dollars and ten cents is what paid for this out the door nine dollars and ten cents out the door after taxes and discounts I'm pretty happy with it it's about a 70 percent THC wax they call it a crumple this one here is a wax cheers folks that's pretty good there is a little bit of harshness about it I mean you know it is a nine dollar crown you know not normally this is on sale but still need to understand that some companies do better work than others some companies have higher standards than others that's what it comes down to and some companies do a better job than others you're like hey man how can you get a decent concentrate for $9 a great deal how well there's a couple ways there's a couple ways sorry about that as you can see that bubble is almost 3/4 of the way up it has been about 35 minutes but that's the limits in there for 20 minutes I'm not gonna bow too much it but uh there you I'm pretty happy with the distillate though um yeah I actually don't like blunts at all let's have tobacco in them and I used to smoke cigarettes and now I can't I can't have any [ __ ] tobacco at all it's [ __ ] it's pretty lame it just it really it tastes bad to me and I'm not one of those guys that's like oh you smoke cigarettes well you should suck a dick no man you're a smoke cigarette smoke cigarettes I mean it's not like you don't know what's gonna kill you [ __ ] everybody's been telling [ __ ] everybody for [ __ ] decades and it's gonna [ __ ] kill you but everybody [ __ ] knows that's gonna kill you they did those commercials with the Marlboro Man and all that [ __ ] everybody knows I'm not [ __ ] I don't give a [ __ ] it's gonna kill you it's gonna key it's getting cait's gonna kill you my grandmother smoked for like 60 [ __ ] years she's lived to be 93 goddamn years old and she didn't die from cancer okay I'm just saying I'm not anti smoking I don't smoke I don't like I don't like how heavy it makes my chest I'm up I'm a pissy [ __ ] sorry coughing so art that's one of it that's a $9 gram okay see you got a little bit more [ __ ] on your chest you know you got a little bit more heavies in the in the hit it's not as pure it's not as it's not as nice that's why you pay three or four dollars more for your gram and then the upgrade just a little bit that's just that's that's what I'm saying folks just just that you know gingersnaps I'm having a decent day indeed indeed indeed I haven't had a good day in a long time I got four kids no I'm just kidding no never great day having a great day do a little bit of a live here I normally don't do anything on Sunday you know so I figured I'd pop on here got a friend of mine over and they wanted some distillate cartridges they're like man I really don't like paying the amount of money that they want for some distillate garbages I says you know what I got some cartridges here they're decent you know run over here we'll go down we'll go down by some really nice distillate at a decent price and uh I'll throw it into some cartridges for you I mean you're gonna have some decent babe cartridges at a decent price you know well it works out pretty good and it does you know even even if you were forced to buy these you know even if you were forced to buy these cars are just you know you go down you buy ten or something [ __ ] them you know you can generally get a decent cartridge a good I recommend going with good see sells you can use them two or three times and that cuts the price by a third but you get a good see sell cartridges if you only want one or two they can be about five bucks and that's that is what it is you know you get what you're paying for you can save money and buy cheaper cartridges if you want to save money by cheaper cartridges you could have a failure or they could not draw as well or I don't anything anyway you pick these up for about three or four bucks apiece right then you pick up this grandma distillate you know I got this gram discipline like I said I got it for $12 $12.50 you ever taste somewhere in there so you add that to the $3.00 you pay for this 15 bucks for a full one gram cartridge out the door you know whereas normally if I were to go down to buy a cartridge a decent cartridge even a cartridge from the guys that make this oil they still want eighteen to twenty dollars for a cartridge so you're paying six eight bucks just for that cartridge generally if you buy it in that manner then I just I don't need to do that I don't recommend doing that if you can get around doing that then do it as you can see now this is the same Boyle where that bubble didn't move at all I've been holding in front of the heater and as you didn't see that bubbles moving just fine now I'm gonna heat it up a little bit more and then I'll settle down and then I'll push all the air out then I'll load up this other cartridge and I'll let you guys get back to your day I do appreciate you guys joining in thank you so much it really means a lot to me and uh why I said if this helps you out or if you give a [ __ ] at all go ahead give a like on that thumbs up button down there and if you'd like to help contribute to the channel feel free to click the patreon link in the description and go check out some of my tears see if any of those rewards work for you I would appreciate it helps me out all right that being said we're drawing a little bit and then push out a little bit all right there we go once again we stick it all the way in to the bottom start to dispense the oil all right now do what there's a little bit all right so that being said and done so this is on the left this is the strawberry lemon-aid right here and this one on the right is the mango as you can see there's still a little bit of an air bubble right in there on that mango because I still haven't warmed up this cartridge it means II wind up let it sit in there whenever you've got some real good distillate you always want to do that whenever you see me doing my videos a lot of people like dude your videos three seconds long you take pure distillate you open it up you put in a cartridge then you start hitting it in [ __ ] thirty seconds dude there's a lot of cutting and pasting that happens there [ __ ] and my dumb ass standing in front of a heater for a minute while the [ __ ] cameras going going [ __ ] wildest goddamn [ __ ] feel better cuz I didn't heat it up enough that's why cuz I didn't heat it up okay um so yeah you don't see that all the time but all right at the base of each one of these mouthpieces there's a little silicone o-ring right there I'll make sure that squeezes out just enough to be completely flush with the outside so it's absolutely perfect um this right here with a little bit of an air bubble in it is the mangle and this one here is not as their differences but the mango is a little tiny bit lighter maybe a little bit tiny bit lighter maybe but that being said the mangos on the outside strawberry lemonade's one inch from the outside it's for my own benefit here you have it Oh Phillip a couple cartridges with a little bit discipline Oh hope you guys might be able to get a little bit of use out of that you know um I know it's not not everybody's gig but it's exactly what I do and uh it's how I make [ __ ] roll a lot easier and a lot smoother for me now I have got all of this done for approximately twenty-five dollars to one gram cartridges full of seventy seven percent THC distillate where the bubble don't [ __ ] move at all at all at all for a total of $25 $25 so you know for me this is the ideal way to do it okay you get a hundred bucks together you go down you buy [ __ ] what 9 grams of distillate you know if you've got a good C cell cartridge you pay five bucks down right now and you can use that three times you can fill that [ __ ] up three different times I can do it I try to do them never more than four but I never tell people more than three they've got a very good failure rating and that failure rating doubles or triples every time you reuse that but it's so low it doesn't even get to 1% by the time you're using it four times that's that's that's math anyway um maybe some reading real quick Daniels dude [ __ ] I'm a stretch to spit out some fold eyes I'm gonna [ __ ] just kidding I'm gonna do it dad's then we need the [ __ ] out of Dodge don't you worry about it we'll try to each phone in line what's the difference receiving Ewing oil and that stuff well here we go the difference between CBD oil and this stuff is to be exact this is oil if you look at these little numbers on the back the actual CBD that this has is 0.4% CBD all of these have a completely different THC v CBL CBC CBD CBN all these are different properties and molecules and components components of the cannabis plant each one of these components of the cannabis plant activates or utilize the different neuron or part of your brain to do [ __ ] you understand what I'm saying some of these are for nausea some of them are for making your [ __ ] pucker some more forget you [ __ ] high someone for me to get high longer okay that's just a scientific and I can get into that if you want to but that's a completely different video the main difference between lists in CBD oil I can buy this exact same package with a different flavor from a different plan that is 70% CBD in almost zero THD that's the difference they come from different plants therefore they extract a different material and that way this is a strike THC that they would attract CBD and that's the way that works very very baseline is that better you guys could have told me to [ __ ] turn that heater off and any [ __ ] kind and I don't listen to you fool it's just like right here anyway [ __ ] it's quiet now let's do a DAB somebody out there is running chainsaw leaves goddamn Christmas time one month while the [ __ ] eejits all right so here we go we're dabbing on some alien cream I still don't like the name of that right hey you should with some an alien cream in your [ __ ] rig right Wow really really that doesn't sound good at all I don't I don't know I don't like that but it doesn't sound enjoyable dude all are tasting an alien cream no no I have not I have not you can there's no videos or pictures I swear no alien cream for me all right so here we go we're into a bit of a Dingle donger dab here we're gonna say right well I appreciate that by the way come people ask why the [ __ ] should we give you anything on patreon mainly people that I know that don't watch my videos like [ __ ] enum to give you [ __ ] anything so I was like well you know what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to make my livestream you better I'm trying to get platform I'm trying to increase the microphone and increase the camera strength so that you can get a better start of what I'm doing here I would love to get a little bit higher quality video camera I'd love to get a desktop for the garage a desktop computer that I could run some the webcam and thing I could use an alternate alternate payment system other than YouTube super chat which they took for me because I'm so bad to in that situation and we can become more interactive we can interact more in an interactive way I think you go boo boo whenever I get a comment root loop and you know you could do that hey I'm gonna make my comment look like my wife's comment because uh I like her so thank you so much effort I appreciate it greatly man but uh go ahead and check it out this is really nice

going on guys this is weeding aloud we are here to talk about some new types of pens from Liberty Health Sciences these are Liberty Health Sciences they have them listed as you know all in one kind of like disposable they're disposable pens I don't know if they say all in one there but that's basically they're like you know complete with the battery no no right off of the bat I noticed that these have a window unlike the ones that you get generally have like a like a wick or something you know and these have an actual cartridge kind of coil built right into them so to me these are kind of like a in-between a/c cell and just a regular vaporizer like standard like like the you know like the met and the Pina Colada and stuff that I did the other day from the slim vape lime from purely I think these are probably like a step up from that type because you know because of the window and you can see the liquid oil in there and which is its thick oil and that way you can kind of tell to manipulate it you know in like make sure you got it upright so the oil settles down and you don't have any problems with it blink and dry when when the oil is like on the wrong side of the pen that is an issue with these and that can happen and four of about ten percent the pens that have bought ten percent of them were faulty and you know broke so and did that specifically like showed started blinking like it was dry and there was so quite a bit of oil left in here all right all that being said and I cut too low on my beard just right that being said let's test out the indica it comes in indica hybrid and sativa and I think there is a method like most of them are 70 to 80 percent of this 176 and the indica is 80 percent with point 2 milligrams of CBD I don't know if you can see all zoo [ __ ] own just gotta take my word for it I'm using their own camera today oh that's another thing one's green and ones blue I notice that I bet the other ones yellow because that's kind of like their company colors like the green the blue and the yellow like I'll mix together right there blue Liberty again this is me inhaling I'm inhaling everything right if I didn't a nail how can I tell you whether it's good or not oh good stuff Oh what because that [ __ ] like kind of kid hey you keep [ __ ] around man you're gonna watch me kill a fly lamb over burning wings off oh my god this font seriously what's it done land on something I got like a whole can of soda over there maybe you're not old but like yesterday's complaint oh man oh oh [ __ ] you see that's what I was talking about about like I hold one little bit of breath in like that in my mouth so I can taste it before I inhale the rest when I am inhale and ever hit that's the one little part that I don't know nail welcome taste it in that yeah this is cool super good super strong I'm liking these way better than then just like the Slim's these these seem to be much like just like much more oil in them and and and I got to tell you that they are much more expensive than the slim bait pens the slim bait pens you know usually lasts me about a day and they're $18 I don't know how long these will last but these cost me I think they're either 38 or 40 dollars pretty sure they're 40 dollars there might be a $35 one and a $40 one and that is because there's a 70% one and a 80% when I believe but uh this is the hybrid and that that's printed right on them that's the good thing hi so you can't mix them up a lot of them there's no labeling like that so they're real easy to mix up also the color coding oh yeah strong choking me up like a dab every time I take a really big hit I feel Oh mmm this hybrid one is very very dank very very bud ish there's no flavor in no added flavor and it tastes all natural like bud flavor I like that the Terrapins come out really good in these yeah excuse me oh yeah I'm gonna wait I think I got my full ten inches after the huntin trip to New York next week I donate my head to the wigs for kids maybe I'll do a haircut video where I go to the barber and have them put each one of these in a little ponytail and cut it off real short like a hitch it's from the Scout yeah I'm pretty sure I got the ten inches all the way around what do you think that's like [ __ ] three feet but we'll see autumn measure with tape measure and make sure before I cut it it's be the second time since my son had cancer that I've donated my hair to some other kid that was having a harder time of it and needs a wig I think it's important while I still have enough hair to be able to grow a wig for a child and I don't use a crazy hair care products like bleach and air duct you know because that's the kind that they need an all-natural I might be thinning but I can still grow a wig for a kid for sure this is a pretty good a pretty good ponytail for some little girl or a little boy or whatever they make with it on them oh I'm just doing my part much as I can alright damn guys these are so good I got to give it to him Liberty Health Sciences coming up with another slightly different but a very effective take on the disposable battery thing you know you know I like these I'm gonna have to wait you know a couple days a week a month to be able to give you like a real like full honest opinion opinion since I just got him today you know I'm just really know getting into him I don't know how long they're gonna last or whatever but if these last three to four days I will consider them a bargain so you know I figure about ten dollars a day is what I usually spend them like the flower and everything else we're averaging out and these were $40 so if it lasts for days you know then it lasted as long as it should have if it lasts less than four days and I will probably not continue to buy them but I'll let you know in the comments you know when they do run out and you know update this accordingly it's so far so good I'm loving these things they obviously have way more oil than this

mmm big Rick it's me back to another review today I got 19:37 do you see it well it's called Snoop Dogg og indica there it is it's got like this writing writing [ __ ] inside of it basically the history of weed I guess blah blah blah I got it already this one looks like it's Snoop Dog og cush 1937 now look how full it is I like that 1937 I got full this and you know I've taken a couple of

try [Applause] yeah this is this is delicious man this is this is pretty good about the same price cost me like cost me 60 bucks good grab at it get it", "lZ-vfMIuGco": "[Music] welcome to truebuds tv it's your buddy jack talking distillate vapes versus live resin vapes what's going on here what's the difference i've had tons of requests so i'm happy to be fulfilling those requests let's see what we got in the uh little handy dandy true buds pack let's open it up well that's for another video i'm going to be opening up this top shelf pre-roll see what we got inside keep an eye out for that video i have the uh live resin from jetty here the unrefined let's go ahead and open this up we got the little satchel in here tastes so good so live resin upon harvest is instantly frozen this is the way that they're going to get the most terpenes in there the full flower flavor that everybody loves live resin is usually extracted with butane and purged in a vacuum oven i'm not going to go too far into the process let me know if you want to see more videos on the actual process now live resin usually on the scale shows it's a little less potent and a lot of people go shopping i want the highest potency i want this and that that's why distillate cartridges are so popular and that's why i'm making this video to kind of educate people because distillate is the bottom of the barrel if you will it's the leftovers the trim the shake because everything is going to be burnt off essentially it's like making booze it's like making a moonshine or ever clear you're going to put all this [ __ ] in and then you're going to be left with the most potent stuff possible basically tasteless odorless colorless and then this is when the companies add in the terpenes if you're lucky sometimes they're delicious sometimes they're not but a lot of times you can taste the artificialness and that's why i think especially after having this live resin i got a live resin from my uh packs the other day from jetty too i think this is the go to from now on i'm tired of these distillate carts when i hit them they taste fake i'm [ __ ] like sneezing that's another video i've been with people when they're smoking vapes i sneeze all the time after hitting this distillate cart like what kind of terpenes have you put in there is it some [ __ ] random flower that i happen to be allergic to like that is the beauty of the live resin is you are getting the live flower if you will the closest resemblance in a nice form that's right there price point price point this graham cartridge is pretty damn expensive i'm not gonna lie i was a little hesitant it was like 62. i got it from ease i'll put a comment down below if you want to order through there for your first time get 20 off but that's expensive sometimes i have people commenting like dude that's some serious dough you're dropping on some carts and [ __ ] but it's convenient it's legal gives me peace of mind i really don't mind actually you know shoveling that money forward people buy the stuff through ease it all kind of comes back but what i'm saying here is i think this has helped transform me i've had other live resin vapes and i've thought the same thing but i'll still buy distillate ones but i'm sitting there i feel like sometimes these like even the circles one like i'll take [ __ ] like 10 15 [ __ ] poles off it and it feels like just now i had like what four of these like this is better so i guess you got to decide where you want to put your money quantity over quality i'll just compare it to like schwag versus fire ass nog you know what i'm saying i would say this is that good nug and the distillery cartridges are the swag so yeah like that we got the unrefined live resin and then we have a distillate like this was like 15 bucks and you can tell so that's my two cents i wanted to break down the difference for you between the live resin and the distillate vapes like i said the tons of people were asking like yo bro like what's the difference man and i'm like i'm gonna make a video so here it is thank you for hanging out i'm gonna go enjoy this and if you're liking this pack or you want to grab any of the other true buzz merch you know i'll be truly grateful and i got some really cool stuff just dropped the free smoke edition the stone bald eagle i got a whole video coming about that because it represents a lot to me i put a lot of thought in it and i want to thank the artists on that video too so keep an eye out grab some true buds merch if you're feeling this video show some love to me i'll keep making videos showing love to you you know what i'm saying thank you and i'll catch you on the next video here on true buds tv yeah this is true buzz that mary j now we ain't new to this for my stoners and for my cannabis enthusiasts talking edibles ain't bringing comedy let's get it time to pass it to the left and we can have a smoke session yeah true love for my true buzz light it up and i'm on it this vibe take me way back screaming i got five on it in the cut of sativa anything that you need break it down like the weed this is true buzz tv buzz i'm a stoner i'm a smoker it's a hobby it's a lifestyle and a culture yeah this is yeah this is", "KFQfFMzT_wM": "there is a broad range of cannabis strains in between indica and sativa these strains are known as hybrids and show traits directly related to the genetics in its lineage the most popular of the hybrid strains in los angeles include Koecher dog OG 27.1 THC gorilla glue member for 27.1 THC cookie batter 25.1 THC and Thin Mints by Lorax labs 23.1 THC hybrid simply means the parents were of two different strains most cannabis seeds sold today are hybrid strains so how do we make our hybrid cannabis plant for the plants to multiply first they need to pollinate with each other meaning you need to have a male and female plant choose from your two favorite strains you need to have one male from your first favorite plant and a female with your second favorite plant the disadvantages are that hybrid strains often do not breathe true and results of a cross may be any number of different types phenotypes of plants from the same parents it is for this reason that the seeds from the best plants resulting from a mixed breeding are often then grown out and bred to each other to produce a more stable string that will breathe truer over several generations", "E14mf9wddmE": "I'm dr. Matthew Roman here at nature's way medicine in Philadelphia Pennsylvania and I wanted to tell you guys a little bit about what I think about indicas and sativas I think the difference between indicas and sativas is completely overblown I've never seen anybody give someone either an indica or sativa not tell them what it is and say tell me if this is an indica or is this a sativa in my opinion if you tell somebody hey this is going to get you real stoned because it's an indica they're gonna get real stone and most of the time that's because indicas are stronger you have more teeth seeing them the primary ingredient and the only ingredient in my opinion that gets people medicated if you give somebody a sativa and say hey this is the strongest sativa out there to make it giggly and it'll be a head high people are gonna think that is actually happening and that's not necessarily because it's all placebo even though it actually I take that back it basically is all placebo well not the medical part of it but the high changes depending on what you expect it to feel like that's what it is there's certainly placebo everywhere especially when it comes to CBD products that's all placebo but even with THC the high changes depending on what you think it's gonna feel like and I've never seen a Pepsi challenge with indica versus sativa I'd love to see somebody out there perform that exam or that that study just simply take the people who think that they're the best that knowing about marijuana don't tell them whether they're smoking an indica sativa and let's see if they can even guess that simple that's simple you know 50% option you know or if they can if they can decide which ones which I highly doubt anybody can I don't think I can and I'd love to see people try so maybe in the future we'll be doing that and we'll see if anybody can actually even tell the difference if they're tested on it and not told beforehand of what they are that's it for me I'm dr.

Michael Morgenstern with dr. MTV bringing you vital health information you won't hear anywhere else so if you're new here consider subscribing if you search the internet for the difference between cannabis indica and Cannabis sativa you'll find a lot of fiction without much fact let's take a quick look around the internet these individuals were asked the question and did their best to explain the differences between indica and sativa but only one answer is right can you tell who has the right answer some consumers prefer to use sativas during the daytime and indicas at night cannabis indica is tend to be more relaxing and have full-body effects cannabis sativa is tend to be uplifting cerebral and good for creativity are usually they helped you relax you most people will use them at night as a sleep aid or and sativas generally will give you more energy let you keep more focus so more people will use sativas during the day because you can still function being up being Downers isn't always the case when a strain is categorized into indica or sativa it's more talking about the morphology of the plant which is just like the appearance and not so much the hi effect that's right the widely accepted terms cannabis sativa and cannabis indica refer to two different species of plants the stems from the opinion of an 18th century botanist jean-baptiste Lamarck who coined the term indica because he felt that the plant's characteristics warranted a new name the cannabis sativa plant grows up to 24 feet high and has a narrow branched leaf the cannabis indica plant grows around the height of a human and has a broad branched leaf but Lamarck has been criticized by many contemporary botanists for naming a new species when a species is actually a group of living organisms such as plants capable of exchanging genes or interbreeding the classic example of a species is humans or Homo sapiens we have unique genes and DNA and we can only breed with other humans but all types of cannabis such as sativa or indica can interbreed which is probably why some taxonomist say Lamarck made his decision with relatively little study that's a pretty big insult coming from the scientific community in defense of Lamarque he didn't have the advanced genetic technology to make his decision to put things in context when the mark lived people believe that you could inherit traits from your mother's previous partners why should we care what the strains are called mostly because it's led to a good amount of confusion some say indica and sativa have distinctive effects which is completely is often described as being uplifting and energetic indica is relaxing and calming if only life were that simple there are definitely different chemo types or types of cannabis plants that have different effects on the human body in general any marijuana plant can be THC predominant CBD predominant or mixture of THC and CBD this leads to many effects it's also possible to have effects from the other ingredients in the plant ingredients like terpenes and flavonoids sativa or indica is really just something that refers to the way the plant looks but looks can be deceiving no matter how it looks a sativa or indica plant could be bred to have the same amount of THC CBD and other ingredients so technically a sativa or indica could have identical effects when consumed the only way to actually know what's going to happen from any strain is by identifying the underlying ingredients of a particular plant or strain or observing the actual effects and real people let's look at some commonly reported misinformation about the differences between sativa and indica sativa is described as being uplifting and energetic something that can or should be consumed during the daytime but brands being marketed as sativa tend to have higher levels of THC the psychologically intoxicating ingredient in marijuana it's not exactly a great idea to be using that during the daytime when most people need to be focused on work driving or doing tasks that require sustained attention indica on the other hand is marketed as relaxing and calming because of its high CBD content something that should be used at night to help with sleep but the reality is that CBD and commonly used doses is actually stimulating the sedation which is falsely attributed to these strains is usually the result of mersin a monoterpene in fact many of the observed effects that have been falsely attributed to high THC sativa strains or high CBD indica strains are actually related to the underlying content of terpenes flavonoids which aren't usually even known or tested for in a particular product what should you do if you go to a dispensary and see everything is categorized as sativa or indica got the sativas over here at this set and they're a really good headstone really uplifting kind of high make you want to go to the park run through and look at flowers and then over here it's the indicus which are the kind of like the body stone kind like wheel chair weed how can you predict what kind of effect a particular strain will have on you there's a few things you can do the first is try to find out what are the underlying ingredients in a particular product they might label the THC and CBD percent the contents are the dose and milligrams on a product they might also list this information for other cannabinoids or terpenes or other ingredients that are in that plant secondly you can ask what kind of effect has been reported by individuals who have used a particular product the third thing is trial and error you can try a particular strain and observe the type of effect the product has on you to summarize there's no real difference between cannabis sativa and cannabis indica the names only have to do with a way a particular plant looks rather than the effects it will have the only way to know the effects is by testing for the underlying ingredients in a plant such as the THC and CBD amounts or by observing the strains of fact on people who use it question of the day have you tried sativa and indica brands were they labeled for their underlying THC CBD cannabinoid or other ingredients what kind of effects did you experience let me know in the comment section below remember some of the best ideas come from the community so make sure to connect with everyone in the

story make sure you subscribe to the big meat official youtube channel and don't forget to hit that notification bell now let's get started on wednesday january 22nd the marijuana regulatory agency or MRA for the state of michigan recalled nearly 10,000 THC cartridges that tested positive for vitamin e acetate which is the ingredient found to cause lung illnesses lucky Valley the recalled products come from a Detroit based company called Plan B walnuts I guess they better think about moving to Plan C right the products were from the brand savage it includes several different strains those effective would have bought cartridges between October 3rd and November 16 2019 and on January 16 2020 of the recalled 9380 cartridges an estimated one thousand three hundred and sixty were sold with the remaining eight thousand to be destroyed by Plan B wellness in a press release the MRA stated patients or caregivers who have these affected medical marijuana products in their possession should return them to plan B wellness for proper disposal it was also made clear that plan B wellness was to contact those who purchase the affected product and notify them of the recall back in November the Emery stopped the sale of all cannabis vaping products on the market to test for vitamin D acetate although many products passes testing over 60,000 cartridges failed with the savage brand included as well much of this recalls being blamed on Michigan's rush to begin selling cannabis products after legalizing recreational use late last year some producers were operating without a license and allowed to continue their sales due to a court order sources say the MRA allowed dispensaries to transfer untested cannabis products into the legal market so long as customers sign waivers acknowledging they understood the risk on the flip side a cannabis testing facility based in Colorado suggests that vitamin E can form naturally in cannabis at levels that do not present a risk this may be why testing showed positive for the ingredient but at the moment it's unknown whether or not vitamin E acetate was added in after the fact on one hand I'm glad to see testing is actually being enforced but on the other I'm disappointed to know that potentially dangerous products may have made their way to the legal market let me know your thoughts on the story in the comments below and

you can see you can't see I'll read it off to you so 84% cannabis THC 70% and CBD 1.7% I gotta say I really like this Karthik - it's pretty it's pretty fruity first of all when I opened it was kind of a panda but to open well then that's a good thing cuz child-safety and you don't want to keep giving em your stash but anyway the cart says the strain right on top right on it which I've never seen before the oil the whales pretty much what you'd expect out of some good cheese I mean I've seen worse and I've seen clearer ones but to be honest with you those clear carts they put chemicals in that to make it clear so that's why I don't really trust those I'm not gonna name them but you guys know there's chemicals in that [ __ ] anyway and then they turn brown anyways but um this one hits like a channel it does get the engravings it's got the Rose engraving anyway so I'm gonna slap it on this vision spinner by the way I still vision spinners if you guys wanna get at me these are awesome

guess if you need something to smoke on but and if you want quality bro Rove it up tell me the first time I tried it oh so [ __ ] satisfied I've said all kinds of her and I'm pretty sure something more fake because they're so inconsistent like that's the thing about cartridges then you got to find one that's consistent because nowadays people from duplicate [ __ ] you can order the packaging

people been smoking a shitty weed for a long time problem is shitty weed is just shitty weed even whenever you get something you can tell if it's not weed because it's not weed when you get something

syringe from fly higher two heads total cannabinoids are right there 80.8% alright this is where it came from this was tested um manufactured a best by date the quality analysis parent right there you see that [ __ ] QA parent right there alright quantitative analysis you understand what that is this is all pesticide free this is all done with highly purified distillate and it hasn't added terpenes to it this is a verified product made from a very good company do you understand now you take this product right here you put it into these cartridges from Jupiter they use exclusively C cell cartridges they are one of the only suppliers of C cell cartridges in the United States C cell cartridges high quality oil you put the two together that's what you should be vaping on all right if not then you need to buy cartridges that have verified provenance no provenance is provenance is a verified source where you get it from now your buddy Jimmy he might talk some [ __ ] about where he gets it from you never really know all right it's good to have a receipt it's good to a verified store in a legal state if you can if not go with somebody you know don't just buy random [ __ ] off the

there's that's all there is to it there's no ifs ands or buts about it it's it's already in there and it's already doing whatever it's gonna do so you got to be careful whatever you're vaping on [ __

that's what the loh stands for irrelevant says for legends of Nigeria this is some heavy-duty [ __ ] right here but this has full testing turf THC CBD cbda see th see a [ __ ] right there what's that

qualified done out the door good stuff right there alright so here we go we got legs oh my dear this is some gems and juice jims and Jews right there look at look at that sparkly charcoal he's Berkeley darkly you like that so um one of the things that people need to realize you need to do the research these kids that have been killed by these cartridges they're not getting killed by cartridges are they're sucking on a juice from China all right they're getting prefilled cartridges with toxic substances and they're just sucking on it nasty [ __ ] alright a lot of it's these kids that are getting this [ __ ] cuz they're not fully informed about the dangers of it um everybody people see me on here just smoking and token man we're doing some drugs well it's not all games all right I go down I buy [ __ ] verified [ __ ] I I get this [ __ ] from with somebody to test it I talked to the commies that produced this [ __ ] I know the background I know what happens behind the scenes I know that whenever I'm paying for this I'm paying for the product but I'm paying about 30% for the testing and all the quality control and quality assurance that goes into the production of this product that's what I'm only paying for dance track I'm not paying for that name just because it sounds cool and they got the cool shiny printing no I'm going with this product because I know the guys that provide product to these guys know what they're doing and these guys only test only except product from companies that test for pesticides [ __ ] like that this says right on it I threw the box but uh says right on the bottom there no pesticides no additives this is fully tested this [ __ ] here they tested full-bore alright they don't even buy from companies that use pesticides alright they do very extensive testing and that's one of the things that you need to understand when you're buying a cartridge you're not just buying the oil that's in there like this is the bomb well you're buying the company that made that oil and if it isn't a company there's just some Joe Schmoe and Joe Schmo is trying to make more money companies are trying to make money too but they've got a business plan they're looking for repeat customers where old Jimmy Joe if he's skipping from town to town to town everybody he sells the car to could die he's never coming back he's going and selling cards somewhere else so don't matter alright this these guys what their job is it's just like coca-cola and Budweiser when you go in there what's up rainbow veins now you doing me when you go in and you buy a coca-cola you're not like oh well this coke ain't too bad it's okay now when you're going to buy a coke you want the same [ __ ] coke you bought last week last month last year your letter wish so you go to when you buy a coke and you crack it and taste it it tastes the [ __ ] same that's what coke is that's what standardization is that's what the marijuana industry is trying to get to when you crack the Budweiser and you taste it it tastes like a Budweiser because it's a Budweiser whenever I taste abstract legend of Nigeria I want the same effect same taste that I tasted last time I tried abstract legends of Nigeria and that's what you get whenever you get quality and uh and I really appreciate that and that's one of the things that you can count on whenever you get name-brand cartridges alright these cartridges are tested they're produced in their quality now I'm only gonna dab on this and um be here for about another three four minutes I'm gonna get out of here because I've got plans big big plans big plans to play about on Friday early 6:00 a.m. on my waking bake channel if you haven't seen the wake of bake channel go check that out well if you have an it thumbs I'm going in to thumbs up I would appreciate it let's blow some smoke here and tell you guys what we think about legends of Nigeria crossed with some sour blue here we go alright well there you go all right I don't know what I can say about that that hasn't already been said about sex and fast cars that's just a good time right there big fan of that big fan of that that's good stuff now one of the things you're gonna want to do whenever you're thinking about these vague cartridges and how babies dangerous and all that you'll want to do some research read the article read close in to the article read five or six different articles and make sure they're not all getting their sources from the allied press Associated Press whatever you get one guy one reporter for The Associated Press he writes a story he shares it with a million different people next thing you know they're all putting their own twist on the same exact story and you never actually know the truth all you know is what that one writer said because that's what the information he got shop around don't just shop with your news agency check other ones they're wrong you got something to talk about tell your friends about how that news agency never like is wrong whereas if they're right um hey you verified your story so that's kind of cool alright let's do this again tear people [Laughter] very good super super quality stuff here alright alright alright alright so what it comes down to is you guys need to understand that when they say cannabis cartridges are killing people they're talking [ __ ] okay something that is being sold by a lying bastard as a cannabis cartridge is killing people okay that's like saying when that bad lettuce was going out and e.coli in the lettuce was killing people that's like saying lettuce is killing people lettuce is it lettuce is dangerous lettuce is killing people lettuce is not killing people poorly cleaned produce is making people sick okay you need to understand that it's not the lettuce itself it's what people are doing to it okay if you bought you know that's exactly what you need to realize and they did the exact same thing they figured out where was coming from who was producing it and how I got there you need to do the exact same thing with these cartridges don't just black ball all babe cartridges um because you need to understand a lot of these people put time and effort their lives into these products and not all of them are horrible products all right not everybody's out there trying to screw somebody over and doesn't care about whether or not they get hurt a lot of these cartridges are being produced as medicine for people and the the the limits that they put on themselves to ensure that they produce a good quality product are pretty extensive so Joe Blow down the street selling uh black-market cartridges he may not give a [ __ ] but whenever you're getting a legal cartridge from a legal state from an actual verified company they mostly all do their homework and then there they're all they're all pretty safe I have not heard of a single problem some companies in the beginning they were trying to buy products and they were getting some pesticides through but they were gay got tested they got popped and they got pulled back these companies do test for those kind of things and uh and they are they are safe so that being said you guys have an absolutely wonderful day enjoy the rest of your Friday if you're going out fighting I'd be safe and I will see you bright and early Saturday morning for the Saturday morning wake and bake at 6:00 a.m. know th cartridge THC cartridges aren't killing people they're not at all some people are selling cartridges filled with bad [ __ ] and it's making people sick and that's that's that's the fact of the matter there's there's no real way to verify what's in it without having you tested and the best way to do that is by it already tested either from a verifying dispensary or a recreational store that being said you have an absolutely wonderful day thank you so much for tuning in I do appreciate it we will see you next time look forward to seeing you tomorrow peace", "_2sH0wxGnMk":

skittles on an Oklahoma baby you guys have a good day", "fISV3iGvtgk": "Oh david Ellefson to be fat anyway mm-hmm I try to keep my sting clear it all clean off and just keep continuing it junkie and junkie anyway miss December 7th and I appreciate anybody wishing me happy birthday this videos about topic is uh marijuana and fitness you don't know I used to UM on a marijuana shop over in LA and so whatever I learned even people have been smoking for thirty years four years 60 years they don't know the difference between the sativa indica and what is what marijuana is an indica and sativa and some of a hybrid some across some guy maybe 60% more indica and sativa and vice versa some got a little bit more sativa the Innoko so I'm and I'm going to do this see people just be speculate I'm not gonna speculate I can tell you different patients I had coming into my shop and with day and fitness people and bodybuilders so but there's this I can say this about maybe five the babies maybe a little bit more people that would you can finish go back if you I would if somebody chemist said they want something keep them up sativa is are more like up let me give you the proper definition of a sativa miss if I can find a proper definition of sativa near indica is more for pain so I sativa uplifting energetic see bro Spacey best suited for day use indica relaxing Carmen body boss car flock best suit for night use that is true so McGee exemple with most shops should have sativa Bluegreen in haze Innoko Skywalker oh geez some or maybe 70/30 indica usually put down the indica side okay so if you go on a gym and you you know you don't want you wanna drink the more coffee pop some pills gonna damage your kidneys you can medicate or take a sativa Blue Dream Sour Diesel super Lemon Haze or you can look it up there's a you see Triple A let me see what else here super Lemon Haze I used to grow that Lemon Haze sativa so anyway you can look it up and another thing is so Jack Harrow to meet Jack Cara that's like a stable so service but in because the only reason I would say that if you can't sleep at night but if you're trying to get ready for show you gotta be careful cuz indicas make you real hungry you know I remember the time we still shoes stuff I'd even like to eat hour so you gotta be real careful so anyway let me give you the example I'm not gonna say that guy's name you're coming to shop you always wanted a Blue Dream Blue Dream I couldn't keep Blue Dream some other stuff I like the name of like all of a sudden it's another stable sativa when I think of I tell you about it um so um blue team would go off the shelf he would get that medicated medicaid on it and into gym my thing was quite a few people they would do the same thing now there's like I said I know few people that day was og fitness and stoners dance whatever they can get they were smoking they were do we enter stronger indica and hit the gym and in those people had I top physiques that's the only thing at the time that I knew that they was doing that one particular I was doing something else but so that's the difference so if you go to a shop owner get marijuana and get the full effects of it you getting your from the fitness you need to get you need to get a sativa and I told you that you can look at Google when the sativas is and different different plants have up now I've got the stunt man you can do the research on there may I do a second video on that so the CBDs and the THC is on that that also determines the uplifting and also pain level yeah so anyway green crackers to tea green crackers with a weak sour DS is a team of six hour diesel it's very popular in the back east out here I think it was second under Blue Dream yeah there's a Hayes Hayes you leave us at Eva to but to me Hayes's don't taste it but some people like that tastes sour these blue drink tasting to me tastes the best right now if you don't know you can I would suggest you vape user vape it's more healthy to use a fake usually the doctor tell you to use a vein and you know it keeps smell down you don't like the smelling and clothes it's more like no we did you know so try to get you a fake you give a three worth fifty to a good one to one hundred fifty one thing I must tell you when you go to a shop sometimes people sometimes may be lying okay like the example that had a easy open they said Louise the indica we should we got low on product and it was like in between it was a person who said okay what you need you know what you need a medicine for or just say man said oh I just wanted you know just to feel relaxed then you might refer them to something that might be the same thing way over here so let's do you said we had Rama I'm thinking this is confirming story true is possible here at Ramallah which is in indica from my mistaken wonder purest right so we might seven doors down down a line change your name of it just to it we might call it Obama let's say you know that's what a lot of shops do so you got it but if you're a regular customer they're coming tell you what it is we looked all G cousin we tell them what it is but people don't care who we had too much of Ramallah I think which we did got a good price you know we're telling me getting mad at discount then we had our bunky bunk which the bunky bunk oh I think my Skywalker you know sometimes I not go to lay this in

you're looking at my stream which is a sativa crossword with a gorilla which is so this plant here what I showing you right now is a for the period plant I grew the period out of flower and I have to originally CP what you have to have originated even original indica when you're doing crossbred see you can cross bred and and get your different strength from then you mix your screen with different

you trust me you will understand it much more better than if you're doing it for somebody but right now I can I'm gonna say so yeah enjoy", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system

I've already made it's so dark because it's so deep and you can't tell that it's amber but it's looks black it's not and when you smear it it's not I'll show you as I pick well it's still gonna look dark see I can see the difference from here but I know yelling can I be able to see that at home you know what I talk like an idiot I've been talking like an idiot for four years now I don't learn how to not talk like an idiot anymore that's what it looks like seriously but it's so like beyond [ __ ] concentrated [Music] most of the wax will come out like dark dark dark dark all right cheers cheers Cheers I'm living in Delaware I forgot my carb cap but that's right hi Debbie welcome to Canada's time it's cannabis time what should I call this miss Lisa's cannabis time least miss Lisa's miss Lisa's hi times miss Lisa's miss Lisa's get you high on I don't know we'll figure out something right hey Lori how you doing Oh Lorraine I don't know if you called Lori but Lorraine hi Maureen okay so what we're gonna try and do here is I'm gonna make oil with this this is a product that is used for making it's actually for making wax into vapor oil but this oil is pretty thick so I'm gonna add some of this to loosen it up so that I can use it and like I said I do everything like this was the first time that I did debate for the babel and I usually just do the crumble I don't really care about the bait so I'm so glad that it came out good but I completely forgot that I was gonna put it in a smaller dish because otherwise it's pans out like this and of course I want this to look this way when I'm doing the crumble because you scrape it up and you put it in a dish this now is all kind of stuck to the side and especially with what was going on that was freaking out so he's shaking it back full check it right off make a joke well this may give me nuts so now that it did work out good thank God you know times I [ __ ] this [ __ ] you do not know how many times okay okay so what I'm gonna do is um okay so just so you know this is licks and you can go to its it's not I sell it but you could really just go to the website if it's something that you wanted like tonight the herb or herbal liquidiser I think it is calm I think that's what it is calm so I have to guess how much oil I have in here because I don't know I did not weigh the pan before I did this I dropped a couple of pieces of butter in there I see it I see it okay um I have this much which should be more than sufficient now I'm gonna be have to be very clever about this and figure out how to mix it it's going to be the thing more figure out how we're gonna mix this for a second I'm not sure if I should use hey Corinne I mean hey Connie how are you honey I'm doing cannabis tonight I know I should be doing jewelry but I'm miserable so I am leaning back on cannabis because that's a much more what I'm passionate about so that's what I'm doing right now is doing the cannabis hey Amanda how are you making cannabis oil here's what's going on tonight I'm gonna make this into vape juice okay pictures okay so I am going to take so much of this I'm gonna get I'm gonna start to put it in and I'm gonna guess I'm gonna put a little bit in I'm gonna push it around see what I can do I'm hoping to get it all into the corner and be able to put it into a different container or at least get it you know what get it all to the corner and then use a syringe to get it out of there that's my game plan okay hi Connie my lady love you I am so sorry I'm not doing the jewelry right now I promise I will do it I promise I I'm definitely going to do the jewelry once a week maybe Friday night I'm thinking maybe and then we'll have to see from there okay so you think like I love the name like like like slick look looks like some states like looks all right so I'm gonna start - no no honey is quit selling the jewelry I with the with the breakup it's just been too hard for me too I can't do the whole singing like you know I'm saying so I leaned back on the cannabis because I'm really really passionate about the cannabis and I'm educated and I know what I'm talking about and even though I'm doing some experiments it the jewelry made me feel I went on one night and I and I like almost had a panic attack and I was just you know what I can't do this I can't do this and nobody was in there my and Chris was in there I was like and Chris with you and she said yes and nobody else said anything and I was like I I'm shot Nick down this is too much for me so I do and I'm getting a bunch of jeweled new jewelry in so I'm not stopping that I'm just this this makes me feel like I'm you know like I'm not selling anything so I don't feel the pressure to be trying to sell to people you know I mean I am selling something if someone wanted to buy something that I was using I would buy I would sell it to them okay so I'm gonna start to try and get this to work out so I'm gonna just stop with a few drops in this corner and see what happens it should be on heat but I'm a little bit too afraid I wanna show you what I'm doing I know you can see what I'm doing there but they can't see because this one is too tall just too tall I could get it to lean no cuz then you only see my boobs and I know I got a good rack right now but who the [ __ ] wants the patient\u00eds those alrighty let me see if I can find something else no be a good thing a baby spoon baby spoon would be good I think I had one of those after freaking supporter baby yay for the baby spoon right right come on from [ __ ] vacation I get [ __ ] breaked up on right yeah [ __ ] stringing me along alright oh this is going to be is coming loose man but this really needs to be heated alright alright alright I was really hoping I would work out okay so to do is scrape it and I cuz I wanted to put it in too thick and then I was doing the video or cuz it when I'm doing the video I freaking lose my mind on what I'm actually doing thank you sweetie I wish I could snap my fingers they might be alright - right my brain was just so crazy so it's just so in love with him oh my gosh like if he came in here right now intense I'd turn that off and and and come into bed with me I would be there I would be that really I would be there I wouldn't even [ __ ] hesitate to be there but the [ __ ] that I [ __ ] have gone through but I he's not he's not gonna do it so I got a really like on that and get with it that he's not doing that that that's it's not happening so I have to move on I have to like why are you in the hospital don't [ __ ] up oh my god I'm like complaining about this [ __ ] what are you in the hospital for alright what I'm gonna have to do is I'm gonna have to scrape it okay I have no other way of doing it I'm gonna scrape it and you want to see something so fine and I'm gonna have to put it in this beaker little bit little beaker okay it's the size of my glasses just so you didn't I what's going on here aids this beaker it has leftover oil in there from last time but I don't give a [ __ ] I actually have a smaller one you want to see this this is so freakin awesome look at these little beakers aren't they so freakin cute I have one that's like a next size up so but I'm gonna use this one because it has a a better hole in there too for me to get this in here and I need a alright I just had a what did I do with my my house is such a [ __ ] disaster I can't wait to eat leaves all right let me see where the hell is my damn bird there it is there it is because I'm gonna have to use this in order y'all my nails look do these look pretty like do they look pretty on my hands I know that's a weird question but I just got this new design last this first time so I'm wondering if it actually because I'm feel like my fingers look to Porky for that what do you think you guys can't even really see the good color that it is because she looking gorgeous collar alright I have to scrape this [ __ ] alright I hate scraping oil well and you're gonna see how dark it gets oh wait let me give you guys a visual to make sure oh my god money I'm so sorry I'm gonna pray for you my pray for you sweetheart okay here's the color you can see that that's a yellow color okay so this is an old like it's actually my ex's it's old but it's it's clean and sanitary and it's only been used with oil and I use the razor until it dies if you have a problem with that I don't really give a [ __ ] but you see how it's yellow in there but look at how dark it gets when you pull it up off of the canvas the dogs are fighting on top of him while he's trying to sleep because they want to do something I wouldn't let the oil get in to this like this because I would have then pushed it towards the middle but you know what it's still gonna make really really good vapor oil that's all that matters right I just got to get it out now if worse comes to worse what I would do is let it just get some alcohol and I would then reclaim it and just fish it out which I may have to do a little bit in the end all right so see how much I have on there that's a lot I will see once I add the liquid how much I actually have I'm gonna pick this before it gets too far I can't wait till my bifocals my bifocal contacts get here so that I don't have to lip lift up my glasses and then I don't have to put glasses on when I have my contacts all right go in the little beeper beaker now find your way find your way come on [ __ ] find your weight all right I got a stop cursing y'all I don't know how I'm gonna do it though because it's really not necessary and my grandmother always told me that she was like when you're mad it's okay when you're mad but when you use it in your regular line which it just makes you look like a low-life but I'm also destroyed you know so but I do curse on like the regular so I was thinking well what am I gonna do like put a dollar in a jar for myself I don't freakin keep money on me I have some all my money is in the bank like I don't even know what but you know what I've done it before because I did a teacher I used to teach massage therapy so I have done that before in the whole no cursing and all of that so I know when I can do it and and when I can do it and when I'm really really upset or like super excited I will go nuts cursing no kidding okay I wish you guys could see this okay so there it is I'm gonna do something to hold you up so that you will be able to see we're almost there I have my cup trying to hold you up with yourself and it's not working oh I know what will work maybe there we go it's a cannabis and boob show it's the cannabis and boob show it's a cannabis and boom show hello alright I'm just want to be able to show you what's going on see on Facebook right now I had to push their their camera down so that they could see what was going on in my little dish here and you guys can see right there but they cannot so now they have cannabis and boots now they don't look this good when I don't have a bra on just I'm saying I had three kids but as I got a fatter they did fill out a bit I never had this big boobs but that's because I gained weight which ironically now that I started the cannabis full-time I'm losing weight I mean of course I'm going what I'm going through with him but it's not like I haven't eaten and I'm just healthier eating now because he's like I'm sick all righty let's see if we can get more out of this the more the merrier the more the merrier I hope nobody is conversating with me right now because I can't see your stuff because I'm trying to get this stuff out of here trying to get the oil okay I developed a conversation that was like we don't be saying Oh get the stuff in the stuff you guys know that everybody has that in that house all right Topanga with your person that's what you say and they know exactly what you're saying and you go get the stuff in the place I have to stop saying that because not everybody knows my stuff I think I did pretty good on this claim there is some that's Bilkis see a decent amount oh wait I didn't even go down this because this would not feel like this and I can't think that this sum over here it's not letting me get to it you saw all right look at it now you can you see how it's this brown in there but it's really really dark but once you spread it out it's it's a yellow looking looks more yellow there's my cup as my where is so okay maybe that's maybe that's our fence all righty here we go back to the oh you know what I got my 230 to see can you see the pink I treated myself to a manicure and a pedicure maybe give me the money for the tech that's definitely my kid coming in yeah I hear her all right so I'm gonna take this away hey Tony and I'm doing a live how are you good all right in order for me to do what I'm doing them and a half day you use the glasses for a moment and oh you know what let me look at what you guys had to say looks great okay thank you sir okay so what we're gonna use is this it's just a little heater that I plug into not the [ __ ] wall damn I need a charge oh you ROG charger is over by the watch could you when you're going to grab the watch could you grab me the piece that it's connected to so that I can plug this into the wall please cuz I'm a idiot but everything has this nowaday what the [ __ ] hello hello what the hell what the hell all right let me see okay it looks like I got four grams I'm some pretty good oil which means that I could turn it into four times three is 12 so 12 grams now this is 10 grams so I guess I would have the room but I really want to keep it pretty oily because of this new thank you very much this new the new atomizers that I said I got it alright let me plug this thing okay but you know the guy took care of me too so I'm grateful for that I'm you know grateful and he'll be taking care of me for the next year because that's my severance package okay so oh it's gonna be boob time okay so it's gonna go just like this and I'm gonna have to lean you guys again so that you can see it you'll have to move the comments to be able to see it but should I hunch down like this and talk to y'all I got look now you got even more boobage look at that I love boobs boobs are freaking great aren't they I don't know sometimes I don't want them no I don't even feel that feeling sometimes you know what the only reason I don't want boobs is because they're not perky and they don't stay up on their own so and I have to wear a bra although I haven't been wearing a bra well I've been teaching you anything this is the first thing and it's only because I went to the get my nails done okay so now this baby is plugged in let me turn it on there's my my light okay and it looks about 4 grams now I only think I'm gonna go 1 to 1 ratio on this because I like it thick I could make 12 but I don't want to I want to be able to have thick thick oil 8 grams that's plenty so let's do that hello Katherine how are you I'm making cannabis oil a vape cannabis fate Canada's fate yes miss Lisa's kind of best vape all right so I gotta put my glasses to side and you know now it's that it's settling it looks much more it almost looks like it's 5 grams but I would like to know for sure so I'm gonna let it heat up and yeah because that's like stuck on this side there well I guess it really doesn't matter right no because I want to do one to one ratio and if it's not on what it's on that is like just hitting and well what's melt there what there is to melt like see that it's like there's a hump there there's that hump so I need for that to be down and this thing isn't the warmest isn't like sometimes I used my coffee mug heater cuz just works faster and is it's not too bad but see I can leave my finger on there yeah that's definitely 5 grams 5 grams and that came from ok so that's 5 grams that's gonna turn into 10 grams a vape and that is was out of six grams of trim so trim means like a cannabis plant when it grows when you pick it there are these leaves that have called server leaves and that's not a part of the bud so those have to be cut off but they still contain the medicine so they can be used to make they can be used to to make the oils that they can be used to make the medicine so you can actually use the entire plant that way even the stalks and leave the rail leaves stalk parts the the branch has the medicine on it so all of that that's why I can put all that in the texture because all the medicine is on there okay as its melting out it's a definite definite five for sure five you know I'm wondering if I could just heat that bad boy up you know I hope I have oh I do I do and syringe made me a syringe and I prefer the smallest syringe but you know damn well I don't have it in here because I don't really prepare for [ __ ] I just do it but I bring what I think I'm gonna need and then I'm like oh [ __ ] I need this oh [ __ ] I need that as long as you notice things go somewhere else and get it this is a long stem let me just grab the other place where they are and see if I can't find me a better serve range I might have one I'll be right back a family that works for me okay so as its melting you know what once it gets warm enough I'll be able to suck it up and put it right in those cartridges I'm wondering if I should do that but if I put the additive in it it will last a bit longer and then I'll be able to put it in my big vape pen which is the ultimate goal plus the fact that the babe pen is about the pulps like three grams I'll be right back alright so I'm gonna show y'all how to how to how to load this - sorry about the boobs I'm really sorry I just want you to be able to see what's going on here and if you watching share me share me on your page on your page don't go and share me and other peoples pages cuz you don't know what they want and god forbid you know I don't know I really I I appreciate - I love talking to everybody of all ages about the situation but like I can't I gotta know that I'm doing a social media thing that could be viewed by children and that's why I come on in late later at night I don't need them stumbling upon it but I believe that when you have a sick child that information could be different could be more welcomed then that's definitely five grams I feel good that did really frickin good I hate tell you that is like freaking awesome okay that's freaking awesome that was seriously probably six there's only about 6 grams of trim and 5 grams of oil off of that which 5 grams of oil is almost like ounce of flour wheat flour if you just did buds that's pretty [ __ ] good that's about who's making it if you have the right person doing your plans correctly then you got so you know when you got something good you got something good all right 5 I gotta take my glasses off right now because I am gonna add some of this cuz you don't I I like this strawberry flavor out right and that's why I also put the water through it I'm just gonna add a little bit I'm gonna add alright so it's at 5 I thought I was only gonna be able to get to 8 so let's just do three and see what the consistency is you know I'm just gonna go seven just because I have this new piece you know what I have this new piece which I could are thicker so maybe I'll just leave it at the seven mix it put some in these and then add a little bit more so that I can put it in my big vape pen that's what I'm gonna do that's what that's that's that's my plan of my plan let's see how and the oil is already pretty warm oh it's still it's got a minute this is this heater is like this is you know like my first heater but so be honest the coffee a coffee mug heater does so much better it heats up quicker but you have to pay attention you have to you have to don't mess around with it like and this is pretty hot like I can't leave my henna finger on there now but don't take anything you're doing for granted when you're doing these stuff and um I have illness and I tell you I drop things and and things go all over the place and I don't know what the hell is happening and so when I'm doing something like this I tried to be extra extra careful so I drop crap everywhere I cannot believe I have been dumped seriously the light goes on right God has a plan for me I know I was planning for me is that is he sitting up there freaking laughing at me and I'm gonna when I get to have him I have to have work with him no I know he has a plan for him I know he does and don't be all upset that I talk weird about God because I talk to God on a first name basis I don't say oh dear God or our God or our Father I say hi God how you doing today I don't say that I say hi hey hi God I don't say dear anything because you're supposed to walk with God and not he's supposed to be one with him so you're supposed to walk with Him that's your goal his standards all his standards in the Bible his standards that he lives by and that's what he wants us to do so when we do that then we walk with Him and then you supposed to like talk to him like you know like a human being or at least that's what asides the Bible and I've read the Bible three times and I listen to different parts every single night for an hour and a half so if you're gonna go ahead and go head-to-head to me on the Bible don't it's a wrong move so I hope I think that no can't comments about the Bible but I can't tell you a verse and all that kind of stuff but I'm pretty well versed in the Bible and furthermore I also look at other things I don't just go to the Bible there you know the Dead Sea Scrolls there's Mary Magdalene's book and Thomas's book and Enochs book and so there's a lot of things that are left out of the Bible too that I have read that is astounding and that belongs in the Bible in them so sad that not all of the scriptures are in the Bible the scriptures that we have are miniscule in comparison to what should be there alright it seems like it's going good okay it seems like it's pretty ready to go so I'm gonna scoop it back up into the I'm gonna spit it up into the syringe and oh you know what I haven't even lost okay I get this one I have any may open this thing Oh oh I love you okay so it has a really simple I hope you all can see that it's very simple just unscrew and it's open you put it right on the side of the little circle there on the side of the circle and I'd say a lot of times they're confusing I hate to say it's just freaking terrible all right so I'm gonna scoop this up into muscle range I'm only gonna take a little bit because like I said I want to put the other in the beef and I it's so dark but like you see when it's not condensed it's not that dark alright so I put my pet my syringe into there and I'm just slowly releasing to make sure I'm not over releasing and that has plenty of room above that but I'm not gonna do it you just back on and it would be good if I had something to plug this into to like show you how to do it right okay you should wait a little bit before you go and do that actually to be honest you're supposed to wait until it soaks into the bottom of the atomizer but I showed you guys a piece last night so I know that there's a battery right there so I'm gonna go grab it okay so this is the kit that I showed last night with the glass top and the battery is of course interchangeable in my opinion 1100 mah is probably the best one to use for the cartridge okay if you're going to go and put it on like a big a big battery you're just gonna blow out your cartridge even though I like taking big drags and I want to put it on there so bad but so I'm gonna cook this a little bit more I'm gonna put a little bit more of the solution into here and then that will go into the other one but I got to make it looser okay so this one is much more thick I only put one and a half so that makes it super thick if it gets cold it's very very difficult to get the oil moving and you have to play with the battery and all that so a lot of batteries get wasted and cartridges get wasted because of this exact situation now if you if it gets if it's warm out during the summer anybody who smokes weed in the summer our cartridges are perfectly worked perfectly and then it becomes fall and winter and they don't and we get frustrated and we burn our batteries I don't I sell them so I know better I'm already on low power mode if it's my phone I was trying to charge it and I'm not getting my charger if it's done it's done when it's done light it turns off it turns off I don't like it alright so I am gonna heat this battery is on see I'm gonna hate it just so that not out here it usually hear something happening but I know all right so I'm gonna suck on see stuff I suck on it and see what happens see can't do that now that there's smoke coming up so that means that it just needed its 15 minutes that I didn't allow to do and I was just gonna heat it but I was hoping I'd be able to suck it all right we're getting there we are getting somewhere we are and this is where I get impatient I think everybody gets into a patient but I have the taste in my mouth and it has the strawberry taste of this here but I can also taste the water I'm doing a very I'm being so impatient all right I'm not gonna be any more impatient I know that works I'm gonna let it sink in there for a minute I'm gonna put the cause I think I have enough I think I see how many grams we have here oh all right I'm gonna fill another two of these this is how you take care of your medicine so I make these and [Music] I'm able to make so many at a time and then I know I always have my medicine I don't need to worry and I don't need to pay for it at its expensive freakin rate of ridiculousness just outright expensive like ridiculous expensive and seriously if I went to the dispenser area and just bought six grams I could make freakin three grams of concentrate which is much more powerful in the end when you just smoke the flower I make my weed stretch Express my eat I'm a couponer or I've been a couponer that I need to get back 82 especially now that I'm not gonna be together with by myself alright let's see maybe these were I'm thinking maybe these were only five point five gram because it is not that part is still full oh wow there we go night saundra have a good night sweetie thank you for hanging hanging I appreciate it I need the real where's Jeremy stay with me that's what I've been saying that's what I've been saying okay all right there we go another one down another one down I miss someone I know I had five there we go yeah it's--that's-- on and look it's a very beautiful amber you can't see it maybe you can right there like with the light but it is dipped down where you can actually see where it's trans you can I think you guys can see it I'm not so sure if you can see it you know what to be honest I don't know what other people get I have no freaking idea what other people get because I haven't ordered from anybody in a long long time although I have gotten stuff that was completely like clear which I just don't know how that works I don't have to know how to make that isolation happen it's on my agenda lists to figure out that situation so I'm gonna load this last one whatever's left in here I'm gonna throw it in here and then just add a bit more vape juice so I can put it in my big bait pen did not think I was gonna get this much okay the rest will go in here which really was not much at all oh my goodness okay so I got let's see here I got 4.5 ml c cell and I'm gonna check on this now it's getting there all right it is getting there I'm thinking maybe these might need it no it's hot it should be if I went out that's what I thought I had five and I'm like I didn't have my so now I have 5 of them 5 okay so now what I'm gonna do is because this one is going to go into my my vape pen that only tolerates regular vape product I am going to add underneath a gram and a half yes there we go okay where the hell is the cap for this oh man you know our human evil ways that I keep track of all my [ __ ] that's it right in front of me okay said [ __ ] like cursing the last so many minutes I don't know if I do alright so now I'm going to mix this stuff get this mixed and I am gonna have six grams which is perfect because I will have it's a it holds three grams like I'm pleased or it might be leaving a little bit more than that feels which is a good thing it's a good thing when the oil is hot all righty something's getting stuck in there anytime you syringe doesn't move the oil straight up the syringe that means there's something blocking it so stop what you doing before you blow the thing across the room cuz I've done that okay all right across from all right across around okay and there is my vape we'll see now if you see the color up here is the real color that it is even though it's dark like that you see now if it was a black are not good it would be black you wouldn't be able to see into the syringe in there so now what I wound up with was what's looked like around six five five okay so five grams I will find a cap oh my god there's a cap sitting right here there's we can get up here do you know that there is never a cap when I want it and now everything else is around the house but I found the cap how cool is that although I should put it right into my one I think I gotta clean it and there you go and you know I really kind of hate that I have to use a syringe because uh it's like a junkie like I'm always ordering syringes but they have blunt needles to be able to do this and so I could think I couldn't make it more like I'm a diabetic just think that way I don't know why you you know what cuz my I feel like everybody's always judged me for marijuana and judge me that I they thought that I was like dope head or something I don't know why cuz I'm not a dope head I wish I was doing pad I wish dope would get me that dope head because it doesn't I if I get to a if I get the where I do I get to a good place like my body feels like it's okay everything feels like it's going normal so I don't get that high feeling I just get feeling good I'm feeling good alrighty I don't want to burn them yeah let's get rid of that I don't let's try this freakin thing one time I hope you know I may have to put it just on I may have to put on bigger battery and if that's the situation I'm definitely only light you guys know about that hello Carla hello Colleen how are you I'm doing cannabis stuff I'm trying to get this to work ok like it's going it is going I always tell my daughter to do this and I say just pump it and pump it and pump it and when they first doesn't like keep on sucking on it and now I'm being just impatient as she is there we go works pretty beautiful needs probably going to need a little bit of a stronger battery maybe I'll be able to probably use it though on my stronger battery this is so awesome I'm so excited I made it it's the first time I'm making this young very very first time that I made really good oil and then got it into a pen like this like usually I have to buy the shatter or make the concentrate and then put a ton of it in and then do that like I would use the crumble that I'm that I put on that I make this is the very very first time that I made the oil that came out beautiful and then made one two three four five cartridges alright so I wound up in the end so I did do what I was gonna say wound up alright I don't think these are a grand though these are definitely half grams so let's say so two and a half grams plus five grams is seven and a half grams which is perfect it's perfect got from my other big vape pen that I liked it has a big big thing and then this one which is more now this one is going to this has more liquid in it so it's diluted more this one is much much less diluted and what that's what these atomizers are for I'm digging it yes yeah yes yes yes I am I love it alright so that's the deal that's what I did tonight any questions I don't see anybody in YouTube but I see there's a few people here I'm still got to do I have to do something to keep me busy so I am going to refresh myself on maybe a couple things you're here I know you're here calling and asking you I do definitely have to do the capsules I have to do those which is just like then me sitting here filling capsules although that could be interesting I guess right you all have to talk to me though cuz I don't freaking know what's gonna you know like you gotta make me entertained did you guys get to see the can of butter that I think finished from the other night I scraped that with a knife to be able to show you what it was like it's like regular butter so pretty and I was saying earlier that it doesn't it doesn't smell like Superbad cannabutter like cuz they can just be rancid like oh alright I want to get to the point where I'm like making food again for myself I'm not quite there yet I didn't eat today my store water fed me last night I didn't eat the night before no I didn't eat the night before and the night before that and I need the knife for that well then I'd feel that because this breakup has been going on for that many um so once I stopped cooking for myself again what I'm thinking is is I will show you how to add the cannabis to your regular dish or dishes what you're cooking you know like when you're going into a regular meal for yourself you can put a couple of doses into your marijuana I mean into your dinner and you wouldn't even know it's there you're getting your medicine and it's all good to go see there's a lot of different preferences on how to consume it like I have no problem like putting the tension in my mental before I go to bed my nighttime tincture is the bomb and so I have no problem absolutely no problem putting that in underneath my tongue but during the day I would much rather have an edible I would much rather have the canvas go through my system so that it does a thorough job on keeping my illness in check and next like super low battery YouTube YouTube YouTube alright listen up I have low battery some extremely sorry I gotta stop doing that but it's been any three minutes anyway as long as frickin videos man who the hell wants to watch all this [ __ ] Jesus Christ if you guys watch me for this long thank you holy crap but please share me please subscribe please maybe yeah you'll forget it's alright I forget all the time too any time that I'm working and like and I am i oh my gosh you I didn't so I can't freakin subscribe to that person I feel awful I can't freaking find them now alright YouTube

have a good weekend peeps", "X5Db35SMz8o": "hi welcome back with Megan at Reve dispensaries again today we're in our beautiful cultivation facility we're gonna be talking about what type of strains there are now most people know you have indica and sativa and that's what most people know but really the best way to look at it is you have a sliding scale with two polar ends you've got your indica which is your heavy body high generally associated with pain relief helping with anxiety sleep disorders and on your other polar end you have sativa which is most known for its cerebral effects for giving energy focus creativity also still can be a great anxiety reliever and then you have hybrids which can fall anywhere in between there it's the best way to look at it is here's your middle your perfect 50/50 and you have in dikko over here you have sativa over here and your string can be anywhere in between the great thing about genetics and being able to cross them is you're gonna have maybe a 70/30 mix maybe an 8020 mix there's really so much variety it's really easy now to be able to find a prescription that's gonna work perfectly for you another thing to consider too when you're deciding strain type is if it has high CBD or not CBD isn't a cannabinoid that people are talking about more because of its medicinal value typically you see higher amounts of CBD in your indica strains there's many well-known strains such as Harlequin ac/dc that are known for being specific CBD strains so when you're thinking about it think about it as a scale and think about what use you're going for and where you're gonna fall on that scale to get the best results thanks for paying attention", "DIUXMyPs6e4": "[Music] new results from a local marijuana testing lab paint an alarming picture of what people who vapor putting into their bodies team 10 investigative reporter Jennifer Kastner discovered that nearly 80 percent of the cannabis vape cartridges that were tested were deemed unfit for human consumption what you see is all made right here whether you want to eat your marijuana as chocolate or vape it as oil Platinum vape and San Diego's got you covered this is actual cartridges being filled tucked away in a quiet business park the manufacturing company produces high potency pesticide free cannabis products that go through rigorous testing co founder George Sadler is on a mission to spread awareness about the serious potential health risks of using products from unlicensed vape makers and sellers what can you say it's it's horrible it's doing so much harm to people versus walking into a licensed or so platinum vape teamed up with nearby licensed cannabis dispensary mankind to buy back cartridges that ranged from homemade concentrates to counterfeits of popular legal brands in exchange customers got discounted platinum vape cartridges that are tested and regulated we wanted to encourage them to replace something that could make them sick with something that was safe so if you see inside this window you can see the plasma those cartridges were then sent to local marijuana testing lab infinite Cal for potency pesticides in heavy metal testing the results were alarming the lab found that almost 80% of the cartridges were deemed unfit for human consumption more than 60% failed for pesticides that's what all of these are and this one over here is also another pesticide almost 40% field for lead so toxic levels have left yeah one of the big pens had almost a hundred times the legal limit and half of all the products had less than 50% THC in them some of the cartridges were even cut with excessive levels of vitamin E acetate the additive that may be linked to numerous vapor elated deaths and illnesses 20% of them a significant amount it's sad for me you know public safety is a really important part of what we do and what we believe in mankind says the only way to ensure that customers are getting safe products is if they buy them from licensed dispensaries like mankind that purchased products from distributors like platinum vape that are regulated by the California Bureau of cannabis control I think the exposure needs to be there for people to really understand what's happening and you can check out all of the marijuana dispensaries licensing statutes on the state's website we have a link to that on

Greene today I've got another strain review that we are gonna do exclusively here on the ice smoke channel this is ice cream cake it is a cross of the legendary gelato 33 and wedding cake let's talk about this strain in a bit more detail right here on the ice smoke channel we got to DANC growing farms finding this car got a history of finding amazing cuts of specific genetics also found that marmalade cut that people are raving about we got chem dank as well everyone that has made this strain review possible this is a strain which as I mentioned in the intro cross is two absolutely legendary cannabis strains in the game one of them the wedding cake is more on the indica dominant side it's got that really sweet vanilla frosting type taste popularized by jungle boys of course a gelato 33 there's got that real distinct gassy deliciousness to it hearing from the grower the genetics weren't particularly stable with this one this was the only keeper a lot of the others her meat which is when they start producing pollen sacks as well this was a stable one and this was the keeper I am expecting effects from both ends of the spectrum a lot of that heavy hybrid hitting hi is coming from the wedding cake and the gelato 33 let's talk about the appearance of the ice cream cake [Music] this is where this is 10 out of 10 but guys every time I post a picture of this on Instagram it gets like twice as many likes as anything else I'll post it has got this rusted white look to it the trichomes are in such abundance that it is significantly alters the composition or the appearance of this but it looks like it's been dipped in vanilla frosting reminded me of the wedding cake but it has also got this just lovely sort of like stat calyx the bud structure is delicious looking and actually it's consistent consistent delicious looking luxe across the sample that I am smoking you could trimmed you up on this one and the the frosting this means that I must about to trim off quite a lot of trichomes getting those bases of leaves off but it is looking like a Cali bit of bud as you can see that I'm holding in my hand helped out does this look oh yes coloration really really like coloured there's patches of darker which our guests were the basis of the leaf before it was given that excellent trim job it's got reasonable size pistols they're not particularly long and while they are sort of in in quite an abundance on the pile actually compared to some other strains pistols if you don't know come on vagina's so overall this is looking like a a very very nice bit of bud I would say appearance-wise 10 out of 10 but how does it smell initially this has got that sort of dank gluey sort of pungency to it that piney earthy but like also Major League a seat sort of sort of a Roma's coming out of the jar straight away giving hints as to what its gonna be like it's got this real sort of offensive under time the ice cream cake that reminds me of the gelato 33 it's got the sweetness of the wedding cake as well chemically levels of gas eNOS is one experience in smelt bloody lovely very very strong hiney knows gassy notes smells like an OG smells like that sort of it's got that sort of richness that I've got sour power OG at the moment and it's not too dissimilar a smell from there and I think that's the pungency and the Pioneer it's coming together with that terpene profile to give this sort of lovely rich dank cannabis in and that is what I'm getting before I've even pulled it apart squeezed it agitated it at all let's try that now or as a nice density to that guys this is some very good bud alright let's break it open you hear that crack there's a definite skunky smell and a definite gluey smell to it by glue I mean the same sort of chemical burns smell that you get for all that mean the specific a really low strain I mean that gas in it which is like when you're at a petrol station it's like you you think about that smell you're like and I shouldn't be inhaling those fumes but that smells good it's got like a smell that's that's along those veins it's not the same as that spell but that's what I mean when I say gas is like losing this delicious more rich scent that it's really difficult to put you put your finger on I mean it's a pungency than offensive smell to the nostrils oh yes let's move on to the taste section of the review I'm super excited to get some of this into the bond guys we're gonna grind up the ice cream cake by sea junkie genetics all right if you are a hater or prohibitionist or you don't like the weed smell and get a [ __ ] out what you doing so lost if I said you would not like this smell of this strength it is gonna be in your face if someone's got it in their pocket you're gonna be pissed off I've got my raw little sister bong here this is a marvelous piece of kit we're gonna hit it through this raw bung let you know how the flavour is and then we're going to move on and wait some all right if you're joining me for this you know what to do get yourselves ready get those joints rolled bongs ready dab rigs heated up you can hit that pause button if you need to we're about to go live with a bowl of ice cream cake oh yes shoving a lot more in the bong and I'll see you all on the other side cheers folks oh wow so immediately smooth smoking experience nice flame and rice nice and smooth no validity hitting that in the raw bomb was a delicious smoking experience I'm finally over that annoying cough I'll be suffering with for the last month or so allowing me to majorly enjoy this bomb now that it's back up - back up to where I'm normally at no COFF COFF interests try and get a bit flavor and a little bit of the pungency is creeping through but overall the cleanliness of that was the major USP so far I'm pretty impressed with this strain guys looks-wise it is amazing smelling delicious - and really smooth smoking experience through the raw little sister long I'm now about to vape it and see how it tastes and I'm pretty excited because I bet it's gonna be delicious all the signs are there here we go guys [Music] yeah the sweetness is leading just just leading that pungency that gas units there as it's real like frosted sweet pungency it's a really nice white guys this is a strain which tastes bloody lovely let's talk about the effects of the ice cream cake today I've been consuming the ice cream cake by sea junkie genetics this is a lovely straight guys flavor-wise it just completely delivered how am I feeling I feel like this is a good strain to smoke during the daytime it comes from two heavyweights trains yeah it doesn't feel particularly strong I do think that there's a nice indica led hybrid stone creeping over my body from that first bowl of the day but I'm not sort of inebriated significantly you know vaping it to continue getting those cannabinoids I'm noticing this slight visual sensitivity in the light I'm quite chatty so there's also effects on the sort of sativa side I think there's probably some sour D somewhere in this heritage and it's just generally a nice strain for smoking during the day so I might say and not just because it's called ice cream cake you don't have to just enjoy it on sunny days but I bet it would be nice if you did the am feeling nicely relaxed but not overly inebriated even though I did a nice bong of that food a royal little sister and I'm now provoking it a bong I did was actually about half hour ago as well because I had to quickly pause the filming because I had someone come rad to do a job that I've forgotten about come back never felt too high but did get this nice high feeling the flavors delicious even those wonderful let's sum things up today the ice cream cake has been the subject of that I smoke strain review I hope you guys have enjoyed it as much as I have appearance-wise is probably my favorite thing about this strain it just looks 10 out of 10 just nothing better about it it's just a wonderful strain that I love the look of every trichomes glistens in the light smells dank particularly when broken up and ground very very nice strain indeed all that pungent say that guessing is that fuel aroma taste wise delicious particularly through the vaporizer the smoking experience was incredibly nice and smooth as well and effects wise I'm feeling good I like it during the daytime and it is a strain which I will happily smoke any time day or night what do you think of this review guys do leave your thoughts below in the comments and remember to hit that like and

of cookies again for another strength tasters cannabis reviews episode and today we're going back man we're throwing it back with some classic gaps as I say it it kicks in we're doing a review today on noble Farms cherry pie cherry pie being the classic strain this is like one of the first strains I ever grew cherry pie if you haven't had it it's a super gassy sweet flavored strain that like probably was the like one of the first strains to lead to all the exotic strings that we have now like this was this was one of those strings when it came out everybody was raving about yo you need to get some cherry pie literally I remember 2009 2008 member whenever cherry pie first came out and it was available in California to buy it record but not wreck shops medical shops I drove all the way to San Francisco 7:00 in the morning and bought like 10 cherry pie clothes and I was like my first real borough I grew a bunch of different stuff granddaddy purple cherry pie whatever was available back then but that was I bought it at burners club - that was a funny thing I bought it the THC which is the hemp center that was a burnished Club way back in the day but yeah man this cherry pie right here super fire from noble Farms hello affordable I got the [ __ ] for 35 dollars and eight and it's way worth it as soon as I opened it boom kicked me right in the face with that sweet gassy smell new right away just because I grew this before I smoked tons of it I knew right away okay that's 100% cherry pie done right smells good looks great - tastes [ __ ] amazing cherry pie is across a lot of granddaddy purple and Durbin poison both of those super sought-after gasps strains so putting those together is what brought this [ __ ] beautiful bun to fruition and yeah man this uh this one right here is tested in at 23 percent THC zero percent CBD yes fire its fire like for me I give cherry pie on the on the rating scale like specifically Nobel forms I give there's like an 8.5 because it looks good smells good tastes good and it's affordable could it have been more gassy and more sweet absolutely you know it's a hybrid strain so it's not really like super into kendama knit like I like or super heavy you know that's kind of what I'd look for what I'm trying to find a weed that I like but if you're somebody who looks for a balance a balance strain that's gonna give you a little bit of both I would definitely recommend this and for the price link you can buy two weights to this you know for around the price that you're gonna get 1/8 of like some exotic [ __ ] and I think this is [ __ ] it's not all the way in the 90s but it's it's right there it's gas so I would [ __ ] with it but yeah man [ __ ] I'm definitely gonna look for more stuff from noble Farms I first time ever happened them first I'm tryna I was over there at Green Theory on a bell red and one of the budtender said man you gotta try this stuff right here and uh I grunt cherry pies I said you know let me take that chance see if they got it and then very pleased with noble form so eight point five noble Farms cherry pie oh yeah make sure you guys keep an eye out and go look for that and once the game man there's been another quick review from strain tasters cannabis reviews support a lot of cookies [Music]", "Jd6dPGAGbEU": "hi I'm the top shelf grower I'm welcome to episode 25 week 25 of seasons of outdoor cannabis I know it's nighttime what I'm shooting this early in the morning sleep is for the weak hmm no coffee no a spliff look cause I've been hmm about stations all week and it's absolutely paid off now it's time to show you guys the final four plants we've got your last look at the most purple cush you're ever gonna see and some two superstars sativas okay let's get through with folks here we grow hmm it's been a very very busy week fortunately there hasn't been any rains hasn't been any terrible thunderstorms but nevertheless - at the ready and I've been keeping unusual hours I've also been busy harvesting a couple of plants so let's pick up with blue coach berry the most purple specimen of the bunch and it is safe to say that this girl is incredibly dank and incredibly close to harvest get a load of these boards oh my god maximum frosted maximum purple tones and those beautiful orange hairs oh yes oh yes okay this week I promise is gonna show you my jeweler's loupe but I just couldn't figure out how to you know get a good angle with on the cameras I can't really zoom in any better on these trichomes than with the with the video camera or something I'm trying to get in under what you can see look it's totally frosted and I'm trying to hold a napkin in there at the error all on this particular plant completely milky had a try comes now I just I'll show you the actual jeweler's loupe in one of the smoke reports or maybe just in the next episode before we wrap it up so you know when I'm talking my book pocket microscope whatever you use was that is all you need you know to really get in there but at the same time you know your quarterly ball I'm gonna be honest with you because I've never come that's of course had so many so much frost that's how many orange airs and within at the end of week age and you know that wasn't dawn so this girl is absolutely ready to go so I've been just flushing it with the five milliliters per liter of coconut water and we'll just take it down here we have a look and the medium is not quite dry so I'm gonna clip her tomorrow wit her sister that has also produced some purple tones now not quite so rich the developments but get a load of these notes oh yes indeed you stuff so just a sugary and just as ripe and ready for harvest too so just a pullback week that Blue Crush Berry is a really killer strain that's one for definite I'll be growing this again pleasure to grow out of the whole lot of the easiest to grow most suitable in my opinion to the environment and the climatic conditions and definitely responded really really well to my experimental organic nutrient regime does it go admit last year was all about you know using the minimal amount of Canada synthetic a typical indoor nutrients and applying what I knew there outside this year starting off with the auto flaring plans you seen back in spring was you know taking that a step further okay seen what's the minimum we can do with the autos with those synthetic nudes but still got great yields okay then with this particular crop how can i integrate as much organics as possible and then finally make the switch where I'm just using organic products on a pretty much there now ladies and gentlemen so the next crop you see sometime in 2020 God knows where I'll be hopefully I'll be on the move applying for a lot of jobs internationally so anyone if you have received my CV take this video into consideration the mind knows how to cross course okay right now moving love and the purple tones don't stop get a load of this LA amnesia they can't you two just keeps on giving okay definitely the sugars and the frosty and fattest colors it luck quite possibly the pick of the litter if I'm honest it depends on the high now it's gonna take a lot to cut that new course very but this is in your direction swinging city but it's gonna be very uplifting as opposed to crack a lock and you can see no popcorn those few boards you say even the kind of stragglers I lollipop themselves just the top no bit so it's all lovely stuff and purple tones yeah that is now confirmed right this is what my hypothesis was going into it that it was the OG Kush if it's in the mix in their genetics and you got a bit of cold water then you'll see some purple tones and depending on how much of it is in there and if it is the real deal OD Kosh has been crossed in and you'll see because I didn't see it I'm a sense Easter because that's not cross that og cush and it didn't see it I'm a Mendocino skunk that's also that's not grass ecology cush but I think all these strains have a little bit of G caution including the atomic cell Hayes get a loaded up these purple tones super sugary nogs now these are actually beginning to rival the LM need very very frosty city without a paradise seeds folks and they don't take that long to flare get a load of this and we gate I reckon next week I'm gonna say now it's gonna be the last episode of the cultivation part and his series so there you have it folks say bye-bye to the blue coach berry been amazed so Colin time I'm eight weeks I'm furious flaring and that was nice you know eight weeks of adjective growth got your shooter mainline and that's another thing if you want to learn how to mainline yourself got a recommend this technique for all the kinds of growers indoors or outdoors want to get total control over your crop and the maximum yield only the top shelf colas that's in looking at a torchon yes absolutely I could have blasted all of these plants out with a variety of chemical fertilizers blown the boards off twice the size oh yeah I could have done that but it would have been fit for human consumption absolutely not why not gonna smoke it up that's another reason why you know I stay away from hydro if I can I'm not knocking it in a desperate situation as yeah as opposed to smoke and not yeah it smoke your highlighter but know when it's my own stuff I want the absolute perfect Sun growing cannabis as natural as possible no contaminants no unknown chemicals that will turn me or future generations and ways behind me into the elephant back you know all right honestly I'm waiting for that the near future gonna wheel a bloke out onto a stage with two heads and six-fingered hands and I'm gonna tell you a week ago you look

everybody it's your boy the Loki legend how the [ __ ] ya do it today I'm doing all right today I am back with a brand new episode of stoner tips for you guys today we are jumping aboard with episode 118 of the stoner tips series today we are going to be covering the topic of sativa dab cartridges and this is a requested video that if some of you guys have personally wanted to hear a little video about so I figured I got enough experience with smoking these that I could go ahead and make a video so if you guys do a joy though be sure to smash that thumbs up button it does go a super long way with that being said let's dive on to number 118 of the STONER tips series talk about sativa dab cartridges alright so before I get this video started though real quick I haven't uploaded in five days I'm very sorry about that I just haven't been feeling myself too much lately but I am trying to get in the groove back to uploading I definitely will have a video out at least once a week to three videos out a week but I don't know if I'm gonna be doing daily uploads I'm gonna have to get back in the groove a little bit get some more motivation but drop a comment if you guys have any other suggestions on videos that I should do and I will get to them ASAP because yeah I'm doing video ideas just from you guys only now so anyways let's talk about some sativa dab cartridges alright so the first thing I'm gonna go ahead and say is if you guys have smoked a sativa dab cartridge you guys probably smoke dab cartridges a lot alright if you smoked any of the indicas any of the sativas any of the hybrids you will notice a significant taste in each of them a lot of them like to go in depth with taste so you can get fruity pebbles ones and as you exhale you will really get that fruity pebbles taste or as you even inhale there's a lot of different unique flavors of this of the dab cartridges that are very excellent in their flavor but when it says sativa on there I'm supposed to my mind is set to getting a sativa high from it and I'm not gonna lie to you guys a lot of the times when I smoke these dab cartridges they are not exceeding my expectations for having a sativa high especially when it says right there on the box sativa I expect to be all in the mind I want to be a super mind I don't want nobody I don't want to be lazy I want to just think a lot of different [ __ ] and from what I have noticed in these sativa dab cartridges they have not been doing that for me okay they have been doing ultimately the same high that I got off the indica ones now where I live it's not a legal state to smoke weed so that might be part of the problem I feel like but at the same time there's only a couple name brands that are in my state right now I'm just gonna go ahead and name them because it is what it is dude one of the brands that switched over I was smoking on supreme DAB cartridges a lot and my mind was programmed to all the sativa ones I want to smoke that because I want that sativa high I want to be high in my head you know think about [ __ ] be active still and be have motivation to still do the basic [ __ ] that I like to do just in a high mentality if you guys catch my drift on that but I noticed when I screwed that Deb Carter's on and hit it it kind of resembled a small difference from from indica it would kind of go to my head a little bit but not as much as I as you guys would think that a dab cartridge should do all right so when you're smoking sativa dab cartridges I expect I mean anybody in general would suspect them to do a lot of damage not damage but a lot of effect on them because this is a 90 you know we're talking 90 plus percent THC in a dab cartridge so after every hit you blow out you should be fried after that dude like you should be decent you feel me maybe one or two three hits is pushing it but still you should have a bigger effect on your mind then it should your body and I have not noticed that in the Supreme dab cartridges now there's going around that we're getting exotics karts and dank karts those are the main two going around in my city right now everyone's just easily getting their hands on them I don't know how but I'm guessing either one of the companies probably went out and said you know we don't give a [ __ ] we're just gonna sell these out to everywhere and or maybe they're just kidding they got a solid plugg from a certain state you know one of the legalized states and they just take a trip down there grab it come back I don't know what the case is but those are the two main brands we have going in our town Zadok and dank and i have not smoked them yet I'm not gonna lie I have not tried them out yet but from the supremes what I could tell is that these cartridges are kind of just excess oil like probably the bottom of the bin oil that you're getting just kind of shipped off you know you can make out of a big old bin of oil just the bottom [ __ ] you can make you know a hundred plus dab cartridges out of it and that's literally sold by the thousands so once you take that into consideration I feel like the way we're shopping right now is still illegally we're right where I live so you even though it says on the actual packaging what it is I feel like it's not all a hundred percent there and I don't know if that's just for me but first first sativa dab cartridges I've only had really one or two different experiences with them with two different brands is what I'm saying I smoke two different brands of the sativa cartridges and I have not noticed a significant differential way to compare the two like I can a little bit but it's not to the point that I would expect it to be so one of the reasons I'm gonna give to you guys for maybe not exceeding your guys's expectations for the dab cartridge sativas either is will be they are not legally produced in this state once there is a company in your state that can legally produce this [ __ ] they're obviously gonna have a harder motivation to keep it going because they know people can just walk into the store and get it we to the weed community are like the bottom feeders alright we really don't care what we get as long as we get some [ __ ] we don't have the option to go into dispensaries yet this is made in 2019 of February so maybe a year from now you know if you guys are watching this there might be legal everywhere I don't know but right now from where I'm standing this is not legal yet and I don't think we have the ability to go in and get the actual full 100% you know tested [ __ ] I don't know if it's with all these exotic dab cartridges or all these dank carts but I have noticed a sharp little you know it's pretty much neutral with hybrids and indicas I feel like they are all the same in a way it might give you a light different high but I don't feel like that's a real difference between what it should actually be and what it actually is so that might just be a personal preference on me that might just be my body but I want to know your guys's opinions if you guys have whatever cartridges you have I feel like they should be hitting a lot different than what they are actually doing to us you know they're making us high you know we get that high feeling but I still feel it in my body even when I smoked sativas so I think that's a problem but also that's not a solution we could go around until it becomes legal and once it becomes legal I feel like we'll have different dab cartridges you know at the dispensaries that we can go to and access but for now we are literally getting the bat not even the bad batch but something along the lines of that like you know the the end of the line batch where it's like yeah you know these were just put together you guys can you know have them in your legal States they're not selling them to us directly but they're selling them to the big dogs which are the plugs who get their dad cartridges and sell them to us so I don't really know how to really go about doing that I don't really like smoke and dab cars now when I think about it I smile if I smoke a DAB carters I just expect to get high and fried like I think of it always as an indica even if it's just a TiVo I don't really think there's a big difference because I'm in a non legal state so I don't think it really matters what type of [ __ ] we get so in the end man that's really my personal preference or my personal experience on Babb cartridges I want you two guys to comment down below if you guys have any other different experiences or maybe I'm wrong about this entire subject or maybe you guys can relate to this subject at all drop in the comment section below that's my personal experience on dab cartridges though I think that they should be a little more potent to your brain and the kind of mind high you're supposed to get rather than kind of just all-around I don't think that it's specifically zoned to your head I think it's all around but it might be zoned a little more specifically to your head but not enough to sell an entire dab cartridge off of and that's just my opinion guys so I'm gonna make another video very shortly probably tomorrow on the nikka dab cartridges and let you guys know on that but indica is supposed to be a motivational hi to where you can actually you know do all the [ __ ] that you want to do normally and it's just a mind high like you'll think about weird [ __ ] and you'll but you'll still have your body will be still motivated to do the normal [ __ ] that you do so I think that it's a it's not a good balance right now I think that it's more based on indica even if it you're smoking a sativa cart I think it's got a small effect on your head but not enough to the point where we can actually they are taking it seriously to give it to us so when these big plugs go up to them and ask them for it they literally probably just give them the bottom of the barrel [ __ ] and you know even if they get fifty carts sixty carts whatever the case is it's not gonna be that top shelf [ __ ] because it's the bottom of the barrel [ __ ] and usually that that's not the best type of wax to get if you guys know what I'm saying I don't know if I if I make you me making sense at this point but leaving the comments to what you guys as personal preferences at Eva is make a little community down there I'd really appreciate it I might have missed out on some [ __ ] or not mentioned you know some stuff in the video so let me know what you guys think though other than that I'm sorry I didn't upload in the past five days I really tweaked on that I just kind of like I said man didn't get much motivation to keep uploading but this has been episode 118 of the stoner tip see you guys did enjoy smash that thumbs up button would catch y'all tomorrow for a brand new video subscribe if you guys are new phone and Instagram if you haven't already other than that y'all stay safe stay

going this is a disclaimer all products on this channel are in compliance with Maryland state law any viewers under 21 are advised to turn away and all reviews are my personal opinion and I am in no way paid or supported by dispensaries or growers it's just me doing my thing so uh yeah today's product we were going to review is called mag landrace um it's a Verano product Verano notes this runs you $65 an eighth it is an indica bud it is very pretty it's got almost like a purple tinge to the entire bud itself it is very impressive that being said it also looks kind of sappy that's the best way I could describe it this light really isn't doing it justice I wish I had a better means of articulating that hope but she's a gorgeous bud one nonetheless um yeah we're gonna give her a quick test run see how she flies this is the mag landrace and I got this from oh that's a good question i got this from trilogy that is trilogy in ralph 40 off of route 40 in howard county hmm yeah it's got two it's got like a fruity lemony yeah it's definitely got like a lemony but with like a hint of lime it's really not a bad deal at all besides the the tastes on it it's a very pungent bud it's got a high THC the THC rating is point 64 and the THC a rating is 21 point 43 so this is a potent bud this but is definitely rocking oh one thing I can say trilogy puts a lot of information into their buds and what their buds are rated for what the Reed net and I like that about them remedies a little more straightforward but um yeah all things considered this is a good bud and it's worth checking it out while it's around oh this has been Steve Stevenson with Maryland marijuana review you folks enjoy yourself stay high high five", "mDhTt2dlOSY": "you were looking at some indica and some sad about

both wonder strains they both been hybridized to produce up real well they're very crystally and they're very heavy the sad of all is actually it's only a little bit longer than the indicate but it

is my favorite this is hybrid hybrid I will smoke but I definitely like indica / anything I don't like sativas I have me a radio going and keeps dying because it's old this is like the Nintendo of all

I don't play just kidding happy Friday later", "zqgxr9OKWQg": "hey guys it's Joe again doing another unboxing unveiling review on what I think are some of the best cartridges out there right now in 2019 so basically went to pretty much my favorite dispensary ever went to this place called high tide and Oceanside and it was exactly the way I would imagine a dispensary should be where everything is just super high vibration everyone in there is full of love and joy you can just tell that as soon as you walk in the door they've got crystals everywhere you know amethyst crystals they've got salt lamps it's a very low dim just everything is just wonderful and everybody in there really knows what's going on so first of all shout out to them guys that was my favorite dispensary I've ever been in I would buy a house out here and move out here just to have that as a local dispensary because I don't see that replicated anywhere anyway getting on to this cartridge right here Cresco labs they're a wonderful brand she shared with me all of the charity work that this company does all of the different organizations they're involved with and she said it's a very high vibration company who's doing some great things in the cannabis industry basically these guys just are doing it up right now I've already opened this cartridge and been using it for about a day or so I love it it's wonderful it's it's great but I'm still gonna do this as if it were so basically I'm interested in the live resin cartridges not so much interested in the distillate with the re-added terpenes that's just basically what everything is out there I'm interested in the live resin cartridges which are not adulterated at all they're completely full-spectrum nothing else added to it love it so anyway this stuff is wonderful Crisco this cartridge is a high quality cartridge you have the glass and so basically we're gonna try this out on a pen that I really like and that's going to be this pin right here which is an open alright let's see what happens okay light and that is the lowest setting I was always always like to test on the low setting mmm oh that's wonderful no burn no harsh no hot there's the tickle on the back side the Terp tickle the Terp tick yeah that's good this is a high quality cartridge very very high quality cartridge yeah this is on point", "HcV8-oLiHtI": "what's up

com we bring you the latest in recreational and medical marijuana information from all over the globe this week from another great source High Times Magazine they have an article about the five differences between sativa and indica the two different substrains of cannabis plants are classified according to a system dating back hundreds of years cannabis can be subdivided into two main subspecies sativa and indica there are variations to those subspecies in the form of hybrids and one other subspecies ruderalis which is less common for our purposes here we will be looking at the differences between sativa strains and indica strains sativa strains originated in an area around the equator and can be found in countries like Cambodia Mexico Thailand and several African nations the indica strains originated from higher altitudes and can be found predominantly in countries known for their hash culture such as Morocco Afghanistan Nepal and Turkey these plants are shorter and fuller plants compared to their sativa counterparts the top five differences between indica and sativa zar one size sativas will always grow taller and then their indica sisters indoors I've seen sativas get as high as six feet while indicas tend to stay short around three feet tall the effect and high as a connoisseur smoker there is nothing like a sativa high the sativas are like chateau lafite rothschild 1965 a fine wine that tastes even better with age I smoked some sativas that have been cured for more than 24 months and the high had no ceiling meaning that with every new joint you smoked you just got higher and higher with the indicas I find the effect to be quite Universal across a multiple of different strains is usually a couch locked quote I want to sit play playstation a kind of feeling that being said is actually the indicas that have the strongest analgesic effect when it comes to medical cannabis it's usually the sativas that have the higher amount of THC compared to CBDs flavor sativas have a wide range of flavors from fruity like fruity thai or amnesia to what is known as the cat piss flavor which is a more of an ammonia scent the indicas can also be quite fruity which you see a lot in cush varieties as well as sport skunk flavors as found in indica hybrids flowering time when growing are also different sativas can take a long time to finish I've seen a plant even go over 20 weeks it's a pure Cambodian with the thinnest leaves I've ever seen with sativas you could always change the 12 12 photo period 2 11 on and 13 off to speed up the last few weeks indicas have a much shorter flowering time with the quickest indica I've ever seen finishing around 44 days it was a Dutch strain called top 44 however generally indicas are finished between eight and ten weeks with added co2 they will usually finish a week earlier finally the yield generally speaking the indicas tend to have a higher yield than their sativa sisters however there are exceptions back when I was with Delta nine labs we had a sativa that finished in 14 weeks but had a yield that was almost double any other plant we had on the indica side of things the OG Kush tends to be a low yielding compared to some of the other in the COS sisters which can be mega yielders again this is from High Times Magazine and was written by Harry resin which is a very interesting name and we hope you enjoyed that there's a lot of differences other than those that we just spoke about and everybody's body is different some people react differently to sativas than other people and the same thing with indicas so check it out whenever you're trying a new strain whether it's indica or sativa just take a couple of hits one or two wait about 15 or 20 minutes and then you'll know if you need more or not it's all about the dosage everybody peace and love everybody peace and love will be back next week with Wednesday's with lera wanna right here on Canha wanna buy com where you can get the greatest products and fast shipping right here on Canha wanna buy com once again peace and love everybody peace and love", "ZMCyCHrK4Yk": "I smoked how you doing I'm back today with normal video and we are going to be taking a look at the famous white widow cannabis train this train is proper old school cool if you've been in Amsterdam in the 1990s you would have encountered this and it's still around today guys so I managed to get myself a lovely sample of this one below but I've got it here for you guys today I hope that you are ready for another iced mocha review and that wherever you are you are going to be smoking along and let's take a look in a bit more detail guys the first thing to say about the white widow is oh my god the buds the buds are fantastic they have been clearly cut to perfection and has left this strangling really really tasty and delicious you get this sort of earthy almost woody smell coming from the buds that just reminds me of an old bag of weed when I was like 15 16 when I first smelled it it might have been this strain or something very similar because this to me is the traditional cannabis smell it's got no some additional smells low fruitiness no berry no hazy it's just got this cannabis stench which is delicious I've actually had a cure in for a little while longer who's ready to go put it in a glass jar and smelling better over the week that I've had it so yeah this is [ __ ] tasty guys and it is a really good kind of a strain and my pleasure to review with you guys today so what we're going to do now is I'm going to show you a close-up of the butt and you can have a look at yourself see just how good it is really really good trim job then really dense I think it's due to the way that it's been imported I don't know where this has come from it wouldn't surprise me if it was someone like Holland it's quite compressed but not too much so the buds are solid but they're not sort of over crushed together and as a result you get this lovely sort of odd formation here yes they probably did look better when they come straight off the plant but I cannot complain with the quality of this bit of cannabis because it looks and smells and tastes absolutely delicious so the overage hairs in this or I'm sure we have close up you've seemed in a lot more detail but looking with my eyes they aren't very apparent they're not like some kind of estranged UCLA while big orange hair some overtaking the bus which somebody mentioned to me could be a sign of heat stress this hasn't got any of that is all quite uniform in color Oh school old school cool is a cross between a Brazilian sativa landrace and a resin heavy indica which is from South India and it's bred quite greenhouse seats and it was bred a long time ago it's one of the most famous strains in the world I know all of this anyway but I just wanted a little bit of backup what I'm going to do today I've actually purchased a new micro Greek and this is my new bomb because that one broke and I'm between bombs at the moment to grind up some of this and we're gonna pack it into the bomb we're gonna let you know how it tastes and what the effects are so gonna grind up fresh grind up the house move these are when they're fresh you know don't get this up a blind off to use their few times look at that it's almost working your hair got using it just gonna keep that spoon look hypnotic [Applause] anyway this but some of this why we don't net and shame to to break up those when we've still got some nice juicy little mugs say goodbye to this mean actually this grown-up ever get stuck with the resinous crystals as you can see it pops out by lighting the grind up because it's nice and compressed and tasted that looks lovely smells like old school kenja without further ado I'm gonna put some in my bomb now my first form of the day and then we can stop letting you guys know what the effects are like goes the only issue with those plastic binders that haven't got a sort of compartment for the week to go through to it you don't catch the leaf or the the stalk sometimes a little bit comes through or stays in there whereas when you use the bigger crime is you've got that extra layer which is sort of usually catches a lot of the leaves that I've got obviously this has been trimmed well so there's not a lot but just a little bit of smoke in the middle was was left in that so just that to watch out otherwise I would have liked my bottom tastes nasty and that's not what we want put some hemp wick here I've stopped opening new hemp wicks I need to find some of my old ones and to be honest I don't know if I see the flavor difference you know I mean I need to do a video comparing it because with a lighter and we have wick icing tastes relatively similar but let's see guys let's see how this one widow tastes through the bomb and I think it goes nice Cheers [Applause] [Music] mmm very smooth very smooth fog the place is incredible like I think because the bonds smaller it seems to be quite a little to taste it'll be better than my previous bomb which I'm really surprised this was eight quid and that's not like a lot to pay for a big glass until I've got this top of the market still just because I saw and it reminded me of my one in Amsterdam and I was like [ __ ] it okay [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and it trips me this one is brilliant the pole is there three times the size of the other bunk I'll be using even though this is smaller yeah really good experience I can report that that was really tasty I'm still bit ill at the moment as you can hear from my voice I'm still struggling I've got quite a bad cough in terms of smoking it for a bong it's really really smooth it's a lovely flavor it's not harsh it doesn't make you want to cough up it's a pure sort of taste and it is a hybrid of indica and sativa so it's quite a balanced strength so you get the relaxing chilled out feeling of the indica you also do feel quite happy and uplifted as the sativa side of the hybrid kicks in so how am I feeling now the bong is starting to wash over me now and I'm feeling the familiar sort of relaxing feeling spreading across my shoulders and working its way down the double-bond first thing in the morning was a great idea it is poke me up I was tired this morning his self my appetite I'm now gonna go and have some breakfast and it is yeah a nice bit of weight guys so I'm glad that I could share that with you and I really hope that you've enjoyed the white widow review parallels can be drawn I feel between this and the Northern Lights train that I reviewed the other week because they're both old school strains and both of mantastic I'll pick them both up whenever I get the chance to it actually tastes really nice in a vaporizer as well very clean very fresh and that's the sort of thing that you want guys in the daytime smoked because you're not gonna want something that's just gonna blow your head off if you've got stuff to do something like this white widow is a lovely stroke once your thoughts and opinions on this guys have you smoked white widow when was the first time you smoked what we know what did you think let me know you can find us on the web I smoked Marco got UK and I smoked mediator code at UK find us on Instagram Facebook Twitter snapchat we're everywhere hit that like and subscribe button to support the channel and help us grow make sure you tell your friends about I smoked I voice and abyss consumers in the UK will be back soon with another video keep talking guys hey guys so it's been about 20 minutes since sudden bongs how am I feeling I'm feeling great actually and it's not something that I expected to overpower me it is as I keep mentioned in old-school cool and it's a really relaxing but also a lovely mellow strain so I am completely functional while I got the nice relaxing effects of the indica in the uplifting effects of their sativa side from the balance of the cross I don't feel like smashed if you watch my holy grail video last week you'll see their aftermath which shows me looking quite [ __ ] I don't feel like that at the moment I actually feel quite did not but I didn't feel good before but I mean I feel relatively sober still off they're doing two bombs of it so yeah it's a great strain guys I have been smoking it for about a week now and that might be something to do with why my tolerance is probably quite high to this particular strain but yeah in terms of the THC content I wouldn't say that it's a it's up there with some of the strongest strains by is the lovely smoke", "xCWfiXMpTkE": "good morning everyone it is May 1st 2018 I am Michael Canada akh outdoor and today I am doing a review of select elite cannabis oil extract cartridge fruit punch here is the that as you can see as it goes into focus is ninety one point nine percent THC and about 0.55 percent CBD I think I love about select is that they have like a description of what kind of what kind of a feeling this particular strain I'll give you do that you know a lot of people don't know this is it different strains of marijuana can produce you know very different effects and for you know it's it's it's different for everybody to my brains wired a little differently and you know different strains of acne fruit punches my new favorite though by far energetic and talkative is yeah how I'm definitely feeling right now you know and I got some electro-swing kick in and you know I'm gonna get some [ __ ] done today wow yeah excellent excellent cartridge my my new favorite by far cuz yeah I mean I need a little bit of CBD has for those of you don't know THC is that is the psychoactive ingredient that you know gives you that buzz that high whereas CBD is more of it brings a sense of physical well-being you know it's it's good for pain relief and and you know just just to relax so my I like having some CBD in there that's it's normally I like to have a bit more CBD in a cartridge but man I saw that number on the THC there's that's 91% point not 90 not damn near 92 it may as well be 92 1.9 am and that's that's that is that is 92 percent THC Sun as Lauren by the way that's 92 percent THC son I don't play it's a yeah it'll it'll make today a lot more fun but for example if you had if you had look at the cartridge to its you'll see that it's a very very clear fluid that is in there well I don't know how good my lighting is here but you know that's just yeah it's it's got kind of a kind of a honey color to it but like a really really translucent you can actually see through it whereas like some of the other cartridges like like this is my my old cartridge here if you look at it you'll notice that the stuff in there the the extract is darker color and that indicates that it's it's less pure you know you have a less pure product and it's it's not gonna deliver as much of a kick and then plus you got the impurities in there too you don't know what the hell your your puffs in there you know so yeah keep it clean you know don't keep it good but yeah if you live in Oregon or Colorado or any other state that is legalized and get yourself a selectively fruit punch 92% THC and a little bit CBD to chase it down and it's good for you thanks have a good on everybody", "I-6Ul2JlYlw": "what's going on YouTube your boy Lonestar coming at you with another quick review which might be my last review on a cartridge as you can see I got this chronic cart pink grunts it's a sativa well the box is a little beat up there that's sitting in my bag for about a good week or two and it's kind of being in tossed around yeah which might be my last review because uh as you know you know everything that's been going on with the baby is she whatever and you know these might be hard to come by pretty soon and also being that we in Texas I'm in Texas you know I'm saying um you don't really know what you're getting man you know saying my beginning

"YyXDwc9OQ2M": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 where we give you the most in-depth reviews as efficiently as possible and today we're gonna be checking out this crumble or this bubba kush crumble by Regulator extract and with that we're gonna go ahead and hop right into the numbers so THC a comes in at or actually THC comes in at 60 to 0.5 they don't have a whole lot of other stuff but as you guys know I don't buy my candles based off of THC the reason I really picked this up was because it looked really good and it was a steal so I can't hi guys know I don't really mention prices so I'm not really gonna go into it but just know that this was really affordable this was definitely something that I would consider budget-friendly and I'm trying to open this right now and it's not working give me two seconds there we go alright so sorry guys I've been fighting kind of cold so if I sound a little funny I apologize all right so here we go sorry it really is that far off camera I was so as you can see this looks really really good zoom in for you guys so you can check that out let me educate this and play with it a little bit so the color that comes off on camera is about two shades lighter than the color that's in the actual like in person I would say it's a little bit darker than what you guys see here but it still looks really really good ooh as far as the scent is concerned it just has that really clean floral you know good concentrate taste but with that I'm really excited to try this and I'll be back again with you guys in a couple of days to let you know how this hey guys what's up I went ahead and tried that bubba kush and as far as the flavor is concerned it doesn't have a whole lot outside of like a regular clean concentrate floral flavor then the hai itself is more of a relaxed stone enos that kind of hits the body but that leaves your brain kind of clear-headed this one was a good one I would say it was a little bit longer than I expected it to be especially for the price and then the way that we ended up smoking it for the majority of the week and I think we still have a little bit of it is we end up topping other stuff that isn't quite as strong or just like you know you dip it in you know you take your other concentrate dip it into some of this and the combination of this with other stuff has been really really really good I honestly think we might end up picking this up again just for the simple fact that if you do end up getting something else that's not quite cutting it you can just dip it into this and boom it's good to go so all around a really good concentrate if you're a newbie I would say you could probably just go ahead and try a normal-sized dab with this because it's not gonna throw you so far out of your element that you're gonna feel uncomfortable and it is gonna give you that concentrate kind of feel if you're a newbie also remember that the THC percentage isn't relevant to you any concentrate is gonna get you higher than any sort of flower that you've ever had before just because it is a concentrate so just keep that in mind when you're out there purchasing your stuff with all that if you guys enjoy what I'm doing go ahead and hit that sub button if you're watching this on Facebook make sure you follow the page this has been recreational 420 and I'll be back again with you guys soon", "4zUOg26hck4": "what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with a different kind of review today so i'm going to review a big joint of maui wowie and a big joint of rockstar but i'm going to smoke them both at the same time and we're gonna hot box the ghost rider check it out this here is the ghost rider i just wanted to make sure that you guys could see it half decent because she's a nice little beast let me know what you think of this idea for doing the hot box in the car and if you like the video and if you think i should do more like this she a little dirty we just took off the winter rims or the summer rooms for the winter so i want to review both strains and hot box the car at the same time and make sure you stay because we're going to open up the door and let out all the smoke and see how cool it looks so hope you enjoy the show hey you welcome to my chris review a juvenile spells this is what i do smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now instead of show thank you for the view all right now that we're all settled up we're going to start this review and we'll start the review by lighting up the maui wowie and reviewing that and then we'll smoke the whole joint and jump on the rock star so we'll get a nice hot box up in the ghost rider so let's light this up um so the maui wow you it kind of has it has like a nice kind of i don't know i would say kind of like an earthy type of taste to it but it has like a nice kind of like a stronger taste though it's not like a weak taste like earthy just it's kind of like a pepper type of taste but it's kind of like earthy like like um i don't know like a bit you know how like the skunky stuff it has a bit of that earthy taste but it still tastes kind of good it has a bit of that taste mixed with like a little bit of a pepperish taste it's not a bad mixture at all it tastes really nice actually so let's take a nice look at the buds first we'll give it a nice sniff test they got a nice strong crystally smell to it as you can see here we'll grab the light so you can see it a little bit better here let's see there as you can see it's kind of a lighter green but it looks really nice it has some nice colored hair and it got a lot of crystal on it it's a very nice trimmed but very nice looking strain it definitely looks like a very good strain and it does have a really nice crystally smell to it so this one is two grams it pretty much came in this bud plus what i rolled this joint with so it was a nice two grams oh no this one was three sorry the rock star was two this one was three grams so yeah it's not a bad account i'll give it a i'll give it a nice rating of at least four for a count because that's not a bad account looks like it's a fairly decent amount because that's three grams like i said besides the joint that i rolled the rock star was two grams i got a little confused but we figured it out so the rockstar fell here we go we got it here see that's a nice looking bud that is a very nice looking strain it has nice crystal nice hair nice bright orange hairs and that's what we're going to be jumping in right after this one so make sure you don't stop watching i got this joint rolled up with that too so it's a very nice strain i'll write the taste i'll give the maui wowie i'll give it a 4.5 for taste because it's a little bit original i like weed that has an original taste instead of smoking the same strain for the same taste and strain all the time i like when it got a nice change in the taste switch it up so i also have bow coming next white widow that's going to be coming next plus this i'm not sure what brand it is it don't say on it but it does look like it's going to be pretty nice that's a shatter so i'm going to be doing both of these real soon so make sure you sub so you ain't going to be missing that and i also have what was this one uh strawberry chem dog strawberry chem dogs coming up next and hold up i got some more goodies we got tom ford pink is coming and platinum girl scout cookies that's coming too and we also got the gorilla cookies and i got a few more up in the house that's going to be all coming i'm going to be doing all them shortly let me know down in the comments if you want me to continue to do this type of idea with it oh [ __ ] i'm laughing too much there we go i'm gonna ruin the hot box once we get out we'll open the door and we'll take a look of all the smoke that we collected up here you might not be able to see it as much in the camera but it is getting nice and smoky up in here so and i'm starting to feel pretty nice this is a nice strain all right taste i think i say it for say it i think i said i think i said uh four and a half for taste because it's not a bad taste at all i definitely recommend it and i'll give the account a i'll give the account a nice four to four and a half out of five as well because for three grams that's not too bad you got this nice joint plus this i can definitely roll a nice few joints out of that so i'll give it the maui wowie an overall rating of 4 to 4.5 0 to 5. it's a really good strain it's not the best but i definitely recommend it sorry about me snuffling it's a little chilly out here but it's not that bad so if you haven't checked it out go and see my how to talk videos as well they're pretty cool i like the one where i made a bomb out of a watermelon and i also um i made a hideable pipe out of an air chuck and i teach you how to do it too so if you're like somewhere where it's illegal to smoke or whatever you can make yourself one and stash it somewhere and nobody will even know that it's a pipe there's all kinds of different things that i make um i think you should go over and check them out they're pretty bomb i call it my how to toke series i got a playlist so you can go up and click them i'll put them in the title cards or whatever at the end of the video so you can go watch them after if you want and if you haven't seen my videos previous keep your eyes out because i'm getting sponsored by mars hydro and i'm getting their plants i'm going to be doing an unboxing i'm going to be growing plants with their lights and it's all going to be going on my reviews my plant progress so make sure you sub so you don't miss that i'm going to be growing purple kush and whatever else i can get hands on i got a bunch of purple cushions right now so like i said make sure to sub so you ain't missing that because it's going to be awesome i can't wait it's coming up in the next little while i just gotta wait for the light so it's gonna be a hell of a time i can already tell that they're gonna be awesome why it's gonna be a great setup [Music] starting to feel pretty good now so we're gonna light up this rockstar one in a few seconds once i find out where i put it so i lost it for a quick second but i found it we're good to go so we're just about done this one so it's almost time to switch it up anyway let's light this next one up oh so the rockstar has a stronger taste to it and it has more of a it definitely has more of like a sweet type of like maybe lemony citrus taste that's a pretty a very strong flavor it actually is it tastes really good i rolled this one up a little tighter than i should have so there we go we're good to go so the rockstar so let's take a nice look at the rock starbug so it's a nice size but so as you can see it has very nice looking green hairs i mean orange hairs it's a very nice looking light green with bright orange hairs it looks very delicious it's like coated with crystals so that's why i wanted to do the maui wowie first because this looked like it was a little better i think this is gonna be just about a five out of five because this looks like a really good strain and i don't see like when something's really really [ __ ] good like how can you get much better than that you know so i can't deny when something's like at its best right because i know sometimes you guys think that i may over rate some things and stuff so that when they're not that good i try to give it a little bit of a lower rating but when they are really good it's hard to give it a bit of a lower rating so i try to look at all aspects to make sure i don't give it like an underrated rating or an overrated rating so yeah the taste it is a very delicious taste it's strong taste and i didn't mention but i'm pretty sure that maui wowie was 24 and this one is around 30 to 32 percent so it's a lot higher percentage i think i did rockstar before but it wasn't as strong as this one is and the maui wowie was from uh i forget what the name of the store was uh empire healing i think and this one was from the medicine man so the medicine man is who i got all these newer ones from that are going to be coming up so make sure you keep an eye on because they all look like they are great and top-notch so all right so the rockstar yeah i definitely i think i'll give about a five a five out of five for flavor because it is a very strong flavor and even the looks of it and the smell so i didn't even describe the smell to you but i can smell it through the bag but it actually has like a really really strong smell it's like really like um lemony smelling but it has a bit of like the earthy smell to it but it's a clean like early smell it smells really good so this one i'd say if we're if they're going against each other this one definitely wins so i say about a 4 to 4.5 for the maui wowie and i'll give a a five of five a five a five of five a five out of five tuned up rockstar because this is very good we're getting pretty smoky this is tasting very good let me know in the comment section if you guys have a favorite strain that you think i should try out or anything like that and i'll see if i can get them or let me know if i've already done your favorite strain because if you're new here i've done like i'd say almost like 150 different types of strains well and shatters and uh live resins and different types of extracts and hashes like dragon hash um ak-47 and all kinds of different ones so i've done all kinds of different [ __ ] so far and i can't wait to start growing these plants it's exciting if you want me to grow any type of [ __ ] plant or anything or you got any type of seeds and you think you want me to try to grow them or something you can send them to me and but just message me or comment and i'll get back to you and i'll let you know my mailing address just please be respectful and send like only seeds or something don't say no [ __ ] stupid [ __ ] so yeah like i said i'll give the star an overall rating of five out of five because this time it was really good and i'm starting to feel like real good don't be shy in the comments either if you got a channel you do reviews or something you want me to check it out let me know and i'll come over and give you a video and checking out and see what's up over on your site and like i say all the time i appreciate everybody that spends time on my channel because without you guys it'd be just [ __ ] pointless for me to sit here and record it in the car like i'd be doing this for no reason so with that i do want just to know that for sure and if you think it's a good idea for me to set up the whole tattoo machine and give myself a tattoo or something let me know because maybe i might do that for a video idea someday so i don't know if i mentioned i got an airbrush kit i just want to practice with it so but i just need to find a decent place where i can paint and i will be posted my artwork and [ __ ] like that and videos and then i'll show you guys all that [ __ ] good i can't even say how much like this rockstar is very good i'll sniff a couple of these and give you a little description on them the platinum girl scope cookies let's take a look and sniff at this all right so it actually has kind of like a really sweet like almost like a cookie dough type of smell oh it smells really crystally too though it has a very nice smell so let's let's give them all a little sniff test over here drop nashes so the strawberry credit or the strawberry chem dog let's give it a sniff well it actually has like a really like a strawberry smell as well oh it's really sweet and berry like smelling that actually smells delicious i might be doing that one next that smells good the tom ford pink hmm it almost has like a berry type of smell to it too but it does smell very delicious i thought i brought more out but i guess not that's all i brought out here besides the shatter i'm not going to open that until we do the review so but it does look very good oh the battery's getting low i should have charged it more but we're almost done anyways so we should be safe who take a look at that i hope you can see it in there how smoky it is on the camera it's pretty freaking smoky so why don't we get out and see the smoke roll out [Music] see if we can do it i hope you guys can see it it's crazy i hope that you guys could see it i hope that you guys seen all the smoke [Music] go with that we'll leave it there i hope you guys all have a good night and have some good [ __ ] to smoke at home you guys enjoy your evening peace it's time to end the show i'll be

inspired by a question by du b88 who said hey Seb assertiveness trains a better choice if I want to avoid being lazy and tired because I only been smoking indica and I'm tired of all this laziness for those of you that don't know there's two general types of marijuana sativa and indica this is going to be a roundabout answer with tons of controversy trickled throughout it as per usual because scientifically the survey is still out on how different they are we all agree scientifically that there's two different types of marijuana but even science cannot decide whether they are subspecies or different species entirely and I'm going to rely on a general consensus here that CBD to THC ratios are higher in cannabis indica than in sativa which is not always the case so please keep that in mind there are exceptions to all these rules there is also a ton of controversy or controversy over which one is better which is stronger and what the real benefits of hi ratios of CBD versity actually really are so I'll talk about the effects first the general consensus is that sativa produces more of an energetic head high while indicas give you that mellow lethargic sort of stoned feeling if you were to choose sativa vers indica for energy smoking sativa will take less energy from you than indica will so smoke sativa so the unique effects of sativa would be that it's a lighter higher feeling or more of a head high rather than a body stoned you'll have more determined thoughts using your own creativity and taking action on that will be easier with a sativa type marijuana than it will be with an indica and when you smoke sativa you're more likely to be social and cool and still hang out with people it's more of a social high so team is also very interesting and different to indica because it actually has alerting effects on your body in very small doses once you start smoking it all day though and you take large doses it will still be a sedative very quickly so for regular smokers that want to smoke in the morning have bricks we can bake or you know just for a day smoked most regular marijuana smokers would choose a sativa so Indic is a bit different and these are just the unique effects between indica and sativa so in become so much more heavy stone feeling it's the body stoned this is where you just want to sit down with an indica it'll still give you that creative effect so you'll think of many different thoughts as opposed having one train of thought so you're more open-minded but your train of thought is not as long and you'll really notice this when you smoke indica and when you're in the middle of a conversation with someone and then you just stop you don't know what you were talking about right and you're like what was I saying and you should know but you don't because your train of thought is really short you have less determined thoughts so obviously that makes being creative and taking action with that creativity pretty difficult indicas a bit different to sativa because in small doses or large doses it is a sedative even if you smoke that first Bowl or joint you will probably immediately want to sit down a lie down right or more of a chance of that within decart then with sativa indica is the anti-social marihuana people call it couch lock you smoke indica and you're just in your seat right you are stoned so most regular smokers would choose an indica for their night smoke because they believe it puts them to sleep I'm being very general here and I'm running on the consensus CBD to THC ratio will be higher in an indica and the ratio will be higher towards THC with a sativa as for growers indica will usually have a higher yield of buds per pound so the yield is higher with Anika and it has a shorter growing season so growers like this it's better for indoor growing because they don't get is tall you can grow sativas in your home but you want to much higher ceiling and indicas are generally found naturally in southern Asia and the Indian sort of subcontinent they're darker green in color thicker leaves branches grow closer together they grow shorter and thicker and they produce more buds so if you were a small-time grower growing out of your home most people would choose indica type of marijuana to grow for themselves sativa has a higher THC than CBD which equals the Cerebral soaring type of high and the more energetic feeling the yield is usually lower than IndyCar but it is very potent weed and sativas grow pretty much everywhere so sativa is the lighter green color narrow leaves branch as far apart they grow tall and thin and they produce less buds kind of it's kind of the gangly Gumby sort of marijuana grows very large like a tree but the buds are very few and far between but because of such a big plan you can probably get more buds off the plant overall but you'll get less buds per pound and buds per pound is all a grower would care about financially and that is why growers prefer indica now I'll tell you one sellers prefer and usually it's indica it's better for dealers because when you smoke indica it's more likely to cause that initial hit you know really knock you on your ass and that is usually how a STONER would judge the quality of their weed if they smoke weed and that puts them right on their ass whether they prefer that feeling or not they're not usually thinking about that they're just thinking wow that's strong marijuana so it is arguably perceived as stronger it is more likely to be smoked once you are in a zombie state of being stoned from indica marijuana you're more likely to just keep picking it up and smoking it whereas a sativa you might get distracted doing something that has to do with life so financially dealers are more inclined to sell indica more often which weed is more common on the street well the most common marijuana you would buy from the street is hybrids mostly indica dominant and it's obvious why so growers usually have higher financial going with the indica dealers also usually have higher financial game with indica indica dominant strains are found more often and sativa on the street and that is probably one of the main reasons that sativa strains became more popular with regular marijuana smokers so higher financial gain for growers is indica higher financial gain for dealers is indica preferred by most regular weed smokers probably sativa and which is most common I would say it more has to do with what your dealers are doing generally everyone prefers indica because it moves it sells it's easy to grow it's quicker to grow it has a lot of benefits to a dealer and a grower but every now and then a dealer will say I want some really different stuff or I want some good stuff get let's get some high strain sativa the one you're gonna find everywhere is indica sativa is a bit more rare but it still everywhere so which weight is better well they're just really different nothing I'm saying here is across the board you can find indicus with higher THC levels since sativas but as always the best information comes from real life experience real users smoking weed so what do you guys think which we do you prefer do you prefer Indy car do you prefer sativa I'd love to know what you guys think just write Plus once a team up or +1 indica and then leave your comment afterwards or just leave it like that don't forget to like the video if you liked this video it helps so much guys cheers for doing it and I'll talk to you again soon"}
