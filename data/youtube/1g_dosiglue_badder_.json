{"-lFJ5srpVFA": "hey youtube what is up alex here back again with another quick video when this time we have is some prism now a funny thing about prism that i just learned from a subscriber and from the uh bud tender was that alera and prism don't label their package don't label their concentrates so the dispensary tells us you know usually if it's a sativa indica or hybrid i thought by the color of the packaging that's like most brands do they color code the packaging green hybrid blue or so purple is a indica and red is a sativa well alera doesn't do that they do it by by textures so crumble is red uh batter and sugars are bluish green i think and they do it that way now the subscriber had told me that and i looked it up and it was true so i misspoke the other time when i did the review on the banana og x gorilla glue i thought was a sativa because of the red packaging and you know what was weird is it was very energetic and uplifting even though banana og is a hybrid and gorilla glue could be a hybrid or an indica so but this here is a sativa it is golden goat so i want to say thanks to subscriber who told me that and for the troll who was talking [ __ ] in the comments you're out of here i deleted you but for the subscriber that advised me about the packaging stuff thanks a lot guy all right without further ado let's get this review going this is golden goat batter one gram yeah we all got trolls i got trolls too on this channel i just delete them from my channel that's what i do so let's get this open i'll let you know what i think of this golden goat i am going to throw this in the puff go i don't think i'm going to do a dab of it i'm just going to throw some in my puffco here because you know what since i did that video on the puffco i found a newfound love for my puffco again cleaned it out really good today and uh i'm gonna throw some in here i got it nice and charged this is a batter looks like a batter smells good that is golden goat batter let me zoom in on for you look at that batter golden goat batter 78 percent i think it was coming in at let me take a little look-see 76.949 on the thca and 1.327 on the thc thcv is 0.48 percent so now i heard that thcv is an appetite suppressant and it makes you not hungry food for thought anyhow let's get a little uh bit of this batter inside my i'm gonna that's pretty fat that's probably enough for one or two let's do it like this one or two dabs trying to get you guys there you go i'm gonna put that inside the puff go i'm just going to drop it right in there yep yep there you go boom it fell right to the bottom i'm going to throw the lid on like so i do have it on the green setting for uh medium heat double tap sesh mode cheers hmm got a nice flavor very earthy with a piney kind of twist i'm here to do again let's see what the tarps are yeah it's got a lot of uh carpathian it makes it a little peppery it's got a lot of terpenoline in it of course when you see that you know it's a sativa let me zoom in i can show you there you go stats for you prison batter golden goat you can see all the stats there and the terpenes terpene profile yeah it's pretty good i did do two hits off the puffco you know what we are going to do it down it just wouldn't be right if we didn't do a dab off the dab rig of this delicious golden goat it's pretty tasty it's got a nice earthy peppery piney kind of taste very enjoyable yeah very enjoyable so i'm gonna heat it up and we'll do a dab of this on my rig and i'll probably wrap this video up get you another look at it got a nice funky smell to it too real nice funky smell that is the golden goat batter by prism not a live batter cured batter but it still tastes really good get my timer ready so let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comments section on this uh dreary afternoon here in erie pa pennsylvania medical marijuana you know how we do it here so yeah let's do this dab and i'll let you know what i think this is very tasty though it tastes really good out the puffco so that's how you know if it tastes good out the puff go it's definitely going to taste good off of a dab rig hit let me get a hit onto the rig get a hit on here dab tool get a hit there trouble focusing here we go if and i did start doing my dabs at a much lower temperature i were doing i was doing them a little bit too hot lowered it down would help with this new banger because that old banger i had was really shitty and it wouldn't hold the heat in very well this one holds the heat very well so i can give it that 40 45 second cool down get that perfect dab every time let me wrap this video up that is prism golden goat very good very tasty this is a sativa even though the box looks like that you can't go by that with alera but then again even with moxie their sativas are dark purple color for sativa and their indicas are red so yeah i guess other companies they gotta kind of confuse you but yeah so i thought my bad that this was this one this color meant it was a hybrid and that red meant and that red meant that it was a sativa but i guess not they go by textures by their colors so yeah anyhow like share subscribe and uh we said let me know what you guys are dabbing on down in the comment section i always like to know give me a thumbs up if you liked the video and uh tune in for the next one peace i'm out", "zbAY763zt4M": "[Music] hi there this is ally hi times concentrate correspondence over the last few years concentrates have become the biggest thing to happen to pop culture since well pot but as the popularity of Deb's continues to grow so the questions about the many forms these concentrates can take all concentrates are made through a process called extraction where marijuana's main ingredients are concentrated into an essential oil the main three solvents used to create Deb's are butane co2 and ISO isopropyl alcohol after extraction the resulting Deb's can look very different today we're taking a closer look at the three main types of concentrates shatter butter and oil oil is a gooey sticky liquid that can be kind of hard to handle while butter has a creamier consistency from being whipped finely shatter is smooth clear and solid all three can be used in vape pens and oil rigs but finding the right concentrate for you is a matter of preference shatter is the purest and most potent form because it involves a second extraction process that removes fats lipids and waxes this can result in over 80 percent THC however it also means that some of those tasty terpenes are removed therapies are responsible for marijuana's unique smell combined with THC terpenes create the flavor of the pot or concentrate your smoking butter retains more terpenes so it tends to be more flavorful but less potent with THC percentages in the 70s oil tends to be the least refined of the three this form also known as honey oil or butane hash oil can retain a full flavor profile however THC levels are generally less consistent unfortunately availability often determines what type of concentrate you smoke but hopefully this little guide helps those lucky enough to have a choice thanks for watching and stay tuned to hi x comm for more Deb related content including how to select a nail and the rig you [Music]", "kgzkiS7c_ng": "what is up family here with another video going over the pts concentrate batter the great mahata and in it i'm kind of disappointed it's a little bit darker than what i thought but honestly off the smell i am fantastically surprised so as you can see we've got this great mata it's a bit darker than what it's what was expected as you can see yeah it is terpy it is solid batter but in general it is a little bit darker than what we would have wanted to expect but we know that it's from the dispensary so we can not neglect the fact that we know that is good [ __ ] homie so let's go and give it a nice little rip off of a fresh puffco peak pro atomizer off of one of these nice master glass shop attachments that we just picked up let's go and for this test off of this fresh nice dispensary depth we have a fresh puffco peak pro atomizer as you can see only thing in it is a terp pearl that we are going to be using it's a four millimeter one that would be recommended don't use anything bigger you're gonna end up having a lot of splash all right fam big clouds here we go we've got our great mata we've got a fresh puffco peak pro coil atomizer chamber this stuff smells amazing absolutely amazing and we are ready to lift off cheers to technology [Music] and that's how you get a dab scent [Music] that's real dabs right there man oh my god oh man i don't know why people are taking dabs like this and wow wow oh my god that got me so blasted honestly one of the best of all for the year i will be honest this is the first time i've smoked some dispensary out of my puffco and for the peak pros especially this thing is ripping on a whole nother level the terps are real everything is killer and it's all on low temp so realistically if it's real you can go on low temp and that's all you need to know um if you think that you got some fake you definitely need to switch to a different uh thing or just go to dispensary because it's not working because it's not real so thanks checking out this video guys i'll catch you next one peace out [Music] what is up fam we're back with another video going over another concentrate from the dispensary coming in from consumed cannabis over on milwaukee and vaughan it is the batter the great matu again i will say it's by pts the concentrate batter the great matu one gram coming in at sixty dollars with the inflation on the market let's unwrap it and see what we got it is probably gonna look okay but it's been a while family had a couple little throwers and people that cultivate on their own that made their stuff but we got another box inside a bag oh my god what are they doing this is the right way to take them this is the right way to take them this is the right way to take care of me and i swear to god if i ever had to explain to anybody i explained like this how you doing [Music] no you don't understand i have never taken a dispensary dab out of this puffcoat yeah after after i'm done with the outro yeah no you got some brownies you know we smoked some [ __ ] joints on the road you had a cartridge in your hand the whole time on the road like you're good you ain't complaining calm the [ __ ] down you don't get it all right yeah all right", "tU_s_zWnKYw": "I am the 4/20 gamer and I'm back with another strain review what is up guys today I'm going to be reviewing this pristiq batter I bought this gram of concentrate from maniac sesh a cool little event that happens every Saturday in Los Angeles this company was there they had a booth and I thought it was pretty cheap so I decided to try some out I'm gonna open it smell it okay so what it looks like [Music] they put the little peepee on the bottom side the purple punch and you get like a berry smell a sweet smell a little bit of a purple smell the strain is purple punch or punch is a sweet and sedating in the cut dominant hybrid the genetics are Larry og and granddaddy purple and it's known for smelling like grape candy or kool-aid the healthy dab from this with that pretty big guy very

he was able to ruin my giant as that another dad no ants Cheers pristiq purple punch you're gonna be trying this let's see what it tastes like [Music] [Music] some of the berry flavor comes through I also get a lot of pine flavors overall flavor-wise I'll probably give this a 3 out of 5 the price is five out of five being at $15 [Music] the cool thing about the strain is it gives you a two punch effect both to the cerebral and to the body this is a perfect strain paired with desserts or as a dessert the effects may help with nausea stress body aches sleeplessness the main flavors that I smell

the eight you know there's nothing else to say nothing to hate about it the even eight if you guys see the lemon skunk in your dispensary and you guys are into a sativa i recommend trying it out so that is my review for the lemon skunk by mx hope you enjoyed it until next time smoke in the small town you", "0VDQ8ZjnSTc": "all right so real quick I'm gonna show you how I clean the dabber so first thing I do is that I set it to the blue setting all the way so that the high setting and now go ahead give it a cycle so heating so again that's just prepping it to loosen up the excess oil that's inside so you just give it one cycle all right take out the cloud going on or it's just already stopped so then I'll take a piece of paper on the paper I'll cover it up like this and then I'll just go ahead and shake off the excess back typically do it over the toilet over a faucet but just be careful with how you shake because you don't want to drop your [ __ ] in the toilet you know saying so keep shaking that off so what should happen is that take this out and all that nasty excess oil runs up here and then you're ready to kind of sort of clean it it's only gunk in my case because I was using this for hash when I was in Amsterdam so that's that so now I gotta head and do another round just make sure that some of its off and then you kind of know you're on the bottom when you can see the thing heating up so around just because get it out the way all right that's done so then I grab a q-tip some rubbing alcohol like this so let's at the program out the key tip with rubbing alcohol and just start wiping around the area so so yeah you can see it but this is what it looks like after you give it a quick run-through listen uh alcohol in the q-tip so that's me it would at least not get it entirely spiffy but it's cleaner than it was before so in another round let's get the alcohol out and then once again I'm gonna cycle so at that point it should be burning off any of that rubbing alcohol that ya left in there and then just what I do then use the other end of the q-tip the clean side just use that to wipe off any excess so this is what it looks like I'm taking a quick run-through yeah it's not gonna be spiffy but it's a lot cleaner than it was initially so that's how I typically clean the atomizer right here but you also want to make sure that you clean the mouthpiece to specifically because this area right here this little filter this cap does come off so just make sure that that's not clogged up cuz you know it's clogged up then it's gonna be a problem using it later so let's make sure you give it a quick run through and as long as you see as long as you can exhale inhale from the mouthpiece you're fine but if you can't inhale or exhale you might want to go ahead and check the insides make sure it's cleaned up so so yeah this typically how I clean up the dabber so hopefully yours will be all set and let me know what you think", "8XDuBjYRizI": "please I put them in the soil remington water i put in work until the Toba maximizing the quality takes a certain kind of grower mother I really over put my faith in the Sun anybody else take it and

see does the chill out of 33 is the purple punch and the Mirage and everything ultimately is looking pretty great coming along nicely what we just did a few days ago around the day 14 mark was lollipop all of these ladies or what we did to be more specific was prune about the lower third of the plants off and we cut off all the branches and made those into clones to make sure we are preserving these wonderful genetics that we have and make sure that we're able to keep them so along with that it also helps these top coalos over here that we were seeing I get a lot bigger this is the Mirage we're looking at now she's sort of there for the runt of the bunch the smallest plan out of bed in here but overall everything is still looking pretty great pretty happy with the results along with being an organic living so these are all under CEO be lighting nothing crazy nothing fancy no brand names or nothing just a couple co B is on top keeping everything rockin same lights we've been using the whole time I know a lot of people ask and it's really about the transi so yeah anyway yeah we're just gonna let you get a nice look at these flower shops ultimately everything's going pretty good the one thing I did do is these these tips you're seeing here we're a little close to the light now there could be other problems but she was definitely closest to the light I have two lights in here she was right next to one of them I did raise the lights as these plants seem to have finished their stretch and they seem to be about as tall as they're gonna be I went ahead and raised the lights and now we're looking at the lower canopy like where I went ahead and did a good amount of pruning and Lolly popping and now I'm just gonna keep had in the water like I've been doing making sure the soil stays more so those raw amendments being added on top we broke him down by the microbes in the humid lair and from there on out we'll just keep going until harvest enjoy the rest of these water shots with the space rain front of you space right in front of you space right in front us but you've got your damn room and you've gone to space right that's a part of the cosmos that you can come to grips with well the room is a place to sleep and so if you say your room more properly then you figure out how to sleep and when you should sleep and how you should sleep and figure out when you should wake up and then you very slow Porto's you should wear because they have to be arranged properly in your dress and then you have to have some place to put your food you're gonna have some clothes you have to figure out what you're gonna wear those clothes to do right and then that means you have to figure out what you're going to do and then your room has to serve that purpose because otherwise it doesn't set up all right here we are now in three by three veg tent where we run the 89600 aight cycle again everything is in a hundred percent organic living soil with bob and mints only pure water being added no bottle boots of any kind also do surrender seob light just one and we've got some special strains in here right now you're looking at candy pie number ten

water soluble does not wash out usually find that in like plant prod reroute or these reach cheap you have foods right and you know it's my belief that calcium nitrate some way better nitrogen source

yeah well you know high ranking cannabis that was totally deadly you won't be disappointed oh no no not at all if I got that from a dispensary I would be very happy yeah yeah I'm sure I think perhaps it's time to do a dab don't you choice I agree definitely well you know what time it is camera guy still you all know indeed it's time to roll another use joy but in the meantime keep watching urban rainbow on video [Music]", "_3v71fexFDE": "yeah guys doing this is Neil from perfect Sun LED calm and Africa is a grow update for you so I'm going to show you guys really quickly what what plants we have going on and then we'll play the actual video update where you'll see me in real time training this blue dream back here and I'll show you some cool trick on how you can do an alternative type of mainlining training that i'm doing for the blue dream which is a photo period these are the three Auto flowers I'm gonna give a quick update for those that haven't been watching what three plants these are how old they are and then I have two different videos so I'm gonna be showing both of them so one at 46 days old which is this one and then another one at 56 days also ten days later you can see how the training took in just ten days alright so here we have the Afro DITA and this is at Auto flower I believe that one is by world of seeds and so Auto flower obviously this one here is the glue berry og which when I click very soon the gorilla glue OG or the grail of gluten allergy just guerrilla glue my fast buds and all that and back here is in New York City diesel auto flower by I believe advanced seeds and so anyway yeah there you go that's the day 46 now I'll show you at day 56 and then we'll go ahead and go to action over the update and then I'll talk about some cool things some some grow tips and stuff and things to avoid alright alright so before we get to the actual video where I do real-time update here I show you guys the plants in real time which I don't do very often here we go so we have the afroditi this is only ten days later the afroditi the Gorilla Glue and then back here we have the New York New York City diesel and behind over here we have the blue dream which I could show you really quickly you can see how much she's recovered we'll go through this again now well actually you know it this video does it human you can kind of see her back there a little bit right there blue dream I thought yeah you can't see like that back there you can see she's recovered quite a bit but we'll go and go through these videos and I'll come back and talk about some tips of stuff and what we've been doing alright hey how you guys doing so doing a quick update here this is the Blue Dream this is a photo period what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start mainlining here I think to make her stay short and bushy I don't know I kind of don't want to do a full main line I just don't know if I'm gonna have enough time to do that because it does take a while for a plant to grow at the full main line but main line training is like where you just keep two branches on the bottom and then you let those go out horizontally should start at that earlier if I was gonna do that so instead I'm going to do is see how kind of bowl changer right now I'm gonna take off the top several nodes and a couple branches and then I'm gonna leave all those bottom branches down there and I'll say that looks like in just a second old old-time video for those that remember that's inside Joe if you guys but you're an old watcher so anyway here he goes I cut off the whole entire top there that can actually make it really nice I can make some nice clones out of that there's a lot of clones on there I can make but I don't like here to clone the blue dream and then I'm going to take these branches I'm going to tie them down to the edge but the main ones I want to take the long I'm really beginning to dislike these edge phones I really hope the next generation has an on edge version because I've even turned off edge functionality and it still sometimes just holding the phone try and record it'll like kill the peak Alex I'm trying to do something with it I think I take off a few of the bottom branches and I'm gonna tie these branches down I wanted to grow horizontally because this is a horizontal room well it's a square room but I grow an 8 by 4 of it so I want it to go eight by eight way right so the four way I want to have only a couple branches smaller ones go into this way cover the four direction and the other branches I want them to try to go as long as possible to cover the long direction so that's the goal here I should have started that kind of training earlier but oh well okay now here when I could something I do that real quick and I'll show it look like all right in the end I have it tied down like that so I have these three branches going that way those two branches going that way that's gonna be the horizontal way and these two here I'll just be there for a little bit of the other way the shorter distance the four-foot distance alright cool and really quickly here's the rest of the plants we've got New York City Diesel back there they all almost died because she forgot to water and they were like almost dead and I was gonna throw them out start over but they for the most part recovered it definitely is going to reduce their yield and not only is going to reduce their yield but it's gonna it's gonna reduce probably well when it reduced their size big time I think that New York City sort of got a lot bigger but it's you know it's 2 and 1/2 feet so I'm like that this one I'm actually surprised the grille glue shut up because she was really small and then the afroditi alfredito it's about how big she would be anyway she's not a very big plant besides she's not fully into flour yet so she might still stretch more these two are probably out there at their final sizes they might get a little bit bigger but not much so that's the new york city diesel really blew by fast boats and aphrodesia these three autos that ones the photoperiod that's getting trained for when these ones finish I might even start a couple more autos so that my time they are this big these ones will be done and then I can give that photo period extra time to veg so Jen's a pretty serious training on it as you can see I'll see bahala see how she looks when these are almost done well now if I do that then I can't plant autos so I got I got to decide soon upon the plateaus or not I can just plant them I guess what they don't and just give that thing extra time to bed just for the hell of it good to heavens anyway so there we go that's the update she's starting to put on a little bit of sugar on the leaves as you can see there that's the grill of glue afroditi says she's not fully flowering yet so she does have little ways to go and then New York State Diesel back there you can also see the New York City Diesel especially since it was trying to recover the light was too intense for her you can see yeah not leaf right that's those things are just too much intense I moved over to the corner more this kind of stuff my wife doesn't you know fully know how to do yet is you know thinking about stuff on the fly like when stuff happens and so I've been trying to get in here but my health makes it very difficult well yeah so alright cool alright cool so that was update let's go and look at some cool stuff here I want to talk about with the plants and things to watch out for some little you know tips that you can look out for when you're growing let me see I'm gonna go ahead and turn off the sound when I play this that way so here here's the update here and I want to show you guys I think there's a part here loosing bias this is under the perfect son max yield right now we just have one light on this whole time also keep in mind this is without co2 once again because I haven't been able to get down and actually fill the tank up yet but you know as you can see honestly so there's the blue gene this I want to show you that's probably the best shot I'm gonna get right there so here's the blue dream now you can see that she's recover nicely this is all the new growth and so under my light the lights so intense that's really gonna show you like the difference between new growth and an older growth you see how much brighter green the new growth is this is this as normal you know you can see some new growth here too that's fine so don't worry about it but yeah you can see that so look how much she's recovered already look how much more bushes she as you can see these these branches already starting to grow out wider and taller and I'm gonna keep on training these three branches and these three branches to grow this way horizontally like this way this way so I gotta come back here we got to put some cutting to do is tie some bamboo sticks or put some holes is he on we're in fabric pots so we'll put some holes here on the sides of the pots and then had the bamboo sticks going through like that and then we'll tie down the branches to the bamboo sticks as it grows I'll show you guys a diagram what I'm talking about here in just a second so that will be cool anyway so that's what we're under the blue dream and I was debating whether or not I should start more on flowers and then let her really veg out even longer since I'm doing such intense training to her but then I was like well I don't know what if then what if she veg is way too long it's way too big I gotta control you know so I think I'm doesn't go ahead and see what happens here with this so right now these are at day 56 you know and so I don't know we'll say at day 56 that means I probably whether you're looking now especially the afro DITA I don't think that Perdita is gonna finish and tell like man probably day 86 I'm thinking another Sami sick she might and then either twenty days she might be close to being done I think the New York City so I think that won't be a lot closer to being done in twenty days I'm something that she has another you know anywhere from twenty to thirty days longer I can veg out after that I have to fetch her for because these ones aren't gonna be finished yet and that I actually want to veg her a little bit longer after that cuz I want to give her the full length of they buy four to really try to Train her out to be you know as big as possible in there I just don't and also I probably should transplant her because right now she's still in a small pot so we have to transplant her into another pot I should play I do that to your very soon and we'll put over here on this side right now she's just had this little corner this whole time so I think it's time to move over here under her own light and put her in a bigger pot and let her start really taking off because she's recovered now about ten days after this hard training and she she's recovered she's growing nicely she's grew a lot within that ten days you see help me like little leave she had in the other video look how many believe she has now so yeah it's scary I know like even my wife was like oh my god he killed the plant but I've done this before so you just the first couple times you do it is kind of freaky when he do that kind of intense training because you like took almost all the branches off and all the leaves off and you're like always she kind of recover from this and she does look at she's fine so yeah anyway so let's go ahead and look at some other stuff here some tips and I want to show you guys how we're gonna train that plan out further I also I'm gonna be starting another grill inside the bedroom so with with some vegetables by adding my throw like one CBD Otto flower in there because CBD actually the CBD strains have really been helping her so she can smoke more regular weed without having the you know the paranoia or the panic the kind of panic attacks that come with it when you smoke too much THC not everyone is affected by that but she is so the kind of like half and half the one to one ratio stuff where you have let's say a percent CBD and eight percent THC if she smokes some of that before she smokes regular strong stuff that really helps so we're and we're going to grow some of our own so I got a nice CBD strain I'll be good I'll be showing you guys and that's an as it'd be it'd just be a bedroom Burrow so it's starting to cool off so I think it won't be too hard to keep it cool in there we're gonna be do that in a glide the Goliath of v2 and just in case because then I know like I think if I run out of room in there like last time I don't use a light move or something so the by a few - lets the plants get really close within like a foot away from the light without burning them so I think I'm going to grow a pepper plant or two as well and then maybe some lettuce or something so we'll see and it's a much easier for me to get in it to get in that bedroom and go all the way out on the garage so I should be able to go in there on a more regular basis and do little video updates for you guys alright so here well I want to show you guys after d-day up close see this right here I've talked about this before but for those that haven't watched all my backlog videos I'll talk about this right here again you see the edge the teeth of the leaves how they're pointy you have a really sharp and then they start curling up like this there's a couple things that can cause that the most common is gonna be light stress or heat stress in this case I know it's not too hot in the room and so she's just not handling the light very much so she was pretty close to light I think they're I think they're actually a little bit closer she's a little bit closer I think than two feet away I think she was about eighteen inches away she obviously doesn't like that so this was a good thing so afroditi if you want to plant that you know like gorilla glue where they don't need as much light then this is a good plant for that so I can tell I've heard EDA is not a it's not a heavy light plant and so I should move her over and so if I if I would have been in there every day this would have been done before these leaves got this curled up but this is the you know they can handle this kind of stress right here this isn't really gonna harm any thing actually sometimes I like to push them this far maybe not this far but almost this far because it's gonna really help them pack on the density and weight I always like to try to get the light as close as possible without like stressing them too much but a little bit stress is fine so I'll probably do with this one is just have her move it out a little bit like about four inches toward the corner you know so right now it's more toward the center of light just move it out toward the corner more and then she'll be fine another thing that could cause this would be like something like magnesium deficiency or something but she doesn't have that she's fine and so she's still kind of early in her flowering stage just she's just barely in her beginning flower stage look at this she says that the other ones are definitely more ahead of her so yeah I thought that she was a very fast plant but keep in mind if you get a Perdita I don't know this might just be this particular female if you get afroditi it might it might be an 80-day plant 85 day plant because she definitely takes her time so there's the blue gym again the blue gym is the photo period there's there's the where I cut it off right here the whole top took all that off I left you know these branches these branches and those branches down there sink I left three nodes you can look how much leaves they've grown since last time pretty crazy yeah she's ready to probably be transplanted now and in the next couple days will definite answers now it's now technically like two days later so this was on November well I have the dates written down hold on there we go so November 2nd was day 56 now two of them the New York City diesel and the grill glue actually three days ahead might has been talking about these dates because I I messed up somewhere on the dates anyway so and I think it's I think they're more closer to this but whatever it's fine so that was November 2nd which is this last video the first video I showed you but when I was trying to burn out my sari I was kind of confused there the first video I showed you where I did the training when I'll show you how I cut it and stuff and train the branches down tied the branches down that was way back in October my third one they were 42 46 days old now right now it's November 4th so just so you know what you know this was I'm basically showing you a video this video right now you're looking at was taken two days ago so or two days from this day if you watch it November 4th ok so anyway but yeah so you can see how much further along the Gorilla Glue is Gorilla Glue by fast buds usually finishes a day about 65 68 deathly should be finished by day 70 so I'm thinking that this will be the first one to come out so she's a fast fast finishing plant and she doesn't usually care for much light but look it she's actually decently close to light is actually unfortunate though that they weren't watered correctly so you can see she actually suffered a little bit here with some uptake probably calcium uptake where she sees little hole like little looks like little burn leaves or burn holes in the leaves but for the most part she's fine you can see it's hard to kind of see what this lighting but you can see look she's starting to pack some sugar on these leaves here you can see all these see all those little nice sugar spots so yeah she looks like she's gonna be nice once she starts really packing on that weight you know right now like like that you know once the buds start looking like this I start stacking up this is when they really start packing on the weight she was in New York City so you can see that the hair is all nice and white and fluffy still but within the next 20 days she's gonna really start swelling up and she might actually be done in 20 days so I think that the gorilla glue will probably be done right now it's day 56 let's say so I'm thinking by yeah 50 60 not far not far away less than 20 days in for her I think we'll see and then New York City Diesel she might go to day 76 so she applied she might have another 20 days from the day that I told you how old these are not necessarily from how long you've watched his video but time you watch this video that might be long done you might be watching this video in 2022 or something who knows but yes so there you go cool you can see kinda how far away the light is right there the New York City Diesel I think is the closest to the light right now that's why I moved her over to the corner more so she's not under the center of the light she's more toward the corner of the light and yeah so but she's doing really good I think I might rearrange them though might raise the light a little bit and rearrange the plants this one the blue James gonna go over here under its own light I think I'm gonna move to maybe move the New York City some more toward the center this one I can't keep up more over here on the edge because she doesn't need that much light and then Gorilla Glue doesn t much light either I think I'm gonna move these more to the edge and have the New York City so kind of occupy the center more of the light and raise the light just a little bit so she's not so close to the center of it yeah so I'd be good so I'm raising about two feet above her which is good about 24 inches so all right cool so that's it guys thanks for watching hope you guys enjoyed the video I thought it had something else I wanted to talk about but I don't think I do yeah I can't think of anything else right now if you have any questions though about growing all that kind of stuff definitely go ahead and leave comments in the video I appreciate that and if you guys want to what lights I grow up I put that in the beginning of the video which is perfect son LED calm the link is also in the description go check those lights out as of right now what as of right now when to make the day that this video came out I have in stock the dwarf stars the minis let's see here what else I believe the Goliath the glide v2s are going to be ready any day now so yeah the Goliath fetus and also I'll have more max yields really any day now as well so stay tuned for that so those two big lights the mega I don't know when those will be back in stock again I'm not only worried about that right now I'm really just trying to focus on the glide fee too and see you you know because a lot of people been asking for that kind of design so we'll see how that does for a little while and then I'll then I'll bring back the mega maybe but for now that's filling in that that particular portion but yeah anyway so that that's the update for the lights and yeah definitely go check them out like I said the glide fee too should be in stock any or be ready any day now to ship again that's the same thing as saying be in stock and then max yield maybe about another I'm hoping within a week that they'll be ready to ship to alright double peace thanks for watching", "T7WmpxVhjfw": "dragged it to the point where Oh lavender buds best today so lavender buds are mainly draw them mainly grown in the Canary Islands and northern Africa now of course since their popularity has grown throughout the world throughout the entire Pluto sphere whatever we're gonna call this planet it has been grown in different places now I actually have some lavender plant growing outside in the front yard because my wife has a green thumb and me perceive a brown thumb not because I wipe my I do wipe my butter laughs but it's not okay this is just weird so I actually want to start this on off backwards so I'm gonna start off with two side effects that I found out and then we'll go into the benefits and then you can weigh it out there that way if you don't make your way to the end of this video you know at least you know a little something-something apparently you only watch about two minutes of our videos anyway so let's make this happen so okay number one is that it has been known to grow breast tissue and prepubescent boys because this is a part of to it mimics estrogen so in hormonal or pregnant women lavender buds like drinking it and apply it to your skin like especially in the central hole form can mimic estrogen causing some type of issues whatever estrogen does to pregnant women I have no clue and then my wife's pregnant and that's the extent of what I know about pregnancies but it does you know Carlos that issue in previous and boys and adult pregnant women with mimics estrogen so if for any chance you've been wondering why are your little boy or your wife or yourself has been a little differently now lately because you know SOI also mimics estrogen too so that's the thing I eat a lot of soy but man it's okay all right so we're gonna start now with the positives so lavender tea does a great job of helping with your sleep if you have irregular sleep patterns or you're having a hard time sleeping throughout the entire night I guess that would be a regular sleep pattern okay yeah so if you have like something's wrong with just sleep we take some lavender actually calm me down I also you take the essential oil employment remote essential oil diffuser does a great job of calming you down as well my plan with Chris has given birth was to have the essential oil diffuser on deck with a mix of frankincense and lavender essential oil to put it into a nice calm and tranquil state so while she's pushing out this fat hit ass baby that's gonna have a mix of my head and her head which is huge her heads a huge it's my she's in a more relaxed state so I want the baby to come into the world very relaxed just like the mother so that's the plan for that but yeah so lavender oil does a great job relaxing you and stuff help you sleep okay so when you take it in t-phone it could also go about with adjusted issues if you're vomiting throwing up or you have like a lot of diarrhea it does a great UPS even soothing that little area in there so if that's something you're struggling with if you're watching this video right now I want to tal it dropping off massive kids to the pool you may want to consider investing in some lavender but celebrity is cool but I'm not really a big fan of teabags giggity just because I don't want my tea all crushed up I prefer like the whole like everything so I'm with the whole leaf and with the whole but I want the whole flower whatever in my tea so that when I put it side put it inside of my tattoo but it's like nice and pretty nice so one thing I like to use it for is when I make I make like a spray like this like a cream and sunblock is welder does a great job of blocking out like SP s from the Sun or no mask F UV rays from the Sun as a high SPF and also bugs it stops like bug bites of stuff so lavender is a great to have healing of minor cuts and burns and those like irritations from mosquito bites and stuff so yes you know you have a kid or you're a person that goes outside a lot and you have bug bites maybe try like an oil or spray or something like the midnight rose actually that's a lot rosin violet violet moon it's a spray out all right it also does a great job if I stop in hair loss because some of the issues you have with hair loss is fungus so it can actually destroy these cell membranes of the fungus membrane from what the doctors say like I'm not a doctor this is what they say in their little journals and stuff then it can actually destroy the membrane in fungus quick story so I met this homeless guy and he had like a lot of hair like a lot a lot of hair and he ended up having to get all of his hair cut off right because he had a fungus growing influence he had a fungus growing in his hair so they had to cut all his hair off and every time I saw him he had it's this huge bald spot right some of this hair would kind of go back but he was never able to grow back to limp it was like it really long locks but he had a whole fungus growing make my skin scroll thinking about it but yeah so it does a great job of all protecting its hair loss oh okay still itching about the last one but okay so this is actually gonna be last one it talks about relaxation but we kind of hit on that before about the whole crispy and pregnant pushing up my fat hit baby thing but yeah if you've ever wondered like why are you going to certain places smells so relaxing and so economy it's from the aromas in the air and one of those aromas usually is a lavender because it does a great our just put you into a nice tranquil and relaxed state so I recommend if you don't have any to invest in like a essential oil diffuser they're all the rage these days and get some lavender oil drops and just relax your stress do some of that if you want to get just the buds itself you can do that and put it into a tea and drink it up and that's good too but just remember the two side effects from earlier that I've talked about about little titties growing on people that some boys and the estrogen amount that goes into pregnant women yeah so if you found any of that interesting or beneficial please like comment and subscribe to this

place so yeah I put some bamboo stakes no little [ __ ] velcro things there keep everything sleeved up real nice oh yeah I'm gonna let these go about another 10 days today 62 or cage 63 a full 9 weeks and then I'll be cutting them down so I got a couple quick lift and [ __ ] and the peanutbutter breath number two [Music] slur Canaan cross number four right here this one is a pretty good yield er it

amazing with their Community Guidelines so please if you're under the age of 18 please don't watch this but if you're over the age 18 you're cool now as always before we get bored let's jump into this week's episode hey guys what's up can a girl 8:07 here for this week's episode I hope these guys are all doing absolutely amazing this week we're gonna be looking at something a little bit different here it's just mainly an update but I did want to show you guys this cool little piece of equipment that I did add to it I did find out on Amazon the link is in the description below it is my ink bird humidity and temperature sensor so what this does is it constantly monitors the temperature and humidity inside the tent it's got a sensor at the top and this little guy here and then that little string that I showed you at the beginning that's another sensor so it helps me keep track of my humidity and temperature make sure that it's sitting at proper marks and as you can see here the girls love it when I go onto my phone it tracks everything for me all day all night so I can see if there's any spikes or anywhere that I messed up to diagnose a humidity or temperature control issue before I start going straight to either newts or pH so work so pretty good now if you guys want to pick up one of those the link is in the description below feel free to go grab one of those I think that wing is like $45 the one thing I will say though is just do your research if you want that brand go ahead and grab it just because it's quick if you're looking for something else that's a little bit more advanced has a little bit more easier interface by all means spend some little money but for me it works for now it gives me my graph I need I can check it when I need the ability to be able to hook it up to Wi-Fi and be able to check it on the goal would be nice but for right now it works out for me so that's all I need but let's continue on with this week's episodes guys thank you so much for checking it out like I said this is gonna be a quick update this week so if you have any questions make sure to put them in the comments down below I love conversating is that the order to call mercy King talking with these guys down in the comments below everybody over on the we tube as well to how these guys do and I see you over there as well - it's so nice to have you guys out as well basically we're gonna be basically following this why twiddle for the most part here because out of all the girls so far this is the most interesting this autos absolutely exploding we're going to take a look at her throughout the entire week here of growth as well as the other girls but we're mainly focusing on our white widow auto right now you can see this is the beginning of day eight and they're just loving the spider farmer light here they're stretching up towards it like I said guys if you are interested in that SF 1000 or any spider farmer product there is a link in the description below spider farmer is helping us out this season I do have a new one on its way depending on wing allows that to happen but aside from that let's jump into day nine now [Music] now I did give these girls a few waters this week like I said I have slowly been getting towards the outside of the edge and you will notice that when I do do the outside edges and every time I do water and we see these time lapses you can just see big vigorous growth on this white widow and it's so exciting to see exactly what it looks like when I come home from work every day it's like this is one day's worth of growth compared to how it looked the other day how small those nodes were and now they're just almost half halfway up the other set of leaves on the side they're like it's it's completely crazy you can see she's already popping pistols so it is it is going to be starting to flower here in another week week and a half or so we should be starting pre flower and I am so happy that we are 5 times bigger on this white widow than we were last season if you haven't seen last season I will leave a description in the bowl link description a link in the description below there we go on what our white widow Otto looked like last season and full grown it kind of looked like how these little girls look like right now but for us here going into day 11 because the 10 was a Friday and Fridays are crazy in the restaurant because everybody's hungry during Corona so I didn't get any footage on day 10 but for day 11 these girls are doing absolutely amazing and yeah I I can't really say too too much this week guys because it was really easy this week all I did was water and film and just watch them grow like I said the bubba kush and sweet cheese they grew but they're kind of doing their own thing they're going at their own pace that are not autos or anything but they're doing their own thing slowly here so that's kind of where I'm leaving them right now eventually we will be low stress training them we will hopefully like I said we'll be able to do some fun stuff with them but going into day 12 like I said I'm giving them another water slowly increasing that circle around the plant to help those roots slowly branch out so that way we don't get any group lock or the roots don't get found in the plant and as you can see on day 13 after that water I just love these time lapses of the white widow you can see just the amount of vigorous growth here going into day 14 with this girl now that they got an extra water just how just how fast she's growing compared to the other ones I'm so happy that we were able to get all this set up in time thank you guys for letting me continue to grow if you guys love these videos if you're loving the season so far let me know in the

trike up a little bit before I showed them and they are triking up today is the day wanted to see the fuzziness on those leaves these are only into like week four I think I they're about halfway done and they're starting to bulk now a little bit too [Music] which I'm excited about so they're bulking up you can see um the density through there you can see the amount of light we can compare this in a few days we'll look and see how much more dense it is through there as of right now you can still see light through the bud so that's an interesting way to compare it [Music] [Music] blueberry from DJ short from Dutch passion seed company show you my setup here got [Music] high-pressure sodium a metal halide and then another high pressure sodium 3000 Watts got five plants in soil you can tell by the thickness on the stalks the ones the one in the very middle is doing really good and even though this doesn't have a thick stalk the one with the double stock right here is doing really good to also actually these free plants they're doing well the two with the thinner stalks not as well they're down there on the end they're not going as good but um they'll produce a little something so we'll keep our eye on them I'm not running co2 right now either I guess I should probably that's my co2 system back there I should probably hook that up and get it running now that I'm in budding - could really blow these things up and get some weight off of them man maybe I'll do that today maybe I'll work on my co2 system anyway thanks for watching my videos I hope you enjoy this HD footage

again for tuning in to another episode of this week's drop sugar gets a fresh delivery of flour every week and I'm super excited to be sharing my favorite streams with you this week I am highlighting none other than humble exotics truffle butter it is a hybrid and it's testing at 20 0.78% let into like the batch number and everything in a little bit but let's talk about their packaging I hate it I'm never a fan of like mylar bags they're always like I don't know I don't like them a big reason I don't like them is when I open this bag of weed my weed was crushed it was flat it was kind of sad another reason I hate this packaging is because this like stupid child fruits thing it's so hard to open I'm 25 and I feel like I'm 5 trying to open this thing a lot of the times I give up and just get scissors and like cut it open I like don't understand how like people with arthritis or like older patients are supposed to open this cuz it's so hard it's a pain aside from the packaging the flour which let's let me raise the packaging first I am giving this packaging a 3 out of 10 not not happy also they didn't put a bow betta inside which I'm not happy about either but they're lucky because they're flower is really beautiful the smell not super potent it's like a little pie me a little citrusy I smell like some like orange orange notes in there it kind of smells like slightly like a og it is hybrid so but the flower itself is super frosty for me find a decent sized mug for you guys and show you a little closer up also the nuts weren't that big I mean they're not small but they're not tiny it's really really frosty flower though so I'll give them that I'm going to rate the nugs out of a 10 I'll give them a 6 it's not bad I was really sad that how like flattened it was and everything me breaks them down for you guys put it in my handy-dandy bubbler shout out to Marley Naturals anyone else we looking for some glass sponsorships out there so little sob shoot your girl a message I would love to have a new piece on here daily high club there's a lot of a lot of bongs out there that I want to try hook your girl up let me break them down for you now that I've been like smoking the flower for a week prior to reviewing it it helps a lot I smoked this and now joint and I smoked it in a blunt and in a babe and in a bubbler in my bong I really enjoyed it in the vaporizer the most you got though like really those orange notes really came out on the babe let me take a hit for you guys and tell you exactly what I'm tasting it's not it's not super smooth but it's not harsh it kind of tastes like an OG like I said I really enjoyed smoking this in my vaporizer I have a Arizer and it's like one of those hose like desktop vaporizers and you really got the like citrusy notes in it much much better than just smoking get out of a bubbler but overall I'll get the smoke out of a 10 I would say it's at a 6 a 7 I'm gonna give this overall flower a rating of 7 out of 10 it's a 7 out of 10 for sure like I said the flower itself is really beautiful I wish they would use like a glass jar to preserve the nugs a little better and it wouldn't get so like destroyed and like ground up inside the bag but you know you win some you lose some Packaging is expensive so appreciate those class stars you see out there because that is not cheap for the vendors to be putting it in that but like they said I would definitely recommend smoking this in a vaporizer because you'll get the full the notes the you'll get the full effect way better that was my favorite way to enjoy this strain also it's said it was testing at 20.78 but you know like I said it wasn't that strong it's a hybrid too so it's gonna be more it aired more towards the the indica side for me but it was definitely enough to keep me energized and like have fun with friends and like go out and watch a movie and for that reason like I said I would definitely recommend truffle butter I definitely have smoked it again but the next time when I get it I'll put it in a glass jar and put it with a bo beta and maybe that'll make a big difference thanks again for tuning in guys be sure to tune in next week where I would be reviewing cerebro's grow greasemonkey I'm excited for that one thanks guys oh don't forget to follow us on Facebook and Instagram please you'll be able to see all my reviews and also all of our other channels bye guys", "LN2h2sWH-J8": "you look like a big blob look at you [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] today i am out here in our raspberry patch pruning all the raspberries it's that time of year early spring when i like to prune all of the old flowering canes from last year so i can just get a lot of airflow in here and make room for the new vegetative canes or primocanes to come up for the next year i'm just cutting away all of these old canes these are what flowered last year and produced the fruit they won't ever produce fruit again raspberries only fruit on second year old canes so these will just only hinder the plant and not allow them to fully thrive and get all the sunlight that they need and they also can harbor a lot of diseases now all these canes that i'm leaving behind these were last year's vegetative growth or primocanes and this year they are going to produce fruit and then die and the cycle will repeat itself one other thing i like to do as well when i'm pruning my raspberries is i always cut away any of the canes that are shorter than my knee height those canes are just not going to really be that vigorous or produce that much fruit and the fruit is going to be further down in the canopy when summer comes and they'll be harder to find raspberries are super super easy to grow they're probably the first like fruit crop i would recommend to start if you're wanting to grow any type of berry they produce like i said in their second year so the plants you would most likely buy at a nursery those plants won't produce fruit that first year you plant them but they will the next year and then subsequently they will keep replacing the old fruiting cane so you have a harvest every single year as long as you give them the right location enough water and the proper nutrients they should do just fine spring here i'm going to check out the bees today and uh i think they made it through the winter i already see a little bit of activity i see a little i'd be flying around here [Music] [Music] all this old straw and hay and make sure they're poop we're gonna let this compost make it like almost like a vegetable compost this is mainly straw but it does have some of their good poop in there like i said where's just so much of this stuff so these garden beds here we put these in last spring or and end of summer i guess you would say actually used to be all of that pile there this is like a little all these trees little mini forest here but we have uh three of these 50 foot long beds this is like a shorter almost about a 25 and then we have a couple beds here and then a few beds back there all of these ones have garlics there's about maybe [Music] 600 to a thousand garlics we're going to have so many garlics we'll be good the vampires won't get us so but yeah this year we're going to add a couple more beds down here and then we're getting i think about another 20 or 30 blueberry plants we're gonna expand our berry orchard um over there as well kind of intermingled with the garden [Music] aside from doing the gardening in the early springtime we like to come out into the forest once all the snow is melted and start looking for antlers [Music] looking for antlers is a challenge but it's really fun when you find them we've always find them every season but it's hard like you know there's so many sticks on the ground there's so many things that kind of deceive you so you really have to have a good eye for it but at least we're out it's warm it's been warm the last few days and it's nice being back in the forest again with no snow [Music] do [Music] all right i don't know [Music] [Music] here's a little update on what's going on in the grow room i have all of my broccoli cabbage family vegetables growing right here they got a little bit leggy so i needed to add an extra light we have the celery and the onion these are only about a month old and these like i said in other videos grow very very slowly so this is only what one month of growth looks like for them and in the back here i have tons and tons of just different types of lettuces romaines loose leaf they're all heirloom seeds this setup i've shown so many times and really recommend having something like this but you really don't need to if you have a really sunny southern exposure window that can work really really well i grow so many seeds because we grow try to grow enough to eat throughout the next year and the winter so i need something bigger than just a small window in the house but if you're just growing as a hobby or just a few plants here and there you can just do it on a windowsill um i always start a little bit earlier than what is recommended on the seed catalogs usually by like a week or two it just seems like it it just seems like i kind of get an earlier harvest and i've kind of timed it now where i know kind of the right time to plant and when it's not too early or not too late so i get those really vigorous starts when the time comes to plant them another thing we're going to mention is thinning your plants these just came up maybe about a few days ago and i'm just letting them all grow i planted more than just one seed per cell so i can kind of choose the best most vigorous start i'll pick out the little ones that i just don't like i've already done that to the celery so i have about one or maybe two celeries per cell i had about three to four initially and then just thin to the strongest most vigorous one so that's something you want to do because a lot of the time you'll get seeds that are just not that good when you're planting you're just putting them in there and sometimes they're not the most vigorous so you can just kind of tell by the way they look how fast they're growing and so on so something to keep in mind and then today we've been planting even more seeds we've just been going seed crazy i planted all of my leeks a lot of brussels sprouts we love brussels sprouts probably our favorite vegetable in the garden some chinese cabbage more cauliflower and more broccoli", "XY8vQjgWqV8": "ladies and gentlemen the world-famous deejay short Daniel John DJ for short naked chicken the old genetics master himself it is an honor and a privilege I said I'm from cannabis culture I'm from pot TV I'm all the way here from Vancouver the first thing he said was oh hi to mark and and Jody and David Levine David Melville Levine and Chris Bennett and everybody up there keep up the good work I'm sure you as one of the absolute masters and legends in the game you've got to be really busy I mean these are exciting times it's been come a long journey well woody [ __ ] man what do you think well I'll just say this the best is yet to come from you as well is that even possible yeah I know it is it's it's can you do better absolutely after the land race we have people in places like Oaxaca and Thailand and Afghanistan and Morocco Nepal they got us beat by thousands of years man but they're more into the extract to hash and so I think that's what I want to focus on here moving into the future as well it is crazy that we're here with you right now it's an honor and a privilege but really it's these crazy buds you got going on here just the whole vibe of this place it's such a such a cool experience I mean the communities come together and as a whole from grassroots right on up is this you how many years of people come to the cup this one a good question five or six somewhere around there I've been going to others as well and other things here in Northern California ten years down here in NorCal what do you think of how does this event compared to not only previous year's here but in general no this event is the pinnacle there there's nothing like this 800 entries all outdoor all organic I hear people bragging about coming in 63rd at the Emerald cup I talk about 63rd at the other Cup it's like hey hats off man congratulations top 8% of me that's not matter no no exactly but and up to this point in time the Emerald cup is the standard the bar by which all other I think events are set this is the competition well we do a pretty good 420 up in Vancouver as well to that we have a lot of fun at but when it comes down to this is a festival and a fair and a copy yeah and then when you throw in a competition with 800 entries we got the Karma Cup which is one of the more respected cups in Canada at the moment here and a 160 entries or something like here all outdoor all organic all right like there's let's let's like that's something to be celebrated that's craft cannabis at its finest let that in yup yup exactly you can't die you can't do that try and be the Machine and do it to the level where you know you got the true order - you've got legendary [ __ ] hands on small batch just with made with more love than anything else yup and there's room for for all of us in that capacity I think the demands only gonna skyrocket you must be in demand right now yeah to a degree I'm hesitant I'm being a bit reticent taking my time just because you know I've been at this for a long time I'm old school and I don't want to move too far too fast and there's time it slow motion er that are in a hurry right now are gonna be making mistakes there are a lot of people that will be losing out as a result so that the big news actually got big news was this last year in eastern Washington outdoor grows well they were selling last year's bulk it's not does that bag appeals got 20% cannabinoid and it's down to 37 cents of gram so that's a game-changer that's a game-changer sorry it's almost took off there right now the price point will stabilize they think it around a dollar a gram we're talking but and the growers will do fine at that providing they're allowed to one to two acres but we have 40 acre grows now Dana Larson says you can't compete with a combine you can't beat a tractor no matter how many trimmers you go no and you can't compete with the Sun yeah also it's all good and you have a tough time compete with DJ short but I want to know what's next for you can you give us a little sneak peek what do you got on the on the horizon if anything I'm just spending time in Michigan right now my fiance is there so I'm just doing kind of a domestic family thing hanging out doing my work there like I said the best is yet to come we have a number of things that are that will be sprouted up and coming and we're just looking to see what's in there doing the hunt we will be watching from all the way up in Vancouver and people around the world - for more information how do they keep up with you old world genetics right there and that is the website as well Oh world genetics dot-com and Instagram as well I have other people working that for me so it takes a little time for you know information to get to me it but it is what it is and I'm loving it it's great well I appreciate I'm gonna let you get back to it this is fantastic honestly real pleasure thank you very much we're here at the Emerald cup 2016 DJ Shore check them out old-world genetics cannabis life Network Greg axe [Music]"}
