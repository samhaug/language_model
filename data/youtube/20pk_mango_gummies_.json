wheat's the marijuana review show where we help you wonderful fine folks make sense of that crazy maybe now remote place you call your dispensary uh we're out here in beautiful sunny long beach today trying to stay as healthy as we can out here in the pandemic world don't worry i've got my mask on me um but we're gonna do even with this pandemic raging one of our favorite patented wheats reviews and today we are taking a look at a company that's quite big uh one that i don't think i have reviewed anything uh from yet but one that i'm very excited very much looking forward to giving a try and that is one of the many weed companies with the name canna that's right this is canna cannabis infused gummies k-a-n-h-a not the c or k-a-n-e-h of canaco or c-a-c-a-n-n-a of many other cannabrands all these are their 100 milligram gummies pretty standard issue um they are 10 10 milligram gummies so instead of the uh 20 doses you get the 10 in here which i normally prefer indica mango flavored and uh from my experiences with canna their gummies are usually pretty tasty too uh their gummies are quite affordable they're usually a little bit cheaper than uh like the plus gummies or steezy they come in usually a couple dollars cheaper i think i picked these up for 13 at a dispensary in long beach about two dollars cheaper than most gummies that i see in this area um and that indica mango gummy taste sounds really exciting so i'm going to try to open this up with one hand here and we'll get this review started like all of our wheats reviews uh guys the way that they're going to work is i'm going to eat this whole product not necessarily all in front of you on the camera here but i will eat all 10 of these gummies this is gonna be a little bit uh rocking here excuse me you just look at me this way for a moment hello child proof packaging there we are oh wow i could smell them the second that bag opened not the weed smell no weed smell just that that is very very very mangoey uh smelling wow that is a crazy mango scent uh here are the gummies themselves these aren't cubes like a lot of the gummies are these are little pucks very very sugary pucks that's a lot of sugar on it uh so let's give it a taste no weed odor but a crazy amount of mango scent my dog's pretty tired here i'm playing some frisbee oh wow yeah a little bit of um weed taste there at the end but early uh in our taste experience it's nothing but overwhelmingly sweet candy mango flavor uh but i mean that in a good way these are pretty good they go right down uh they're just coated in that mango sugar um so yeah in terms of flavor um no problems with the cannaba cannabis cannabis canna cannabis infused indica mango gummies um real good especially for that 13 price point but the taste is the smallest most insignificant part of the uh edible review uh the most important the signature thing about all edible reviews is it is it gonna get you high and for that you're gonna have to wait just a bit me i'm gonna polish these off over the next i said about hours so and then uh about two hours after i have that last one i'll come right back here and let you guys know if these can of gummies are as good as we hope until then stay safe stay high stay [Music] healthy hello folks i am back it has been two hours since my last can of gummy and the question is can of these make you high uh and the answer is yes they definitely can um these are pretty good uh i think their quality is maybe just slightly under that of like a plus or a steezy or something in that range uh but they are a little bit cheaper and they um hit almost just as hard tastes pretty good um all in all the canna is pretty pretty good uh value so if you see the canna and they're a little bit cheaper than some of the other gummies give them a shot unless you have a really big preference for one of the other brands as long as these ones are a little bit cheaper uh i i think they're going to uh you know this slightly less uh [ __ ] i should just start over holy [ __ ] i'm sorry to me i guess and welcome back to weeds guys it has been about two hours since my last canna cannabis infused indica mango gummy uh and i am very happy to say that uh my joyful journey uh was [ __ ] hello everyone welcome back it has been about two hours since my last canna indica mango gummy uh and my journey was as joyful as advertised uh these are pretty dang good um they are i would say just beneath the top sort of tier uh edible gummies out there uh they are cheaper i've seen these as i said at the beginning of the review routinely uh two or three bucks cheaper than their competitors um i would say they are not quite as good as again those like plus or steezy kind of gummies but they're so close and that price is is is a you know a nice enough discount that the trade-off may certainly be worth it for you um so uh yeah very happy with the can uh canna cannabis and views indica mango gummies uh really like that lion guy he's pretty cool looking um i also uh just now noticed that they are the winner of the most accurate accurately formulated edible by the sas the prestigious sas wow man uh i wish i had known that they were the most accurately formulated editable uh as awarded by the sas beforehand um because i would have you know done nothing different with that information uh speaking of doing nothing additional with any information let me share with you a little cherry on top little something extra that you can enjoy with or without your weed uh both of these though i would say uh probably gonna be a little bit enhanced with weed it's a two for one today uh i'm gonna uh give you the cherry on top of a two for one video game both from the same uh studio which is i believe annapurna the movie studio but they also make video games they had two that came out last year that are both great i think they are both available on ios and switch i played them on switch uh they are called donut county which is sort of like the inverse of a katamari dimashi where you uh met you start as a whole and you make stuff fall into a hole and then the hole gets bigger and then you can have bigger stuff fall into the hole which makes the hole even bigger so that even bigger things can fall into it it's amazing donut county the other one is called sayonara wild hearts very dumb name uh i mean it's kind of a cool name but it's also kind of embarrassing to say sayonara wild hearts out loud uh but it is uh sort of it embraces the cheesiness of that name in the game itself it's kind of impossible to describe both of these games take about 90 minutes to play um and uh they're both available super cheap check them out donut county and um sayonara wild hearts and maybe while you're checking those out try some cannabis canna cannabis infused indica mango gummies it may make them even fun more fun funner more funner until then stay safe stay healthy stay high and we'll see you guys for the next review bye", "2N127KGGYUY": "there's a little tingle a little tiny i was about to tell you how they weren't spicy at all hi welcome to this wednesday type of chili chun where we got a spicy snack this was sent by emily actually as part of a massive international gift box of snacks that i'll be pulling a couple other things from also over the next couple weeks but yeah these are from spain and this is like spicy gummy mangoes and i freaking love mangoes and i love gummy things especially the kind of fluffy gummy thing that this looks to be and this is a channel where we do spicy stuff i don't know if you knew so we're going to dive into the snack and so this is like very much in the vein of like haribo gummy bears and stuff just the hanging bag of gummy things is like well established in earth as a trope and this is like a pretty nice looking snack look at that big chunky mango pieces uh big bowl to print to let you know what you're getting into and i i don't i'm not going to read the ingredients of candy um you're going to find it depressing because it's just a bunch of chemicals because of candy so just accepting that as given we're going to go ahead and just dive into the snack oh dude as soon as i open the bag you get like a like a legit rush of like gummy mango smell and it smells like mangoes it also smells like fake candy which i'm i'm i mean i'm into it that's a really satisfying smell of like a candy shop if you look at the snack itself it's like a little little piece of foie gras that's what it looks like this little mini gummy foie gras which by the way if that exists i need to review it even if it's not spicy but yeah it's just it's just a little gummy turd it's kind of the fluffy type like the bun from a spongebob krabby patty rather than the meat and uh that's kind of my favorite i like the foamy fluffy gummies like this uh cheers youtube hmm [Applause] okay so uh it's really good it's not actually very sweet like it's pretty subtle for a gummy candy pretty subtle on the sweetness and the mango flavor isn't like super artificial tasting like it's artificial but it it doesn't like uh it's a little tingle a little tiny i was about to tell you how they weren't spicy at all but there's just a little tiniest little little pitter powder on my tongue of like little bitty spice monsters oh that's cool okay i could get behind that so it's a really nice refreshing gummy candy that's kind of fluffy it's got a nice texture it's a nice mango taste it tastes a bit fake but like not in a defensive way like i'm cool with fake flavor sometimes it's a banana pigment as gross um yeah it's it's like and then like way after you're done eating it you get like a little across your tongue of spice and that's pretty much it like it's very very very mild i'll put it at like sub one like a half maybe maybe maybe a one if you eat enough of them they're freaking good though yeah so um spaniard snacks in the wind column that's really good i really like it i guess this has a great taste it's not offensive it's not super sweet it's not super sour it just kind of soothes your your tongue a little bit it's real fluffy and mushy and it's not like chewy chewy chewy gummy it's like very soothing all throughout and even the burn is kind of soothing this is the kind of snack that i think actually would get better if you put it in the fridge i don't know why but i think that this cold would be an even more like soothing summer experience like on hot day that sounds really good and the spices is like just the cutest thing ever it's just like a little like a little the tiniest little breath of the smallest dragon in the universe it has a nice smell damn all right so uh emily hey thank you for sending the box of stuff appreciate it and uh b if you happen to see vidal the spicy gummy mangoes i highly recommend you pick this up if you're looking for like a spicy spicy snack it's not gonna do it for you it's not very spicy but it tastes awesome and it does have a little a little kick and that'll be just enough of a kick to where you don't have to share it with most people because most people see spice and they're like yeah i don't think so

"[Music] hi guys I'm Dan HOF key operating officer of honey stick as well as Gold Line CBD and in today's tutorial episode we are gonna be calling it CBD gummies for dummies why not because we're insulting anybody's intelligence but because we are gonna break down in a very simple fashion of exactly what the differences are between the different types of gummies available in the market one of the most common questions that we get to our Gold Line customer support is what I hear things like full-spectrum isolate coated infused gummies what's the difference what effect does that have on me and our CBD there's all these gummies out there and no real explanation on what the difference is they cost different they have milligrams so this episode is gonna break down the main categories and differences for gummies what does that mean for your CBD in a very simple to understand fashion and how does that affect your buying of your CBD your supplements whatever so basically we have a few major categories for CBD now a lot of the products you'll see out here if you're familiar Gold Line you will see from our website some of them are not offered on the website but they are prevalent in the market so I think it's important to have them out here so we can have a full discussion even outside of the things that our company is currently offering so you're properly educated on CBD so let's jump into it right away what are the major differences between gummies were the most common questions that I get is what is the difference between isolate gummies and full-spectrum gummies and it's really simple it's what type of CBD DEET is being used isolate gummies are generally made from biomass and it is synthesized off of different hemp products and the CBD is processed and extrapolated until it becomes basically a hundred percent pure a beedi and it's in almost a crystallized form and it's really easy to calculate it's very easy to make different solutions for your gummies it's a very good effective way to know how many milligrams you're gonna get and to make sure that there is absolutely zero THC within your gummies so for people who might necessarily get drug tested or not want to roll the dice on having even any traces of THC within their gummies or their CBD products that they're taking I select gummies are gonna be the way to go so when you're buying CBDs and you're asking your manufacturer like us questions then you would ask whether they have isolates or their full spectrum now what is full spectrum full spectrum is basically gonna have traces of THC however it's still gonna be below the legal limit which is 0.3% for hemp according to the US farm bill now that 0.3% is even below 1% so it is extremely small portion of THC however some people don't want any instead of being processed over the the full spectrum is actually taken from you know basically the live plants so generally when I select gummies are very high in CBD full spectrum and broad spectrum you know made based gummies that use that type of CBD they will have other things like CBN CBG CBC and different spectrums within the CBD category to give you a very complete form of all the different type of CBDs so let's say that you know full spectrum is more like a multivitamin if we're comparing the two different types of CBDs so our CBD is just specific you are getting your CBD and that's that so some people prefer the full and the broad spectrum for that reason and other people prefer the isolates because they don't want to roll the dice they just want to know exactly what they're getting and you are still getting the good effects the supplemental effects of CBD we won't go into what the different effects are people using gummies for different conditions or whatnot or CBD that's on you guys to research I'm not dr. Gupta I can give you medical advice or supplemental health advice but the differences are is full spectrum and isolate based the next large difference is is where the gummies are infused or whether they are coated some people use these terms not properly because they think that if it's infused with CBD that it is just CBD is on there so there's two ways of getting CBD within the gummies you can either coat them or you can actually infuse them to where it's like I like to compare to donut so I mean who doesn't love donuts coated gummy is like a glazed doughnut sort of flavoring and stuff it's put on the top and that's how those gummies are made is that they're made and they are basically sprayed or soaked with the CBD solutions and they get absorbed into the gummy and they're on the outside to infuse gummies they're more like a jelly doughnut to where the solution is on the inside the oil is on the inside and they've been either injected or it's been formulated into the actual compound of manufacturing the gelatin or the building block of the gummies so that is another key difference and between that people say were some of pluses and minuses pluses and minuses are as generally the ones that are coded on the outside those are generally less expensive so they're more budget-friendly however the ones are injected are usually a little bit more consistent so if you're buying a jar of 1500 milligram coated gummies some gummies might be a little bit stronger than the other depending on how they record or if they're touching the edges of the jar and some of the CBD mighta came off and beyond the jar so you might have to take one two more of the coded gummies - whereas some of them might be a little bit stronger so they kind of average out but if you're looking for super consistency then you want the infused got me the jelly donut because that is basically an exact amount that they put into the gummy so now with these examples let's go into you know what different types of gummies there are so outside of the full spectrum and isolate gummies and the coated and infused gummies now you have gummies in the categories of even flavoring so here we have our CBD Gold Line let's take a look at this half of the product line right here so here is basically our offering of CBD Gold Line now these are actually all isolate based gummies so these will have absolutely no traces of THC they have they have basically a total amount of milligrams that you will get per jar and we recommend that you take two to three gummies per serving so we have different textures for gummies our first one here is going to be our sour gummy which is going to be like I said these ones are an isolate based so they're gonna be the zero TAC you're gonna go ahead and open it here so these are gonna be like sour flavored gummies and they are coated with our Goldline CBD solution very clean job of openness let's get close-ups here you get several different colors and these are gonna be more sour and taste you're also gonna have a little outside sugar coating for a little bit of a little bit of extra flavor let's go ahead and take one out and get a real nice close-up if you're into the sour taste not just kind of a plain fruity taste this will definitely be up your Avenue and also sometimes the sour taste can offset any taste within to come with the CBD oils so even when you're dealing with full spectrum gummies and things like that if you have a sour bass gummy it can offset any type of you say I don't like the taste of natural CBD oil there's CBD solutions then a sour gummy might be or a sugar-coated gummy might be a good alternative for you to offset some of that taste so you get a more pleasant experience of Wired having your CBD then you have your natural gummy which is basically plain fruity flavor a lot of companies just in making gummies that aren't CBD infused make very similar gummies that your the taste will be familiar from any of the Albanese gummies and things that you can get from the supermarket except they have the added CBD and these have been coated not infused and they use isolates they have zero THC every once a while different isolate gummies have different solutions every once in a while you might get some type of you might think it's sugar it's crystal but actually the CBD isolates come in the form of CBD crystals so every once awhile it might not be uncommon to see crystals on the gummies it might not have gotten fully absorbed into the gummy or that might be on the outside when the CBDs are a hundred percent pure that they're like isolates it's not uncommon to see some crystals I don't see any on this gummy so everything was good but these are generally big fruity flavored gummies so they're there Jim a little bit more fluffy they have the fruity taste these aren't gonna be the sour gummies so let's go ahead and put this back and move along so on Goldline CBD we generally sell the gummies in two sizes we have a 12 ounce and an 8 ounce and also some smaller assortments generally it's you know more value driven to buy more but we have all the way down to I think 10 or 20 pack that you can buy or even a 5 pack that you can purchase on the website just a sample the gummy to see if you like it and then once you're a go we do all kinds of bundles and you can go up to 12 ounce which contains I think about a hundred and twenty gummies so here we did a limited run for the holiday season these are of our holiday gummies on top of being the large fluffier gummies and being you know of holiday colors which is a red white and green over here these are actually uh flavored also so they're gonna have the different a little bit more added fruity flavor into them so it is a little bit more of a premium gummy than your standard base gummy bears that uh that are used so it's gonna be a little bit of an upgrade but you're not gonna get any of the sour taste so you know what a lot of people and a lot of companies even outside of ours will do is they'll use different types of flavored gummies as their base so you can kind of know what gummy bears from going to the supermarket that you like or what type of tools you like when you're selecting your ideal CBD gummy and I hope it's a gold line but in the event that it's not look for that too when you're on the hunt for buying your gummies let's go a little close-up of these guys so you can see we have the red green and white give me a thumbs up that you got a good focus and other gummies so there you see we have the nicest Ortman they're a little bit fluffier in texture and they also have the added flavor infusion so you're gonna have a very flavorful experience with these holiday gummies and they're still available on our website I think for the whole month of January we continued producing them and once that goes away we'll probably still offer these gummies but they're not going to be holiday oriented maybe some Valentine's Day gummies so now moving right along to our full spectrum gummies these use a high quality of full spectrum oil and on top of that they are actually infused so they are injected into the gummy so each time you get a gummy these that we have here available in four flavors you're gonna get a very consistent 10 milligrams of CBD in each gummy now we used to offer a 25 milligram full spectrum going but a lot of people especially when it comes to full spectrum you can actually taste the CBD oil so taste a little bit more like a medical gummy so there's different things that you have to do to the gummy to offset the taste some people are really into it like the Colorado and California style gummies and that's kind of what it tastes like and some people would rather just have you know a flavorful experience as well so what we did was we realized is that instead of offering a 25 milligram gummy let's kick it down to a 10 so some of the oil taste is not as prevalent and we also have poor flavor so we flavor and fuse the gummies on top of it so let's go ahead and get a close-up of what's available here so we have cherry flavor fruit punch and also strawberry and an orange citrus I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to lay each one of these out here on the table so you can see they're actually fruit shaped and the different flavor is actually indicated by the different color these are really nice gummy very high qualities of very high quality full spectrum oil and they are also quality infused so you have very consistent flavoring taste and CBD oil quantity in between each one of these gummies and again like I said you can get them available in the four different flavors yeah so like we said these will actually be below the point three legal limit for according to the the hemp farm bill passed in 2018 so these are in accordance with that however they might have little traces of THC within the legal hemp limits but they're there is that there is that so people who don't want to roll the dice to get you know drug tested and things like that then generally you want to stick with the isolate based product because there is zero THC in there whatsoever those could be within the legal limits see would be fine and it's still very very small almost non-traceable but we do have to put that out there for you guys then there's also gummies that we're developing that are almost like gushers to where there are very soft and heavily infused with flavor so it's kind of like they melt in your mouth and then they have the the the flavor follows up afterwards and rolls them so it's different from kind of a chewable gummy this is this is an extremely soft chew if we could even classify that but I would say it to a gusher and we have them infused I just want to go ahead and show these because some companies I've seen are doing it we're gonna start offering it but we have not yet so these are in the shape of bear but they're extremely soft very fluffy and almost melts I even feel bad putting them putting them out here but they are and they are actually they're full-spectrum and they're infused we have some of these samples are 25 milligrams all the way down to 10 but you can see that these are more than fusion style soft to customized gummies tour these these gummy bases are actually custom made to really melt so these ones are gonna be more like a gusher and generally you can tell from how fluffy and how soft they look and if you get a real good close-up there you can you can see the difference between that and even a fluffy standard gummy you know so again those would be full-spectrum and infused and then for those people who are looking for positive hemp benefits possibly a multivitamin I've also seen we don't currently offer them but hemp will extract gummy chews that you can see here these actually have hemp oil they're CBD content isn't really confirmed but it does have 20 milligrams of a hemp extract and it's also infused with like a multivitamin tour it has like your vaults a mitten or a vitamin b-complex and also your vitamin C's and different vitamin E so if you're just looking for like a nutritional supplement and don't necessarily want CBD we don't offer it but these are starting to get really popular within the hemp community and something you probably will come across most of these because they also have the multivitamin they're not going to be coated they're gonna be infused so they are gonna be very consistent to take on a daily basis you won't each one is gonna be very consistent to the other and again sometimes with the coated stuff some of them might be a little bit strong and others but generally averaged out pretty good so in summary I hope that today's

few days before the protest began because of the murder of George Floyd and I didn't know when an appropriate time was to post this video because I clearly do not want to be insensitive to everything that's happening right now but like many of you I have been glued to my phone social media the news and also the last you know I guess how many days I've been I've been out and about at the protests in downtown LA and Hollywood as well and the other day I honestly needed a mental break after coming home from the protest it's been very emotional and powerful but I did need to just I ended up watching some Gordon Ramsay and then I watched him RuPaul so what I was saying is I I think it's okay to take a little bit of a mental break this is something that so many of us hopefully all of us watching this right now are just so passionate about and mad about and and ready to fight to make change for which is already happening but also we need to be able to recharge as well a little bit so I'm not saying that watching a video like this is necessarily an escape but a little bit of a mental break and a little bit of a ability to recharge and then get back out there and do what you can I also did reach out and speak to some of my subscribers out there and asked if this was an appropriate thing to do and they kind of voice the same feelings that I am feeling right now so clearly YouTube videos are a lot more plan they're not necessarily in the moment and right now with what's happening everything is so in the moment it's changing so rapidly so if you want to catch up with me and see what I'm doing in the present moment you can catch me on Instagram I'm posting on there quite a bit any Adsense made from this video I'm going to be donating to blacklivesmatter and I'm planning for at least the month of June any videos I make adsense there I will be donating to an organization affiliated with black lives matter and I also have a very important message at the end of this video that I personally would love more information about and I do need to learn more about and I feel like as a community we need to as well so please stick till the end of the video and yeah I hope you all are staying safe out there I love you all and enjoy what's up everyone AC girl Stephanie and today I am gonna share with y'all some of my favorite CBD products I've been a big fan of CBD for quite some time now is really impacted my life positively as well as other people all around me and Josie's too so before we get into it if you haven't yet please make sure to subscribe below come join the sisterhood no matter your true pronoun or gender identity come join the family alright let's get started okay so before we get into the products let's talk a little bit about what CBD is so CBD stands for cannabidiol which is a chemical compound derived from the cannabis sativa plant aka marijuana CBD is non psychoactive meaning it does not have a strong effect on the brains cognitive activity and doesn't cause the hive associated with marijuana and in fact has been found to have a lot of great health benefits currently there is so much research going on with CBD in terms of cancer research epilepsy but in terms of just 182 CBD in daily life I think I have four health benefits that you know anybody out there would use CBD for these ones I personally use them for so here we go I have pain relief so studies have shown that CBD may help reduce chronic pain by impacting endocannabinoid receptor activity reducing inflammation interacting with neurotransmitters we have anxiety and depression reduction so CBD acts on the brains receptors for serotonin which is a neurotransmitter that regulates mood and social behavior third we have sleep aid so one study showed that CBD improved the symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder a disorder in which a person acts out in their dreams RBD is associated with poor sleep and nightmares and then in terms of on the outside personally we have acne treatment so CBD oil may help treat acne due to its anti-inflammatory properties and ability to reduce sebum production and also there's a lot of research on CBD in terms of other skin issues like really dry skin eczema and that kind of stuff so those are really the health benefits that I guess I'm gonna be talking about with these particular products and of course we have different ways of using we have ingestion and topical so we're really gonna go through a variety of different products here we're gonna start this off with ingested CBD and this is probably the form that I use the most and these are gummies so here are my favorite ones in particular this is by plus and as you can see I have different kinds here so if we're just starting off with two of these here these are 700 milligrams the CBD per 10 there's 14 gummies in here so that means our 50 milligrams of CBD per gummy that is a lot for a gummy product I actually have now tried and maybe over like 10 different brands of gummies and these are quite small but for me this brand tastes the best but also because there's so much CBD in there and you can taste it a little bit more it's a little bit more bitter obviously with so much packed in there you're not gonna avoid the flavor or like the terpenes of the plant itself so typically because this is 50 all like cut this in half or even into quarters sometimes or you know eat one whole I want to I started taking CBD because of anxiety I definitely deal with daily presence of anxiety I don't think that I have the high some anxiety ever at all but I feel like as a normal person we're all dealing with anxiety you know what issues within our own lives all the time the way that my anxiety Manifest is I just feel like I'm going a million miles an hour while I'm doing nothing and I'll like hold my breath really and I just get really tense and I don't even realize I'm doing it I have to consciously just like let it go CBD really really helps with that it just helps me just relax a little bit and just slow down has absolutely no effect on my brain function like I said or anything it just makes me just relax a little bit more so that's when I started eating these gummies I really like these but the ones I really like these are my favorite just CBD gummies are these ones they are 90 milligrams CBD and 10 milligrams THC now there's a lot of research out there currently that says that CBD is more effective when you have a little bit of THC with it and this is called the entourage effect and it kind of shows that in terms of like the chemical compounds of the plant they work better together than as their individual components so that's why when you look at a product that contains CBD it'll either be full-spectrum broad spectrum or isolate I'm really not going to go too far into that because this is a lot to talk about but I'll just say that full spectrum does have a little bit of THC in there legally for it to be just sold everywhere it has to have under 0.3% I believe so this one is not legal to be sold everywhere I had to get this from a dispensary because in terms of like one dummy actually there's point five milligrams of THC you don't feel it at all when you're eating this one but I do feel like this one in itself gives me the same relaxed feeling the feeling of calm as one of these so this one only has four point five milligrams of CBD per gummy this one has 50 milligrams so I really do believe in that entourage effect there is one more from this company that I think it's worth talking about this is their melatonin gummy this one is 25 milligrams of CBD per gummy one milligram of melatonin so it is a very low amount of melatonin per gummy I find that eating one of these has the same effect as eating like a melatonin pill and I want to say usually those are like five milligrams of melatonin so I really like to use this I don't eat melatonin super regularly but I do have racing thoughts sometimes like I said my anxiety can carry like into the night so sometimes taking something like this really does help and I will say that in terms of like whole flour marijuana or something like that I do use like a little indica pen to go to sleep as well that's pretty much my the scent of my marijuana usage but of course I live in California and it's all legal I use it to help me go to sleep but sometimes if I just have this I don't need that the pen at all I do know on their website you can purchase any of these separately and you can also buy these three as a pack which I did and like I said I had to get the one with th seed a little bit of THC and they're from a dispensary another brand of gummies that I do enjoy our CBD effects and this brand in itself has so many options for CBD they have got like gummies tinctures everything so and I believe on the site that might even have packs you know that you can have a variety pack of different things so if you're just looking into like diving into CBD and just trying whatever you want this is a great company to go to I like the concert or this one and itself too because it's pretty small pack I think they're like eight gummies or there were four gummies no eight gummies in here these ones for only five milligrams per gummy so you're not going crazy oh oh like going 50 milligrams and you don't have to obviously cut it up all by yourself so if you're really very new to CBD I think this is a a brand to look into I think that they have one like small pack like this left and it's there like spirulina you're not gonna get this specific flavor but you're gonna get the same like five milligrams CBD gummies another thing actually that I really do want to circle back to about doing your research is you really have to look at the ingredient list in the back and if you can't see it if they're not displaying it on the website do not buy from that website because there are some brands they label their CBD like gummies in particular like extra chil CBD and actually they've added melatonin to it without telling you explicitly on the packaging like you look at this one it's called sleep blackberry tea with melatonin there was one brand that my sister really liked no where on the packaging did it say CBD with melatonin but she was like Stephanie these ones are so good for sleep every time I just eat one of these gummies it knocks me out right away and I was like whoa that sounds like it's a little bit too relaxing but maybe my sister's just very sensitive to CBD so I bought it and I remember it was like 5:00 p.m. I was working on my computer and maybe like 45 minutes later I was like I'm so tired right now what's going on at first it felt like I was just like really relaxed so I was like this is crazy this did not have that much CBD in it and also like it's making me not just relax but really sleepy then I just went ahead and looked at the packaging and you know back here it said melatonin I was just shocked because I went on the website on the page of the gummi know we're on there to say anything about melatonin until you went to this teeny little ingredient list at the very bottom area that you had to like click a tab for and then under everything it said melatonin so just do your research and look over everything before buying a product and if a product doesn't explicitly say that has something like melatonin in it I'm not sure if I would trust that brand so next up after gummies the product that I use the most are tinctures so I have two here for you I have one by Lorde Jones this is their royal oil a thousand milligrams CBD and then I have this one by anda which is their full-spectrum CBD hemp extract now the Lord Jones royal oil is advertised as being topical and I do use it in that way as well but I didn't have the pleasure of meeting one of the cofounders of Lord Jones Cyndi Capobianco and she did tell me that this isn't just about as well because all that's in here is I believe grapeseed oil and the CBD oil one dropper pool is 40 milligrams of CBD so maybe I'll you know do half put it underneath my tongue and just hold it there for a minute if you're really not trying to mess with a lot of added ingredients you don't want you know any sugars or anything from the gummies this could be a great way to go and it is a very multifunctional product because I do have some neck shoulder pain issues and this is a product this is the first really effective CBD product that I found to really help with my my pain in my neck I think especially topically the thing that I really grasp about CBD is that it reduces inflammation and inflammation can be the cause of a lot of bodily issues in terms of pain management skin issues a lot of it has to do with inflammation and this product actually what they recommend is to use it in your skincare so you could put it in your moisturizer a little drop of that or even end it just on your face but like I said this one I use mostly for ingestion and if I were to put it topically like on my shoulder and then this one by and I just wanted to mention it because I haven't used it too much but I have seen a friend who does like this brand I need to look into it a little bit more I believe actually the all the packaging has changed very drastically since I received this one but if you are looking into another brand if you look into this one if you just don't want to taste anything at all you don't want to deal with any oils you don't want to deal with any gummies we have capsules here for you of course so I have two here where I'm from CBD effects again it's one these little envelopes there is 25 milligrams of CBD per capsule and then we have a little jar here of the Lord Jones hemp derived CBD gel capsules this one as well has 25 milligrams of CBD per capsule you know in terms of all these methods of ingestion it really comes down to I guess just your preference personally for me a lot of CBD is about the process I guess and it is I hey it's the word of like mindfulness of understanding that I am you know rubbing this thing on me or eating this thing to help calm me down or to help me in some way so I enjoy that aspect of CBD cuz it makes me kind of focus and be like okay just chill out this is what I'm trying to do to help myself so it's a little bit of a self-care moment if you don't need that moment for yourself like go ahead and just take a capsule or you know this could be that process for you as well I personally have not used these too much because I enjoy using the other ways but I have gifted these to friends you know a bunch of these in the bottle I have gifted to a friend and they were dealing with some real pain issues in their back and they said that this one really helped them along with other products I did give them though I'll talk about the other one in a sec it but yeah this is just a way that you'd want to ingest EBD go ahead and try it in terms of incorporating CBD into your daily life I have been enjoying some these products that make it even more of I guess like a ritual so I have a couple honey products here so this first one is from potli this is their cannabis infused raw honey this has 100 milligrams of CBD and 10 milligrams of THC so this is another one of those that you might have to purchase from a dispensary I believe this one is only sold in California and again because it has the little bit of THC in there you get that entourage effect to make it a little bit more effective this is something that I would put into you know anything that you want honey some tea you put it on some granola it just incorporates CBD in another way into your daily life without maybe making it feel so Medical like you're not taking a tincture or a capsule you just have it in your honey and this honey tastes great this brand potli is wonderful the founders are fell and Christine very are my Faria girls and I feel like they're killing it I have another product here from them that I want to talk about this is a product that I really really like and then if you're looking for one that has absolutely no teach C in there that you could just purchase online this one is from iki pers natural this is their beat chill raw honey and hemp there is 500 milligrams high potency hemp oil which is CBD in there I actually personally know the founder of bee keepers Naturals as well which is so cool so now I've talked about three female or four female founders but her name is Carly Stein she started bee keepers naturals because she actually has grown up has lived with her whole life with an autoimmune disorder and she found that natural bee products like propolis and royal jelly and I guess now added with CBD actually really helps with her extra so you're looking for just a really nice honey that has some CBD in there as well but no THC you can look into this one I have one more food product here again from potli and this is their hemp infuse extra virgin olive oils so this is cold-pressed estate Tuscan olive oil with 250 milligrams of hemp derived CBD again just one of those products where you can put it on to a salad you know just put it into your daily life and this olive oil is like really really delicious this is my highlight my special occasion not a special occasion but I wouldn't I would not cook with this olive oil I would use it for something raw I mean my favorite dressing for our salad would be some olive oil and some nice balsamic vinegar and we're good to go so you're fairly new to CBD and the idea of taking a pill or gummy or something is not practical for your life but you are a tea drinker or you're a salad eater you know this could be the form that would fit into your lifestyle earlier I mentioned my friend who I gave these capsules to who was having some really bad back problems I'm not sure it she it was like a pinched nerve feeling but she's not positive that's what it was but it made her very immobilize some of this one for her to put on topically and this is the bebo therapy's high potency CBD body balm there is 750 milligrams of CBD in this jar so topically what this balm claims to do is to reduce inflammation so if you're having just general body aches maybe just from working out this is a product that you could rub onto your muscles to help you out the other day Michael had a really weird back spasm it happened while he was bike riding and thankfully he wasn't that far away I think he was just like in Chinatown so I had to drive and go pick him up like he could not move his back was in so much pain it was actually really scary but when we go home he took a hot shower and then I rubbed this on its back for him oh no it was it was like his shoulder within his shoulder blade down his back you know some it was really weird but I rub this onto him for like half an hour and what they do recommend is to keep this on for at least half an hour and I think that it really helped obviously it's a combination of things like he took a hot shower clearly I'm giving him a massage which I think in itself helped there are other ingredients in here a lot of really nice oils that could help but in itself as a balm I feel like it does give some relief the CBD in there gives some real relief in terms of physical aches and pains this one plus the Royal oil are ones that I personally have used on my back and my neck for the pains that I have and you know when you're rubbing it on yourself you clearly can't really work it in and I personally have felt just that strain and my neck down to my shoulder just like loosen up after having this on for an hour it just says it just feels so much better even now like I still have the issues if I'm doing this all I'm hearing is just like I can't got crack all throughout my back you know just when I'm on my computer I'm hunched over and that's my tension as well that's my stress I I carry all in my shoulders and I hold my breath when I'm doing stressful things so all of it all CBD kind of helps me with those issues without having you know necessarily to take the next step into taking other things I will say this bomb is not the most friendly in terms of soaking into the skin it definitely is one that's great for massages because you can just keep working working working with it it does not soak in that well but that just means that a little bit goes a really long way because if you just use a teeny tiny bit of it it will obviously spread thin and soak in but it just is it's just I know it smells great it's a really nice bomb but yeah be careful if I don't know laying down on your white sheets or anything because it does a little bit of a tint on there and if you're slathering it on you know clearly you see that it has a color to it we're gonna jump into some other skin care products before we really hop into the face stuff there's another bomb here by Lord Jose and this is their high CBD formula body balm and this has 200 milligrams of CBD in there so you know this one over here has 750 this is 200 I would say if you are looking for something for aches and pains and those kind of things for inflammation of the muscles this is one that I would more recommend this one I don't even think that they don't claim anything about helping your muscles or helping aches and pains this one is just like a balm that you would put on for really dry skin the thing that lower John's really talks about in terms of CBD with this product is that it is very soothing and very a restorative ingredient and it is really good for dry cracked skin so especially now that we are all washing our hands so much using so much hand sanitizer this is the kind of product that like at the end of the day I'll like rub on my knuckles and my cuticles of course like I said with the previous product there are other ingredients within this like beeswax and oils that do help with that I think this product is a good example of how CBD can be really incorporated into your regular products in your everyday life it's not a miracle ingredient every single time they're claiming in this one that is just good for you know maybe some dry skin some cracked skin it's not going to solve your arthritis or anything so just do your research I guess on the product with CBD that you're purchasing so I have two more skincare products here another one from Lourdes Jones I just you know I think Lourdes Jones is maybe was the first CBD brand to go into Sephora they really did break out in the high-end skincare realm I really don't know a lot of other skincare brain ants that have CBD in them so that's why there's so much Lord Jones products if you have any recommendations for me please let me know in terms of CBD skincare clearly I have a lot of other brands that I like with CBD but I just haven't seen much CBD skincare that I really like because Lord Jones uses some really awesome ingredients outside of the CBD but yeah if you have any recommendations for me please let me know the thing in terms of skincare from Lord Jones I think I really like I really really like the most and this is probably the newest one for me is their whole plant formula acid mantle repair this is a CBD moisturizer this is quite a rich cream I am an oily person this is good for all skin types so typically this is my nighttime cream and it's this is gonna last me a long time because I've been using this for a minute and it looks like I haven't even really skimmed the surface you don't need that much at all along with the CBD there are some really great ingredients there's hyaluronic acid so it's highly moisturizing but because it does have the CBD in there it is really a restorative kind of ingredient it is great for acne and it's so funny because I do really love just scrolling through online reviews whether they be really bad or really good and it's it's awesome because on Sephora there are so many positive comments about this from people who look dry skin people who have acne prone skin it just seems like an all-around great very positively reviewed product so if you're looking for a really nice nighttime moisturizer if you are oily or disah all day everyday moisturizer if you got dry skin yeah this is just a really great straightforward moisturizer and the last product for the face that I have here is the Saint Jane luxury beauty serum again this is kind of one of those products that supposed to be for all skin types it has 500 milligrams a full spectrum CBD with 20 potent botanicals so it supposed to hydrate detoxify help with dullness uneven skintone wrinkles it's just kind of supposed to be yeah a miracle serum I haven't been using it for that long but I will say I feel like my skin is glowing afterwards I did have some breakouts that I had like I want to say they started like a week and a half ago I really consistently was using both of these at nighttime and my chin is just like really cleared up and I thought that there was gonna be more popping up but it did kind of back back then they went back in there so I'm gonna continue using this one I would say out of any of the skin products this is the one that I've used the least and it is also the most luxury product that I have here so I'm really being stingy with it but also again from all the reviews that I've read online a lot of different people with different skin types really have been enjoying this product hi Joe I just woke Josie up from snoring heavy sometimes when I'm recording now she just starts snoring so loud that I do have to I have to wake her up because she's just right here in front of the camera well speaking of Josie we do have a product for her this is the blossom full spectrum hemp oil this has 300 milligrams per bottle here this is the one I purchased for medium dogs you administer 0.25 milliliters per 25 pounds of pet weight CBD for pets is super effective I I feel like it might even be the most friendly gateway into CBD for a lot of people because they see immediate effects in their pets whether it be giving it to them during you know hard car rides where dogs have a lot of anxiety during that time or with fireworks so there was one night for some reason that there was a bunch of fireworks going on all outside Josie was a little bit nervous she's not usually nervous about loud noises but I think Michael wasn't around so it made her a bit nervous and I gave her some of the CBD and she calmed right down it was very I don't know it was pretty amazing and I have you know babysat other dogs where they're really anxious dogs and CBD just helps so much so I feel like just in that to see how CBD works for your loved animal and how it calms them down is just a really great testament to how effective CVD can be for you it's all not saying that everything you would give your dog is be good for you but I'm just saying we have a direct example there I do like this brand I feel like there are a lot of CBD for pet brands and a lot of the brands that I'm showing here let me see I know this one onda I saw on their website they have one specifically for dogs so I feel like a lot of brands that make CBD is just smart for them to also make it for pets as well so I would definitely recommend tinctures I'm not so sure about treats but I'm sure those are you know also effective I just have one last form of CBD not for pets but for humans and that is just the flower here so these are from Lowell smokes first off I have their premium hemp smokes so you can actually buy these from Lowell smokes it's just hemp and in this pack they also give you these little matches the packaging little smokes just kills it with the packaging is very very smart and I have gone through a good number of these little pre-rolls like I said I feel like for me personally part of CBD is the ritual and I am NOT a big just like weed smoker like I went sit down and smoke I was gonna say blunt I wouldn't go it's a ton of smoke a lot maybe you know back in my bay area days maybe but I went to sit down and smoke a joint on any given day but I do enjoy that process of sitting down lighting it and just relaxing with it so in a way I can I can have that without the high and we have it here with these CDP rolls if you don't want to have a whole approval because I understand I'll usually have to just like smoke a little bit of it put it out and then doesn't necessarily taste that great you know when you have to relight a joint they also just have the flower so this right here is 3.5 grams or 1/8 of the CBD hemp flour it's just crazy because in my mind like this just this is weak but yeah there's no THC in there it is just CBD is just hump and you can put this in your little pipe and smoke it so that's another option for you if you just really want to have that also I feel like if you're trying to not smoke so much weed but you enjoy that process this could be a great thing you know for you to do just smoke a little CBD so you're you're you having your ritual but you're not getting super stoned all right all those are all of my CBD products I have to show you it was a lot but I wanted to give you some options and I honestly I didn't realize that I really use a lot of sea wheedies so I hope you enjoyed this video before we close this up I did want to touch upon this in that you know currently marijuana is legal in California and in a lot of other states decriminalized in certain states I believe and it really is moving quite rapidly a lot of people a lot of companies are making a ton of money now in this industry and yet there are still thousands of people currently incarcerated for charges as small as carrying marijuana just possession and as a user of these products we need to be mindful and understand and become educated and become advocates for people who are currently in jail for crimes that are no longer criminal and I mean shouldn't not have been criminal in the first place I know myself I need to become more educated on the subject so I would love to hear from you any suggestions for anything that all of us should read about any kind of information or charities or organizations that we should look into because there's there's a lot of information out there but it's hard to really weep through it so I would love your help on that and I would love to be more educated and with that said I hope y'all are well and hope you are staying healthy and safe there's a lot of stuff going on right now and I hope this video maybe gave you a little bit of a break from that and I love you and I will see you in the next video bye", "E54xfctwvxM": "hi and this is the pitch for my memoir and i want the memoir to be about mango gummies that i got as a kid so these mango gummies my great grandmother used to always give a few to me and my sisters whenever we would visit we would call her taiplaw because that is great grandma in mandarin and i remember uh these were always my favorite candies as a kid because i couldn't get them anywhere else besides taipo and so whenever i went over i would always try to convince her to give me just a few more so for the theme i also wanted to be about family and remembering those even if they have passed um my thai paw my great she passed away when i was very young but i still fondly remember these mango candies and they still hold a very important place in my heart even today and i always try to find some whenever i go out now for the how i want to do it i want to make like a little video but i will be using photos and animating them in the video software to make it feel a little more alive so like right now we have me and my siblings coming out of the dark hall knocking on the door and my great grandma shows up and then i would give a little bit of detail in the moments between the moment between the photos moving the photos just a little visual aid and then more animation and more more photos come up later just so you have a little more you get a little more out of what i'm saying in the video as you can also see it's happening on screen and so for the outline i was just gonna start with a scene of me and my two sisters going in to visit my great grandma and getting the candies and after that i'm going to have a very short reflection about it and talking about how i felt about it as a child and what i thought about my great-grandma and all those things and then i was going to have a second scene of me and my sisters who are now older and grown up going out grocery shopping and how we now go and buy the same mango gummies whenever we go to the uh to ranch 99 and then in the end i'll give a little bit of this reflection on that and then that will be it for my memoir thank you", "fAXVeg06RYI": "today welcome to the simple cooking channel today Taylor and I are going to show you how to make some really

channel for those of you who are new welcome my name is Amanda and today I am reviewing the Jessie PD gummies this is my first time reviewing a CBD product and this is actually the first time that I've tried to CBD product so let's go ahead and get into it this video I wanted to cover why I was interested in testing on a CBD product and it's because I've experienced a lot of anxiety stress and I have a hard time sleeping sometimes sometimes it'll be hard for me to fall asleep and sometimes it'll just be hard for me to stay asleep I'll wake up multiple times throughout the night and so I just won't get that great of a sleep so I wanted to find a product that relaxed me so I turned to CBD just to try it out I basically just wanted to try to find a product that would help me relax and help me sleep better or feel less stressed a little bit about the just CBD product and brand I saw it on Instagram and so I decided to give it a try if you're interested in trying out just EVD I will leave my referral code or link down in the description box below the product that I got is the just CBD gummies and I got it in the rainbow ribbons they're basically like rainbow ribbon candy gummies with CBD in it I started out with the 250 milligrams size I believe this is a small size they offer but basically it contains about 20 pieces in here each piece is about 12.5 milligrams of CBD and you can tell that I just finished my container and that is why I wanted to do a review about it based on their website it's as adults typically take about 20 to 30 milligrams of CBD and you can up or lower the dosage as necessary so that would be about two pieces of this gummy ribbon but I think the suggested dosage or a recommendation maximum is about four pieces I honestly don't know too much about CBD but I know it does not get you high so you won't feel those types of side effects with this product it does say on the website that it'll take about 30 to 45 minutes to take effect so it just takes at a time once you take the gummy if you are interested in purchasing from the just CBD store or the brand I do want to note here about they do charge a foreign transaction fees so if you can try to use a credit card that with no foreign transaction fees just to avoid that moving on to my experience and my review this again was my first product that had CBD in it that I was testing out and so I didn't quite know what to expect and I started out very slow I started out with a dosage of just one gummy and then I moved on up to four gummies starting off with a taste I think it was pretty decent I love gummies so I was excited to try a gummy product with sweidy in it and it did taste kind of like gummy rainbow ribbons but I feel like sometimes I'm a little bit sensitive to taste so certain pieces I could taste more CBD taste than others if that makes sense it just tasted like something else other than a gummy candy as far as taste goes I feel like I would purchase this again based on the taste it tasted pretty good I could continue eating product like this in terms of how well the product worked however I think that's a little bit of a different story I did start out with one piece and then I gradually made my way up to four pieces as a single dosage I moved up in dosage because I didn't really notice I was getting any results from one piece or two pieces or three pieces so gradually I made my way up to four pieces and unfortunately at four pieces I wasn't sleeping any better it was still hard for me to sleep I still felt stressed I think sometimes when I would take the CBD gummies I would feel slightly more relaxed but I don't know if that was just with SIBO fact or if it was really helping me but overall it didn't really change or improve the quality of my sleep I was still very anxious and stressed out when I slept and didn't sleep any better that I noticed so based on the results that I got from the product I probably wouldn't purchase this again I might try a different product affairs or just taking CBD in a different form but I just want to share my experience with you just to let you know how well it worked for me or didn't work I'm excited to try different types in the future if you are interested in purchasing or trying this out again I will leave my referral and the description box below but I can't personally say that I would purchase this product again if this video helped you please give it a like and don't forget to subscribe for more videos like this I hope to see you in the next one thank you so much for watching bye", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "x6BgfrYZ7sI": "this is 420 Ohio's medical marijuana product reviews Juanes our gummies are produced by Buckeye relief out of East Lake Ohio gummies are housed in a white plastic bottle with a pine green cap there are ten gummies per bottle each containing roughly eight milligrams of THC and CBD per coming one us our gummies are flavored like strawberry lemonade it is worth noting for diabetics that these gummies are not sugar-free containing sugar pectin and corn syrup the bottle itself is fairly easy to open and is 100% recyclable design for this Ohio medical marijuana edible is appealing with a colorful photo of fruit on the cover and a striking wanna logo inside patients are treated to ten swear gummies crafted into the shape of the THC warning logo the gummies are a deep shade of pink almost like grapefruit and are covered in tasty sugar crystals in terms of flavor the name says it all these gummies are juicy bursting with strawberry sweetness and a tart lemon flavor that's just right I wasn't wincing or pinching my lips while chewing on this gummy like I might with other sour candies if you're looking for that experience though I'd suggest mixing this gummy with some sour patch kids medicinally wanna sour gummies provide a one-to-one ratio of THC and CBD per gummy this translates to a medicinal experience that's both mildly euphoric and relaxing used a few hours before bed this gummy is excellent for distressing after a tough day it's also great for inflammation relief rest and sleep euphoria creeps up with this one building to a crescendo about an hour or two after eating the edible I could initially feel a slight headband effect that grew in intensity before peaking and slowly dissipating this was followed by immediate pain and stress relief overall I rather loved one a sour gummies they are great for the evening providing gentle euphoria inflammation relief and smooth relaxation before bed if you've been searching for a good gummy edible be sure not to miss this one final rating 4.9 out of 5 be sure to LIKE and subscribe below or share this video on reddit

edibles there's a bunch of different options there's chocolates there's brownies there's everything personally I love guns so when I saw that puppy delivery was offering these mango flavored cannabis infused gummies I have to try it if you are interested and these mango cannabis infused gummies just head on over to puppy to them you can pick these little babies up with a formal price of $15 a box", "Oc1JmsGbBAk": "[Music]", "vM5-obreGIo": "[Applause] oh no we might have to open another pack so basically um we got 60 something dollars worth of kazoo gummies because we always wanted to try every single flavor um and so there ended up being three plus okay three plus three six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen thirteen flavors in total um we got these assorted packs to save a little bit of money so that we can get apple musket and greater one as far as i know we actually got every single flavor so today we're gonna try all of these kasugai gummies and figure out which one is objectively better than the others so the first flavor we are going to try is watermelon whoa watermelon looks like this wow you do that a lot faster than me probably not gonna be my favorite it tastes like the um artificial watermelon from watermelon flavored tropicana juice okay i think it's i think it's good it has a little bit of a chalky um texture on the outside and a bit of a chalky flavor on the inside what what do you rate it three out of ten start with a harsh reading peach peach peach i have this one better than the watermelon one for sure it's definitely a brighter flavor it does not have the chalky texture this is a six out of ten sounds good to me wait what did you rate the watermelon one i was just agreeing with you oh in that case i would give peach a five a five okay i would give it a six almost mostly give it a five so i have room to grow okay melon is next not my favorite but i feel like it's just the melon flavor like i don't know anyone that likes melon i actually like this better than peach really yeah because it was like more mellow you want to know something funny what's that the fifth ingredient is concentrated apple juice that's because apple juice is cheaper wow so these are basically apple gummies i bet all of these are apple gummies there's apple juice right there and there's oh no right there so the peach one actually has oh wait this is actually really interesting the melon the watermelon one doesn't have watermelon juice or apple juice what does it have instead nothing i guess it's natural and artificial flavor that's why it tastes so fake i bet it's because watermelon flavor is actually really hard to come by so they just put artificial oh lychee oh ichi wow i can smell the michi i'm really strong this one definitely has the um that chalky texture on the outside which i'm not a huge fan of but i think you're definitely getting it lucky because they just add that texture to get it to not stick to the wrapper yeah but if they add it and i taste it then it's part of the flavor right i would give this a seven with peach being six then richie is seven for me oh lychee was four for me only four yeah strawberry wow this one's really interesting because it takes a while for the flavor to hit but it's like sort of complex when it does i can see that happening i definitely just chewed it up and swallowed it very quickly but anyway i gave this an eight and eight wow i feel like i have more room to grow than you do even though your scale was more deflated in the beginning mango oh yeah i feel like this mango doesn't taste real it doesn't taste like a mango no maybe it's like a japanese type of mango i would give this one like a three honestly not the biggest fan it tastes good but it doesn't taste like a mango yeah so i will say four wow that's so disappointing because mango's usually your favorite flavor yeah okay yuzu i think this is just like a japanese version of a lemon feels like a cross between a lemon and a tangerine it's very good it is good yeah i would give this a seven oh tangerine yeah you were right it's it's like almost exactly the like the kick of a tangerine with like the underlying flavor of a lemon yeah wow what's your rating my rating on six this is pineapple wow pineapple juice is actually used that's the third ingredient oh my gosh this one's brown brown oh yeah maybe we can show the colors oh this one's pretty good oh i don't like this you don't like it i think it's a little strong to be honest yeah it was like when i put it on my tongue it almost like hurt a little bit which was weird well that happens to real pineapples too i would give this one a five i would give it a two i wouldn't have another one of those well the next flavor is ramune so basically it's gonna be like sugar flavored pretty good this is so good it tastes like sprite oh it tastes like colgate total what's that it's a type of toothpaste i mean you don't even know you really want to be eating toothpaste though but you want to be brushing your teeth all right i would give this a a five no a six i would give it a six yes this is kiwi and also these gummies have like black things in this speckles this is really good check this out instead of kiwi juice they call it kiwi fruit sauce which is a combination of kiwi fruit high fructose corn syrup and concentrated apple juice wow so it's basically apple juice and a little bit of kiwi fruit yes i give that a nine a knife yeah i could eat those all day i would give it an eight so that's my highest rating so far also this is the purple grape okay well this is definitely red right yeah this one is okay this is like the quintessential flavor of purple yeah like when you have like a purple ice pop it's gonna be this flavor well they probably all use the same like artificial flavoring yeah probably okay apple juice this one i give this a five yeah i was gonna give it a five two except i would say not to be confused with green apple but there's only a red apple so that's this flavor oh this one's really good oh yeah i'm not surprised because this one probably actually uses apple juice in a way that makes sense wow okay i give this a nine ten a ten yeah this is the green grape one's pretty good musket definitely a seven i would give this an eight this one beats the purple grape for sure in my head yeah same cool that was musket okay final rankings i will definitely be brushing my teeth after this yep i can already feel the bacteria pooping in my mouth after this nice feast of sugar okay", "f72exTyMcfs": "[Laughter] yo what's up man welcome back to the garage you know it's the place where you always have a good time this is too sweet you already know it is it's your boy big will and don't forget to

can't really see this chili flakes but sugar man shout out to y'all this would be better as a belt yeah it would be better as well the flavor of that chili and that sugar right maybe on a belt right this like this this texture is coming with this texture is kind of strange but the flavor is blessing though this is like somebody who they trying to make a cheap i feel like this is a they didn't really put too much effort in a gummy right i feel like they need to put this on a belt stretch your gummy out to a belt because there's no flavor there's no lots of flavor it's just that texture's not matching with the flavor the texture was kind of strange in mouth but the uh the flavor the chili lumon that [ __ ] was good it's like just like the uh little candies you feel me man it tastes just like it look that's what i was gonna say next or makes a little thing a little like does the candies yeah like the candies you know either way the belt or the candies but you need to change your gummies man i don't know man this is just a weird little texture right well you don't write that too well i give it one thumbs up because the flavor is there and you don't taste the marijuana so you know what i'm saying look i know we can say that what you know you just i just come natural nowadays if i taste the marijuana that you could probably get a thumb down now at this point yeah i'm gonna be real know that you said that like when you in the edible section you probably can find like hell of [ __ ] that tastes way better than that but if you just want a chili lemon taste like i mean chili mango taste if you're looking for specific taste then grab those if not if you want just want something that just tastes good get something else you feel me cuz it's not too many [ __ ] busting on that milly chilly chilly fangirl milly chilly fangos fast in a hurry you feel me look like i said man that [ __ ] one thumb up one texture flavor would you rate them though i gotta agree with you

"iL9e5jV40OI": "[Music] another mastermind head [Music] hello folks Anthony again from Ohio cannabis live what's up everybody welcome to another video and today we're going to be talking about one of gummies check it out you want a gummy yeah I want a gummy so one of gummies are gummies that are produced by luck I believe I know they've got a bad rap but the gummies are different story folks and so is the key that's another video you got keeping out where because the keep video is common and you don't believe the experiment god it's lined up for that I've teased that later so let's talk about one of gummies but I decided to go with is the one of gummies blueberry and because it was $45 I think that's still kind of pricey we're talking 10 milligrams each gummy 100 milligrams total again comparing the Michigan that still kind of falls short of what we all think we should be able to get for this price I like the container let's look at what the gummy looks like and then I'm going to eat one and tell you a little bit more about it so I the container is a little weird to open but you have to push in on on each side here to get over so here's the gummies and I'm gonna take another one out for better view and it is blue folks you see a little bit sugar on it and you know I'm I like them i'ma say it tastes better than a bro how gummies compared to gibsonburg dummies I'm going to give it similarity but I'm going to say I do like to taste folks I can think it's one of companies are tasty in my opinion and the views expressed in any of my videos are selling my opinions based on my own personal experience and knowledge I work for none of these companies I do not represent anyone other than you guys so I just wanna make sure we clarify that any music you hearing in these videos if the music that I made myself I'm on a tight budget many of you know that is why I'm still wearing the same white t-shirt eventually we'll have Ohio cannabis live t-shirts and hats someday and maybe even business cards but we're not really in business right so we're just trying to get the word out about these products and we want to make sure that you are up-to-date on stuff when it comes out one of gummies are new let me give you our another close-up of it and on the back is the label here tells you about the dosage where are these at right now I know you know how cannabis company has them I know that Terra Center Columbus has them and there may be a few other dispensaries that actually have these comes as well so check your online menus check weed Maps check everywhere and there's three different kinds there is the indica the sativa and the hybrid and each different version has a different flavor god none of the other flavors that they had was watermelon I posted some more information some literature about the one of gummies on my Facebook page so you can check out a couple more screenshots some of the other material that came with the gummies but I'm gonna tell you I tried one last night and it definitely came in I was saying for a person like me and the way I've been in a lot of pain I'm probably a too gummy person at a time you might be at income ten milligram person I'm probably more of a 20 milligram bilities person and in extreme cases probably thirty milligrams really good for me I don't recommend you eat five at one time at me fifty milligrams of THC and in my experience when I see people take 50 milligrams you see that's pretty pretty much put you to sleep but you can get you in a really lazy tight mode depending on what kind of edible it is and 100 milligrams you eat the whole thing up oh my you're gonna feeling really really sleepy and probably really relaxed so yeah if you just want to if you could afford to eat them a whole pack in one day I mean go for it but if you want to make them last I think that one two gummies each session is probably appropriate based on my own personal opinion folks but I think the wanna gummies are a good product and congratulations Buckeye relief for making a nice product and you know making something to taste better I'm not gonna tell you tastes amazing and I'm not gonna say it tastes as good as regular gum use they don't have THC in it you're gonna taste THC close they're gonna taste medicine in there but it's not overwhelming you do give some flavors like I said this one is blueberry so I think the flavor was good and like I said I definitely compare it to the gibsonburg gummies and forest the texture in comparison very similar type of gummy so you know it's one better than the other right now I'm not ready to make their conclusion I would say they're probably very much similar products from two different processes so now we have a little bit more variety of products now yeah gibsonburg gummies and now we have one of gummies and we have Robo Ohio guns so if you want to see here we go this is the container or grow hi Oh gummies here's the one of gummies and here's a container for the gibsonburg guns so again folks when I tell you things I don't just speak from just other people's opinions I speak from my own personal testing of these products and that's why I wanna make sure you guys get to the information and I would say all three these guys are doing good here congratulations to staring the Wellness buckeye relieved in goo Ohio for making halfway decent products the first batch of these I did not like and second batches a lot better so I think didn't they grow Ohio is definitely improving on their alternative products and like I said I think I'll be within like gibsonburg gonna sigh I know I think so with that we're gonna head to wrap this view with the final conclusion that Ohio got some gummies yeah the price could be a little bit better so if my growers are out there listening see what you can do in the price man we can get these cubbies down like maybe $29.99 I think we would see him go out a lot faster this is my own person

let me try to do the pineapple one more time just get a really good one of all right so we're gonna go ahead and review both of these for the flavor so let's go ahead and see so star burning fuse - 10 milligram servings per piece let's go ahead and read the back if there's anything so it says gluten-free dairy-free not free so gluten free dairy free not free super vegan I guess that's okay right it doesn't say specifically v4 like vegan or anything but it does say clean kind of is guaranteed let's see let's go ahead ten milligrams THC less than 2 milligrams CBD per piece it doesn't say specifically indica or sativa so most likely it's a hybrid that these gummies are so we're gonna go ahead and get into the strawberry ones here in this video you know go ahead and try one oh these are cute so they are rippable it um it's like a super soft like what is it called like a starburst if they put sugar around it but it's also soft like a gummy bear and it rips in half into two pieces but I'm just gonna go ahead and eat the whole piece as a 20 milligram so I'm gonna let her try it first and then I'm gonna give my thoughts on it so that way I don't say anything that like makes her change her thoughts on it so don't say anything but let me know when you once you have your thoughts in it okay so one first strawberry I think that they could have put in more like um maybe some citrus just for a little more punch and then just really a strawberry flavor there's no like to me it's like a very watered-down like gummy but it doesn't strike to me as like strawberry kind of tastes more like almost like a gummy vitamin where you know it's a berry but you don't know that specifically it tastes like strawberry what do you think it smells like fresh strawberries or when he tastes it tastes like frozen strawberry that's been in the freezer too long while you were saying about the strawberries yeah like that's pretty good very hybrid yeah and I thought got me like it definitely tastes like I've got me it's sweet um you definitely don't taste like I need super wheat or THC in it so that [ __ ] tastes more like that you did like the old-school gummies really hard like a pure weed to it and then I think a lot of people wanted to go like a lot like the skittle slavers and stuff enchilada like people really want like our candy taste and I think that's why you don't even really taste the weed in it so next one that we're gonna open is the pineapple let's go ahead and open it and see if it smells like pineapple yeah it does smell like pineapple okay I'm not really tasting a pineapple oh I do a little little bit after I chewed it for another second it does taste like pineapple yeah and for the pineapple it says ten milligrams THC but each piece has 20 milligrams in less than 2 milligrams of CBD in it pineapple 100 milligrams the same thing it's gluten free dairy free yeah not free so mmm that's the best part I think it's a both of these gummies are really good by heavy-hitters I do like heavy-hitters products am a fan especially if their cartridges her mom recently picked up a cartridge - and what did your mom say about it that's strong yeah like she took popped it once and her eyes were like red she really felt the high I think heavy hitters really brings it you know because of their brand and they're really well known and they have some really good products out there I think they're gummies are really on point um I do wish that they would have a little stronger of like a flavour - pineapple and strawberry personally but other than that they are good gummies you know they are gonna take about 90 minutes to kick in so we will give you guys a little update on the gummies later as we go but yeah so we just wanted to go ahead do another little gummy review let you guys know what we thought of them the flavoring and everything if you guys have any questions or comment or anything please go ahead and leave them in the comment section and if you want please go ahead and subscribe and hit that notification Val thanks for watching you guys bye", "5DVkOG7O4NI": "hey everyone so I had I was 7-eleven and I was just looking for some candies and my baby wasting some gummies and he loved gummies and then I seen son and I said oh this looks weird like I never had it before but it reminded me of the mango suckers to face the cell with the chili powder on it so if you look great you see the picture at an angle at the bottom right there and what he says is filled mango slices and see the juice here opening it smells really good so this is my first time having these and this is what I look down and shaped like the mango suckers suckers not around it's flat on your back tastes a little bit when you if you suck on it it tastes kind of like the mango Center once you go out of chili powder loss mmm but once you suck it more and more you can taste it tastes like the chili powder is coming out from the middle I say it's just like the mango sucker you can see different it's a darker color orange when you open the middle we're pretty good I wouldn't eat too many this is very very sweet I was telling it's one it's not a gum you can't hear it you could just eat like gummy bears I can tell that if you eat some mini you will get a stomachache either from the spiciness or the sweetness because sweet and spicy says one serving is five pieces so you get six servings in here hundred and ten calories it's nothing but sugar gelatin corn sir you should just bash it for you but if you like those mango sucker only like gummies I think you're like you try that Williams field makeup flavor", "WivIebpvDmA": "you are now watching a Lucky Penny shop product feature hey it's Lucky Penny shop and if you landed on this

check the description or just click here and always remember if you see a Lucky Penny pick it up", "Ey3xP25kuWg": "[Music] welcome to my kitchen my name is Chad Mitchell and I'm a senior scientist with Carlos North America food applications team I have been asked to talk about how we are continuing to support our customers with R&D from our home workspaces before we were asked to transition to homework I had a few projects with sugar reduction that came up they range from cereal coatings to cereal puffs to frosting and to gummies so we had to decide obviously for coating cereal I need a bigger piece of equipment so that was out but frosting and gummies hey I can do that at home so before we were asked to work from home we were able to grab a few items have a scale an induction plate a thermometer a mixer and the rest has been make it up as you go basically on some of these things so that's been fun and interesting so we're gonna talk about some of the sugar reduction hurdles I've been able to look at while I've been at home and we're gonna focus on a pectin gummy today so right away when I hear sugar reduction the first thing is I always ask is what am i comparing this to is this gonna be a brand new product and you want to compare it to something on the market or is this an existing product and you need to match it in a gold standard way and obviously if it's matching a gold standard and even if it's a new product we want to know about the flavor the texture and the appearance and many times those will have definite set guardrails on there and some of them might be it taste needs to be number one we're flexible on texture and the parents we're okay I think we'll be able to fall into that window so we always try and set a hierarchy that way another thing I always ask is what is on your in and out ingredient list what what are you looking to do do you have something that specifically cannot be used or is there something that you would really like to be used and what are some of the goals of that sugar reduction so then it would be the claims are we looking at a calorie reduction are we looking for we had a sugar reduction do we want to add fiber to this product or other than neutral nutrient benefits so that's where I kind of start there and then the fourth thing is I like to always think about is processing corn syrup I should say syrup is not syrup I mean in a powder is not necessarily a powder so therefore you have to kind of think about all those things because it may look great on a formula or nutrition facts panel they may look okay you know in the beginning and during the processing but then also how does it look in the finish so we have to take it all the way through so we're in a quick jump in here right now today I'm actually going to be looking at using some erythritol to reduce the sugar so I'm preheating I have corn syrup sugar and erythritol in here and I've preheated this I always preheat my syrup here so that I can not shocked my pectin when I put that in there my pectin has been hydrating back here in the mixer I'd 190 degrees Fahrenheit so it's nice and in its functional place all right that looks pretty good so I'm going to turn that off and grab the pectin and we'll add the pectin probably my mixer going a little bit too fast all right there we go it's also working from home we have not I don't have all the big equipment like our pH meters and our refractometers but I've designed some Excel spreadsheets so that we can know how far I need to how much moisture I need to drive off to get to the correct solid range for a pectin gummy which is between 76 and 78 solids all right so 21 27.2 so I'm going to start this heating up I got a quick write down that number so we'll go to about that range right there all right so now I'm going to continue this to heat this up and concentrate the material and while this is working here I've set a timer so I kind of know what that is I have the scale here so I'll be able to watch how much moisture I've driven off of the product here and we'll continue carry on so the thought behind this was I was in a door with rat all to reduce some of the calories and obviously reduce the sugar I also added it to my pectin to get it into a nice happy place so talking about ingredients and thinking as they've gone in here now so yesterday I actually made some gummies with some corn bran and then I also made gummy with store Batol isomalt and our chicory root fiber are liquid inulin and they all had some very different things that that I watch for as I put them into the pot so as I'm thinking about processing and seeing how the ingredients are different so Lydia my daughter Lydia is helping me out today video tape so here is a simple example of 75 grams of water and then 25 grams of the powder so here this one is sugar and you can look underneath there room-temperature water pretty well dissolved here's 25 grams of bran and kind of see it's a little bit more viscous it's still kind of global and then here's the Arista tog in it at room temperature water there's a few little crystals left in there they're pretty well dissolved so thinking about that so just that a little bit of a change there keep working this here so again my formulation of my spreadsheet tells me what a temperature and about a weight that I need to drive off for moisture and then one other thing while we're waiting it to get to temperature their syrups this one is our corn syrup you can kind of see and then here is our chicory root fiber our liquid in Ulan so I'm just going to take and dump these out so chicory root Fiber has a lower viscosity and the 43 is working its way out there so that's one of the things you have to consider when also reformulating and thinking about the process and it also affects your processing time as well because now if you have more moisture you need to cook longer or got a good boil here when I turn down the temperature a little bit keep mixing keep mixing so again so the process here so where we would at be at currently as we thought about the ingredients that we needed and we wanted to look at in reducing the sugar we kind of looked at them on the bench top and said okay I see how they're gonna line up now I'm putting them into the process of cooking them down and putting them into the place where the pectin wants to function and then we'll see how the other ingredients react in that area and once we have these deposited I'll show you some of the things that we look for and work through on the rest of the way there so we're this pectin batch is about a 5 minute or so boil kind of seen that pretty consistently with this type of a formula and we'll also see the weights here see we're at here we're getting closer about what a minute and a half away tour so it's got a good boil and then today another thing it's a great thing being at home learning to work at home you had to deal with zoom meetings school but also wonderfully great questions I've been able to actually dig in a little bit deeper and explain what's going on and then my daughter's have helped me with picking out flavors so today this is going to be a strawberry flavor I don't have access to a library but I have access to mcCormick at the grocery store our lay our colors are also grocery store colors so getting creative that way I'll show you when we get over to our starch molds over here how we've had to be creative with that as well here that's the other thing too is with benchtop space it's not quite like being in the lab you can only have so much space because if you start approaching on your kitchen table everybody else is a workspace doesn't make for happy co-workers if you know them saying all right so let's see we are just about there couple more grams of moisture loss and we should be right about the target solids they're a positive temperature see what we're at here yep we're about just a touch away in the temperature as well so it's looking all very consistent to a full sugar product all right we're at the target stalls where we need to be turn off the heat we'll let it cool down a little bit not a nice thing is I got the breeze coming in from outside so it's kind of work nice to work in your kitchen this way all right so I would say this process of the erythritol in there process very very similarly so today it's gonna be green strawberry erythritol gummies so this would be the point if I wanted to add some sweetener high intensity sweetener I would do that I won't necessarily always do it on the first try I would probably wait to the next one because I want to see how the flavor might just have packed it in general so I will just keep the high intensity sweetener out there out of there for right now here we go here's the strawberry flavor or extract that smells good good choice alright and then next I'm just gonna add our acid which will start the process of the pectin wanting to set both the solids and the acid will help it want to set here so stir this in and then you know go grab a funnel here and then we'll meet you over at the starch molds I'm also using a silicon mold because that's becoming more prevalent in the space as well that does require a little bit different solids and a little bit different temperature on the progress and there all right there we go funnel and spit in a hot oven so that way the product will flow and now we're just gonna go oh I got to move my mold there so we had to get creative with our molds since I didn't have a mold at home but I have some very resourceful kids that we're able to help me out so now we'll see again looking at this part of the process it's flowing nicely so I would say that we're looking really good this erythritol in there it's looking good try and make some of these because I will be saving these to look at in 24 hours we'll check out the texture see what's going on see how the flavor might have changed and plus they're just kind of really good to snack on they're fresh these will not be going to any customers just if anybody's curious on that this is literally I'm working through stuff here so that way when I get back in the lab I know where to start so I can continue on and moving in a fast manner and get you out samples that would meet your needs and also at that time potentially add the high intensity sweeteners real flavors from some of our different suppliers and there we go and then this is what was left in the pan we gonna make one giant gummy so where we are already so we've gone from hmm we've asked all these questions we picked up we wanted to try erythritol in there and see how that would work now we went through the process it looked good we put it in the starch in a silicone mold to see how they might react differently at this solids and then have you come over here Lydia we'll look at this so this was actually made yesterday so this was an L 90 43 de coeur and sarah sorbitol isomalt gummy so one way to check is so now that's sat in there we'll cut that and just see what does the inside look like another one that we made yesterday was this gummy worm with corn bran and gelatin and then after that I've had to go out and I really remove the starch from it just like you would in the plant I don't have a really good polish so again I've gotten creative I used some nonstick spray on the gummies that's kind of what they look like they're coming out and again we can check these since I polished them now we'll see you can see I got a little bit of air bubbles in there but I'll do the fingernail test cut and see how clear and go to set I have in there it cut pretty clean probably got a little bit of air bubbles in there because going fast here at home but there it is in a nutshell so again final recap on on sugar reduction at home is still the same thing would be in the lab I need to ask the questions of is it new is it existing what is in what is out how why are there claims that need to be made and then how is it going to process and then finally what is that final taste and texture and 22 high intensity sweetener gonna need to change the flavor out of these ingredients work with your existing flavors so as you can see it's doable it's fun working with family at home but thank you for joining me in my kitchen again my name is Chad Rishel if you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me or if you have a car you'll contact currently please reach out to them with any questions or ingredient questions we want to continue to help you drive your projects forward during this time and in the future so looking forward to working with you thank you and take care [Music]", "0X5fqRx_ppc": "hey guys and welcome back today we're making some homemade fruit gummies these are all-natural they can be made with fresh-squeezed juice and they're actually really easy we're going to be using the fruit shack here to create these gummies you can find these on Amazon and each kit comes with two droppers four trays and four different shape molds so I'll be showing you a different recipe for each mold today to start off by making our grape gummies and I'm going to be using some pre-done juice this is just organic juice I got at the natural food store you can use fresh-squeezed which is what I'm going to be using for the rest of the recipes but in a pinch this will do so we add our juice we add our gelatin get that all in there and then you're just going to let it do its thing for just about three minutes next we'll take it over to the stove and mix until it's dissolved and warm but not quite boiling then you're ready to start filling your molds Aarthi so cute they're little grapes which is totally appropriate because we're making grape gummies when they're all filled we're going to place them in the refrigerator for 30 minutes until set at that point we can take them out of the refrigerator pop them out of the molds and they're ready to eat I really love the freedom of being able to put whatever you want in these and you can skip all of that unnecessary packaging for a recipe number two we're going to be making our orange gummies this one I kept very very simple and I just used some fresh-squeezed orange juice and a little a sorbic acid so same thing here pour your juice into your little pot you're going to add in gelatin and let that do its plain I also add a little bit of honey so you can do that to sweeten them slightly and I love doing that in a natural way where other than all the added sugar from typical fruit snacks again we did corresponding mold so for orange I did the orange mold and look how cute they are when they're done little oranges next up we're making our strawberry gummies and for this I did some fresh juicing of strawberries I got to admit I don't think I've ever do strawberries before but they're really good I added a tablespoon of lime juice to this one and it just really complimented the flavor I made them a little bit more tangy but for the gummies it was perfect I had a little bit of honey and then did the gelatin I also let that sit on the stove I added the honey on this one after it was already starting to get warm you can do it either way and then once it was dissolved then I filled up our molds one of the nice things about this kit that it has two of the droppers in it number one you're able to get really precise but also you can fill up molds and let your kids help too so as long as they're you know old enough to be careful it's kind of a fun little mommy-and-me project and of course they're going to want to eat them even more if they're helping along the way so I love that about these now if you do what I did and you forget to put your molds on the trays never fear because the car that they insert it works perfectly so I'd realized that I hadn't showed you how to pop these out of the mold yet so I figured I would show you on the strawberry you can see they just come out really easily I think it's all about having the right proportion of the gelatin you're using and the fruit juice but any juice will do last step we are making our Apple and spinach gummies these taste so good and I love that they're green thin and with the Apple it just was really cute and you don't taste the spinach really at all but you still get all the good nutrients this one I actually added three or four handfuls of spinach and like I said you don't taste it at all so we had our fresh juice gelatin let it sit cooked it on the stove and then put it in the frigerator for 30 minutes and there you go they're great in school lunches anything you're doing with the kids and I have to be honest our kids hadn't ever had gummies until I got this kit and started making them which one's your favorite camp ain't it enjoy them igloo and I'm gonna shower you in and they're laughing would you like to wall it well I hope you guys enjoyed the video a thumbs up if you did don't forget to share it on social media if you want to share with your friends how they can make natural gummies with fresh juice and we'll see you guys soon bye girls", "u0Q43FP5gK8": "do you like Nicole Kidman do you know we [ __ ] all know she is is she how old hi everyone welcome back to my channel my name is Stephanie and today we are back with

okay it's like Velveeta instant mac and cheese try this weird butter not really well it's very happy at school on spaghetti oh you came early so this is what school kids are eating oh yeah oh yeah okay maybe worse yeah you know what's weird I really like to school lunch my mom he thought that Americans eat mayonnaise with everything I don't know who told you what's true that's still how I eat it today I mean ranch is pretty good have each other mayonnaise have you tried that mmm this is really good oh really yeah it looks pretty bad but better than the school lunch for sure inside it looks very strange very interesting right tastes like Bobo it is Bobo is non-stop with his dad jokes these days because now someone laughs at them what about those okay oh wow this one's very grounded that is good Mela is way better with these drinks here why you give so many weird drinks it's coffee you cut the bag open you stick a straw and copy it of a I go today I'm gonna tell you guys very intense story this story is a movie you've been watching a lot of movies okay so this movie is called before I go to sleep earlier today I was trying to so I think that he likes it he goes today because he likes and I talk about movies because he thinks it's really entertaining a movie goes what's it called then I go before I go to sleep I go let me guess let me guess let me guess before she goes to sleep someone something happened someone tries to kill her and she woke up it was a dream but the fact that I don't watch this I feel like I slightly watch this and then really had to fully sit down and watch it recently and it has Nicole Kidman in it and so it was like one of my favorite movies she's an amazing actress do you like Nicole Kidman do you know who's here hawlucha is is she kind of old this all starts with a woman by the name of Christine okay Nicole Kidman and she wakes up you don't really get much information when you start this movie she wakes up in effect I'll help you christina wakes up fully naked on you don't really get much information other than that when the movie starts and so she wakes up in the way that she wakes up is it a tumultuous way it's not someone who just gracefully wakes up it's another day another hustle another grind rise & grind not that have a [ __ ] okay she bursts up and she looks next her and there's a strange man that she's never seen before laying in the bed next to her and so she freaks out and she looks around she's never seen this room before where is she right see there's a door that's open a crack right and it's a bathroom and she realizes she has no clothes I quietly gets up out of bed goes into the bathroom closes the door and immediately she sees something that scares her mm-hmm Wow full of pictures of her wedding day on their vacations graduation and she's looking at it she's so confused and she opens the door and he's sitting on the edge of the bed she says who are you because my name is Ben we've been married for 16 years you have amnesia you were in a terrible car accident you had a very bad head trauma and you only retain information for a day every time you go to sleep your brain resets and we start all over but what what movie is this horror thriller psychological oh I like that it's like the only movie genre that I love psychological thriller huh I don't know why it's just getting better and better are you good for me yes banana and milk he says you know every day you're back in your early 20s when you had that accident and we've been married for like 16 years so she's kind of hesitant but she believes him he walks her through the house he starts getting ready for work he puts on a suit there's giant white boys in the kitchen and he says you have a headache this is where the medicine is this is where other medicines are these are numbers for calling me these are the local hospitals blah blah blah blah blah she's looking at it and so it says pack your bags on the whiteboard and she says what am i packing my bags for and Ben goes well it's our anniversary and I wanted to take you somewhere nice so pack your bags we'll go to a nice hotel I think you'll really like it he leaves for work he drives off and suddenly the phone rings she goes hello and someone says hi Christine this is dr. Nash I know what that means nothing to you I know you won't remember anything because you just woke up I want you to walk to your wardrobe and inside of your closet on the bottom right corner you have a shoe box open up the shoe box there's a camera now watch everything inside of that camera and call me late my god and so she hangs up the phone she rushes into her closet finds a shoebox with a camera and she starts playing every video clip it's like a vlog and the first frame is of her in that bathroom saying hi my name is Christine I'm an amnesiac by the next morning I'll forget everything I'll forget that I am in my early 20s I'll wake up thinking I have my whole life ahead of me when in reality I'm about halfway done yeah and then she said and then it's a flashback to two weeks prior so that's current day well we're gonna go two weeks prior two weeks ago you'll flash back to her sitting in the car and the passenger side with a different man that looks nothing like van her husband right and they're driving the man will start saying things like hi I'm dr. Nash I know it's kind of crazy I normally don't do visits like this where I pick up a patient from their home and take them to my office and then drop them off and your husband doesn't even know that you're seeing me right and then she's like no he doesn't know he's like okay very interesting I'm just surprised to that I saw you at the park you know a lot of people were writing about you in the medical field she's like a lot of people at the park and he's like yeah you were sitting there at this little mountain side like hillside Park and I remembered seeing your pictures in the papers and in a lot of medical studies and I introduced myself and that's how we got started on this and she said oh yeah yeah I know I know it must have been a really bad accident if you know the newspapers were writing about it yeah and he goes what do you mean and she goes I mean was it on the highway or something and he looks at her and goes Christine what are you talking about and she says I was in a car accident that's why I have head trauma and that's why I'm an amnesiac me says no you are left for dead you were beaten someone had repeatedly hit you on the head blunt force trauma you were left in a parking lot completely naked and you almost died what and she says what no that's insane that's I don't believe you I mean Ben told me this morning that I was in a car accident and I injured my head and he goes I don't know why he told you that and he pulls out newspaper clippings and he pulls out all these news reports a woman was left naked in a a lot near the airport and she almost died and so then she's like what why would Ben lie to me why would he lie to me that and he says I don't know maybe it's just easier for him every morning to explain that you were in a car accident then I explained that you were left for dead and she goes well did they catch the person who tried this who did this to me no they didn't catch the person why what's going on Christine we don't know you're the only one who knows this you're the only one who knows who attacked you nobody else no the police couldn't find anyone and so they're not in jail and so he gives her a box and she says what's this she opens it up it's the camera the camera that she was recording on that she found in the shoebox and he says so a lot of you know my patients they do a video diary it's a visual diary blondish a a video diary and it's nice to be able to see your face saying these words so you really believe it and I mean I don't know it's up to you I know that Ben doesn't even know that you're here why doesn't he know and she says you know he's always told me that I've been through a lot of therapy I've been to a lot of doctors and it only makes me more stressed out at the end because I never get my memory back and I always forget the next day and every day I have to be explained to that you know I'm seeing a therapist because of blah blah blah right and she said so I stopped seeing people for a really long time he says well maybe it's a good idea to not let Ben know that you have a visual diary because subconsciously you might think that in the morning you'll forget and so you won't be as free and open because you think Ben might hear your conscious deepest darkest thoughts you know and this is for you to remember things and so she said okay and he said and I will call you every single morning to let you know where that video camera is so just put it I don't know in your closet in a shoebox or something okay I'm just this okay and so then he drops her off mm-hm and so she comes home the husband's making dinner and she goes to the bathroom and she says my name is Christine and I'm an amnesiac I wake up every morning thinking that I am in my early 20s and I have my whole life ahead of me but I've actually lived half of it but I always forget at night when I go to sleep Oh coming and she turns it off so it's not even like something died that crazy does she feel like it was something really bad no oh oh in the beginning yeah when she watches the tape she was that oh my god yeah and so then the next day right and it's kind of crazy the way that the movie sets it up is you don't really know what days are what days and I think that's very interesting because it's someone who forgets every time they go to sleep so you just feel sweetles claustrophobic you just feel like it you just don't understand like it just feels very hectic and so the next time she gets into the car with dr. Nash and he's driving and he says I'm gonna take you somewhere and it's gonna be very traumatic and she says where you're taking me and he says I'm gonna take you to the place that you were found in the parking lot and she says why and he goes it's actually very very low percentage of victims will remember their have their memories come back if they go to the place of the trauma and then she goes then why you're taking me and he goes to build trust and so they go there and on the way in the car she keeps saying things like I mean when you think about it it's kind of crazy spen could literally say anything and I would believe it because I wake up next to him and whatever he says I don't know I don't remember anything and so then he says yeah and so they drive they get to a little parking lot and it's like a very weird almost like an abandoned warehouse parking lot and so they walk over and there's these two shipping containers and they point to a ground in the middle of it and the parking lot attendant says yeah I found you here you were covered in plastic and just a plastic like me you know and they said like a plastic tarp so whoever did this to him really thought she was dead really thought she was gonna die and he was like yeah completely naked found you here I could like blood everywhere right and immediately if she hears an airplane so close to go by they get into the car and she says what was I doing near the airport dr. nasch says I mean I don't know I don't know anything about you since before your attack I don't really know you Christine as a person you know I wanted to take this case pro bono because I really wanted to help and see what I can do and so she said but why would I be the airport was like traveling somewhere do I travel for work and he says I don't know I mean there's a lot of hotels here near the airport and she goes hotels what would I be doing in a hotel I live here why would I need to book a hotel room and he says for lots of reasons and she's like what do you mean lots of reasons and dr. nasch finally opens up and says you know police reports did mention that you had sexual intercourse prior to your death and she said I was assaulted who did this they assaulted and then killed me and he said there's no indication that it was against your will and so she said so I wanted it and he's like that's not what I'm saying but the police say there's no indication that it was incredibly forceful and so she's like there's no way I would cheat on my husband I'm married I've been married for so long I I'm not the type of person to cheat and the doctor asks how do you know you're not that type of person and so it's just like scene by scene as well it's just so creepy she just slowly starts questioning everyone in her life and then another day passes or we don't know how many days pass all we know is this happens within a two-week frame she's at the doctor's office again and he's showing her lots of pictures in the dark on a projector right just picture after picture after picture and it's non-stop a lot of the pictures aren't even pictures of her they're just pictures of beaches pictures of just random things mixed in with pictures that she would recognize and she starts having a headache and she starts crying right and she starts getting emotional when she sees this picture of a woman with red hair and it doesn't like it's not a picture of her with a woman of red hair but just a woman with red hair and she says wait stop do I know this woman and dr. Nash is like you think you do this was in your collection that you left you know it was from your house from your photo albums I don't know who this woman is but it's one of your pictures so you must have known this woman and I feel like I know her I feel like I know her from somewhere and so she takes that picture home and she starts pacing and then her husband comes home and they're eating dinner and she says do I have any friends that looks at her and goes I mean you you had a lot of friends but did I have a friend with red hair I'm not too sure honey I don't know why that matters right now what why don't I have any friends no I must have had a friend with red hair I think my name was Claire oh my god yeah and he was Claire oh yeah you did have a friend named Claire I think you knew from college think you knew from college I remember Claire that was a weird one I don't really remember but I I think I know Claire and she said you're lying tell me the truth you know Claire and he says Claire was a good friend of yours yeah yeah Claire I know Claire and she says you're lying you're not telling me the truth he says well what do you want from me Christine do you want me to tell you the truth okay I will tell you the truth Claire was your best friend and she called every single day and then one day she got sick of the fact that you didn't remember her after every time she hung up the phone she stopped calling and she moved away and she never called you back is that what you want to hear why does this matter does it even matter to you it's only gonna hurt you and he starts freaking out and so she gets upset and she goes I want to know these things it's not my thoughts sometimes I get tired sometimes you know most of the time I want to explain these to you but sometimes I'm just tired too Christine I'm just tired I don't want to explain everything all the time why does it matter and she's like it matters to me and so she sees some pictures of her and Claire he shows her and just kind of walks her through a memory lane of Claire and her friendship right and he's like this hurt you a lot you were really sad and so I don't want to talk about it with you it's only gonna hurt you over and over and over again and so she says okay and so she takes the pictures and she goes into the bathroom and you know how all of their pictures are taped up so she taped these pictures of her and Claire on the toilet behind her and so she sat on the toilet turned on her camera and said don't trust Ben he keeps secrets from you he wouldn't tell you who Claire was and you could see the pictures behind her right and then she clicks off the camera emotional login is gonna cause trouble huh and so then she gets really upset the next day she wakes up dr. Nash calls her tells her to go check her video camera she checks it and she's watching the clip of saying don't trust pet don't trust Ben yeah he's hiding Claire from you hiding clear for you yeah and she sees the picture of Claire on the toilet mm-hmm and so she goes to the bathroom and they're not there anymore he had taken the pictures down she goes boil it and so she's like that bastard so that she thinks that he's cheating I don't know okay and so she gets really freaking upset right and then all of a sudden that day she has this flashback she has these memories of Claire and she remembers this one memory where she's so young and she's in a bathroom and she's throwing up and Claire walks in and goes Christine are you okay mm-hmm she likes back and goes I think I'm pregnant mm-hmm and then she suddenly remembers I feel like I have a son do I have a son somewhere and so she calls Ben mm-hmm while he's at work and says are you hiding my kid from me do we have a kid together and so he rushes home and it's raining and she's screaming it's a whole scene listen if I was their neighbor I walked out and video record this or at least eavesdrop because it was a hole and hugging punching in the rain scene right and they get inside and he's showing her pictures of her and her son together right there's so many pictures there around the time after your accident he got meningitis and he died he was eight years old I don't know what to explain I don't want to relive this every single day of my life I want to put it behind me and so I didn't want to tell you what would it do it would hurt me it would hurt you and I don't want to do this and so she's looking at the pictures and she's saying things like was that was I a good mom he was like yeah before you got sick before everything happened you're a really good mom you were the best mom and he gets really upset and she says listen I know that this hurts you but if you love me don't ever hide my son from me and then she goes to the bathroom and she turns on her vlogging camera and she's crying and she says Ben this is dis grief the sadness of their son dying is old for him but this is new for her and it's gonna be new tomorrow and the next day and the next day and she will have fresh pain and grief every waking day of her life she starts having dreams about her son so the first dream she had was her in a hotel in a hallway the long hallway and she's at the end of that hotel room she's in there and she's getting attacked she's trying to crawl away when someone hits on the back of the head and blood splatters everywhere which she doesn't see the attacker and she wakes up and then she has another dream the next night and it's the long hallway and she's still getting attacked when all of a sudden she opens the door and her son sitting there with the drawing mm-hmm and she grabs it and it's a drawing of a man but when a kid does it it's just a stick figure yeah and it says Mike Mike do I know him Mike and so she sees the doctor the next day right and she says I've been having these really crazy nightmares about that hotel you know I don't know what's going on I found out I had a son and he said yeah I knew you had a son I didn't want to tell you I didn't know if bed and told you or what is going on at home but I just felt like that'd be too much drama and so she's kind of leaning on him for comfort and it seems like they kind of like each other and he puts his arm around her and she's like I feel like I only feel comfortable with you and then he looks at her and she looks at him and then she looks at his name tag his hospital badge sues Mike says dr. Mike Nash OMG so she looks at him and she rushes out the car and she starts running and he goes into the trunk and he goes Christine and he pulls out a syringe and he chases after her what the heck what why and she wakes up in her house on her couch she gets a phone call she picks up the phone call and yes this is dr. Nash Christine don't hang up the phone and it had it been the next day yet so she's remembers because what did you do to me were you the one that attacked me what's your plan I'm gonna tell bad everything and he says I don't think you should I don't think you should trust back trust me I'll explain it tomorrow I administered a light sedative a lot of people a lot of patients that have amnesia their imagination in their brain wants to fill in the gaps and sometimes they get it wrong and that's what happened to you know though she hangs up and Ben comes home you know that day everything presumes as normal she has a video clip of her and her son when she was young the dad obviously Ben is recording it and you know she says what do you think about first thing when you wake up in the little Adam has and goes and then she's us yeah I mean she says is that what you think and he says what do you think and then she said something about imagination it's like a cute little moment and she just keeps rewatching it and crying and she meets dr. Nash the next day and he sits down and he says listen it's normal for patients when they feel vulnerable to you know have feelings towards their doctors now it's not normal is for the doctors to feel the same feelings and so that's why I have to have you transferred to a different doctor that was so unprofessional of me that I let myself feel those things I'm so sorry but I just need you to know a couple things I called that hospital that was taking care of you after your accident they said that you know before you left you never really left like a contact number claire has been calling there a lot and she's been wanting to contact you so I feel like it'll be good for you and your growth if you call Claire and maybe catch up with an old friend it might help in your recovery she says okay and he goes and Ben I looked into it I just felt like it was strange that there wasn't a contact number but been divorced you four years ago and I don't know if that was a money thing I don't know what it is I don't know if he loves you who she's like why would he divorce me is he like what did he do you know and so she gets upset and she shows up at his workplace she starts screaming at him like are we divorced how can I ever trust you how can I ever trust anything that comes out of your mouth you say that you love me you said you what we were married for 14 years when you divorced me four years ago so we were only married for ten years and he says listen Christine I lost you and then I lost Adam and I was a mess I literally didn't think after I lost Adam I just couldn't and my heart was so shattered and I just I had to go I had to leave I couldn't do it anymore I couldn't go everyday pretending to be happy every single day it was just too much I just couldn't do it and so she said oh and she's like I guess I understand that right and he gives her a hug and he's like Christine I would never leave you I'm sorry that I left you four years ago but I back and I would never do it again and then the next day she has a phone she calls Claire the number that dr. nasch gave her yeah and Claire picks up and goes oh my god Christine I've been waiting for this day I was always hoping that one day you'd call me and we'd go back to normal and so they arranged you eat at a park so they meet at that park together and they hug and she's the one with the red hair and they start talking and it's almost like old times again feels like they start talking about what happened Christine says I can't I thought you moved away that's what Ben told me and she goes I didn't live away and she was then why would Ben lie about that why would Ben say that and she was Christine when you got sick I was helping a lot with your son and I was helping with Adam mm-hmm and I was helping with Ben one day it led something else and we had an affair and I felt so bad I felt so she I felt like the worst friend I love you more than anything and so it was the biggest mistake of my life and so I I told Ben I'm moving away and I never contacted him ever again so she said okay she gives her a letter and she says but before been divorced you never thought he'd come back so he wanted me to give you this letter if you ever recovered Claire kept saying things like you never really appreciate abettin you're so lucky to have Ben and that just made her feel very strange she grabs the letter and she starts walking home this is at this point you realize that Claire her best friend had an affair with her husband during her recovery her husband tried to divorce her four years ago and then got back together with her and her son died she's reading this letter as she's walking home and inside this letter Ben is writing very beautiful words and Ben is writing this I mailed this to Claire I told her that if you are ever well to give this letter to you and I have to divorce you not because I don't love you and not because I can't handle this anymore but it's because it was hard it was so hard every time that I bought a diamond to see you to the hospital you thought that someone kidnapped him or the next day he wouldn't remember him and so I stopped bringing him he passed away and then I kept going and every time I came you were you were so distraught because you were so confused and so I stopped going I stopped going for a couple days and I called the nurses and I said you know house Christine doing and they said she seems happy he said does she remember me does she remember Adam no she hasn't asked about you guys and so I felt like maybe you were happier without knowing maybe you were happier just being happy with the nurses that's sad and so I love you more than anything but I want to make sure that all of us are happy and sometimes you're happier without me mm-hmm and so she's reading this and she's walking home and she gets home and she picks up the camera and she says Ben I think I know now that you love me and I think I know that I love you and I think I know that I trust you more than anything by this time you'll know everything that's happened and I'm just so happy that like we've gotten to this place and she cuts the camera the next scene that you see is of her sitting on the dining table and Ben is watching that clip with her and she's so happy and she's looking at it right and then he looks at her and goes what do you mean up by now I'll know everything and she says so two weeks ago I started seeing a doctor now we're back to speed okay so we're president this was the night before this is the last night before the pack your bags and so then she says you know I for two weeks now I've been seeing a doctor mm-hmm who's been trying to help me remember and he stands up mm-hmm and he slaps her across the face and she doesn't understand what's going on and she's shaken and she's so weirded out and so she grabs her phone and she calls dr. Nash and says dr. Nash I told him and he's so mad at me I don't know what to do I don't know what to do and he's like okay just wait let me see if I can do something let me see if I can head over there are you sure he's like that angel she's like I don't know he walked away maybe he was just angry in that moment I I don't know I don't know and so then she hangs up the phone and she's like walking around and all of a sudden she gets a call and so she picks up the phone and she says hello and it's Clare and Clare goes Christine where are you and she goes me right now I'm at home why and she goes you need to leave the house and she goes why and she goes described to me describe to me what Ben looks like does does Ben have a scar on his face no why Christine I talked to Ben earlier today and he says he hasn't seen you in years oh I don't know who you're living with would you need to get out of the house do you know your address I don't know my address you need to get out of the house you need to get out of the house and she hangs up oh my god I just got a chill down that's fine holy I didn't expect that and so then we're flashing forward to the movie beginning where she's looking at the whiteboard and it says pack your bags and then she gets a pop dr. nasch you need to go and check out the camera blah blah blah and she watches it and the last clip is of her saying you can trust back and so she thinks that she can trust Ben right yeah and so she's kind of walking around the house packing her bags so just to get it right after that haul front clear she fell she fell asleep so buddy knows everything yeah yeah I think she recorded yeah with I love Ben so Ben thinks everything is back to normal FN know about the walkers yeah yeah but he thinks everything is back to normal because everything's good on the lock - yeah and so back to that anniversary now right yeah and so she so Ben's trying to kidnap her somewhere else - yeah are and he's outside the house but he's pretending to be at work and he calls the house son he has her cell phone and Claire keeps calling it mm-hmm and he says I'm so excited for tonight you know just you know be excited and she's like I'm excited and so she packs her bags and the next frame you see is of them at the hotel in her dreams and they walk down that long hallway and they go into the hotel room and she says wait a second why are we had a hotel near the airport and she sees planes go by and so he goes he sits on the bed and says it's a long story suddenly being in that hotel room she remembers yesterday and so she goes where is Ben and she's looking at him and he goes what do you mean where is Ben bettan left you Ben left you he couldn't handle it he said he loved you but you had some head trauma and you don't remember things and so he left you and she goes what do you mean and he goes all I had to do was walk into that hospital where he left you after you divorced you and say hi I'm Ben and I need to take her home boom and guess what they just let you go with me what nice smile and some fake documents can do and she said what and he goes but don't you think that if people actually cared about you that wouldn't have happened don't you think that if Ben actually cared about you he would have tried to find you by now he would have found him by now he didn't even try to reach out to you so I'm sick of this from now on we're not leaving this hotel as Ben and Christine we're leaving this hotel as Mike and Christine and so she's really creeped out right and so she's like hesitant okay and then he's like listen I love you and she's so confused and she starts having these flashbacks and she was having an affair with Mike while she was married to Ben when they were having affair in this hotel room and he said listen let's get married and she said are you kidding I married it already and he's like no we need to get married you need to leave your husband and she refused and he got so mad mm-hmm and then she tried to leave the hotel room and he started beating her whoa because if he can't have her no one can mm-hmm and so at this point she's really scared she remembers everything that she's really scared and she's like but who will take care of you who's gonna love you I love you more than anything Christine yeah you know that okay I mean I guess there's nothing else she can do by it yeah and so he's like come here just give me a hug and so then she goes up to him and she seems like it seems like she's gonna leave like that and he puts his arms around her mm-hmm and he goes they've completely forgotten about you anyway and she goes they they what do you mean they and he looks at her and she goes is my son alive and he freezes and you never [ __ ] with a mom and so she starts going ballistic a huge huge fight ensues he tries to kill her again he tries to bash her head into like a wine thing it's a huge fight she somehow manages to get out of the hotel room pull the fire alarm paramedics show up all of these police show up he gets arrested and she has that vlog camera because he brought it to the hotel room because he wanted to delete all the footage to start fresh she wouldn't remember anything and so she grabs it she goes my name is Christine Eminem niak and she starts all over uh-huh and she wakes up in this hospital and dr. Nash's there uh-huh he says it's okay he's been caught and he's going away for a really long time but I think it's time for the next step of your recovery and she goes what do you mean and he goes do you remember who Ben is and she was my husband and he was Ben's here uh-huh and he wants to see you and so then Ben comes into the room and she remembers him he has a scar on his face uh-huh and they're talking and she's you know he's apologizing he's saying I've always loved you I never forgot about you and then he says I have someone who wants to meet you oh the sun and then the sun walks in and he's a lot older he's a teenager now oh and he looks very scared and she looks scared and he goes and walks up turn sits down and holds her hand and she says what's the first thing you think about when you wake up is what's for breakfast what about you and she says something about imagination he goes you remembered and then they hug is that a that's hmm Wow Wow how was it Ben of yourself

really little my parents would take us to see my taipoi that's great grandma so we used to live around that area and then my parents would take me and my two siblings and stuff us into the car and we'd drive into the city to go see my taipoi it was like a 20 minute drive with three tiny children so when we got there we'd have to walk down this long hall i remember it's smelling of old people and being mostly dark but there's a large window that you'd be able to see the city out of and not like busy street underneath we'd have to walk all the way down and go up to my paws apartment and we knock on that door waiting for her to to come to the door when my thai paw would answer the door uh we'd all be welcomed inside with a big hug i remember she was a very old looking asian lady this is a stock photo i do not have any photos of just her but i what i do remember is her eyes her eyes were crusted shut and i think she was partially blind but anyways she would still welcome me and my siblings into her tiny cramped apartment all of us waiting on the bed as she would talk to my mom after they have talked for a bit we would have to get going so my taipoi would give each of me and my siblings at least one of these mango gummies we'd always be super excited to get these and we'd always try to get her to give us more but she would only normally give us one or two and then we'd go back down the hallway and back into the car where we'd enjoy the sweets now on the way home me and my siblings would dig into the suites we had just gotten we'd open them up making a little noise in the back annoying our parents but i remember these being my favorite candies and they still are my favorite candies today if i can find them in the store most of the time i can't and the only time i really remember getting them was from my thai paw now fast forward to present times my taipor died a few years after the story told before but she's still remembered along with all the other family members we have lost on a certain day me and my siblings will meet up with the rest of our very large extended family at the cemetery and we will give offerings to the graves of past family members and burn paper fake paper money for them in the next life whenever we do this whenever we visit my type of grave i always think of these mango gummies and really the mango gummies to me have become much more than a candy it's become a way of remembering my taipo even after she has passed at this", "5RyTD1T9tOU": "what is up fam organic Ombuds back with the review with some edibles this time it's

old-fashioned edible and one of the most old-fashioned kinds of weed edibles the gummy that's right we're taking a look at wanna one of the makers of the cannabis infused sour gummies these ones your standard 100 milligram edible 10 different uh pieces at 10 each however these ones are also a cbd blend uh at a ratio that they actually have listed incorrectly there of 10 to one even though it should be one to ten the way they have it listed in that it is 10 milligrams of thc per piece one milligram of cbd per piece 100 milligrams of thc total 10 milligrams of cbd total in this package in these strawberry gummies i picked this up and i accidentally already opened it was recording didn't realize my bad haven't tried any i picked these up for 18 bucks at a dispensary here in long beach california which is a slight premium i would say over there traditional gummy edibles which probably average about 15 so a definite premium there not a whole lot but something to notice and again it doesn't have that nominal amount of cbd in it which i'm curious if it's going to have an effect on me that's not a lot of cbd i'm guessing it probably won't but we'll be on the lookout for it um and on here as well as all the good stuff you want to see they've got lab testing results although this is nearly a year old at this point which is a little disconcerting but whatever uh nutrition information all that good stuff so let's go ahead and take a look at the most important stuff the gummies themselves these 18 gummies and here you go looks just like that 10 of these squares in there oh smells very strawberry not very weedy at all mostly just strawberry well let's go ahead and give it a bite give it a test see what it's like gummy weedy strawberry a lot of wheat flavor actually more wheat flavor than i was expecting not grotesque but for the gummy candies higher than average but otherwise a totally fine gummy candy nice soft chewy okay well i would say in terms of taste a slightly weedier taste than your like plus or your steezy gummies but not revolting in any shape or form but it's there uh but of course guys it's not the taste that we're in this for trying to figure out if they're gonna work or not are they gonna make you hide and for that well that's what we're gonna have to wait around and see um so uh any time i do gummies i like to try to do them under the optimal conditions i don't think i said this i did have a little bit of fat beforehand just to make sure it's going to hit me just right not necessarily for you or for everybody i do it just in case so i had a little bit of fat before just for the optimal thc absorption um but it's still going to take a while to hit the old bloodstream so i'm going to finish these gummies off of the next i don't know hour so do all 10 as we do here on wheats we review the whole product i'm going to review them over the next or as i said eat them over the next hour and then two hours after i have that last one or thereabouts i'll come back to you guys and give you our wrap-up thoughts the most important part of the edible review is it gonna get us high and for that guys you're just gonna have to stick around and i'll be back in just a bit to let you know our wrap-up thoughts about these wanna sour strawberry gummies well here's one for the blooper reels guys i'm back two hours two and a half hours later with these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and as you can see with my eyes they are pure as the driven snow uh and i came here with a really bad review i was gonna come and really trash them as i was like these are pretty um non-existent non-existent in terms of the high that i feel from these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and i was gonna say something along the effects of well maybe it's the 10 to 1 ratio and maybe that little 10 percent of that welcome back to wheats guys it has been two and a half hours since my first uh bite at the wanna cannabis infused sour gummies and if i look very very sober you're correct um i this guys is gonna be one for the blooper reel uh i came here to excoriate the uh folks at wanna i'm saying that these gummies basically did nothing to me all ten of them felt practically nothing and i was originally going to think well maybe it has something to do with that um strange 1 to 10 ratio of cbd to thc and maybe just that 10 cbd was enough to totally blunt the thc and but not provide any of those cbd benefits that was just i've said i was gonna feel like i felt just kind of peaceful but that's about it not really high at all uh and that's because that is actually the case uh i had it wrong not them well actually the bud bud tender had it wrong uh i ordered the one to ten and they gave me the ten to one uh so this really is 10 cbd milligrams to 1 thc so this is 100 milligrams of ca cbd 10 milligrams of thc the exact opposite of what i thought it was um at least i know that i know when i'm high or not and i was definitely not high in any traditional sense with these but that's on me not on them this one's for the blooper reel we'll have to review wanna again in the future this was just a fun little [ __ ] up um and an 18 mistake so uh wanna i am sorry i uh did not mean to disparage i don't know anything about you just yet i do know that my bud tender [ __ ] up the order uh oh well uh [ __ ] happens but we will check you out again in the future apologize for that it's been fun it's been funny anyways that's gonna do it that's gonna do it for this non-existent review here on wheats no cherry on top just a big shame on me thank you so much for watching guys stay high and more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you guys right back here for our next review live stream or even [ __ ] up see you then

own vegan cannabis-infused gummies at home in this video we will show you a quick easy vegan gummy alternative that sets up in minutes and only requires a few ingredients plus whatever cannabis distillate or infused oil that you'd like to use because this recipe is vegan and it's so simple these gummies do have a different consistency from traditional gummies but for those with dietary restrictions it's a great option this recipe is going to use a powder called agar agar or it can be simply shortened to agar this is a powder that you can buy online or from health food stores agar is derived from a type of algae so it's vegan friendly anyway let's get into the process first get all of your ingredients together you'll need one cup of fruit juice this will be the base of your vegan gummies you can use any flavor but in this video i used a tropical mango juice blend you can get creative and use any type of juice that you want and the type of juice you use will determine the flavor and color of your gummies two tablespoons of white sugar or agave syrup this will help to add sweetness 2 tablespoons of agar agar powder and this is what gives the gummies their gummy texture liquid or powder lecithin this is an emulsifier which will help to combine your oil-based cannabis concentrate and the juice which is water-based since water and oil don't mix on their own you probably need to use an emulsifier in order to make sure that everything gets mixed well you'll also need an activated cannabis concentrate you can use a cbd oil a thc distillate infused coconut oil just anything that's an activated cannabis concentrate here are the directions in a small saucepan whisk together the fruit juice with sweetener and agar agar powder bring this to a simmer while stirring constantly simmer for 3 minutes while whisking to avoid lumps remove the mixture from the heat and allow to cool slightly add in as much or as little cannabis oil as needed i'm adding about 100 milligrams of cbd to this batch and then you'll stir it well use a dropper that comes with your gummy molds to fill the molds with the liquid and place in the fridge for 30 minutes to an hour remove the candies from the molds and enjoy be sure to store remaining gummies in the fridge in an airtight container for up to two weeks discard them if any of the gummies show any signs of mold before two weeks this recipe is so easy anyone can do it if you have a hard time finding a gar powder or lecithin for this recipe we recommend checking with your local health food store or supplement store so there you have it infused vegan alternative gummies at home using just a few ingredients but this is just one way that you can pre-dose your cannabis oil into bite-size little bits and store them in the fridge so then you'll have them there ready for you whenever you want them let us know what you think about this do you like making edibles at home would you ever try this recipe have you

you all are having a big day today okay retake hi everyone I just kind of wanted to make this video I'm going to be doing an eyebrow tutorial not really like a tutorial like I am NOT a new guru I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing kind of like an eyebrow tutorial slash edible review slash me just [ __ ] around so I am getting ready because my brother is performing down on sunset today and I have to get ready because I'm going to go and support him Josje oh sure my eyebrows or something that's like really important to me like in high school if I didn't wear makeup at all I at least had my eyebrows build it that's the most important thing your eyebrows shape your face like there I just can't stress enough they're just one of the most important things as far as your makeup routine so I am going to be reviewing I have some kiddo candied pineapple flavored sativa gummies I have never ever tried this before so that's kind of why I decided to make a video on this because since I haven't tried them before I 150 percent honest opinion on them as far as flavor goes as far as experience and all these things I really personally I have a pretty high tolerance for someone my size and weight normally I consume around like 20 to 30 milligrams depending on the edible I know some people take like 1,500 I'm not rich for myself I'm just trying to enjoy myself I just want to live up to my eyebrows how is that not something that everyone so I got these per recommendation of my pleasure I was like I need medical it taste it and that's going to be infected a hundred milligrams of THC and the entire thing each piece is 10 milligrams there's 10 pieces so [Applause] okay we're just gonna pour some my hand and see how that goes okay Oh baby we're gonna go for four is a good number I'll try to pull myself we're gonna messed up a little bit by getting pineapple I don't know why it's available in our shower they're pretty sweet they taste good don't get me wrong but I just don't think I that was it for me [Music] - now they don't taste like wheat okay don't get it twisted it tastes really really good just makes me when structures eat one two three dummies okay guys so I'm going to tie myself 45 minute they not 45 minutes I'm going to be doing my foundation I'm going to do contouring pretty much going to be doing everything besides my eyebrows a little buster [Music] so I went to the and they found I found cotton candy this is honestly the best thing that could happen I started getting hired like 2025 minutes and it has only been significantly up from there I'm supposed to be doing the eyebrow that's right I decided to sit down for this because when I was getting super high I was just like enough this sucks why not set make things easier for myself so I have this product it [Music] my bread my powder Brett brow powder duo who's just so hard to say I've used this quite a few times ladies this little end it's like a as you can contrast I forgot it has an angled edge chicken the spoolie side so [Music] okay there see where the angle is handy now [Music] I'm so into this eyebrow right now it just goes to show how good the eyes I mean so just happy and like just having a good time I hate pizza right before the comic and and oh my god it only took me like 10 minutes to my favorite so evident the good thing about like doing your eyebrows is you can just like go back in there as long as you have please blend it out later so don't be afraid to say this is so sad immediately is dark the very bargain it's okay hope you find one we'll see what happens with this one okay let's get it [Music] - like I'm Kris [Music] maybe the tail is essential Oh [Music] okay so now this is also a very crucial step you have to outline your eyebrows with like get this [ __ ] together I promise that's a huge issue me out there she's gonna have faith in the process okay [Music] my [Music] so we're going in on the top crusty dusty trusty PT blender this is honestly a really important step because it just changes everything it makes it look so much more [Music] [Music] it really is just like life-changing just like it's a whole different I really like this really wise [Music] [Music] so the answer was bullet that's all see the continued struggle so I want [Music] it has work point to me and I see supposedly they're made with all-natural ingredients they definitely tastes like pineapple there since me and they were so light but I expected them to a little bit more sour just because for some reason I know I thought there were sour gummy is a sentiments so they're made with agar locust bean gelatin glucose cane sugar closed strings citric acid capsule and not just it contains you know food allergies whatsoever however are not vegan they don't stay organic they're definitely not kosher but they need all the requirements like their lot tested free of metals [Music] Oh two hours later everywhere yeah I think this is better than I know that there's CVT in years [Music] one of the best combinations you can do and I can I [Music] really like they see this on the party [Music] [Music] [Music] wait huh is purple [Music] this is like a cute I hope

started i'm gonna try one of these gummies first i'm excited to try these i've never had them before so this is what they look like the little mango okay so that's interesting i thought the inside was going to have like a spicy filling or something but i don't think it does unless i bit through it it's definitely got a very good spicy kick to it let's try another one so so so let's try the mango mochi next i have not had mango mochi before either this is not bad it's not super flavorful though so it's really sweet but honestly it doesn't it doesn't really taste that much like mango to me so let's try a piece of this fresh mango it's nice and fresh so i didn't eat lunch today so this is all tasting really really good so i'm actually not really a big fan of fruit in general but i love mango i love strawberries and pineapple there's like four fruits that i do like but i'm not a huge fruit eater last couple slices here i knew that was gonna happen all right this is just bought this from a local restaurant in my area so that's what it looks like it's topped with fresh mango mango sorbet and other tamarind and other spices in there this is really good if you like sweet and spicy stuff i think i'm gonna take that off so there you go this is so good even though it's like it's crazy because it's like almost like in the negative digits out there today and it's still so refreshing and the nice warm meat of my house [Applause] so this so so so well that is all for today thank you so much for joining me i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please do not forget to like

they got a couple different flavors 10 milligrams apiece 10 milligrams or 100 milligrams total in the box so there's 10 pieces in there they're gluten free vegan all natural flavors they got the mango here they got blueberry and then they have a 1 to 1 CBD THC so it's gonna be 5 milligrams of THC in 5 milligrams of CBD each gummy these ones are the strawberry lemonade flavors so they got a couple different flavors right now they're always looking to expand more and make more flavors but these are some really good flavor and consistency gummies with really good consistency in that like the gummy itself but also a good consistency in the effect so definitely something to look for something to try out yeah check them out", "dRCWeLKTTyw": "hey YouTube this is grant Smith from Colorado I'm coming at you live from the mile-high and I am just going to do a quick review here of another edible medical marijuana product here and that is the sour gummies by a company called wana I am not familiar with them this is my first experience with their product and so these are sour gummies really not sure I think that yeah they're about 10 milligrams apiece in terms of THC per and apparently it was made I don't know you got all sorts of information about the plants they used in different trim apparently they use some trim I tore this package up like an idiot so anyway these are what they look like and you know if you're into gummies and you're into that whole thing that's flavor and that texture you would really like these the flavor is great I'm not really the biggest fan of the texture personally so sorry one sec here we are you know here if you're a gummy pen you will enjoy them if not you probably just you know like me you'll be able to tolerate them and you know I'm certainly not trying to knock this product at all because they definitely tasted great again I'm just not a huge fan of the actual gummy textures so you can see they're covered with you know crystals or whatever infused I really don't know anything much about this particular process but this is what they they look like you know standard candy and that's ten milligrams of THC infused within this and that's a pretty good deal you know it'll get you a good little buzz going on and you know if you have a high tolerance level you may want to eat a couple of them if you don't well um I'm sure one will do it and so you know just again I just wanted to remind you all out there that if you're not you know here in Colorado or California someplace where you can kind of get these things with a little less you know going to the street kind of deal you know you may you may not really know how to use them right and so I just want to help everybody out there you know if you get your hands on this kind of stuff just remember don't go overboard with it you know you'll enjoy it so much more if you don't eat too many at once you can really make yourself sick and you know regret doing it if you just tear into them like that so anyways hope you guys are out there having a great one tonight and if you would like me to review anything or have any questions or anything like that if you want to see anything let me know and give me any suggestions that you've got thank you for watching and be safe out there alright peace", "1EtbenDg0YM": "Oh again everybody and welcome back to the channel in today's video I'm gonna be sharing my super simple gummi recipe but first if you wouldn't mind hit that subscribe button if you are new here to the channel and if you already have subscribed thank you very much and if you wouldn't mind please give the video a big thumbs up to show your support so today guys I gotta tell you to get to this point to share this recipe with you has been a long road by far this gummy recipe has taken me the longest to develop in the kitchen I have tried everything under the Sun on the internet to make gummies and believe it or not the simplest of recipes is the best and easiest way to make gummies at home now today I am just going to be showing you my plain-jane gummi recipe if you are interested in infusing those gummies I encourage you to check out my video on infusing gummies and I can leave that link in the description below go ahead and check it out but for today this is just a three ingredient gummy recipe that you can make at home now the cool thing about gummies is that you can buy molds on Amazon for anything you can have Star Wars gummies you can have worms you can have bears you can have anything you want it's a really just a family fun event that you can make in the kitchen and it shouldn't be that complicated one of my biggest critiques of the internet on these recipes was why is everybody making it out to seem so complicated it's not it really is not three ingredients go to your local grocery store and you can find them and I'm gonna show you when we get into the kitchen and you could have gummies within an hour this whole recipe takes about 15 minutes total it's crazy easy but I gotta say to get to this point I did a lot of convoluted recipes with bloomin and cooking and God it was just awful it was awful everybody had a different take on how to get to that point where it was a nice gummy and it's just not that hard guys I hate to break it to you it's not that hard whoever is making these recipes make him seem hard I got to assume Heather don't know what they're doing in the kitchen or they're really just trying a roundabout way to make it seem harder than it is so that most people don't do it which you know it is what it is but today I'm gonna share with you the easy 15-minute three ingredient gummi recipe that you can have and share share along with all your other friends and then again guys if you want to infuse them go ahead and check out that video I'll leave that link in the description below so let's jump into the kitchen let me show you what we're doing in there and then let's start making some gummies alright folks before we get started on today's recipe I want to make sure that you have everything you need to get started so first you will need a small stove pot a Pyrex measuring cup definitely highly recommend the Pyrex measuring cup a fork for mixing and of course gummy molds and a big thank you to magical for sending these gummy molds so the ingredients are as follows and these are the three simple ingredients unflavored gelatin flavored gelatin and fruit juice now with the fruit juice you want to make sure that it's refrigerated you want it to be at a cold temperature and that's key for this recipe so the first thing we're going to do is we are going to measure out our fridges and that's going to be 1/3 of a cup so that's right about there sorry for the mess there let me clean that up ok so now that you have your 1/3 cup of fruit juice and in this case we have pineapple fruit juice now it's not from concentrate and I think that makes a big deal I did experiment with concentrate and it just doesn't come out as well it's not as flavorful it's still gels fine but the flavor isn't there but the next thing you'll need is one package grams of just unflavored gelatin and so once you add that you want to mix it around now you can use a spoon I just prefer for cuz I feel like it breaks it up a little bit better and you want to make sure that most of the chunks of the gelatin are out and this is very key all right so now that that's mixed around I'll bring it up to you and show you there's no chunks in it all the gelatin is dissolved now you're gonna take your flavored three ounce gelatin and put it in there now in this case guys this flavor is just one of the flavors I like I like the orange pineapple it gives it that very tropical flavor and you can mix and match with fruit juices and flavors this is just one that I really like and so as you can see it's starting to dissolve and get going so now we need to let this sit for 10 minutes okay so we just let it sit for 10 minutes and while that's going on what I like to do is put water in the pot and get that up to temperature so when this is done we can get it right into the pot so right now I'm gonna go fill this with water and get it up to temperature meanwhile this has to sit for 10 minutes so I'll see you guys in 10 minutes all right folks welcome back it has been 10 minutes our timer has gone off and so right now this is the blooming stage of the gelatin so now that that's all set our water is nice and warm we're going to lower this into the water and we're going to mix it around now this process takes about anywhere between three to eight minutes depends on how hot your water is you don't want to boil it you just want hot water now you could microwave this for like two to three minutes and then bring it out but the last thing you want to do is burn the gelatin it will not come out correctly I have tried it in the microwave it is super simple but you have to be very careful so you have to check it about every 30 to 45 seconds once it gets past a minute thirty because every microwave is different so that's why I like the stove but feel free I will leave the instructions on how to use a microwave in the description below so for the next three to eight minutes depending on how hot my water was when I put it in there I'm gonna wait for this to get ready and meantime make sure that your molds are clean and ready to go so I will see you in a few minutes and again guys if you're looking to use the microwave I'll leave those instructions in the description below so I'll see you in a few minutes all right folks so it's been about three minutes and the gelatin is now a very liquid consistency now this is really what you want you don't want to really boil it or do anything like that you just want it in a nice liquid form and this is why the Pyrex is so important because you can put it directly in to warm boiling type water on the stove without having to worry about any issue so that's why I say folks that you really want to use the Pyrex measuring cup again you can put it in the microwave I just you know don't prefer it and I don't really like and I really don't like giving instructions on using a microwave because everybody's microwave is so different with the wattage and stuff and how powerful it is so that's why I lean towards using the stove now as you saw guys in the time-lapse video I added a cutting board and the cutting board is just so it's less mess it's not necessarily required but it definitely creates less of a mess when you go to bring it into the fridge so this looks like it's all ready to go so I'm going to turn our stove off here and I'm going to pick up our bottle and we'll just dry off the bottom real quick so that no water leaks in to our mold next thing I'm going to do is I'm just gonna pour all the molds it's as simple as that so I'm gonna pour these and then we'll go have it set in the fridge all right folks so now I'm just gonna have these go into the fridge and sit for about an hour meanwhile while that's occurring you're gonna want to make sure that you wash out this Pyrex it will become extremely sticky so you're gonna want to make sure that you rinse this out and get all that gelatin out of the Pyrex disk so you can reuse it and it's not a pain to wash so I'm gonna go to let these sit in the refrigerator for about an hour and then I'm gonna show you the final product so I've taken the gummies out of the fridge and I popped a few out of the molds to show you here they are they look great you know some of them have this like like a bubbly back that's normal you can cut that off if you really want just for presentation purposes but overall to get that you have to just get rid of that bubbles you have to just kind of like take a spoon over it just to take the bubbles off of it but I didn't really do that for this process these are for my own personal consumption yeah they pop out of the molds really easy you just go like that and off they come so yeah real easy recipe these were in the fridge a lot longer than I normally do is I just got busy here at the house and you know forgot about them so they were in there for about 12 hours you don't have to leave them in any longer than two hours but for this time we just you know left them in the fridge I had got busy but if you guys have any questions about this recipe feel free to leave a comment below or send me an email on that information will be in the description below and as always folks you can find me on Instagram and Facebook those links will be in the description below also and I really hope you enjoyed this recipe but until next time take care and I will see you in another video", "qE5u7lAcWfg": "hey guys welcome back to my channel in today's video I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make Lewis's enchiladas the last time I did a video like this I was just trying to make it for the first time I didn't know what went into it or how to even make it after I posted that video a lot of people were commenting like saying what I was missing or what I needed to mix it with or like just different things that I didn't have the last time I did it I only had this little seasoning and then chamoy that was all I had and I think I put a little bit of 13 but I only had like those two ingredients and some of you guys were saying I needed powdered sugar I needed the little Lucas candy these little powder things so I went and I bought everything I've been experimenting a little bit so I think I finally got it down to where I can now show you guys how to make it I'm gonna show you guys all the ingredients that you're gonna need for this you're going to need a Lucas a little powder I have mango you're gonna need some powdered sugar some fat heat or any kind of chili only one on powder so I have this one and I also have Tajin I found both of these at Walmart so you guys want to go look for this one this one is that one more and then of course you're gonna meet your chat boy bottle so I got this also at Walmart the candies that I'm gonna be using today I like peach rings I have some gummy bears I also have some lifesavers and then some sour gummy worms I also have three packs of guff go first and I'll have some gushes right here if I'm gonna start with putting chamoy in the bowl and then we're gonna make some powdered sugar in it I'm gonna tell you guys down so that way you guys can see I'm only gonna put a little bit of chamoy and then I'm gonna get one big tablespoon of powdered sugar I even think that that's too much I'm gonna put a little bit more gemway and then you just want to mix these together hey so there are clumps of powdered sugar so what you're gonna want to do is you're going to want to put it in the microwave so that way that came out you don't put it in for too long because it might burn so just put it in for maybe like 15 seconds or like 10 seconds in this boy I'm just gonna mix all the candies I'm not gonna do them separately because I would just take too long so I'm put all candies in this one ball and we'll have a variety of the candies [Music] so right now this is how the mixture looks it looks really really good my god my mouth is watering I'm gonna pour the chat William powdered sugar into my bowl of candies just toss it around a little that looks delish okay so I put that in there nomina and I'm gonna add my faheen and then this other powder that I have and then we'll mix them all and then we'll have our losses and Chicanos look at that you guys I personally like my caddies more like watery than some of the dry ones that are out there we're just gonna mix it up that looks so good look at that I'm gonna add some more Tajin and the other powder just so that we can have a little bit more chili powder oh my god I completely forgot to add the mango thing okay guys oh my god this looks delicious look at that this is exactly how I like mine so I'm gonna try them now I'm gonna try a gummy bear mmm that is really in the first video that I make these candies they came out really really sour but I think the powdered sugar really helped it I also think the Lucas mango helps like not make it so sour it kind of made it a little sweet but with a little bit of spice let me know down in the comments if you guys are gonna try this or if I need to add anything else or if I was missing something I hope you guys did like this video if you did make sure to leave a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe and turn on your post notifications so that way you guys don't miss a video and I will see you guys next time bye [Music]", "WPakqUMCCIA": "So today I'm making gummy candy. I'm starting with a half cup of cold water,\nand to that I'm going to add three packets of plain gelatin. I'm just going to open these up, you can find\nthese in the store, they're available in the little box. I'm using Knocks but any kind will do, and\nI just want to add this gradually so it won't clump up. So just with a nice spatula or spoon make\nsure that your constantly stirring. Stir, stir, stir. You can see it's turning into a gelatin kind\nof a mess here. Which is perfect, just what we're looking\nfor. So I'm just going to stir that around and\nlast but not least I'm going to add one whole packet of Jello, because I'm really just going\nfor it. And I'm using the blue one, but any flavor\nyou like will do. Just pour it in there and again stir it around\nso nothing will clump up. So that is it, I'm going to take my candy\nand I'm going to move it to I have a pot of water simmering on this stove. And then I'm just going to heat it up inside\nthis pot of water. So I'm using a glass measurement cup and I'm\njust letting the heat from the water, kind of heat up my mixture. So this way none of my gelatin is going to\nend up burning, it's all very safe, very kind of a gentle process. You could also just pop it right into the\nmicrowave if you prefer and that's fine too. I'm just going to let that kind of simmer,\nand get nice and thick. So my mixture has melted so I'm ready to go,\nand here I have a nice cute little I have like a jewel mold. You can get any kind of plastic mold that\nyou like or any other kind of candy mold that. The little bears are really fun and adorable. But just while my gelatin is still nice and\nsmooth and liquid, I'm just going to go ahead and pour it right into my mold. You can even go ahead and fill it the way\nup to the top or as big as you like them. That is it. I'm going to let those sit up on the counter\nfor about 10 to 15 minutes or until they're nice and firm to the touch, to keeping them\nto the heat of your house you might need a little longer or a little less. But as soon as they're firm I'm going to take\nthem out of the mold and we're ready to go. So my blue gummy candy are still setting up\nbut I have some that are already done, so these are just the same just with a lemon\nflavor and a cherry flavor. The same recipe and you could see them getting\nnice and firm and chewy. Now if you want to get that kind of classic\nsour candy coating, you take a little bit of sugar mixed with a touch of citric acid. And what that's going to do is give our candies\na nice sour coating. And that's it or you can leave them plain\nor you can just drench them in sugar. Anything that you like, but anyway, enjoy. That's how you make gummy candies at home.", "to5i65TnyzI": "do you want to learn how to pick the right type of pectin to make jams jellies and even chewy candies well today on WTF we're gonna cover all of our types of pectin and how to make a great grapefruit marmalade strawberry jelly and even chewy candies [Music] hello and welcome to WTF where we transform food here in the modernist pantry Test Kitchen I'm chef Scot Guerin and I'm Jani Wang one of the owners of modernist pantry here on WTF every week we cover unique ingredients techniques we share fun recipes and demos so that you can get started in advancing on your culinary journey so remember subscribe ring the bell do whatever it is today that you need to do to get notified of our content it comes out every single Tuesday ok so today we're actually going to be doing a follow up to one of our very first WTF ever which is all about pectin because we get a lot of calls and emails here about what type of pectin do I use when do I use it how much of it do I use and because we carry so many different types it can be confusing so today Scott's gonna cover exactly what the differences are and of course you know a few recipes and common applications on when to use each one alright Scott we have 4 different types of pectin here can you really just kind of high-level how do people understand what the differences are or so we're gonna start at the top there's a champ actin and LM pectin okay first one we're going to cover is hm pectin hm pectin is that most common pectin that people are looking for something that you're going to use with sugar something you're gonna use with fruit if you wanted no sugar then you would go with LM pected but we can talk about that later and how that works so hm pectin there's two types there's rapid set and slow set and it's very simple once you understand what it's used for rapid set is if you're making home jam and you're canning at home you're gonna put it in there heat it up and then put it into your refrigerator and let it set or even onto your shelf and let it set you want rapid set if you're just doing it at home rapid sets perfect for whatever you're making now if you're doing large batches say you want to do a farmers market or you want to even you know industrial commercially sell your jam or or jelly you're gonna use slow set and it's just gonna take longer to set up you're not gonna have to worry about it setting it in the heating vessel or anything like that I'm just going to take a little bit longer now if you're looking for apple pectin yellow pectin all these names that the people call them fruit pectin all those things this is going to be hm pectin okay so when everyone's looking for though because they're labeled like that by different brands this is hm pectin which is high methoxy pectin so let's do a quick demo and when we're done with that we can kind of jump into Ln pectin because I want to show see people just how easy it is to work with hm pectin so this is a rapidset pectin we're going to make a strawberry jam but it's kind of brought up to the next degree right we wanted to make the most flavorful strawberry jam that complements the strawberries the best so first I'm gonna start with just our liquid which is a little bit of white wine and a little bit of red wine now you can substitute both these for rose' you can do whatever you want with it if you say don't like red wine or white wine use grape juice whatever but I like the the red wine or white wine it's not going to add any extra sugar but it's going to add that acetic acid is one of the things that makes hm pectin work two things make it work high percentage of sugar and acid so without those two things it really won't fully set up it won't get that jam or jelly texture like that when you spread it it you know stays really beautiful on top of like whatever it is English muffin like we have here so I'm just gonna heat this up quickly just to get a little bit of the alcohol off of our our wine but then we just have strawberries and we cut them in quarters if you like more of a pureed type of jelly or Jam just mash these up and you can put them right in there but we want them to be in quarters so while this is starting to steam I'm just going to add in my strawberries and the natural juice will come out of the strawberries themselves now while that heats up a little bit I'm gonna show you what you do with your pectin so I'm going to add my pectin directly into my sugar and I have a little bit of citric acid here that's also going to help that pectin set okay so they don't use any wine or any type of other you know acidic liquid do they just add more citric acid to get that acidity or do you have to add us yes so liquid it works below 3.5 on the pH scale okay to some people that might just sound like gibberish so what that is is you want to have a good little bite to the acidity if you taste it and you get that little kind of pinch in your cheek you're about the right acidity for what you're doing and yes if if you are making this at home and you're not familiar with you know citric acid or anything like that for about one pint of jam or jelly you're going to use a teaspoon so it's really kind of simple ratio that you can do there because this is one pint that we're making and I just use one teaspoon of citric acid and it is also to taste if you want to be a little bit more acidic balanced with the amount of sugar that you have to add all right so I have my strawberries in here the wine is starting to simmer I have some honey some nice local honey we have get that out so whatever your flavors are for your jam or jelly you can add them if you don't like strawberries or anything you could add any other berry to this and it work just fine and the exact same amounts and also vanilla so every little thing we can do to kind of accentuate that strawberry we're going to do it right so I have my pectin citric acid and sugar mixed all up in here I'm just going to move some of the fruit out of the middle because I want to get into that liquid and I'm just going to stir it in so now some people have asked me recently and this is actually great that we're filming this today because it was a question just came in and people were saying well don't I have to heat it then I need to put it into the jars or containers and then heat it again right so if you are using a sterilized jar and you are heating your strawberry liquid up to a boil this is also going to be sterilized as long as there's no contaminants between here and there you don't have to worry about it if you put it in there and you put the sterilized lid on top and you let it sit on your counter it will set it will seal that jar because it's hot enough and it's continuing to sterilize the inside if it is above 185 degrees which is boiling it's 212 Fahrenheit so as we're mixing this up you can see we just want to barely cook those strawberries so that they release their liquid I'm going to lower it down just a little bit just below a boil and let that go but you can already see the pectin doing its job by thickening is it at first it will thicken yeah and then when it cools it will set a little bit on here in the chute it should be all set look right I I could take this right now depending on how cooked I want my strawberries I can take this put this into jars as long as they are hot enough and they are sterilized I can have them to be you know canned and ready to go on my shelf or even into my refrigerator or eaten within an hour or so some is very simple to do to make a strawberry jam if you don't want to eat all that sugar we have to go to Ella and pectin okay LM pectin is a pectin that is Lomas oscillation which means it needs something else to gel it doesn't need sugar actually if too much sugar it won't work May and if there's too much acid it won't work so it works in the opposite way it uses calcium so it needs to have some sort of calcium in it to gel now the way you get it sweet because I did make a a grapefruit jam here our grapefruit marmalade and grapefruits are generally a little bit better they do have some sugar content to them but you definitely have to balance it with something else I use I'll at all xylitol there's a sweetener that we have here and it's very close to the same sweetness as like granulated sugar but you don't have to worry about it you know messing up your pectin okay so if you're going to be adding the LM pectin to this you would make it the exact same way you would just mix the LM pectin with the xylitol and then we have to add a calcium and the calcium you can add as calcium lactate calcium lactate gluconate I would not add something like calcium yeah exactly because yeah very salty kind of flavor to it and you don't want to do that you don't want to change what you're putting into the jar but the same method you heat it up cook it to the point where you want it put it into your sterilized jar can it and it's ready to go you don't have to worry about you know boiling it again and then trying to get those boiled jars out with something which is always dangerous so as long as it's hot going in and this is sterilized you're gonna be good but it's super simple until you go oh wait there's 2 LM pectins yeah so LM pectin like I said requires calcium and if you go to a store or you've used a calcium gelling pectin before it's usually called like a universal pectin which is like a branding name for it but the real name is Helen pectin there's two types the regular LM and then Amma dated okay and Amma dated is a word that's very kind of difficult or intimidating because none not many people know what it is I don't know Amma dating she changed so that it only needs a very small amount of calcium okay yeah between 10 and 13 milligrams per gram of LM pectin so okay very small like things like blackberries will just gel on their own and when they're added to it because they have enough natural calcium in them you can also do other types of fruits and you just add your own calcium to it but it just takes a very small amount of calcium and then boom it works so it'll set up it'll gel up you know as you make it I can actually see this starting to gel up already see it right there so this is perfect yep alright so in our cooled one should be very ready very soon then we wanted to put it on something so we made some English muffins and that recipe is gonna be on the blog as well we don't have to cover it too much is just a great little rustic kind of English muffin recipe yeah lots of nooks and crannies and yeah it goes great with the jams and jellies but like I said before you can take either one of these and then you can change the flavor you can make any type of marmalade you can even remove all the grapefruit that's in this and replace it with any fruit and this base recipe could work with anything so just know that as long as you are you know following the amounts of water and pectin it's going to work yeah and as always you can get all today's recipes on our blog which all the links will be in the description below as well as I think a really and dandy chart that actually lays out a lot of stuff that Scot just talked about if you're like I'm diligently taking notes but it's a lot of information don't worry go to the blog the chart will be there for you to reference so you can get this information at any time it's from my handy-dandy notebook yeah and I think you know well I want to eat this but like before I eat this one of the things that people have also been like emailing and calling in a lot about is you know like I want to make a pectin gummy so they've they want that gummy bear texture but they want to make it with a pectin so what can you talk a little bit about you know like what exactly is going on there yeah so that's that's a really common question is people are looking for a way to make a type of gummy that doesn't require gelatin all the time right and pectin is one that people go to because it's used a lot for this type of thing but when you go to try to make it it doesn't necessarily work it's very soft okay so when you have something very soft like that and not not super chewy it's called pet to flee or pet date if week depending on where you're from and what that is is just like a really soft pretty much jelly then you have it's not that chewy that you're looking for but to change it and make it chewy you actually have to mess with the sugar so you have to heat the sugar to about 235 240 degrees while you have the entire mixture and then there's also another thing and you can see we did an Instagram video of it cuz it's really cool once you get it up to that point you take a small solution of the citric acid so it's not in there already when you add the citric acid at the end it starts to gel Oh interesting so you kind of hold off so you're able to cook that sugar and that's where people you know don't necessarily because I'm here with pectin I can just add the citric acid it works yeah but when I do a jelly or like a gummy or a chewy candy I have to wait till the end because I have to be able to cook that sugar if I add the citric acid too early it's going to set and burn and I don't want that so so you have to cook the sugar and then you add in the citric acid right before you pour it into a mold and once it sets coated in sugar cut them roll them and eat them and Jane if you want to try one I'm gonna try one okay I'm going for the great what's this white one delicious it's lemon ah oh my least favorite flavor too late but anyway so I think just kind of think we also want to highlight here which is that when you do these you're not gonna get a traditional gummy bear if you do want something that's closer to that we would probably recommend checking out our Druids grow vegan gelatin and there's an entire separate WTF and and like recipes all about that but you are looking for to make a really nice pectin candy then this is probably the right product for you yeah these are chewy they're soft but they have a nice bite to them you're never gonna get that bouncing as that you would get from gelatin it's not the same product if one is a protein one is a carbohydrate so right they're not gonna work that way and we also wrote an entire article on it which is probably gonna be in the link in the description below so you can go there and read all that so we have tons of different things for you to be able to understand these different types of pectin so you can figure out what you need and when you need it yeah and right right before we wrap up I just want to take a quick 30 second and we should mention NH pectin only because it's pretty special and we have another WTF all about that so we're not gonna go crazy diving into it but just mention it because people are gonna see it on that conversion chart on the blog yes so NH pectin very simply is an L M pectin and amedeo Ln pectin that already has the calcium in it required to gel so you can just use that as a kind of a one-stop shop for your L M pectin needs so you can take that put it in there and one great thing about it thermo reversible so let's say I mess something up I can take it out put it back into a pan melt it back down which you can't do with hm pectin melt it back down and then I'm able to read jorrick can it said it whatever I need to do okay well this was a lot of information so hopefully you've enjoyed learning a little bit more about pectin and hopefully walking away with like oh yeah I think I know which type of pectin will be right for me in the future and if not at least you'll have their resources to go find out I would Nissim

then this pink Prosecco so that I'll have two different color gummy bears but regardless of color whether it's champagne Prosecco or cava the recipe is the same in a pot combine 250 millilitres of Prosecco 6 grams of agar and 25 grams of sugar get the pot on medium heat and bring the mixture up to a boil for one to two minutes agar needs to boil in order to gel properly so make sure it hits a rolling boil for at least a minute pull the mixture off the heat and at this point I like to transfer it to a smaller bowl to prevent it from cooling down too quickly next you'll need some gummy bear molds I just got these on Amazon they were really affordable and easy to find and place these molds onto a sheet pan this just makes them easier to move later then use a dropper this one actually came with the molds to stream the Prosecco mixture into the little gummy bear cavities [Music] place the gummy bears in the fridge for 20 to 30 minutes until firm oh now I'm just gonna repeat this whole process with the regular Prosecco so again 250 millilitres of Prosecco 6 grams of agar agar and 25 grams of sugar bring it all up to a boil for one to two minutes transfer to a small container and use a dropper to fill the gummy bear molds while I'm doing that I'd just like to take a minute to thank living gin for sponsoring today's video by using their egg our agar in this recipe we're able to keep these gummy bears which are traditionally full of gelatin completely plant-based if you're looking to replace gelatin and any of your recipes or are wanting to try out these Prosecco gummy bears check out the link in the description box below for where you can purchase the living gin agar agar that I'm using here there are also a bunch of recipes on their website as well as on their Instagram both of which I'll also link to and if you're feeling competitive and are interested in getting your recipes featured by them they recently started holding monthly vegan recipe contests where people vote for their favorite recipe so if you want to submit a recipe or you just want to go have a look at the submissions and vote then definitely head over to their website once the gummy bears are set up you can pop them out of the molds and serve one thing to keep in mind is that the texture of these gummy bears is a little bit less chewy than gelatin based gummies what I found helps to get that texture is just to leave these out to dry a little bit overnight on a wire rack something about dehydrating them a bit gives them that really nice chewy gummy bear texture [Music] [Music] thanks again

[Applause] [Music] you", "BFThmrARMFk": "must be super simple three tablespoons grass-fed gelatin two tablespoons powdered erythritol like I said you can use the sweetener of your choice one quarter cup plus 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice and a quarter cup of water I've got it all laid out here this is the grass-fed gelatin now it's important to note that this is gelatin not collagen peptides so a lot of people will buy collagen peptides and be shocked when the gummies don't set up collagen peptides are not going to gel so you need gelatin and then so 3 tablespoons 2 tablespoons powdered erythritol a quarter cup of water I'm getting ready to juice these lemons quarter cup plus 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice then I'm just gonna heat them all in this pan until the sweetener is dissolved all of the ingredients are combined and you want it to kind of form a thick paste but you want it to still be portable and I'm actually not gonna pour it I used this little dropper and just like squeeze it into these gummy molds it's way cleaner whisk that together and heat it to where the gelatin is dissolved the sweeteners dissolved and then it starts to form kind of a thick paste but you like I said you want it to be warm and horrible you don't want it to start setting so we'll just heat got this heating over low heat I'm just gonna add the lemon juice water powdered or throat oh and the gelatin and then like I said I'm just gonna add just a bit so I've actually got it where I want it and I off-camera I doubled the batch up I decided that I wanted to make more while I was going to make it so you can just pour this right over the molds and then you can use a bench scraper tool to smooth it all out but I like to use the dropper so just feel like it's more precise and it's cleaner and then just fill each mold individually it takes a little bit longer obviously than pouring it but then you don't get all of the dried pieces that solidify on with a mold in between them gummy bears and we get more bears like I said I will link to these molds here you can swipe up to grab some they're super inexpensive they're silicone so nothing sticks to them they clean up really easily oops making a mess because I'm doing this well on camera alright so I filled all the molds I'm just gonna pop these in the fridge for about an hour and then I'll pop all the gummies out of the mold and they'll be good I'm gonna make a second batch also I have about some tart cherry juice for those shops that I wanted to make like the copycat vital proteins tart cherry turmeric shots so I'm gonna make another batch of these with tart cherry juice as well these are done I'm gonna put it in a jar give them in the fridge and now I'm gonna make now that the molds are all ready for me to use again I'm gonna make the tart cherry ones those will be a little higher in carbs but still completely reasonable per serving size cuz it's really not that much tart cherry juice I'm gonna mix them in with all of these super easy homemade gummies", "_qLXHN_lvhA": "quick video on how to make sour candy gummies you'll need one box of jell-o three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin which is about four bags 1/4 cup of corn syrup half a cup of melted infused coconut oil 1/2 a teaspoon of gore gum 1/4 cup of kool-aid any flavor and half a teaspoon of citric acid you also need a strainer that things spatulas molds and also a fan spray get a bowl of ice-cold water you need 1 cup of sugar 1/2 a cup of corn syrup and 1/2 a cup of water and this will be for later to make the gelatin you'll just need 1/2 a cup of water you will add in the 4 packets of gelatin so the full box [Music] make sure to stir everything thoroughly and then we'll just set it to the side until we need it later now you're gonna put your quarter cup of kool-aid or you can use water in the microwave for one minute [Music] now I'm going to get my jello and my kool-aid that I got out of microwave and pour it into a double boiler you're gonna stir until the jello dissolves on medium heat once it's all melted together then you're going to add your 1/4 cup of corn syrup again you're just gonna stir until it all mixes together you're then going to add in your half a teaspoon of citric acid and then mix that together until that dissolves [Music] now once the gelatin is squishy and firm you're going to add that into the mix [Music] you want to break it up into little pieces just so that way it dissolves a bit quicker stir until everything is melted and make sure the water from the double boiler is not boiling you do not want to burn the jello once everything is melted you're gonna put your half cup of infused coconut oil you want to mix that thoroughly now you're going to get your Gore gum and a strainer if your mix looks like this it's because everything is not mixed thoroughly so you'll want to get a whisk and now help everything just mix faster and more evenly now you're going to add in the gore gum and what the gore gum does is an emulsifier that allows the coconut oil and the water to mix evenly so you want to add that onto the top and then mix it until it all dissolves once that's done you're just gonna put the heat on low and then put it to the side while we work on the candy syrup side you'll need another pot you want to get a ziplock bag and a pan spray let's pray the Pam inside the bag and this is so that way the gummies the mixture does not get stuck inside the bag you also want to get your molds ready and also put some Pam spray on that as well turn on the stove to medium heat you're then going to add your one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and your half a cup of water you're gonna want to mix this thoroughly until you see that the sugar has all dissolved [Music] now once you've seen that the sugar has dissolved you're gonna turn the medium up to medium-high then you're just gonna continue stirring until it starts boiling Wow that's boiling you want to make sure you stir your jell-o gelatin side periodically so it doesn't thicken as you can see it's starting to boil and you want to make sure again that you just scrape the sides of it so the sugar does not get stuck once the candy syrup starts boiling you want to make sure it reaches a temperature of 260 degrees now that has reached 260 degrees you're gonna take your pot turn off your stove and just immerse it into the cold water until it reaches 240 degrees once it's reached 240 degrees you want to place it onto a cold surface not onto the place that we were boiling on so that way you can cool down a bit and then you're gonna add in your jello mix into the candy syrup [Music] mix everything thoroughly until it's all one color and you see no bubbles let's sit for about five to 10 minutes until cool so that way you can pour them into the mold then grab your ziploc bag cut a hole in the bottom corner also grab a bowl and this will be so it's easier for you to pour in your jello mixture pour the jello mix inside the bag and then grab a spatula to get everything out I [Music] personally like this method better just because it's easier and less messy then you know refund refilling those syringe or squeeze bottles as you can see there's a little white in my jello mix that just means that I do not mix it long enough so it can be mixed evenly so again you want to make sure it's all one color no bubbles and you don't see any white in your jello mix just so that way you can get the best results these are still gonna taste good but just so that way you know you can get the best results for these gummies mix everything thoroughly a hundred percent [Music] now that I have everything in the molds we're gonna put this in the fridge for about an hour and a half after an hour and a half you will then be placing them in the freezer for about an hour an hour and a half again now for the sugar sour mix it's one cup of sugar and half a teaspoon of citric acid pour your sugar in the bowl then if you want them a little bit more sour then put a little bit more than the half teaspoon of citric acid and then you're just gonna mix it up until you have a nice even sugar sour mix once you try out the mix if it's not sour enough just add a little bit of citric acid at a time just so that way you don't get an overpowering sour taste get some parchment paper so we can place the gummies on now you want to get one tray of the modes at a time when you take them out the freezer so that way it can be an easier faster process taking them out and then sugarcoating them you can either do one at a time or you can do multiple I do multiple just because it's faster just make sure you place them separate from each other so that way they don't stick together and then all you do is shake it up and then you have a evenly coated gummy and then you'll just want to continue this with all of your gummies [Music] these molds I actually got from Amazon I searched up weed molds and as you can see they have these nice emojis on them the other ones have these weed leaf plants on them so they look pretty cool if you want to check them out I can link them down below in the description just so that way you can find them easier and you actually get a pack of six with a little syringe as well so it's a really really great deal so my phone actually died after this part is like cut I coated them I cut them up and as you can see there's nice little squares and I actually ran out of molds and I use an ice tray so I use these heart-shaped ice trays so if you don't have any candy molds you can use some ice trays just make sure you coat them with Pam's so that way they don't get stuck and it's easier to push out [Music] so now that I'm done coding everything this is the last part the hearts this is how they look up close they look delicious and they taste delicious too now I'm just going to be placing my gummies into my bags so with the emoji ones I put six in in a bag these square ones I put seven to eight in a bag and the heart one since they're bigger I put four in a bag and this is how they look so I'm gonna continue doing them with all the other ones and I'm just gonna fast forward [Music] now that I'm all done this is how they all look like in their banks and then I just store them in the freezer until they're ready to eat so I hope you guys enjoy this video if so give it a thumbs up let me know what you think in the comments and also subscribe to my channel thank you guys [Music]", "AtBuPHTZGGk": "[Music] hi everybody Cheri Sicard AKA cannabis sherry here and i'm here today to show you just how easy it is to turn any cannabis gummy into a sour cannabis gummy or a fizzy sour cannabis gummy before i get to that though i just want to remind everyone hit that youtube subscribe button and notification bell cuz i try to upload new videos every wednesday ok this technique is super simple but if you love the flavor of sour gummies you can turn any gummy into a sour gummy i have a plate here of homemade cannabis gummies that i made but this will also work with gummies that you bought at the dispensary but i made these from scratch want to know what i've been doing during Kovach 19 I've been making gummies I have tested hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of gummy recipes to come up with a perfect cannabis gummy that has the texture of the real thing like that and that doesn't mold and doesn't get too soft and doesn't get runny and it shelf-stable so that's what I've been doing doing during coated there'll be a new gummy course encyclopedic gummy course coming soon so see the links below for news of that but right now I want to show you just how easy it is to turn any gummy homemade or store-bought into a sour gummy now I have a little bowl here and in it I have some granulated sugar it's about a quarter cup of granulated sugar and to that I have mixed a little less than a half teaspoon of citric acid you want to mix in about a quarter to a half a teaspoon depending on how sour you like your gummies this will add the sourness to it it has lots of other uses but and you certainly don't need a bag that's this big but I use it in my topicals too but mix about a quarter teaspoon or so into your sugar and that will give you sour gummies all you have to do is coat them just like that in the sugar it's that simple we now have a sour gummy if you want these gummies to also fizz not only be sour but can be fizzy in your mouth add a tiny bit baking soda to that so maybe about 1/8 of a teaspoon to this mixture I am baking soda will make them not only sour but don't make them fizzy too now if you've taken my DIY topicals course you might recognize this citric acid and baking soda combo from the bath bombs because that's what makes bath bombs explode and be effervescent but it also can make the citric acid be effervescent in your mouth along with the sugar so that's all there is to it just coach our gummies so be they homemade or store-bought in the sugar and citric acid and you've got some delicious sour cannabis gummies your weed [Music]", "uuGSQR_AsJ4": "hey guys when it comes to my kids lunchboxes I am always looking for healthy delicious alternatives to the processed stuff that's out there so today I'm going to show you guys how to make strawberry gummy snacks I'm Meg and I'm passionate about finding ways to make life with kids easier in the kitchen so here's what you'll need strawberries water honey lemon juice gelatin and silicone gummy molds so the first thing you're going to need to do is take your strawberries and turn them into your puree you can use frozen strawberries make sure they're thawed first you can use a blender or a food processor and then blend until smooth all right once your strawberries are pureed you can combine it with water and then head over to your stove start by putting your water and strawberry puree mixture into a saucepan add your lemon juice and your honey and turn on to a medium low heat and whisk once your mixture is combined add the gelatin continue mixing until the gelatin is completely dissolved and there are no big clumps once your gelatin is completely dissolved all you need to do is pour it into your gummy mold today I'm using these little gummy bear molds because they're really cute but they aren't insanely large so when I'm packing these for my kids that I usually use a smaller gummy mold if you can't find gummy molds you can also pour your mixture into a baking pan and continue on using a cookie cutter all right once your mixture is in your gummy molds you're going to put it in the freezer for 25 minutes my gummy bears are all done chilling all that's left to do is pop them out of their molds oh my gosh look how cute these are these gummy snacks are by far my kids favorite they ask for them all the time and I hope your kids enjoy them too thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe and I will see you guys next time bye guys [Music] [Music]", "XgI1MSNjojM": "[Music] before I share my recipe I want you to know the truth about gelatin it's made of animal body parts it can be found in many foods and other products like cosmetics it's made by boiling skin tendons and bones the victims are pigs cows and fish you and your loved ones deserve so much better the animals deserve better luckily there's an alternative so now it's time for the recipe you'll need to get some juice a gummi bear mold and some agar agar I've heard different pronunciations so let me know how you guys pronounce it in the comments below another thing about vegan gummies is they don't have the same texture as animal product gummies so what I did was I experimented with these three products of the three the vital wheat gluten actually did make a big difference but I found that it was clumpy and I had to sift it so I'm thinking next time I'm gonna try to put it in a Vitamix and blend it that way there are no clumps but I'm gonna let you guys know if I can come up with a gummy err version of this recipe the almond flour didn't really affect the texture I would say it just made the flavor a lot more nutty and the tapioca starch made the texture very very soft so I would definitely not recommend using that one pick whatever juice you want to use I'm putting in 1 cup of juice I have the heat set just a little bit above medium now you'll want to add your agar agar or agar agar or whatever you want to call it I'm about to put in three tablespoons but you can play around with this you could put in more figure out the texture that you like start mixing it in grab a whisk if you have one handy I was just using the spoon because it was really convenient in that moment [Music] make sure you keep mixing it and you can let it sit for a bit but keep mixing it just so that it doesn't stick to the pot you'll know it's ready once it gets thicker and really sticky I'd say about 5 to 10 minutes so once it's ready you're gonna want to pour it into a smaller container or if you have an eyedropper that would be a lot easier because then you could just drop it into the little molds I didn't have one so I just poured it into this glass container and don't worry if it overflows you can just use a spoon or fork or knife and scrape it off into the next little empty mold I had so much fun doing this I don't know why but it felt really therapeutic don't worry guys it's gonna speed up really soon you're not gonna have to watch me pour every single one so slowly [Music] once you're done you're gonna want to put it into the fridge for about 20 minutes if you take them out too early little break as you're trying to pop them out so if that happens just put it back in the fridge and just be patient it's not a big deal okay popping them out is also fun look at this cute little gummy bear they're adorable they're really really cute I almost feel bad to eat them see so you guys can make your own gummy bears at home and control everything that goes inside of them or if you're too lazy you could just always buy vegan gummy bears but do not support the companies that use gelatin it's disgusting and horrible for the planet the animals and your health thanks so much for watching guys I hope you enjoyed this video and learn something please subscribe", "V0tXOfJrk4o": "Oh again sorry Tommy bear and they have that guy in the background like they are the gummy bear 80s cartoon themes were epic she was going to koala show it was on Nickelodeon it was part of the pin wheel pin wheel spinning around look at my pan well and see what I found anyways I was saying me baby stay in the noggin hi I'm onna I'm a bun and we are those annoying beginning guys today we're making gummy bears but since gummy bears are usually made with gelatin and often contain honey bees wax palm oil we're going to veganize it yeah these are really simple and you can make them in any flavor you want you just take your favorite fruit and you throw it into a blender or food processor and you just obliterate it and then you take that and you run it through a strainer until you're left with a smooth root puree for the honey we are going to be returning to agave something we've used many times before and for the gelatin we will be using agar powder now a car is derived from a variety of red algae as opposed to gelatin which we know comes from the bone muscle tendons and skin of multi cows pigs and often fish we are also going to be using a vitamin C pocket with one of our flavors now we've found that it adds a penny sort of taste to it but you might like so feel free to use that with one or more flavors and get a healthy vitamin C boost while you're at it then as always this recipe is delicious affordable and easy to make so let's make it [Music] look at these these turned out really good they're so cute you may have noticed in the thumbnail that there's other shapes we took the leftover and we just filled our ice cube trays we only had one gummy bear mold so we had these ice cube trays and made gummy drops and granted they're not gelatinous because there's no gelatin in them more like Swedish Fish looks true yeah Finnish fish or sour patch kids and sort of the texture of a summer picture yeah they're tasty if you guys have a Trader Joe's where you live they taste like those fruit bars at the front of the trader goes the whole advertising campaign on the packaging is like 100% Apple and it tastes like enough they do contain real fruit which is something that you probably should be eating and ingredients you can read right we should come up with a new word it's a vegan word Pig Latin egg arias which sounds like a villain in a comic book egg arias you will be stopped this time he's also aren't going to be nearly as like sweet and sugary mm-hmm there's a gummy bear you can use real sugar but a gobby is a perfectly fine sweet replacement you know what else has sugar in it Brut mm-hmm we made a Totoro jelly oh this is before we started filling her ice cube trays with the leftover yeah so this was just sitting in the bottom of the bowl and it got rough on big RFID we'll be sure to start filling those molds as soon as you see the mixture gets thick yeah because if you wait too long it's going to set yeah take it off the stove go for it deliver right away yeah don't leave coat at all so there's a little history about gelatin why gelatin what pork a gelatin candies were originally inspired by turkish delights and even Japanese rice candy which were originally made with rice or corn starch in the 1900s we saw the beginning of gelatin in Great Britain with certain gummy candy and as for gummy bears Hans Riegel who is from Germany created the original Haribo gummy bear it was inspired by the dancing bears he'd see parading on his street and they were originally longer and then later on they smooshed them down to make them look cuter he started out by using corn starch as well but then found that they weren't as chewy as he wanted them to be and that's when gelatin came into play no more animal exploitation mean chewy candy people will argue with us and probably many of you that we need animal product it's not about taste it's about the nutrients and the vitamins and the buh-buh-buh that we get from these animal products we're hunters we borrow this is actually a case where it's completely 100 percent is a very extra yeah look I wanted them cure and there's all of people who think that we must have gelatin in our diets because hair skin and nails eating a lot of veggies no drinking a lot of water getting proper sleep there are a lot of things you can do so guys we've been really working on educating ourselves about nutrition and vitamin C which we added to one of the flavors it's actually really easy to get from just your fruits and veggies oranges red peppers kale Brussels sprouts broccoli strawberry grapefruit wobba a lot of fruits and vegetables contain vitamin C one cup of kale for example contains 134 percent of your daily value brussel sprouts 80 percent the half a cup of moong juice that we used in our gummies is your whole day's worth of vitamin C fresh squeezed orange juice like you take a literal orange and you'd squeeze it until the juice comes out you understand these foods they derived from real thing you can get your vitamin C with fruits and vegetables here's the key you have to eat fruits and vegetables I like to think that the Earth Mother Nature they haven't kind of worked out yeah like if you eat the beans that you're supposed to eat then you should get what you need to get right right we've evolved so gradually as human-beings where technology has evolved way faster than we have exactly not our core we are still herbivores from Africa that need to eat our fresh fruits and fresh veggies it's all what people want to see and want to hear and want to believe people like to hear that meat dairy eggs and seafood are good for you because it means they can keep eating it without feeling bad or feeling guilty or feeling like they're doing harm to their own body or harm the planet or harm to the animal but it doesn't make it true people love to hear good things about their bad habits I got my blood work done Matthew did and everything were you protein efficient you must produce protein deficient that is the one thing out of all of it that was horrible it wasn't just one check it the great thing about eating vegan living vegan eating healthy living a compassionate lifestyle proof is in the literal play yes dr. John McDougall got kicked out of an obesity conference because in his presentation in his slides he was alluding to the fact that this is one of the only areas of medical science where you can be obese and still give advice on how to defeat obesity I'm not fat shaming the general population I'm fat shaming people who are teaching you and your family how to live and eat and this means life or death for you and your children I think that's okay the analogy is if this is was the tobacco medicine conference and you had speakers up on stage smoking cigarettes or this was the alcohol alcoholism medicine conference and speakers got up on stage visibly drunk telling you about the road to sobriety I mean think about these three together you have fat sickly people standing on stage talking to your doctor's your dietitians and the press about how to get trim and healthy I think it's fair to point this out what you preach is that's a comedy yeah life recommendations you can or you that animal products are good for you and just looking at the results at this obesity conference as well in the program there was also a lecture titled how to retain obesity patients in your practice the art of attracting and retaining patients to your obesity medicine practice keep you coming back in the door a revolving door you call those boomerangs in retail oh I like it you want me to do it I'm not gonna do that alright ok ok oh you're not good as that no oh good mmm record enjoy blueberries or blackberries or jingle hmm why I think I'm gonna mingle try all the fruits that we didn't do oh so

and we're back on another great butt hole of a February day but there is one shining light on this February day and that is this video and what we're about to do that is we are making weed gummies whoa that's right we've made brownies we made cookies we made chocolates we made maple syrup which that was questionable I think that worked but we have not made the quintessential lead food which is weed gummies now I'm a little nervous for this video because when you're  around with candy there's a lot less room for error and there's you know big risks on the table here this is quite a bit of weed so we're here I have the setup of what we need but really we're going to be going back there for the majority of this video to the oven I'm assuming you have a whisk I'm assuming you have a little pot I'm assuming you have water that's it those are the things you probably already have now hopefully you also have weed and hopefully you know how to make it into cannabutter because I'm not about to go over that with you I have my fancy towel here that my sister got me for Christmas it says the food has wheat in it and in this house that's probably true you're gonna need sunflower lecithin I think that's how it said this one is like a heavy all national cold press Papa bah a link to this specific one in the description box in fact all of this info will be in the description box below because I'm not a reliable source now on to the slightly grosser ingredients gelatin this is basically like horse hooves sorry and then jello which is more horse Hope's exciting but this will give us the you know candy flavor the recipe I'm using is from this place called the canna school and then their recipe they say use a half cup of water but then in the comments people were like it actually works better or tastes better if you use a half a cup of fruit juice just has a little bit of a flavor so let me show you what I got so fruit juice is definitely not my area of expertise so first I got power eat fruit punch in this tastes like medicine so I don't want it and I'm gonna have to like throw it out this isn't nobody's gonna drink it and so then I went and I got v8 splash berry blend I just want something that's like a nice sugary drink that's not like gross you know but it's actually really hard to find let's see that's exactly what I'm going part  Dan we were at the store yesterday and I was like trying so hard to pick out a juice that was good and I'm not well-versed in juices like I said and he was like that's gonna crop sex to me gross no Michael what about this he's like what are you grandpa like it's not the tomato based ones they're her bunch okay so oh and the final thing that you need is obviously mold no you don't actually have to use gummy bears you can use whatever you want but I want to use gummy bears because if I'm traveling with this I want to go to disguise them as I get a candy this recipe makes about a hundred gummies small ones weak ones I want big strong ones so I got the cutest gummy mold it's like the medium size so this is by the modern gummy and they had a small size of medium size and then a larger size and there are like 36 of these in here or 38 so really all that's left now is to go over to the stove and mix all this together and the reason it's a little scary is because oh and I have to heat this up too but the reason it's scary is because we're cooking sugar and candy and if you I have to do whisking it as I mean as I'm squirting it into this so time is of the essence you know so let me get us all situated over there and we'll begin alright guys I have everything all set up my station is ready because once we start this process you really got to keep it moving I have to whisk this liquid for like 15 minutes non-stop as we go so I'm gonna do my best to kind of like show you guys but this might get intense I don't know and I don't know I'm trying to make this video funny but it's probably not gonna be funny because I don't want to joke around and then up my edibles that ain't gonna happen so we're gonna stick to the script today okay I'm attaching you guys to this which is actually um for the car but it works on the oven so we're getting creative here and you're gonna see a little aerial view of what's going down my dog is like you when you're gonna take me for a walk well we need to medicate first little Jimmy we need to medicate hey it's a girl Angie KB I'm gonna tell you what I'm doing step by step so first you turn this stove on to medium low add in the cannabis butter add in your soy lecithin powder and start stirring rigorously and then once that's combined you add in the fruit punch as you're choosing and then you add in the gelatin and you've got a like whisk a lot as you're doing this or else it'll get all clumpy kind of like cornstarch you know and you know just whisking away whisking away oh then you add in your jello powder you can see in the background my dog licking his dick so that's nice it's getting a little clumpy okay so then you just whisk for like 10-15 minutes and then I started filling up these molds which took a while I ended up switching to a spoon which is easier but yeah that's basically it [Music] all right guys the deed is done I don't know how I feel about the fact that I got some of this on me and you literally can play with it like special effects makeup and it's not coming off but tasty sense so mmm horse hooves that was pretty easy it did get a little tricky with the hardening but they acted online as if like oh my god it's gonna harden in like two seconds so I know I think that I did all right I lost the dropper like halfway through it just got too thick and it like clogged and it didn't work and then I just ended up using a spoon from my cabinet which made it a little messier but I think ultimately a lot faster so now these are just gonna set it says to put them in the freezer but then I saw people saying that they were better left out so I think I'm gonna do what you would do with normal jello and just put them in the fridge I don't know I'll let them set for a few hours and then I guess we'll taste test one right I guess so all right guys it's hours later and these things are set they're dumb this is how these came out they look pretty legit and then I had a little bit of excess left so I just pour it in here you know I haven't popped any of these out but let's see I'm impressed with myself these came out really good like normally I do a really bad job with this stuff but let's do the taste test so I'm just gonna eat this big one because yeah mmm mmm all right little gelatin II I mean it doesn't taste awesome cuz I can taste a lot of the coconut oil but I mean you know I'm not eating this cuz I  want candy you know I mean this cousin trying to get my rocks off so if you're trying to get your rocks off try this recipe you try one of the you saw I mean yeah boo tastes awesome cuz it's like very coconut oil II it's not bad it's just like you kind of want to get it over with is it a fail I don't think so I mean I guess we'll find out if it gets me high it's not a fail you know it's edible thank God we use that fruit punch stuff because I don't know how it tasted without back umm-hmm right no all right guys but that's it what do you think it was actually really easy hopefully very effective we'll see I'll let you know remember the recipe link will be below I'll also link where I got the soy lecithin powder stuff and follow me on Instagram if you want Angie Kb thank you for watching this episode of 'angels anything show and I'll see you next time good bye [Music] alright I'm here to report that the gummies worked thus laylee to gelatinous gummies did indeed work I am hi and also I have a pimple between my eyes which I've had for this whole video so you guys already know that anyway it was a success so definitely make them alright also Dan just up a Hello fresh alright guys more time has passed and they feel they need to tell you that I'm even more up now as you can probably tell because my eyelid is even more closed and my pimple is even more red so I'm not sure what's happening - then no okay don't do try these at home do you tres know Dan's rolling a great bodysuit [Music]", "tNZdQ4GXbu8": "let's talk about our CBD gummies that we sell here at AZ holistic plant health our CBD gummies come in two formulas the true infusion gummies are 10 milligrams per gummy they are square and come in 10 packs which is 100 milligrams and 30 packs which are 300 milligrams respectively the sugar-free swiss relief gummies are vegan gluten and gelatin free the entire bottle contains 250 milligrams in little small dot sized CBDs now the true gummies are low sugar but they are not sugar-free they come in three flavors mango green apple and banana we suggest cutting the true gummies in half and starting with five milligrams per piece and slowly increase your dosage until the desired effect is received again CBD benefits include mediation of pain and inflammation through the trpv1 receptor and anxiety due to its influence to the 5-ht one alpha receptor which is a serotonin receptor in the brain which brings on a state of calm now there's also an augmentation of Ananda mine when we put CBD in the body which brings on more of a GABA tone in the neurological field and helps lower cortisol which we know is a stress molecule all gummies are manufactured in a sanitary iso certified laboratory let us know if you've got questions or go ahead and purchase here online thanks so much you", "y0iRtNf13bE": "- Hey growers, I'm back and I'm between the two Grobos and I've\ngot some gummy bears. They've completed our recipe\nand they're ready to show off, so it's a little bit of show and tell now. I coated them with a\nlittle bit of refined sugar because they were quite\nsticky coming out of the mold, but they're really nice and sweet and nice and powerful. (upbeat music) Okay, the first step we're gonna do is we're gonna add the powder of the Zen Zingers Cherry Bomb. To that we're gonna add 45 milliliters of reverse osmosis water, and we're gonna stir this up really well. The instructions say\nto use a wooden spoon, but I don't have a wooden\nspoon here in the office, so I've selected this\nbeautiful metal spoon to use. This is on a medium high heat to begin. Once it's all combined, we're\ngoing to go with a lower heat. We want it to continue to boil, but we don't want it to boil too much. Now that it's boiling, I'm going to set my timer for four minutes and we're not gonna touch it. So we are not gonna stir\nit any more at this point, but we have turned the temperature down. Once four minutes is up, we'll be back. Okay, so that was four minutes. So we're going to take the\nconcoction off of the heat. Now we're going to add the cannabis oil. If you'd like to see how\nto make cannabis oil, check out our video in the link below. I'm going to add this whole\nportion of cannabis oil. I've made this before. It's nice and strong. We're gonna be making\n15 of these little guys. Great, now I'm gonna use the syringe to fill up some of these\nlittle smiley face cavities. I'm going to fill 'em\nthree quarters of the way and I'll come back and top 'em all off. Once that's done, we're going to put these\ninto the fridge for 24 hours. Then we're going to\ncover 'em in table sugar, store 'em in a flat container, and they'll be ready to consume. So that's the end of our gummy bear video, but we also have a couple of\nother videos you can check out. If you'd like to find out how\nwe made the cannabis honey oil that went into this recipe, click the link in the description below. You may be asking yourself at this point, what on earth is that gorgeous guy doing between those two Grobos? That's a good question. We've made a video about how these two grows are progressing. One we topped and one we left alone. Wait a minute, yeah, one we\ntopped and one we left alone. So you can check out that video in the description below as well.

your support has been truly awesome so I had a couple requests there for vegan gummy bears and as I said it previously in the past I tried it with epic fail and so but I am never one to give up so I kept thinking about the method I knew would have just something to do with the method so I I thought I figured it out and the fact that you're seeing this video actually means that I did figure it out so I've created a vegan gummy candy for you so it's not gonna be exactly like a gummy bear but it's gonna be about as close and probably with you being vegan this is probably something that you're far more used to anyway and and with that yeah so I'm really excited to be able to bring that for it to you and the one thing I decided is if I'm ever gonna want to pick up somebody rich I'm gonna pick up a vegan because seriously man if they can afford the Google's groceries or that kind of food holy mountain they must have money because that stuff is expensive so anyway I'm gonna get into the ingredients here and the steps on how to do it and stay tuned alrighty so for our vegan can of oil gummies you're going to need well now I'm just making a small batch because I'm testing it so I'm not a hundred percent sure if this is gonna turn out and I really don't feel like wasting a whole bunch however if it does turn out you're if you're seeing the video then you know it's turned out so I'm going to be using 1 cup of juice I'm just using a peach cocktail you can use whatever juice that you'd like just not pineapple juice because it has an enzyme in it and that will that I know causes gelatin not to set I'm going to think it probably has the same effect on agar you're going to use one and a half tablespoons to one cup of the liquid if you want to make it more so if you're going to go 2 cups of liquid then you would do two and a half tablespoons of agar 3 cups of liquid three and a half a garb so on we're going to use one tablespoon of blue a gob syrup a quarter cup of our can of oil now I've just used regular coconut oil I haven't infused it because again I'm not going to eat this so I didn't really want to waste it and there's really no difference whether I've got THC in it or not and we're going to use Gore gum as our emulsifier so we're no further ado and we're gonna need our handy little blender and a saucepan and a spatula obviously your molds and that should be about it so I'm just gonna get this stuff cleared up and we'll get going alright so we're going to turn our heat on - so we're going to add our liquid to our saucepan and we're going to add in one tablespoon of the aghasura that's a coconut it was a lot different than butter so what we're gonna do is we're going to emulsify our our oil and our liquid first when I've tried it the other way adding everything into the agha R it just didn't work so I'm hoping that emulsifying our liquid and our oil together first is gonna solve that problem so I'm going to use 1/2 a teaspoon of our agar our sorry of our Gore gum Gorgo Mogar it's very tongue-twisting if you have a strainer like a little small strainer strainer works great for doing the gums so because you can evenly distribute it all over the top otherwise if you have to do it with your hands just try and do it as evenly as possible just kind of take little pinches and sprinkle it around like so and we're going to get our handy little hand wonder and start blending this up [Music] all right so that looks all thoroughly mixed so that looks good all our oil is nicely blended in so once you're that it's all nicely blended and it is all one uniform nice uniform homogeneous texture you're gonna add in one and a half tablespoons a Gaur now you can get Oh Garf lakes or agar powder the flakes are less expensive the powder I'm pretty sure you would use at the same but you'd have to look at the instructions for it I just don't have a hue a lot of experience with us with it and a half a tablespoon is one and a half teaspoons three teaspoons is one tablespoon and you're going to turn your heat up to medium-high we're going to bring this to a boil and once it's boiling we're going to turn it down and let it simmer for five minutes so now that my mixture is coming to a boil I'm going to turn it down to medium medium-low and just let that simmer for five minutes or until it is completely dissolved and you just want to keep make sure to keep stirring that alright so I'm kind of seeing some oil the oil sitting on the top here so I'm going to use the blender here to see if we can get that mixed in there because that's not looking quite right [Music] so I'm still seeing it set up at the top here the oil on the top so I'm gonna add in some more I'm gonna add a little more girl gum so I'm going to add in just a quarter of a teaspoon this time [Music] well that looks a lot better all right so what we're going to do now is distribute this in to our moles so whether you're using your squirt bottles this might be a little bit thick for the for an eyedropper but you can give it a try all right so once your your syrup looks like this it's nice and smooth no lumps you can put it into your squirt bottle oops oh [ __ ] all right don't do that on the mold learn from my mistakes all right so I'm just gonna clean up that bottle we'll get this into molds all righty so now that I've cleaned up my mess now the bottle is going to be very hot so you want to wrap it either in a some doubled up paper towel or use an oven mitt or something and you're just going to distribute it into your molds now don't fill your molds all the way up to the top like I just did there that's an oops you want to keep them just below and that's so it doesn't create an edge a sharp edge on your candies now with agar you're just gonna leave these sit on the counter for a few hours for them to set they do not go in the refrigerator whatever you do a guard is not set in the fridge it is completely different than gelatin also has a very different texture well if you're vegan and you you use agar you know what the texture is like but for those of you too new to it are trying it something different it is a different completely different texture than gelatin I can't really describe it it is a gelatin but it's not jello it's filling these up and I'll come back in a couple of hours we'll take them out and see what happens right so let's see how these little puppies came out well they come out of the mold really holy mackerel they actually worked this time I can't believe it last time they were partially set and partially mushy and they were really disgusting but this this method actually worked so I did some reading on how you actually store these because you can't do them like a regular gummy bear or a regular gummy candy and with four agar actually it says but it's served best cold so actually once they're all set you know just put them on a plate put them in the fridge for a couple of for about an hour George's for them to cool down get cold and then give them a try so I'm gonna do that and we'll see how they are now these puppies just pop right out of the mold look at that lot easier than the jello look bear overboard alrighty so I put these guys into the fridge for an hour and so they're nice and cold and you can see how much they lighten up and as well they're not as greasy so when you first take these guys out they are gonna feel a little bit greasy once you put them in the fridge that tends that goes away but as I said you can probably see you store them in the fridge I'll just wrap them up in wrap it up with saran wrap and they'll probably be good for about two weeks I'm gonna guess if you find that different please let me know in the comments that would be great alright so that is the little tutorial there on a vegan can of oil gummy bears and I'll just be back to say goodbye so that was my little demonstration there on vegan and can of oil gummy candies I hope you enjoyed the demonstration if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I will get back to you as soon as I can and I'd love to hear from you and let me know how yours turned out alright well thank you so much for watching I really appreciate it and if you enjoyed this video I do hope you subscribe thanks again have an awesome day [Music]", "uBlyb3dh02U": "good afternoon we're going to make some THC infused gummies first step is to make sure you have everything that you need out so our items are a three ounce package of unflavored jello or flavored gelatin not sugar-free I'm using two packets of unflavored as per the recipe that I posted and 2/3 cup cold water I've also got my lecithin to the side to put a little bit in because that is a nice fat protein that the THC bonds to there's a little machine that keeps it to a perfect time without having to go back and forth to the stove also has a link posted since we're doing super Lemon Haze on blue so let's again box tile I like to make sure it's very loosely powdery because it'll stick together I said it is a plant fat protein mini whisk mix all of these powders together enter water so we want to make sure that all of the gelatin is wet and separated and there are no clumps of gelatin that are still powdered the gelatin is mixed and 15 minutes has elapsed the gelatin has soaked up the water so enter the trusty little heater you turn that on I'm going to go ahead and break up the gelatin a little bit here and I'm going to wait probably about 10 minutes to come back and stir it again back quick search it's starting to look clearer for the record I'm doing blue for super-lon haze because true clear has a blue label just like I did read for indica and I did yellow for hybrid alright we're gonna let it sit another five minutes so it's been a little bit I'm gonna go with that is as clear as it needs to work because there's lecithin and it doesn't get that crystal clear like if you're doing candy but it is quite smooth quite runny I'm going to inject the super Lemon Haze truth here into it that has been so deep and warming in a cup of warm worth yeah it's tough [Music] and what i'm doing here is optional ma'am I usually pull that off but I'm going to pull some of the jello up in give it a shake and squirt that back in we all want to make the most of all of our product so I'm going to stir that in and once again I'm going to let it sit for five minutes to infuse before we put it into the molds all right we're gonna give it one more stir then because this is gelatin and not egg I'm not gonna whisk it super fast assuming it's going to stay in there [Music] smells like THC so the gummy bear molds that I put the link to hold about a milliliter you don't need to measure but they came with little droppers I'm going to hand this off to my partner because he has a much better non-payment you if you drip anything cuz it's silicone it's gonna that's basically gonna be one dose all of the little dots that end up on top of the silicone yeah kind of scrap all those at the end put them together it's almost like having an extra Bayer we use the opposite color or a different color than the jello you he's gonna go ahead and fill the rest of those up and we'll be back in a moment on to another bold [Music] we're gonna go ahead and stipple some cornstarch onto the back I put these in the freezer they've set and I've let them come back to temperature to make sure there's not a lot of moisture so this is my makeup brush there's a link to this this is the stipple the flat top that's what we're gonna stipple with so I've got cornstarch I just used the cornstarch lid they've got a little folded up foil and a paper towel in case I feel like it's getting too thick so I just went to stipple along the back of these and if you feel there's a bit much you can always go back and kind of wipe something away the nice thing about the brushes you can twist it and if you feel there's too much corn starch somewhere then you can use the edges of it so I like to know that my backs are good prior to pop them out I'm gonna pop this one out like so now gonna turn it over and show you the quick way I just stick my nail into it and pop them out and then lay them out afterwards welcome back to the final step we're going to say it's been 24 hours these will stay out overnight these have been out for 24 hours they're slightly smaller because they've now reduced down a little bit in size once they have dehydrated a bit as such I stipple them on the top with the cornstarch and I'm able to have them not to be sticky any further questions please feel free to send me a private message or post on the video however you'd like thanks", "DGbITXSfySg": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is Liz and this is the first time you're stopping by and the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much for joining so today I am going to show you how to make real fruit gummies yes made with real fruit so you can use frozen or real arms not frozen fresh fruit that would be the word fresh or frozen I prefer the frozen however like I said you can use either and you can make these yummy yummy cannabutter and fruit snacks now your kids would love these too - the can of butter obviously but if you want to make a really nice candy for your kids just follow the recipe along it just exclude the can of butter and the guar gum and you've got a great relatively someone okay you're sticking fruit in it so we can call it somewhat healthy candy for your kids alright guys so let's jump right into those ingredients what we need to get started and yeah we'll get these made oh one thing I want to tell you if you are because we're using real fruit you do need to use a mold inhibitor lorraine's makes one so it's called Lorraine's mold inhibitor I however do not have it if you do not use a mold inhibitor you will need to keep these in the refrigerator you won't be able to keep them out for like two three weeks on the counter because they will get moldy if you do use the mold inhibitor however you will but I do not have it so I'm not using it but I just wanted to let you know that piece of information so with mold inhibitor you can keep them out and we'll have a lot much longer shelf life without it you're gonna want to keep them refrigerated and get the meat and fairly quickly alright so for our gummy fruit snacks what we're gonna need is about two cups of fruit so I use frozen fruit I just find it's way easier you so you can use any favorite any favorite fruit that's you like I'm using a mixed berry combo so it's blueberry strawberry and blackberries the only fruit that you cannot use is pineapple and I think also mango because it has they contain an enzyme that will not allow gelatin to set but other than that you're free to go so it's said you can use fresh fruit or frozen fruit and I said you can buy one about 2 cups we're only going to use about a cup the extra you can always freeze and save for later then a for our candy syrup you're going to need 3/4 of a cup of light corn syrup 1/2 a cup of granulated sugar and a quarter cup of water now if you have a can of syrup or can of sugar you can absolutely use those as well so again you want to split part of it so quarter cup quarter cup however you want to split that up you could absolutely use those but today I'm just demonstrating with cannabutter now for the rest of it what you're going to need is a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/4 cup of sugar granulated sugar another quarter cup of granulated sugar that we need to premix our clear gel with you're going to need instant clear gel now you don't have to use this if you don't have this you can eliminate it but what this adds to is makes that candy a little softer instead of being so gelatin like it makes it that softer that real candy texture loves of fruit snacks so this is an optional if you've got it if not you don't need to if you do not need you are not using the clear gel eliminate 1/4 cup of the sugar you're going to need three quarters of a cup of ice cold water or blooming your gelatin you're going to need three core three tables sorry three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin so it was three and a half tablespoons on a flavored gelatin and a half a teaspoon of citric acid 1/2 a teaspoon of gore gum now this is our emulsifier this is what's going to allow us to combine our butter with our water because that's a water oil mixture and you need an emulsifier in order to combine those two to become one so that they become friends instead of mortal enemies and that is it I believe so for this we don't need any extra color or flavor and that's what's really nice and now another side note for those of you who do not like corn syrup you can make a substitute called inverted sugar which is 2 cups of granulated sugar 1 cup of water boil it to 234 degrees as soon as it hits that temperature removed from the heat put the lid on the pot do not touch it again until it hits room temperature once you're at room temperature it's stable good to go if you want more details about how to do that check out my canna syrup video its basis in its making inverted sugar but with candy syrup just avoid via the can of sugar part that's all ok so that's all we need for our ingredients let's jump into our equipment that we need and we'll get going all right so for the equipment we are going to need two small sauce pans a whisk spatula the hand blender this is for emulsifying if you don't have one you can use the whisk it'll work you just have to want with really really hard but these are definitely an investment if you are going to be regularly making Jam and things like that you're going to need a candy thermometer now check this said I got this off Amazon it's a dual so let's pop the probe it's got that probe and then it's got a probe that you stick in the side which is awesome so I can just slide it in my pot and keep it on the side oh it's great remember the issues I always had before problem solved and you're going to need your distributing bottles these are a sweet sugar or bell I believe yes we took about I got links for all these equipment if you want just to make life easy you can check out what it is in the description there and then just a cup of hot water with a pastry brush or washing down the side of our pot that's pretty much what we need I'm sure I'm gonna throw some extras in there Oh obviously your bowls now a trick that I've learned with my molds is because this is gonna be a loser syrup and I'm gonna do two colors as always put your molds into the freezer that way wouldn't you put as soon as you squeeze it in it kind of immediately starts to solidify that way your colors don't bleed all together so it's a really cool little trick for you all right so let's get all those ingredients put together and let's make some fruit snacks so the first thing we want to do is get our gelatin bloomed and we'll be set aside and waiting for us so we're gonna add our three-quarters of a cup of ice-cold water and three and a half tablespoons of our unflavored gelatin and you just want to sprinkle it kind of evenly over the top or it'll be four envelopes of the gelatin approximately and then you wanted this to mix that in until it is well mixed and there's no lot and then while you're mixing this well how you can kind of tell that your gelatin designs your gelatin may not be thickening as well is while you're mixing it it should start to feel like applesauce the texture of applesauce now I'm feeling this is a little bit thin it's all dissolved and it's still not quite as thick as I'd like it so I'm gonna add about another half a tablespoon to that that's better so that when you mix it up and it's all dissolved that's the texture you want it to be so like a like an applesauce and then I'm just gonna set that aside we'll let that bloom and you need at least a minimum five minutes but it's okay it can wait longer okay so the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna prepare our berries or our fruit whatever fruit that you're using so we are going to put our heat on to medium high okay so the first step is our berries now what you're going to need to do is to prepare your berries ahead of time and we eat you're going to be to macerate them then what that means is I'll whether you're using frozen or fresh put them into a bowl instead about two cups you're gonna add a quarter cup of lemon juice and two tablespoons of sugar mix that all around cover it with saran wrap and put it into the fridge for a minimum of two hours if you are using frozen fruits if they're going to be about four hours or you could just leave it on the counter that's no problem and you want one you get will create this really nice syrup and everything will be defrosted dissolve whatever defrosted not frozen anymore do that ahead of time so the first thing I want to do because I've got a lot of seeds and extra stuff I'm just going to strain off the extra juice and those seeds now what you can actually use that juice for don't waste it is if you're a baker you can make a simple syrup with it so add about half a cup of water a cup of sugar boil it for two or three minutes and and that's it letter B and you've got a simple syrup that you can then use on your cakes to cope your cakes with you know those Decorah the american bakers and all that stuff hot they're always putting those things on youtube can do the thing so I'm just getting a little off that excess juice here well obvious I'm not going to get the seeds that I'll get those out after when we when we mush it down when we purify it so I'm going to add a quarter cup of sugar to that get my spatula and we're going to turn our heat on to medium high and you're just gonna mix that around we're just going to bring this to a boil for about two minutes my berries are coming to a boil here don't have better angles so you're just gonna continue mixing that like I said we're just gonna boil that for about two minutes and then we want to get our hand blender ready all right so my little berries and then boiling here for a couple of minutes this is just a soft in the month so that we can purify them puree them not purify puree them a lot easier and if you're using fresh fruit you may need to go for about five minutes and you're going to get your hand blender be very careful cuz it's gonna be hot and be careful if anything splashes up so we are going to puree okay so you're going to continue to blend that until it is completely purified all your fruit is completely blended and there's no major chunks and I'm just going to strain our puree to catch all the seeds and any fruit chunks that did not that did not get liquefied pureed [Music] and then you're just gonna work your puree through your strainer takes a little while just scrape off the bottom a little bit of a pain but you inside necessary to catch like I said if you're definitely using berries or fruits with seeds and also to make sure like I said any fruit that doesn't get purified if you don't want any chunks in your candies so just continue that until you can't get anything nothing else is uh working its way through the mesh and you're just gonna have kind of a puppy puppy mutt mush left okay then once you've got all that we want to measure out about it we're going to measure a cup of our fruit puree a lot worked out pretty even all right okay so now clean this off quickly it's a rinse off your blender because you're going to need it again and we are going to take our pure heart root puree put her back in the pot and we are going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid citric acids help key things to help bring out the fruit flavors the tartness and the fruit flavors as well as it helps prevent crystallization just mix that in and now we are going to you're going to premix up here our clear gel so we're taking a quarter cup of granulated sugar and we're going to take one tablespoon our cereal and it needs to be the instant clear gel the cook you have to cook it for five minutes boil it at a vigorous boil for five minutes and we can't really do that with our fruit so you wouldn't want to use the instant if you are using it they're gonna cut together we're gonna set that we'll just leave that there for a moment so now we are going to add our can of butter to our puree work fruit puree say that ten times quick so first drop in your melted can of butter let make sure to get a roll and sprinkle in a half a teaspoon of gorgeo and you want to try and get that kind of mixed all around not mix like sprinkled even kind of evenly around like so can't really see there that doesn't help sorry and I'm gonna actually angle the camera because I want you to see the emulsification okay so we're just gonna kind of just stir that in a little bit to begin with make sure it's not stuck to the sides and we are going to get our a hand blender [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] now this can happen sometimes because I let that gourd sit for a minute or two while I was setting stuff up it started it started to clump if that does that you end up with any lumps in your mixture don't worry about it just run it through a strainer and it will catch those lumps and you're always good [Music] which I am going to have to do here so watch doesn't always happen if you actually mix your gore and your guar gum into a little bit of your butter first it will melt and you won't ever have that issue I kind of forgot that step okay now if you're using the clear gel you need to do this last step if you're not using clear gel just set your puree aside and we'll be moving on to our candy syrup so you're gonna put your pureed back into the pot on medium low heat after you can turn it up to medium we just need to get it keep it up and get it started boiling now this see what an emulsifier does you can see that there's no oil separation between your water and your and your oils the sudden it makes them friends and yes you can use soy or sunflower lecithin you could use about a teaspoon of that I'm just gonna get my wrist candy and once our mixture comes to a boil turn off your heat take it off the heat and we are going to whisk in our sugar and clear gel mixture so I just do a little bit at first get that way now let's get the rest of it in so that what this creates is a softer texture to your candy versus that being more of a gelatin okay so we are going to let this we're going to set this off to the side and now we're going to cook up our candy syrup all right so to our pot we are going to add our half a cup of sugar 3/4 of a cup of corn syrup and our 1/4 cup of water you can just stir that together and turn your heat on to medium high but you're going to stir this until it comes to a boil once it starts to come once it comes to a boil we'll have our candy thermometer and cook it to 275 degrees and this one you're gonna want your cup of hot water and that pastry brush to clean down the sides of your pot Thanks so my search beginning to boil so at this point I'm going to stop stirring and we are going to cook this to 275 degrees now for those who will cook syrup for the first time yours your temperature will come up to around the two 2223 mark and it's gonna sit there for a few minutes this is when a large when your large majority of your water is starting to boil off so it is not uncommon for it to sit at that temperature for a while then once it does start passing that the temperature will start to increase fairly quickly so I've had a few people comment saying but it doesn't get higher than 220 you just got to be patient it will and again just wash down any sugar crystals that are from a farm on the side all right so we're getting there or almost a temperature all right so candies of temp I'm gonna move it put it on the stone here that will help take away the heat quickly so I'm just waiting for the bubbling to stop now we're gonna add in our few fruit puree okay so our bubbling is stopped or it's starting to subside there it's going to a syrup now when you do add to puree it is gonna bubble up again don't worry about that he may bubble up again and we are going to mix this stir it until everything is completely mixed together we're gonna stir this for a couple of minutes until our fruit and our syrup and everything gets combined and that extra sugar gets melted yeah if you find that the syrup is starting to solidify on the bottom no problem just put your heat on to low and we'll get that get that melted and you just want to eat it up and Toba candy from the candy syrup is melted and become syrup again we don't want to start it boiling and I'm gonna use the hand blender on that so that we can get every leave emulsified because we do have the oil you've just dyed it in some more water to that we're gonna use the hand butter to get that all also 5 now have a look if you see you can see it butter any butter rising at the top so you'll see like a little bit of an oil slick I'm gonna add in a little bit more gore gum to get that most of Isis what will happen is that will rise to the top of your candies and you won't have a nice mixture okay so what I'm going to do this time is I'm adding a little bit of oil and I'm adding about a quarter teaspoon of the Gorgo to it just mix it together I see how it dissolved this will avoid any lumping and now we're just gonna add that on to into our candy we get our handy-dandy blender now our last step is we are going to add in our gelatin so we've got our bloomed gelatin this will be warm enough for it to melt we don't want to have it on heat because gelatin will break very easily if it is too high it melts at a warm water bath temperature she's gonna break that up into smaller chunks and you're just gonna can stir that until it is all melted I'm just gonna give it one final mix here with our hand next blender and there we go now I'm just gonna let this sit for a little bit so that we can go so the air bubble isn't that can work out and we can have a clearer syrup mixture so instead of having it like this it'll become clearer so we're just gonna let it sit probably about 15-20 minutes or so and if it does stiffen up too much you can just turn it on low heat to remelt it and then bring the right on one nuke them then when the air bubbles rise up to the top settle at the top here you can just use a little small strainer just as scoop them off or you can also stir gently kind of break them but they're a little hard then as it cools if you help remove some more of those air bubbles is just going circular motion gentle circular motion and see how it'll pull with bubbles kind of all together in the middle then you can just take your scoop and just skim it off the top yeah I'm gonna get my bottles fill up my large one and I use a strainer to help to catch anything else or any extra seeds that mean snuck through or if it's gum if it's become a little too solidified you can just put it up back on the heat low heat or just a couple of minutes just to warm it up a little bit now half of this I'm gonna do is the translucent and the other half I'm gonna add a couple of drops of white to give create a solid background but with the same kind of color so it looks really cool gives you a nice contrast I'm just gonna give this a real quick heat up here so I just heated it up just a little bit you don't want to go heat it too much because you'll break the gelatin so just enough to make it a little bit more syrupy I live my technical terms so I'm just gonna add a couple of drops of the white food coloring mix that in and so see how I create that solid background alright so I just took my molds out of the freezer nice and cold chilled and I'm gonna get my two colors my solid and my clear and just pour yeahjust both together and you can kind of do any design you want what let me get that in a minute or just go half in half or a little marble effect and that's it just fill up your cavities and then you're gonna pop these into the fridge for about two hours and then we'll come back and take them out you can see what they look like alright so it's time to pop these puppies out let's have a look-see there we go nice and easy they pop out now these guys do not get sugar or sour coated these are just the plane the plane kind their regular fruit snacks with a little kick alright it's gonna get the rest of these guys out here you go haven't got clothes so check that out yeah I got the two-tone solid with the translucent they look pretty cool eh let's check out a dinosaur there we go whoa check that one out whoo-hoo all right so I'm just gonna pop the rest of these guys out and yeah so I hope you enjoyed this no sorry so what you're gonna do is if you have used the mold and immature you can let these dry out on the counter for a couple of days if you have not used the mold inhibitor you're going to put them into the fridge for about 24 24 or 48 hours to dry in the fridge then take them out for 24 hours but for the pretty much you'll want to keep them in the fridge in a sealed airtight airtight container I would not keep these out exposed if you haven't used the inhibitor for more than three or four days yeah because you don't want anybody getting sick and because you're using the real fruit and if they will likely get mold on them very quickly all right so that's everything if you have any questions at all or any comments that you'd like to leave please don't hesitate and thank you guys so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "5U1FWD6O54Q": "hey guys welcome back to our Channel today we will be showing you guys how to make deuces ante letters if you want to know how we made them keep on watching so what you're going to need is some sugar some chamoy some Lucas and some tahini or Valentina adds we used and you're also going to need some lids with containers and some candy of your choice these are the ones we chose so let's get started what you're going to need to do is place five tablespoons of sugar into a container and you're going to add 2 tablespoons of Chum moy and then you're gonna mix mix mix oh okay well tell them now mix I'm gonna mix mix mix good job so you going to mix this until it's evenly incorporated I know where it's no idea okay well once you have mixed your stuff strip you want to microwave it for 10 seconds and this should look like this tada next you're going to pour your candy into one of your containers and you're gonna add a Tuesday tablespoons of the liquefied candy stuff whatever you want to call so what this is gonna do is it's gonna make your candy all sticky yiii so when you add your dry ingredients they will stick now you're gonna add a generous amount of Valentina or Tajin you're also going to add your Lukas and also add a generous amount then you're going to cover the lid and shake it shake it for about 36 seconds not 30 minutes and then they should look a little like this all the powdered stuff should have covered a decent amount of the skittles now we're gonna move on with our watermelon sour patch okay and watermelons and their kids the kids they're what a melon kids I think so you're just gonna blend blend mix mix cover make sure that every watermelon kid every candy is coated and you're gonna continue to add your tajin or your Valentina whichever you prefer and your Lucas and shake shake for another 30 seconds and you should have something that looks a little like this some deliciousness mmm they were so good now we're moving onto regular sour patch kids and guess what we're gonna repeat oh nope we're moving on to find a product this is what you get when you repeat the steps um we hope you guys enjoyed this easy fast simple recipe that we found online and decided to recreate ourselves too and maybe you guys will give it a try and for those that have made it this far in our video we do have a surprise at the end so stay tuned something else we've decided to recreate mmm so we're gonna be showing you guys how we dress a beer we don't drink but you know we could use it for any other kind of juices you're gonna start with a Pelon pelo Rico put it in a container and you're going to microwave it for 10 seconds so it can get soft once it's soft you add some Tajin or Valentina and you're Lucas and you are going to stir that in now you're gonna squeeze a whole lime into your mixture the more juice it has the better then you're gonna want to mix your whole make sure mix mix mix mix next year you're going to make sure that you wash your cans before this and once you do apply a coat of this to the lid then you can sprinkle some more Valentina or Tajin onto the top of the can as well as a couple drops or

particularly use it for my gummies as you will see in most of my recipes that I have posted here they all call for potassium sorbate that way I can keep my gummies outside of the fridge I'm in a drawer in my pocket in my car and my desk whatever I want and they're gonna last just like if you were to buy a bag of gummies or candy from a convenience store or a grocery store I know a lot of people make their own gummies and then they mold or they just don't last and the simple solution for that is this bag of potassium sorbate which I bought for like $15 and this will probably last me forever like I'll probably never even get through this so the way to make it is with potassium sorbate and water and that's it so I already have some made here but I'm going to demonstrate to you guys how to make it yourself you can make whatever amount you want if you want to do a smaller amount you can do that a larger amount that's fine the only thing that matters is that it's one part fast-absorbing to three parts water so I'm going to do three quarter cups of water and 1/4 cup of potassium sorbate if you wanted a smaller amount you would also do 1 tbsp potassium sorbate 3 tablespoons water so it doesn't really matter as long as it's 1/4 potassium sorbate 3 parts water I'm just going to fill this up to 3/4 of a cup this is just room temperature water do not pour it into a mason jar and then I'm going to put 1/4 cup of the potassium sorbate granules in today [Applause] let's pour that right now give it a little shake so I just shook this up and it's been like 30 seconds and you can already see it's completely dissolved once it sits for a little bit longer it'll become more clear like the mixture I already have made I'm just going to pour this into my mixture I got made previously yeah and that's literally it it's so easy the hardest part is probably gonna be actually frying the potassium sorbate when you use this you'll just need about an eighth of a teaspoon or two a quarter of a teaspoon depending on how big your recipe is for companies I usually use between 1/8 and 1/4 of a teaspoon and I don't believe he throws in the fridge I do just because it's convenient for me and my apartments small so there's not really that many places to keep it I have heard some people struggling to find the tascam sorbet I was gonna post a link and I will when the time comes that it's priced better but I paid like $15 for this over a year ago and now on Amazon it's like $60 which is completely insane but I will post the link when I find it for a decent price but this is a standard ring convened it's used for people who make beer so I really know where you go to get their supplies but if you went to a place where they have very few supplies you probably find this there and I doubt it would be overpriced but yeah that's it please let me know if you guys have any questions I hope you enjoyed the video if you did please give it a like leave

she could grab this slime thankfully we only have like I don't know ten-foot roofs at the lowest part so she's okay she's alive I'm alive we're all alive guys hi it could go H and I try to catch it

oh yeah okay about this yeah we have to put you guys in your beds you know why you would have eaten all the gummi bears all right well it's time for them to see the end results of the gummies here they are guys this one had too much cornstarch on it that's why it looks like you know all nasty still tastes good though this one's pretty good but it is firm like a rock cuz once they cool down they return to their gummy form and even a little bit harder because of the cornstarch this one's still a little bit warm I would say this is probably the best gummy that we made yeah tears here guys just suck on this one the one that got on the roof and you wouldn't want to eat it cuz it has little bits of shingle inside of it so nobody's gonna eat that one this one right here I got nothing to say

official Twain 20 guy on how to safely consume weed edibles or any year for that matter because this is time that's advice you know I'm saying so I find that consuming edibles I eating it it's a lot more natural and has a less health risks than smoking anything you smoke and inhale into your lungs as the potential to affect your breathing cars in such as bronchitis and just overall get lungs see lungs other basic necessity of life right but at the point to note that not all edibles are created equal and being knowledgeable of the dosage level that you take is crucial in order for you to actually enjoy and have a good experience rather than be one of those people on YouTube that gives a story time about their worst experience of marijuana [Music] three hours later welcome back to no song edutainment yall already know what's going on subscribe to channel cuz I'm a fun guy I'm a cool guy I go through my day pretty normal like I'm a normal guy I'm a swell guy I'm a nice enough guy I'm a cool kind of guy I'm a pretty groovy guy I call this honest entertain you make you laugh but most importantly educate you on a variety of subjects that make you learn something they can apply it to your own personal personal life so mister my research the general consensus I see for a serving one serving of an edible is about 10 milligrams but not all will be dispensaries created equal like I said before some of them serve a bit more some of them aren't as precise and having each in each serving wrap individually so depending on where you get it from one serving we have a bit more THC than you might expect usually if it does have more THC than the 10 milligrams like limit it should have this image or however you wherever you see this image on the box right there but in the meantime products with too much THC must have these warning labels so I've told you why edibles are better than smoking or vaping me but how and what do you do to actually enjoy it safe so I got about five different steps for you to follow if you listen to me if you listen to me just listen to me you will enjoy your edible experience simple because I know it all I just played so most places require or from what I've seen research most states and my keys most provinces in Canada require a limit of ten milligrams of THC in a serving of edible but my suggestion Prasad is to tone it down a bit more and actually do five milligrams as your basic reduction to an edible cookie gummy bears or whatever so number one is important to read the packaging carefully so that you don't overdose or not overdose you can't really overdose on wheat but you can definitely take too much this easy there go anybody take a tab hallucinate you finished our trip the trip but chill out I got a heartbeat I can't feel [ __ ] so no longer do you have to play Russian roulette with your dosage amounts there's now a legal dosage of ten milligrams as your basic level of attaboy experience but if it isn't made at home then in that case be extra careful with how much you're taking in a given set or given serving size so especially if you're new to cannabis or you don't take it regularly it's important to dip your toe in the water a little bit before you dive in headfirst rather than taking the recommended ten milligrams take instead to five milligrams and then wait another two to three hours before you take another serving size just so that you are easing yourself into the whole edible experience and you can actually enjoy the high rather than you know some of the other stories I've seen on YouTube and even if you are a veteran cannabis user you should also implement my foot dosing which is start with five milligrams or even you start with the ten milligrams wait two or three hours and then add another one why should you do this because it gently stimulates the body's cannon but receptors which results in an increased high or increased mood productivity creativity without the sudden high effect that you might get if you were to just like consumer all I was in fact Oh Oh cookies very important to me I mean I love to me but they mean much more to me Tommy so the high is a bit more noticeable noticeable and more enjoyable like is you're kind of like on a roller coaster type of thing rather than already being at the top right so you're gently taking yourself to that peak or a high rather than just as soon as you get to the rides everyday at the top which is not ideal so again five milligrams as your basic level especially if you're a beginner and then every two or three hours just gradually take another serving size just so that you can safely and enjoyably each edible our number two is important to consider your tolerance having a low THC tolerance makes you susceptible to negative side effects of taking too much weed or taking too much THC such as paranoia anxiety and dizziness definitely without a doubt it's better to have an underwhelming experience than an overwhelming experience where you are shaking your you panicking whatever it is it's better to be disappointed than to be on the other spectrum if I'm gonna say okay do what you want you an adult but take heed take heed all right one word is good enough for the wise so he was so it's your first time trying a screen or not well since you interacted with marijuana in general don't try and keep up with the veteran smoker so don't try keep up with the rest of the crew just go at your own pace because there's it's not a race I see alright I got this off like that got the sauce little ketchup those sauce little ketchup thank you keep up with them because people that consume meet regularly already need a higher dosage to get their desired high effect and this is why I say it's important to take weed tolerance breaks the tolerance breaks for weed are important because it allows you to get higher for a longer period of time so your high or not it won't be like twenty minutes it'd be like two plus hours or so and you can get high on a small amount of weed which results in savings yeah I put it all together see it and trying to save y'all money I'm looking out for you looking out for your pockets so take means haulin sprigs periodically so that you can continue to not need a higher dosage and that your high can also last for a longer period of time simple so number three it just be patient like I said be patient with the THC and how it how long it takes to affect you depending on your metabolism and your body fat it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two or maybe even a few hours so these snacks are not like your regular snacks at the grocery store or the corniche story these aren't regular snacks that you can - to eat as you're watching a Netflix videos or Netflix shows or movies whatever it is take heed to the serving size and be patient for 330 minutes any for 30 minutes to two hours if you feel the pips this is the moment you feel the effect is when you can like perhaps take another one but even at that let it right out for a bit on number four you want to be mindful of your stomach's contents so the more food you have in your system the longer it will take for weed to get metabolized in your bloodstream and take effect however in empty stomach I lost with the edibles to activate Kruger so just keep it just keep that in mind when and if you are eating edible did you eat already because if you didn't it'll take effect quicker and if you haven't eaten already before it then start with half a dose or what you usually take or what you want to take just so that you know just you can slow yourself in micro dosing same as the same thing micro dosing is the wave don't just jump in and if you drank alcohol beforehand alcohol can increase the THC blood concentration in your system so it's important to use caution if you're mixing alcohol with edibles and number five just this is more of like the nurture you know they say nature is the nature this is more of an immature type of thing it just be mindful of the environment like are you around people that you or as you care about you want people that care about you right and are you comfortable around these people so if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or long much more it's better take it at your home with your loved one or parent or francica with it your brother sibling romantic partner whatever it is just be around if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or just in general you are taking a new strain it's best to be around people that you actually are familiar with and you actually care about just to that part of for you to experience some type of anxiety or panic attack or just seeing a familiar face will keep you a bit more grounded if you did end up eating so much but again the more experience you have the more likely you are to be comfortable the easier it is for you to be comfortable in different situations or different environments but yeah so my kudos take it easy five milligrams or as your basis for anything for the most part and then just gradually increase your high once you start feeling the effects and its best it's always better to have an underwhelming experience then an overwhelming experience londo and take these five steps into consideration you will have a very enjoyable read hi and again have other videos above or edibles from

this one", "kK7cGj8AZGI": "hi everybody and welcome back for today's video where I will be showing you just how easy it is to make healthy gummy bears so come along with me and we'll make this recipe together if you don't know me yet then hi i'm katie Reitsma your registered holistic nutritionist and the founder of live it well nutrition if you haven't already then go ahead and click that like and subscribe button so we can have more fun in more videos like this together okay so this whole recipe only takes a few minutes which let's face it is all the time you mom's really have right so to start if you don't have gummy bear mold don't let that stop you you can simply cut the jello into squares once it sets the recipe I'm making however is the perfect quantity for three gummy bear trays or 150 gummy bears today I'm keeping it simple and realistic for you moms out there okay you'll need three ingredients juice honey and gelatin that's all first you take one cup of your juice and you heat it up it doesn't need to boil but it needs to get hot enough to melt the honey and the gelatin powder once your one cup of juice is hot enough use a whisk to stir in the one tablespoon of honey and three packets four tablespoons of gelatin powder as you can see it mixes pretty quickly then if you're not using mold just pour it into a baking dish and let it cool and forget about it if you are using a gummy bear mold like I am then take your turkey baster and start filling up those little trays it'll only take you a couple minutes I like to place mine on a tray because I bring my molds down to my basement fridge because my upstairs fridge usually doesn't have enough space that's open for these molds the are not stackable so that's another thing to consider when you do this do you have enough fridge space for three floppy gummy bear trays that are not stackable when you take out your trays within an hour or so you will find that they pop out of the mold super easily just like that my son who's only 19 months old loves these and don't feel guilty giving them to him there are actually nutritional benefits if using high quality juice honey and gelatin and it's even a great sensory food where children can learn about different textures of food so that's a really cool part of it as well ultimately they'll try to find a juice without added sugar to it and with pure straightforward ingredients okay you've got to be able to pronounce everything with gelatin though it's tricky to find a good brand the most common brand would be Knox gelatin but Knox gelatin is more affordable than other brands because it is manufactured using commercial factory farmed meat in which case you're not doing yourself or the animals any favors by consuming it if you're watching and thinking what does gelatin have to do with factory farmed meats anyway then I'll explain that gelatin is a gelatinous protein substance that is boiled out of the bone marrow of bones it's filled with collagen and amino acids and has many beneficial qualities to it I hope you liked this video and I also hope to see you around for more go make your healthy gummy bears but before you do please don't forget to hit that

they have a different branding mx by moxie there but now they are in the edibles game with the classic cannabis infused gummy uh it seems like if you are a weed company and you want to branch out from whatever your starting project product is you go gummies and that's what looks like it's happening with moxie uh this packaging is pretty uh nice it's uh kind of like a aluminum can little puck here uh pretty substantial actually uh this little tin is not cheap i'm sure uh but you got all the stuff you want to see on it uh we've got our lab testing results here on the side uh and then we've got uh our dosage instructions which these are uh 10 milligram gummies they're 10 10 milligram gummies in here for 100 milligrams in total uh and these gummies cost me 17 bucks at my dispensary which puts them at the ever so slightly above average price point for a 100 milligram gummy in my neck of the woods uh it does say on here that uh moxie has won 90 plus industry awards neat uh i always find those things to be more annoying than edifying or clarifying uh if you're not gonna tell us what awards you've won uh why should i believe you anyways uh we need some more uh you know packaging regulations here but uh that's neither here nor there let's get to the moxie good stuff i did not actually mention what flavor this is it is the member berry flavor or strain i guess i didn't realize there was a member berry strain before this it does show member berries on there uh i don't know what k i assume member barry got its name from the south park episode which minor rant here boy south park uh on the air for 24 seasons now i remember back when people were making jokes about the simpsons getting along in the tooth back around it's like 15th 16th 17th season uh and now we here we are with south park uh at its 24th season i think there was even a time where south park mocked the simpsons for being uh so long in the tooth that is not to knock south park it's just crazy how long actually and resilient that show has been around anyways member berries uh i don't actually have never seen the episode i don't really watch south park anymore still appreciate what those fine folks do but um i do remember hearing on the internet for about 24 hours people saying remember when a member something like that remember barry who knows uh i assume it tastes just like berries uh let's go ahead and get into this edible here this is 17 thing of gummies uh with my experiences with moxie have been good uh nothing to write a home about like um totally fine makers of cartridges uh and i've had some of their wax before too in non-cartridge form and found it to be totally unobjectionable uh nothing stand out but nothing uh to be suspicious of either all right well here is our here are our gummies rather got a little moxie logo on them uh 10 gummies in there i i guess the idea that every gummy has to be five milligrams everything has to be five milligrams is becoming irrelevant that was a law but i see everything lots of things now uh packaged as 10 milligrams so uh getting lax cool shut up siri she keeps thinking i'm talking to her uh anyways here is our moxie member berry let's give this a shot hmm wow very pleasant very pleasant starting taste um kind of a chewier gummy i don't really need to tell you what a gummy gummy's gonna taste like it's pretty fruity to start uh but there is actually a very strong cannabis aftertaste i mean it's not grotesque most gummies don't get uh offensively bad you've got enough sugar in there to mask the taste but there is a pretty strong weed aftertaste here so if you are very sensitive to it watch out fine for the first two or three seconds and then there it is actually about five alarm weed taste there you got a couple of seconds uh before it really hits you wow that is powerful that is one of the uh more weedy tasting gummies that i've had uh in some time i wonder how they infused uh if they did something different it looks like uh same process as far as i can tell just a very strong weed taste uh that does make me a little optimistic that these are gonna be pretty potent uh there's not necessarily a total correlation between oh well somebody just subscribed apparently that's what that noise was um there's not always a correlation between taste and potency but there sometimes is so fingers crossed that these member berries are going to be as potent as we hope uh for me guys i am gonna eat all 10 of these it's probably going to take me oh i'm going to do over the next half hour 45 minutes or so and then 90 minutes two hours after i have that last one i'll come right back here and let you guys know the most important part about the edible review is it gonna get you high and i've got really really high hopes no pun intended for these with that aftertaste until then guys thanks for sticking around we'll see you right back here in just a bit oh there it is bye welcome back to wheats guys it has been about uh just over two hours since i had my first member berry uh cannabis infused gummy from moxie and that is a really sticky inside of a container there a lot of residue anytime i'm talking about residue it means i'm pretty high uh so these are pretty good gummies these are um i would say um on the good end of average the high end of average they're uh good not outstanding not the absolute best i've ever had uh not the best test tasting gummies by a long shot but they are certainly going to get the job done uh for anybody who is familiar with 100 milligram edibles um 100 milligram gummies uh if they work for you these are going to do the job they are just a total uh thumbs up in terms of quality uh really the only thing to talk about here uh is gonna be the taste and price uh the taste didn't offend me that much uh i quite used to a pretty bitter cannabis aftertaste and uh there was that potency you want with the with that uh taste but it is a stronger cannabis aftertaste if you're looking for gummies with no weed taste these aren't for you uh and that these were the only other thing to mention is that these weren't the cheapest gummies these aren't the cheapest gummies available at my dispensary um so i would not necessarily buy these myself because i know that i can get just as good of a gummy for a cheaper price at my dispensary say a um punch edibles or a buddha's best they have a couple of different gummies at a i at my place for sometimes uh like five bucks cheaper than these so that is a thing to consider uh it really is just going to depend on the price at your dispensary because there is nothing again in this package that's going to say uh it's worth a premium over any other gummy um but you know totally perfunctory and good i'd say these moxie may not have moxie but they have gumption gumption what a weird word speaking of gumption no speaking of moxie let's do a little cherry on top we're gonna do something with some real moxie uh and cherry on tops by the way anytime we have a review that we like we like to give a little something extra that's not weed related uh and let's do something with as i said somebody with some moxie now normally i have a policy i don't like to uh give any cherry on tops for anything that i've actually finished uh because you know i like to it's a wheat thing we we do the entire experience but i've been enjoying this book so much i'm confident that even though i've only got about a uh i don't know a couple dozen pages or so left to go i'm confident that i'm still uh if enjoyed enough to give it my recommendation and that book is a nonfiction book by the author maria konokova uh former writer for the new yorker called the biggest bluff uh she is a fantastic writer and a psychology phd from harvard uh who uh decided to take a break from writing and instead uh spend a year training to become a poker champ after having never played poker uh she just decides that she wants to see what it's all about but really it's a book about how to make good decisions how to avoid making bad decisions why poker is a good analog for decision making it's a pretty fascinating stuff she's an excellent writer it's a really cool concept again the book is the biggest bluff by maria konakova uh that is an excellent book from an author who has a lot of moxie and somebody who has a little bit of moxie is moxie and their member um edible i almost forgot that's what we were talking about but that is what we were here for pretty good from them really good from maria and that guys is gonna do it for everything here on wheats until we see you for our next review or whatever it is stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then goodbye", "NLl6HYGA-Mw": "welcome to 420 RX cannabis cooking and confectionaries here's

locally grown so we're locally gotten so that's just going to give us a little bit of sweetness make it not so tart we're going to turn our heat to medium and we're going to cook this until it's hot not boiling but just hot we just want it to get hot not to the boiling stage yet give that a nice stir and this should just take just a few minutes all right it's beginning to steam we're now going to turn our that took about three minutes or so we're going to turn our heat down to low as you're going to hear our dog gracie yes found something outside that's attractive probably a bird or something we're going to slowly add to that three tablespoons of gelatin and we want to add it to it slowly because we don't want it to um lump together any place all right we're gonna finish putting this in and then we're gonna let it simmer for roughly 10 minutes all right we're putting the last of our gelatin in i can't remember if i told you or not how much we're actually using three tablespoons and

keto gummies and if you are not subscribed to my channel please subscribe and leave me a comment thumbs up on the video if you like it and if you want to see the keto gummy recipe this please stay tuned [Music] okay guys back with the recipe for keto gummies I have all of my stuff right here I'm going to read you the recipe I'm going to show you what I have and then we'll get on with it so basically the recipe says one small box of sugar-free jell-o one packet of gelatin powder and 1/4 cup of water okay and so I'm going to show you exactly what I have here ignore the washer in the background if you hear it I'm going to make four different kinds of gummies of gummy bears and whatever I can but I'm going to show you what time I have I have a these are all kroger brand no they're not all kroger brand okay I have a Kroger sugar-free raspberry okay so we'll have raspberry gummies I have a Kroger sugar-free orange orange gummies I have a jello brand sugar-free lemon and I have a kroger brand sugar-free strawberry oh I have five cards actually I may omit one I'm not sure important make four different cons I like different colors so I may take out this strawberry and then I have kroger brand sugar-free line so I'll probably do a lime a lemon orange and I think I'll do strawberry and I'll take out the raspberry okay there's that and then what I have here this is the unflavored gelatin and a Kroger brand there's four packs to a box they look like this I have one more pack right here and then I have a whole new box so I'll be using that okay so I'm going to show you my molds I've got a little bit of a collection here these are for when I make keto fat bombs always use these they're small so they're not too big when it comes to the fat bomb so I'm just going to put those to the side because I won't be using those okay these let me start with these right here and these are just these tiny tiny gummies okay they're real small and I have a blue one orange one and a green one in these I've ordered all of this stuff gummy stuff off of Amazon okay now these are right here I'm ordering off Amazon these gummy bears are much bigger as you can see they're about twice the size probably and then they also have some gummy worms in there so those are cute so I have two of the sheets of those okay I've got some more things in here but they're more for fat bombs too like I have a jack-o-lantern then I have the little spoons these are fat bomber related so I'm just gonna leave those in here what I will need though these droppers these are what you use to suck up the jello in here and then it's so much easier to just get the jello in the little molds with these so also I got these right here at Dollar Tree okay it says they're ice cube trays they're pretty I don't know if I want to use them I'll make you like a test on one or two of these because they are kind of I mean they're not as these are here like really as you can see they're really and it's easy to pop the gummies out these are still you know there's still pliable but I don't know how good a gummy would pop out of these so I may try like one flamingo and then next time I make them on there if I like them or not so if if they don't work good for that I'll just use them as ice cube trays they are adorable so okay so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna get 1/4 of a cup of water it ready and we'll get it in my pan I'm gonna change my camera angle and then we'll take it from there so I'll be right back okay guys I'm just put a fourth of a cup of water in here I've got the Stowe bottle on and I'm going to start out with orange so I'm gonna make this packet of orange jell-o in here okay pan quite big actually and then I'm gonna need this pocket a regular jello in here okay so what I'm gonna do is get these stirred up okay so I knocked my tripod over okay so hope you can see this yeah I'm getting this going it says to stir it says it'll thicken up a bit but the end whenever everything gets dissolved it will get thinner so that's what I'm going to do okay I got it up on half probably not the best idea in the world especially since this pans a little big anyway this is okay so yeah it does seem a little thick right now I've made this before it's been a while I can't really really remember I made it in a smaller pot though so play the better I'll be able to so sorry if you hear background noise okay it's almost there I just have to do it for just like a couple of minutes trying to get all this down through here I don't know why I grabbed this big of a pan I think I'll switch out forever for the rest of this what I'm gonna do though is I'm gonna go ahead and get all of the jello ready and in a bowl and then I just don't know how I feel about this we'll see we'll see how this one turns out just because I don't know it's thick it seems really thick I don't remember it being that thick before so I'm just trying to make sure everything is dissolved it looks like it is so what I'll do is get this poured in a bowl and what I'm gonna do is put you on pause but I will be back when I have all four jell-o's made and sitting with my molds so I can show you how I'll fill them up and everything okay so I'm gonna put you on pause I'll be back with the jello in the bowls okay guys I'm back what I've done is went ahead and made the red and the orange and I want to fill I'm gonna fill these up and then I'll show you and then I'll go ahead and make the green and the yellow and then we'll do those next so I'm just going to have a variety so what I'll do is I'll produce insert some background music here and I'm just going to go ahead and fill these up without talking [Music] okay guys I made ultimate mistake there of not putting the gummy container here on a like a cookie sheet or something like that but this right here worked good I did not spill any if you just have like one of these little cutting container thing or cutting boards you can slide it right under if you forget like I did and just get it on the cookie sheet so what I'm going to do is go ahead and get another cookie sheet because I feel like I'm gonna need one more mold so I'm gonna get that one on the cookie sheet first and especially since I'm gonna do one tester of those so I'm up high just do like this one right here so I'll be right back okay guys I'm back I have made the lemon jello I have it ready for the molds I've made the lime jello also ready for the molds so what I'm going to do I got these I got this on a pan cuz I know I'm gonna need some more of these and I've got the Flamingo there so I can do the test one so what I'm gonna do is I'll probably put some background music on and just be quiet while I'm filling these up [Music] okay guys I have got everything filled up now so what I'm going to do is get everything in the refrigerator and when everything is nice and set I'll be back to show you how I get the mole or get the gummi bears out of the molds one thing I want to say is whenever you are filling up the molds the less bubbles that you have the better if I had a toothpick I prayed pop some of those bubbles I'm just gonna see if I can get some of these bubbles pop because it's just better if you don't have any bubbles in there it's a couple of bubbles but not a whole lot actually not a whole lot at all so I'm just better if you can't if you don't have them so okay and what I did I didn't have enough Millan left so I did a lemon lung flamingo so we'll see how that turns out we'll see if I'm able to get it out or not so anyway I will be back to show you the finished product okay guys I am back and I think that these are ready to be popped out so hopefully they are so what I'm gonna do is to show you how to do it see here they are they're all in here so basically what you do is turn these things inside out just like that push them right up through there what I'm gonna do I'm putting them all on this plate this so I can get a really pretty thumbnail see how they pop out perfectly you can see wherever the camera is Yam they're adorable so my whole family is kind of excited I'll have a feeling I won't get too many of my keto gummies but that's alright that's alright I'm anxious to see how the Flamingo one is going to come out just to see if it comes out good I may make like another batch of just like regular not sugar-free gummies for the family and they're a little bit bigger I feel like they'd be pretty good doing all the little tiny ones first they come out super easy they're things almost clean when they get out so it doesn't take a whole lot of clean up after and you can see they're so pretty and colorful bad boys I can do the yellow ones next they come out super fast okay there's those okay let me get the yellows I did not spray these molds at all I feel like spraying them would probably give a strange flavor maybe I didn't spray them I do feel like you don't need to I mean I don't know what kind of molds I'll have to see when I get to the Flamingo but and you can see like if they have bubbles in them this is basically I mean you can see the bubbles but you're gonna eat them anyway it's not really a big deal so hopefully the worms will pop out good this is actually the first time I've used the worm molds so I thought it'd be cool all right there's all of those go ahead I'm gonna go with for the worms first here's all of these so let's just see oh look at there pop boop boop you didn't fall on the floor thank goodness okay there's the worm I'm gonna put them around the edges there okay there's the yellow worm okay the swarms kind of attached to the other worm there's the red worm the strawberry worm and then we have our orange worm that came out perfect and glide about that now these gummy bears are a little bit bigger as you can see this facade of the other ones the size difference they're not too much but I made a row of all of those different colors well do the tops one thought I saw one go fine come on have a really pretty thumbnail with all these on here and then I got this jar here at Dollar Tree has a really nice tight fitting lid so I think I'm just gonna keep them in there usually I use like a mason jar with a lid so I don't know I may do the mason jar put a picture at the end on whatever I decide however I decided to store them after every all the family members get to get a try them they're not getting all of them them because they're not kedo i buy in my bag of gummy bears right right right right jack right okay so there's all of those that I'm gonna go for the single flamingos let's see here we go okay okay not good check it out came out excellent so what I'll probably do is just make a little put him down there let's just make a little a hopeful meet and try a flamingos my pregnant to use a couple boxes of jello just all in the same color maybe maybe that raspberry and then just make these because I do have one more well I only have one more pack of the unflavored gelatin anyway here are the Quito gummies adorable hope you enjoyed this video if you liked it please give me a thumbs up please subscribe to my channel if you want to see more videos like this and leave me a comment if you are going to make some of these bad boys there's a whole bunch of different flavorings you can use if you choose to use like the unsweetened jello and stuff like that so yeah like and you can use even T to make to make it my not sure how to do that I haven't done it before I'd like to try anyway why didn't answer okay guys thank you for watching I'm gonna put a video up picture up at the end on how I ended up storing these so thank you for watching", "-Qd7B_tcfis": "[Music] hello today we are going to be doing a review on these gummy candies that I have here brand name kasuga I have here peach pineapple watermelon a combination of lychee mango and strawberry lemon-aid a combination of apple Muscat grape Kiwi yuzu Ramu a melon so in total that gives us 14 flavors so all we have to do is just or not so yet I have a [Music] [Music] [Music] so here we have all 14 flavors I'll go with the must get green grape nice I guess the next one should be great nice purple color very purple it's good I think the Muscat tastes slightly better and grape flavor is just your plain artificial grape flavor nothing too special about it by still good mango which is a really good mango flavored candy I've ever had it's a really nice mango flavor this is really pretty okay the peach one smells better than his taste it tastes it tastes fine it just smells a lot better I know the color is a lot darker than I would expect it to be smells just pineapple smells like pineapple tastes like pineapple it does its job for what it's trying to pretend to be or for what it is really nice strawberry flavor exactly as how you'd expect but slightly better I guess [Music] lot sweeter than your regular homemade lemonade guy smells really nice and tastes even better I really like this one and [Music] eliminating this is the Ramona is basically that marbles soda in Japan [Music] interestingly I find a hint of the flavor of power eight it's good I like it interesting flavor this is very cool yeah actually a slight watermelon in the gummy form which is interesting I like this regular melon that goes and I guess this is like the honeydew this tastes very much like honey - these all have really good flavors I don't know how they do such a great job with artificial flavoring and a can do all of these lychee flavor whatever from Asian snacks has met they've never disappointed me it's a really good lychee flavor smells really nice wow this doesn't taste that artificial at all actually tastes like I'm eating real Apple we have two more left users so yuzu it's like somewhere in between lemon and orange over there and make up the citrus fruit like something in between orange and lemon but there's something very unique to it there's like this really good just definitely give this a try the Kiwi [Laughter] yes the pace plane I suppose it's good I think I just chew on some real Kiwis seat in there they put QB seat in there so the means like they have actual fruit I don't know I don't I don't hate any of these here they've all been very good Wow 14 candies in a row give these a try there are plenty of flavours as you can see I'm pretty sure there's a lot more from the company that's available in different countries or different states they really nailed how they can mimic this fruit or whatever flavor they're they're going for it's very realistic in many ways like a lot of these flavors have definitely surprised me like the Muscat the Apple the yuzu the lemonade and I don't know how they do it I don't know if other candy companies can do the same job as these but definitely give this a try and I will see you next time with another video bye [Music]", "cviOulSPAJ4": "[Music] hi everyone welcome to time at the light edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back and thank you so much for joining and first of all I would like to thank these people have donated to my patreon account thank you thank you very much means the world to me and your support with and your support for my channel thank you thank you so today what I'm going to bring to you quite a few quite a few people have asked for this recipe wasn't 100% sure if I could do it but that would be the old magic me I was able to pull this out so what we are going to make is a soda pop candy gummies and I'm gonna be making this with can of sugar and can of syrup I'm recipes for those links for those videos I cut down in the description for you and check these that I made these ones 7up and they look so cool of course I threw my two-tone as always check that out these are fun to makes a little bit different than the other recipes that we've done so just another way of doing things so you can use any pop at all rip your cherry coke whatever floats your boat you can go with I'm just happen to pick the 7up and yeah that's everything and they actually taste like seven real some enough whoo so I hope you join me for this whole thing stick around to the end because I do have some troubleshooting tips for you for anybody who is having problems with sticking to the molds and not coming out properly or having problems with them the sugar citric acid melting I do cover how to fix those and why those are probably happening alright so do stay to the end thanks for joining me let's jump right into those ingredients what we need and let me show you how these puppies are made all right so you ready for this so the ingredients we're going to need is one cup of a flattened pop and many many pop we'll do a yes I'm Canadian we say pop American I know soda whatever yeah I watch a ton of the competition baking shows of chocolate shows in Canada and they all use gelatin sheets and I'm like Oh Pesce said these gelatin sheets if the pros use it it must be good so what I found out is where I live they're very hard to come by I was actually only able to find them in to store the Russians store in an Italian the store and but in on on Amazon for the state you guys can get any type of gelatin sheets there are now these come in different grades it's bronze silver gold platinum and each of those are different strengths bronze is really weak silver is what they mainly use for mooses and and those wobbly things I don't know I can't think of it right now they use the silver which is about a 170 gel the gold or the platinum are going to be much strength stronger strength unfortunately I can't test with them so I don't know exactly how well they work I would love to be able to but they're on the unavailable we can only get silver in Canada yes so enough with the sheets so if you are going to try the gelatin sheets and the reason why this is so much better is makes your gelatin much softer so instead of having that really rubbery rubbery gelatin this is a much softer type of gummy candy if you use the sheets but you do need to use them in combination with granulated sugar but up I know that was a lot of talking on gelatin she so let's sleep just back up and start again one cup of your favorite flattened soda for gelatin sheets if you're going to use that if not one tablespoon or one package of the knocks gelatin that's for our soda side then we're going to do a coke candy syrup you're going to need a half a cup of can of sugar the link for the recipe how to make kin of sugar from tincture I will put in the description 1/2 a cup of regular sugar 1/4 cup of Canas can of syrup again link will be in the then you know where and 1/4 cup of your flat new soda as well we're going to cook that with our candy syrup so this is really going to help with giving us a more intense flavor in 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid 2 tablespoons or 2 packages of gelatin so yes 3 altogether if you're using the granulated for gelatin sheets in 2 tablespoons of unflavored gelatin if you're going with the sheets because I am using 7up and as a lemon-lime I can add a little dash of lemon and lime flavoring to enhance that a little bit because it does get a little muddled down however you can keep that playing that is totally optional that's pretty much it for our ingredients now a little quick tip here for your soda if you want to flatten it quickly pour it into a glass take a metal spoon and you just stir it for a few minutes minutes and then just let it sit for about 10 minutes with the spoon in it it will completely flatten your pop or you just pour it out let it sit out for a couple of hours and nature will take care of its own thing so let's get into the equipment that we need and let's get these made I know it's a lot of good alright so the equipment we need is a 2 small saucepan candy thermometer digital or the regular regular candy thermometer of course your molds now a tip for your molds is to put them in the freezer before you start making this circle now or so before it helps especially if you're doing two-tone colors then it'll it'll start to solidify immediately it's you poor it is it will kind of keep your colors separate instead of them bleeding together if you're just doing one color don't worry about it a couple small strainers that's if you have bubble issues a couple of spatulas a bowl of ice water if you are doing the gelatin sheets your bottles dispensing bottles or the funnel works really good what I found is using the funnel if I'm using one color is all the bubbles come up to the top and the stuff comes out the bottom so you get a much clearer serum pour into your molds versus this all the bubbles set up here we turn it upside down all the bubbles are coming out with it so this does give you a cleaner more a cleaner pour if you are having bubble issues um small bowl for blooming your unflavored gelatin non stick cooking spray for our syrup and parchment paper and our rock and that's about everything we need I believe as you know I usually always forget something but let's jump right in let's get these may need all right very first step you want to do is to pour your soda your flat soda into a small saucepan we're going to put that on to medium-high heat and we're going to reduce it to half a cup and the reason that we're going to do that is is going to help to concentrate our flavor more all right so get that started because it takes about 15-20 minutes to reduce it to half so we'll start that off and we'll get that going and then we're also going to start blooming our gelatin now if you are using gelatin sheets you need ice water you have to have ice water in order for these to blue so you just take your gelatin sheets they're just they're kind of cool they're like quick like crystal clear if they didn't have that lines in them you never find them coke just pop them you just ride them into the water if you guys just make sure that there's all submersed and you can set that off to the side okay so for our granulated gelatin you're going to take a third of a cup of cold flat and soda and it has to be cold pouring that into our ball and you're going to sprinkle your gelatin over the top and you're going to stir that into the liquid make sure that it's all mixed in and that there are no lumps now one thing that you guys talk about is sometimes your gummies are too soft a lot depends on your gelatin not all gelatin are created equal even if you buy an ox gelatin regularly even that can be different from time to time whether it's been exposed to excessive heat or cold can affect its gelatin strength as well as how long it's been stored how well it's been stored all those types of things factored into the gelatin and how it can affect its gelling strength so as I said sometimes you got an increase or a decrease a tablespoon or half a tablespoon teaspoon depending so you just kind of work on your recipe if they're coming out way too sticky you can't get them out of the molds increase your gelatin by about a half a tablespoon should take care of that but for this recipe I mixed together now my third of a cup and 2 tablespoons I'm gonna set that aside and then I'm just gonna wait for this first or a soda to reduce down to 1/2 so allow your your pot to cook down like so to boil down like so like I said to about 1/2 a cup and then periodically on because you can't really see what 1/2 a cup is is just keep another keep a measuring cup nearby and just take it pour it in and you can see where you're at so we've only done about cooked off about 1/3 of a cup so far I've got little ways to go but it takes about 15-20 minutes to do that alright once you've got it cook down to half a cup just put it back in pot and you can either set it to the side to cool down we want this to get to warm or you can plop it into the fridge for a minute or two a couple of minutes five minutes to cool it down like I said though we still wanted a little bit warm for our gelatin sheet okay so now for our cooked candy syrup side we are going to get oh I always forget this you want to spray your soft pan that we are going to do our coke candy syrup take your cooking spray a light coating of spraying all through your pot take a paper towel and take out the extra the excess we just want to have a nice thin layer of the nonstick coating on the side and the reason we're doing that is when you mix the can of sugar THC does not like water it's okay with sugar but I don't like water so much so it tries to run away it hides up the sides of the pot if you don't put that oil on this side your ITD's gonna get stuck there this way we're going to be able to get it off easily and get it back into the syrup glitter belongs so we take our cup of sugar or half a cup of candy sugar half a teaspoon of citric acid citric acid is to prevent sugar crystallizing and a quarter cup of our can of syrup she goes in our quarter cup of flattened soda we're gonna mix those together and then we are going to turn our heat on to medium high or just about number seven is good and we just get that mixed together the liquid and sugar all combined and you're going to continue stirring this until it begins to boil all right so register and make sure to use the side of your spatula to scrape any excess sugar crystals off the side or at first here with the first time you can use a pastry brush and hot water to wash down the sides but we're not going to use this afterwards so as we stir this their sugars are melting and our staring helps assist with that but once it starts boiling you don't want to stir it because that will cause excess asportation which can cause your sugar to crystallize and what that means is the sugar will reform itself and create crystals in your gummy candies over a couple of days and you don't want that that's really picky you want a cool down my by 7up portion of it in the fridge and I'm gonna take my gelatin sheets and what you do is take them out of the ice water and squeeze off the excess water from them it's really really good and then you just plop them right into your soda pop there and just mix them in and it just disappears God it sounds really cool and that's it just leave that off to the side until we're ready to it until we need that now my syrup is beginning to boil so at this point I am NOT gonna stir it anymore but what I am gonna do is continue to scrape the sides to keep them clear of our good stuff and what you'll see here if you get a lot of icky stuff on top that's just the impurities and stuff boiling off so don't worry about that that will all boil off very very quickly just try to keep that a key part into the middle there so it just cooks off and doesn't stick to the sides of your pot let's see how it just disappears said if you start to see any of it gathering on the side you just want to very gently go on with your spatula around the sides you want to try and do very little agitation and just gently squeeze it and bring that back into the middle then you can just dip your spatula in to melt off anything there and we are going to cook our syrup to 260 degrees so I'm just gonna take a look where we're at right now oh and the ice water that you used for your syrup you can keep that handy because we're gonna use that to stop our cooking our cooking syrup process so right now that I'm about to 47 so about another minute or two once you get past to 21 it goes very quickly again just as it's been he gathers on the side pull it in we're just melted off the spatula we're now at 253 so it's gonna go pretty quick from here so I'm going to keep my thermometer in 60 take it off your heat put it into your ice water turn off your heat and let this come down to about 220 we'll just leave it in the ice water it'll come down pretty quick and I'm gonna grab my gelatin okay now that our shower temperatures come down oh yeah it's come lay down we're good we are going to first add in our 7up or our soda and our gelatin side we're going to mix that in together and if you do find that it is starting to solidify on the bottom that it's getting a little too thick on the bottom just put it back on your burner there's still enough heat should be enough heat from there to melt that if not just put it on the lowest heat so you just want to get that syrup melted we don't want to heat it up again but nice nobody stick it in the corners and we got nothing on our sides which is perfect now we will take our unflavored gelatin and you want to cut it up into smaller pieces just helps with melting quicker lock them in now that's warming up there to melt your gelatin it should hopefully not be too warm to cause it to to break so just let that sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and then we will stir it in and then you're just gonna gently stir to continue melting your gelatin now see this is what happens when you don't mix your gelatin properly in the beginning you get little little lumps here that happens if they don't melt in don't worry we're gonna strain that and then we'll get them out now the work we're basically done with our syrup so ready to cast now give it a little taste and if you find that it's lacking a little bit in its flavor and said if you're using like a 7up or sprite you can add you just want to do literally a drop you can either use this little supply a splash of real lemon or if you're using flavor oils use literally like a drop because you said you don't want to affect the natural flavor of the soda that you're using but sometimes it might get a little muddled like with the sprite or the 7up so literally that I use with just one drop just to enhance its flavor I don't want to mask it and trust me the line you do not want to use more than a drop its who uh he's very anemic keep joking now that that is mixed we're good to go I'm gonna get set up to pour oh so so if you're just doing one color you're good to go like me I always like to do the solid in the clear so well I'm gonna add a little bit I'm going to split this in half and I'm gonna add a little bit of white food colouring to half of the mixture and I'm gonna pour it with a strainer here so to catch any it to catch those lumps that didn't dissolve properly and if you want to be exact use a measuring cup but I just usually eyeball it so for the white if you're using white from the Wilton's one make sure to shake it very very well when you use it um if it sits for a little while it has a tendency to separate and yeah you don't want that to make sure to mix it really really well yeah we're just gonna add in a couple of drops I'm gonna give us a solid background a little bit more and with the white you do have to mix it really really well with the gelatin okay I'm just gonna get set up to get these casted alrighty so we're ready to get to the fun stuff now if you were using one of these funnels they don't come with the Unalaska canned they're a little hard to maneuver so what I created was an auto trigger well all I did was I removed the plastic singham sticky thing I tied not it it's a simple Slipknot elastic around the bottom slid it back through around the bottom now you have an auto an auto trigger which makes a lot easier for pouring so I just wanted to show you how this worked so I did support something that I'm just going to be clear I'm going to use it with this and the I'm gonna do teach own alright step top that huh so see what happens in the bottles like I said is the bubbles come up to the top well what you can do is get the spoon or spatula small enough and you can just kind of scoop those out I'm just gonna stick that there it's doing works better however I'm just gonna live with the bubbles right now because I don't really care that much now also with these bottles I've get larger tips I use four or five fours are good eyes are a little big they're good for a thicker syrup so well with our enough fun edge here I'm going to bring the camera because I want you to see how clear it actually comes out of the funnel alright so now it's time to take them out of the mold so gonna grab some parchment paper I don't know why I'm telling you that kind of calm pretty self-explanatory just didn't air and pop them out just like your regulars now give you some troubleshooting tips if you go to take your candies out of the mold and these stick so they're kind of like this and you can't get them off then let me show you so like that and you try and you can't get them off don't worry you can fix it pre-heat your oven to 200 degrees put your molds onto a cookie sheet and place them in the oven until they melt once they melt add them add the stick melted syrup to a small saucepan bloom a half a tablespoon to 1 tablespoon depending how sticky they are so if they're sticky they're almost want to come out but they just won't come out and then go with a half a tablespoon if they completely there just pretty much almost like tacky syrup then go with a tablespoon so if you're good at bloom excuse me so for half the tablespoon to bloom a half a tablespoon of gelatin you're going to use two tablespoons of cold liquid if you're going to use a tablespoon of gelatin you're going to go with a quarter cup of cold liquid sprinkle it on just like we do in the beginning let it bloom and then add that to your syrup recast your candies and you're good to go second problem people have is when they take the candy said if they wanted to sugar sugar coat them or lit the sugar sour mix and the it starts to melt once they take them out of the molds if that happens for a couple of reasons one is your refrigerator is very cold and it's very warm in your apartment or your house will cause that because the cold with the warm will cause moisture to happen and the sugar and citric acid are water soluble so obviously it's going to melt to resolve that issue take them out of the fridge allow them to dry for about three or four hours first and the room temperature and starting to dry try a couple of firk try a couple at first and see how they do if they don't melt go ahead and finish doing the batch however if they do mount still melt let them dry overnight and then coat them with sugar you should be fine now another reason that can cause your candies of the sugar to melt is humidity so if you live in a place like Florida and you have a lot of humidity again if you don't have an air-conditioner you want to let them dry out first probably did overnight before you apply the sugar coating again try a couple of first at first see how they do and if they don't as long as they don't melt continue on now if high humidity is an issue for you what you could add is about a quarter of a teaspoon of cornstarch to your sugar mix about an eighth of a teaspoon more than a quarter because the cornstarch will all stick to it and though the sugar will just want to add a little bit of cornstarch to your sugar sour mix that will help with humidity because it will absorb that moisture so those are a few things there that I hope will take care of your sugar bubble tea problem that pretty much is the two major problems that people have with their candies now with regards the other one is the bubbles the air bubbles so if you make the can of butter it with virgin and you use the hand blender you end up with a lot of air bubbles to get rid of that allow your syrup to solidify so throw it in the fridge loud to completely solidify in a pot and then put it on to low heat remelt it and cast it that will take care of your air bubbles that way the other is like I said with the funnel so let me show you this so these were the clear ones that I casted with the with the funnel and as you can see there's no absolutely no air bubbles in this versus the ones that I did do with the bottle let me try and get a white one no they actually settled I know you're gonna have what mom wants to really show you with air bubbles this this round usually I do but yeah so do the as I said to get rid of that use the funnel or allow them to solidify remelt it and no more bubbles for you so that's everything there I'm just gonna take these out of the mold and give you and come back to say goodbye so here check these out don't they look cool like I said ones no air bubbles sticky still bye no air bubbles alright so you're gonna let those dry for about 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go and I'm going to show you a little trick here so one thing are dried a lot of you probably find when you put them in packaging they still stick together if you don't use the sugar coating so I'm gonna show you a little trick here how to avoid that okay so to help with that sticky problem all right so to help with that sticky problem what you're going to need is a little bit of cornstarch clear plastic bag or plastic bag and a bowl but you're gonna take something you're gonna take a little bit of cornstarch and you're just gonna sprinkle just a little bit into the bowl you don't want to do too much then take your hand and kind of spread it around this breaks it up and take your candies and just drop them in toss them through your cornstarch I'll cover it so you'll feel they won't stick together anymore and now if you find that you have there is excess on there that you would like to get off like these actually look pretty good but sometimes a little bit more if you use too much a little bit more will get on there you just put them into your bag [Music] and that will help with your sticky sticky problems and the best things to store them in is sello bags or miler bags ziplock baggies um cause them to get moist over time sticky and I found that they cause the absolute most problems so the mylar bags or cell bags are work great so thank you so much

fellows because I am reviewing yet another gummy I always say don't be a dummy don't buy a gummy but today for you guys it smells good though you can smoke through the packaging I have purchased yet another gummy because people told me the flourish flourish F flourish gummies are really great and that I will actually get quite stoned off of them so this is a hundred and fifty milligram edible it has been rated by the SE labs which means that you know it really does have 150 milligrams of THC in there like the packaging a lot very fancy packaging oh so if you haven't tuned in two weeks before you probably wondering why I happen to tell with me well that's because I like to have a little fat with gummy edibles as a good way of ensuring that the THC hits your bloodstream so ask us where if any gummy review I always take a little spoonful and Nutella or spatula for and until a beforehand so that way I can take the edible and your optimal conditions and with gummies you want to be doing this under optimal conditions alright so here we go mmm great every time so I got my fat in my bite let's open up the flourish again really fancy packaging look at that that's so cool well shiny we that we so we gotta open up here and it's in four or pyramid-shaped chunks this is the mango hybrid flavor hybrid being the strange some kind of hybrid we'd strain mango being the flavor oh it smells great smells like mango let's give it a taste almost choked on it well that tastes a lot better than a lot of the other gummi edibles this tastes a lot better than like it appears or infuse creations any of those it has very little weed taste I mean it does have Sun but but totally fun mmm very jelly like a jello like texture kind of hard to chew in fact all right guys well I'm gonna finish these last two cubes here and I will see you in two hours to let you know if this SC or excuse me flourish h1 50 mango hybrid gummy is actually working keep your fingers crossed for me guys because I would really love a potent gummy I will see you in two hours to let you know thanks for watching weeds guys I am back it's been two hours since I had the flourish mango 150 milligram edible and I think I finally found the gummy for me maybe it's too early to tell what just a sample size of one I don't know if anything's different about me but man this gummy it's not perfect I'm not the highest I've ever been at 150 milligrams but I am high I am definitely high which is a lot more than I can say for even 375 milligram gummy add or candy edibles that I've had in the past and certainly higher than that I like how it tasted too I tasted pretty good um I like the packaging and I kind of like the high it's it's it's it's more of like a body sort of high whatever hybrid strain and it's kind of great pretty happy with this I've got another one to review of their 300 milligram errs coming up and I hope it is twice as strong as this one if it is I will be in seventh heaven guys I might have finally found the gummy out there for me whoever recommended the flourish gummies thank you I'm glad I tried this and I am definitely looking forward to giving the 300 milligram a shot as well fingers crossed it's not just an anomaly or a fluke and that these are really the the the real deal in gummy land but I will be sure to review more and let you know for sure guys again I'm excited I'm excited thank you so much for watching this episode here on weeds glad we had a fun result I will check you out on the next review thanks for watching peace pretty good hello and thank you so much for

i want to show you guys how to make edible collagen gummy bears and this is super simple you probably have some of the stuff laying at home and it's time to use it instead of buying overpriced collagen gummies you can just make your own at home and here are the ingredients you're going to need sugar free jello and today's flavor is cherry this is the 11.2 gram serving so it has one packet in it which is right here then you're going to need some gelatin i really like to use knox gelatin it comes with four packets in it but today we're only going to use three packets that's all you need and the next thing would be let's be careful not to spill this the fruit juice one cup of fruit juice or one cup of water it's up to you i find that with the fruit juice it sweetens it up a little bit i am using peach fruit juice also need the molds of course the gummy bear molds and i got these on amazon i've already sprayed them with a light coating of cooking oil and then i wiped off the excess and a dropper for your gummy bear molds okay so let's get started so the other thing that you're going to need is the cooking pot for the stove first thing we're going to do here is pour our fruit juice into the pot and you're going to add your jello packet okay and you're going to add the gelatin with the gelatin you want to uh sprinkle it on there it helps the gelatin get in there a lot better here mmm it smells so good i can smell the cherry flavor one pocket my camera cut out but i did add the other two packets of the gelatin so there's three packets of gelatin in total here now we're gonna let this entire mixture sit for five minutes as you can see it's quite thick we're gonna heat this up on low and continue stirring frequently until everything is liquefied [Music] okay so everything is pretty much liquefied see so we're going to heat this up for another five minutes on low whatever you do do not let this boil if you boil it it can totally ruin the entire mixture so let's just take it slow [Music] i have shut it off here we go nice and liquidy very hot so we're going to take our dropper and we're going to drop them right into our molds [Music] so i actually have three trays full i had two full and then i realized there was still more so three trays is just perfect for this recipe now let these sit for 10 minutes in the molds after 10 minutes we're going to put these in the fridge and you want to leave them in there for three hours after that they should be perfect and ready to try out [Music] hey [Music] you", "MTn3wB7_Jnc": "hey guys welcome back to our channel so today is gonna be a little bit of a different video we're gonna be testing out these little gummy bear molds that I got from my sister-in-law she actually sent them over for the kids for Christmas and yeah so we're gonna try them out we did actually film this video yesterday and I filmed it with my kids but the recipe didn't come out very well I think I might have made a mistake on making it so I'm gonna add a little bit more gelatin today and we're to see how these would come out so these molds you can buy on Amazon for about $8.99 I have mine here in my dish rack just dry now cuz we did use them like I said they were just kind of like jello just a tip on these gummy bears they're not like your regular gummy bears tell you buy at the store but they are a lot healthier I'm gonna be using four ingredients you can use even less if you want to just put juice with them but and you do have to keep them in the fridge and I read that they can last up to two weeks in the fridge and a container so they're not like the gummy bears that you get in a package but if your kids like little treats like that then it's perfect so what I'm gonna be using today is just this pineapple juice I got from Walmart you're gonna want so any kind of juice that's not from concentrate and then I did go ahead and go on Amazon and bought the vital proteins beef collagen it's like grass-fed beef gelatin but this is the one that they saw at Walmart so I bought this one you need three tablespoons of gelatin a cup of your juice but I'm gonna throw in some strawberries so I'm gonna have to blend them up I'm gonna put them in there then measure up a cup with the juice here then we're gonna blend it and then we're gonna put it in the saucepan we're gonna add this gelatin let it it says that it has like bloom so you're gonna see little cracks on top and when that happens then we're gonna bring it up to a simmer you're not going to want to boil the ingredients then we're gonna add our honey after we take it off the heat because you don't want to mess up any kind of benefits from the honey so we're gonna do that and then we're gonna pour it in the molds put it in the fridge for two hours and we'll show you how they come out we'll let you know if they come out really good I did see a bunch of cool like health ones you could just put like turmeric in these molds and honey you can make like cool little gummies for one like your stick or anything like that but today we're going to be doing strawberry pineapple gummy bears so let's get started [Music] so I just removed these from the bridge and it's been a little over two hours I tried one and it actually came out pretty easily this is what they look like they're super cute and the true test is gonna be the taste test so let you know they taste [Music] all right [Music] I don't phony [Music] okay good [Music] I'm Annina Seth keep them in the fridge for two weeks but these wouldn't last two minutes and my head yeah I like these I don't usually know as honey baby house honey well if I had one kid this would be like the best like your first kid when you don't give them junk after you have five it's like I think the two tablespoons of honey was perfect well I don't the rejects so there you have it your gummy bears let us know if you've made these before and if you have come up below on any recipes that you might have that are really good and we'd love to see them Thank You Carol and Fernando and the kids for sending these cool little molds and yeah if there's any other things you want to try out go ahead and comment below and we'll see you guys in the next one says Diego always says peace out and God bless Turkish work it [Music]", "ia0fiogJKRs": "[Music] these are gummies that look exactly like the real fruit and they are so delicious ah so good and the best of all zero trans fats zero saturated fat zero cholesterol great fun snack and gluten free", "ZOEwJRlZG7s": "g'day welcome to the simple cooking Channel today I'm going to show you how to make homemade gummy bears before we get started you're gonna need some sort of mold like see what I've got now you can get this from an arts and crafts store basically this has got a little little bears in it now they're not easy to find so I will put a link to the place that I bought this from and and this cost me I think it was two dollars for one sheet now with a small saucepan just have it on the bench or somewhere put in 1/3 of a cup of water then add one satchel and these satchels vary the satchel I use has about 10 grams which i think is probably just a bit under a quarter of an ounce just slowly sprinkling there now this needs to be unflavored gelatin then you get your flavored gelatin and you want to use roughly 85 grams which is around 3 ounces now for this particular one I've chosen a strawberries and cream gelatin just pour it in slowly now once you've done this just leave this on the counter for roughly 10 minutes and it's about ready to put on the stove now put this on the stove we turn on to medium heat now we'll have this on here for roughly somewhere between 3 and 5 minutes and what we're gonna do is just give it a stir every now and then the idea is once this is dissolved it's ready okay that's ready to go let's do the next stage now just pour it into something that you can pour it out if it's got a little spent and just pull it into each mold leave that on the counter for I don't know five minutes a and then once it's just cooled a little bit and not for us to be able to transport it without it spilling anyway put the end of the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes well they're ready to go now what I like to do is I like to get a teaspoon of plain flour and teaspoon of castor sugar and just mix it together in a little shot glass like this once this has come out of the fridge just sprinkle it sort of over it this will just help the the gummies not to stick together so just do that again spread across it like that so make sure that you do wipe the excess off this because you know what spilling all over the place um well I hope you like my homemade gummy bears got so many yeah let's give them a go oh oh come come Frogger TV hmm I'll see you next time for my next meal [Music]", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check me out on instagram at the NJ chef don't forget to check me out on medical edibles calm every

but look finding these guys for you guys next time", "i1etHmADoHk": "hey guys it is so gloomy outside right now I just want to make some hot chocolate and cuddle up under a blanket on the couch and watch TV but yesterday when it was all so gloomy I spent my day in the kitchen making some DIY fruit snacks some of you might call them gummy some of you might call them Fruit Chews but no matter what you call them these actually are really yummy and they're really easy to make too I picked up some unflavored gelatin from my local Target you can find this from many grocery stores and for those of you who live the vegan lifestyle I found a website that might help you out with some unflavored gelatin that will work for your diet so if you go to a website called vegan essentials comm I've never shopped on this before but I just wanted to do a little research for you guys there's a product called Lieber's unflavored jello you use in place of the unflavored gelatin if you don't want to use this product the other things you'll need are 100% fruit juice and any type of silicone mold if you don't have a mold you can always just use a dish and pour it in kind of like jello and cut it into little squares or use a cookie cutter which I'll show you in this video before we get into the video a little bit about what's coming up on Friday I got this yarn I'm planning on making a loom knit yarn hat if you don't have a yarn loom you could probably just use a container and like I showed you in the yarn flower you could make your own loom somehow this one's out of thin yarn so this one with the thicker yarn will look much better and be a lot more cozy but this was just a test so if you like this idea let me know and I haven't tied it off yet if you're interested in seeing Friday's video and all of my upcoming Christmasy and holiday videos then please subscribe to my channel and click the thumbs up button and now let's get into making some yummy fruit snacks yummy gum you see for this recipe I'm going to be using some unflavored gelatin some 100% fruit juice any flavor that you want and a silicone mold I purchased my adorable mold from amazon.com I'll give you the link to that in the description box below also honey is optional for more sweetness and you'll want to use during spoons imagine cup a pot to mix in I'm beginning by getting a measuring cup and I'm just going to pour one cup of juice into that now pour your juice into the pot and you're going to measure two tablespoons of unflavored gelatin if you're using the exact same gelatin the I am you'll just use three of the packets let the powder completely absorb into the juice and then mix it together once it's nicely mixed you're going to turn on the flame to a low to medium heat and then you're going to just heat that up until you can't see any more powder it will just be really liquidy and at this point you can use some honey for more flavor you can use any type of essential oil such as vanilla or mint any type of flavoring that you want to and just add that into the pot now I'm using a syringe that I got from the pharmacy at Target they just gave it to me so if you go up and ask if they sell them they might just give you one I washed this with soap and hot water and then I am just filling it up with the mixture this just makes it a lot easier to fill up your little tiny silicone molds then if you have any mixture left over which I do you can just pour it into a plate with a groove or you can use any type of Bowl or glass pan to pour this into then you're going to put all your gelatin into the refrigerator and let it chill for maybe an hour it might not take that long but just to be safe and then once it's completely hardened you'll remove it of course and here I'm showing you that you can make little hearts or whatever shape you want by using cookie cutters and you can of course eat all the excess that is left over then the ones in the mold of course you'll just pop out carefully at all the cute little shapes will be revealed for my next batch I cut the recipe so I only used 1/3 of the ingredients and I'm actually using food coloring to color the apple juice since it's a really light color so instead of using 1 cup of juice I used 1/3 cup and that is enough to fill up this mold and still have some left over and then you just use one packet of the gelatin if you're using the box I am and any amount of other flavoring that you want and there you have it personalized gummies you can make any shape that you want and you can make any flavor essentially - so these are really cute and really fun snacks to have around I love eating gummies I think they're so yummy so this is a perfect way to make your home I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial if you did

liebman's Leber's leaders if you don't have a large yard gardening but I am just going to show you how to make it keep this is a hat Thai stick tight stay salt if you baby it's cold outside", "8YfY_NDparw": "and welcome back to my channel today I am going to be showing you how to make canna gummies I did a video on my channel on how I make that infused coconut oil so this is just pretty much a part 2 on how I make my gummies I'm going to show you what I use I had all measured out just to make it a little bit easier for you so you are going to need two packs of this jello it's 85 grams you only 2 of those you'll need 1 envelope of gelatin you will need 1/4 cup of cannabis coconut infused oil so I will link that video down below on how I made this and then you will need 1/2 a cup of water you can use juice or water I chose to use juice it just gives it more of a nicer flavor and you can't taste the weed then you are going to take your gummy bear trays which I got these on Amazon I think all for five of these were $20 so let's get started on the first step this is a very very easy recipe and anybody can do it I mean I can okay so we're going to put this on low heat and we are going to add our canna oil [Music] then our half a cup of water or juice you're gonna walk to so you're gonna want to get this to a boil I already pre turned it on so that's why it's sizzling like that so you're just gonna get it to a nice little boil and I do have this on medium heat so you don't want it to burn so just put it on medium then once it is boiled I will tell you the next step it's already hot so I should be able to add in my next ingredients which is the gelatin and the jello so again it's one cup of the gelatin and two of these 85 gram cellos I usually do not turn the burner on to warm it up so that's why it's like that this is one of the easiest recipes I have found so I am just stirring it and waiting for it to come to a boil which doesn't take long then I will start putting them in my trays so once it has just came to a boil like this you are going to turn it on probably one or two cuz you don't want it too high but you don't want it to get cold and then I have this and you're going to have to keep stirring it well you were putting it in the gummy tray if you don't the can't oil will kind of like go to the top like oil and water doesn't mix right so you just imagine if you stop mixing it like this it's not gonna work and then you are just going to put these in as you keep stirring it's kind of hard to do like both at once but you have to make sure that you keep stirring it I have not stirred it and then all of the oil goes to the top of the gummy bear and the gummy bear is just a terrible consistency it'll be gummy on the front and then the back it'll just be like pure cannabis so really it's not enjoyable for you to eat the gummies I usually get about four trays so I will just bring you a little closer and this is how the wheel gummies come out so not too hard so I'm trying to do this about hand just like this cute little cousin bears so that's how you make it it's really really easy to follow I can make it so you if you have any questions leave them down below and I will try to answer them for you", "up7S_6F7VTU": "[Music] what's up is it gonna generate a new video and today I'm gonna show you guys how to make a homemade

which are muy and charm oi so yeah these are the ingredients that you will need okay so you're gonna turn on your stove to medium heat and you're gonna put ten-foot budding lows and you're going to put and you're gonna put 1/4 of chamoy into the pan you're going to stir it you're basically going to be stirring it until all the pudding those are melted 20 minutes later and when nobody knows are almost done getting melted you're gonna put that that Hien with chamoy you're gonna put 1/4 of a cup chamoy with tahini and you mix it until they put butter in those are all knots it knows I'm melted you're gonna turn off your stove you're gonna find one look at gusano all of it in there [Applause] then you're gonna put three of these Lukas mango flavor then you're gonna put half a cup up Tajin

tahini because I want if you guys like it more on the sweeter side then you put more more Lucas mango flavor it's not too salty and it's not too sweet it's just in the middle so this is exactly how I like it since it's still hot I'm going to put it on a Tupperware okay so now that it's cool off and I have my beer I cleaned up here I washed her and everything nice and clean not for the final result

everybody my name is sarah b and welcome back to the haze today we're going to be doing another edible review we are going to be reviewing the very well known but new to me wild edibles so let's talk a little bit about wild in general they are a portland-based edible company and they specialize in using things that remind them of the pacific northwest and what makes it special and using those ingredients and those fruits and other items found in nature to make these awesome little gummies now in this box there is a hundred milligrams and there are ten small gummies i also want to just talk about real quick how the packaging is it is so cool so you open it like this and out comes this little pocket super easy to open you just squeeze on the side like this bam pop open and you will find these small little sugar coated gummies these gummies are made all with natural flavoring i absolutely loved these edibles they are not overly sugary at all which is fantastic they taste like a natural gummy something that you will find like in a trader joe's or something like that i started out with 40 milligrams and it hit it hit good too i loved it i wasn't overly i didn't feel dumb which some edibles can make someone feel dumb i didn't feel dumb i didn't feel like falling asleep was just so awesome i've been finding too many edibles lately that make you just want to pass out and these guys kept me up kept me going and once the high kind of wear it off and the after effects kind of left i still was able to have a great functioning day which is really nice i love the artwork that will did i love these little huckleberry flowers you'll see all over it and i believe every box looks a little different it goes with whatever the flavoring is which is really awesome on the inside it gives a little message and i'll read that for you the edible contains hybrid perfect for preparing for life's adventure it's a little like the perfect balance of wearing pajamas to work i just really appreciate the the thought process that went into the packaging and making of these edibles now i believe these guys are the number one selling edible in all of oregon and it makes sense they're based in portland but i found them also all over california they are a little bit more expensive than your normal edible but they are extremely consistent some edibles are really great one bag and they can taste great they'll be just like mind-blowing you can give a bag to your friend next thing you know they say it never hits them i don't believe this will be a problem with these guys i'd say if you if you were going to be hanging out at the house like all of us are right now but you're going to be studying maybe doing something for work i'd say eat one of these little guys and you're going to be chilling you'll be chilling you'll be chilling hard yeah so if you guys see these little edibles anywhere i would say pick it up you will not be making a mistake i promise you all right guys so that will be it for my small little review again my name is sarah b thank you guys so much for tuning back into the haze if you like this video please hit that like please hit that subscribe if you want to see more reviews and if you've tried wild please leave a comment below and tell me what you thought about them again guys my name is sarah b thank you so much for watching the haze your guide to a cannabis infused lifestyle and i will see you guys next time you", "Z9jrHoPJb3k": "[Music] [ __ ] enemy how y'all feelin did they mention it today we don't be talking about some [ __ ] kind of nanos these are some edible gummies these shits or Varmus [ __ ] but before we get into that [ __ ] of course you know I gotta ask you where the [ __ ] is another [ __ ] guys please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always say it cuz always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that so you can get a notification anytime so don't forget the follow up [ __ ] over on Instagram this cannot underscore me cannot under [ __ ] score me alright so if you don't like the word [ __ ] mother pregnant you should probably go to another [ __ ] sample I'm gonna just tell you that [ __ ] right now alright so hitting my little uh my extreme cubing dad my weed man came through the other day I want to say you sailor sunday driver I'm not 100% sure but the shade is bomb and any other boy with a little ounce of shape for Christmas so that's dope what kind of lead man gives you Christmas yes what kind of nanos Matt he's [ __ ] right here I ain't gonna front they probably the dopest they're probably the dopest edibles in my opinion that I've had that's on the market that I've had sorry he's gonna need no booze on the market I'm saying it was on the market that's I've had okay so I really like them it's a hundred milligrams and the whole thing and it's five milligrams each dummy now a lot of [ __ ] be like oh 100 milligrams etting she got it had thousand milligrams if you got a thousand [ __ ] from the [ __ ] shop it probably wasn't a thousand milligrams I don't give a [ __ ] what you say or what you think it probably was not a thousand milligrams now some people can't take that [ __ ] don't get me wrong but most people can't because I've had a lot of people that has say a hundred that ain't [ __ ] I ain't got I'd do a thousand I'd do 500 and then they'll take like 10 or 15 of a real actual tested gummy and number uh gonna be [ __ ] up so I don't want to hear that [ __ ] so you know but don't get me wrong some people's tolerance is stronger than that [ __ ] you know cuz I also know that because my tolerance is like probably 40 54 where I like my high to be and if I wanted I could go 60 70 and still be like oh I wouldn't like out there but I could see people being over 100 but my point is you give them up like as a try on the dole singing it yo [ __ ] is to hide I think you need to take a month like a break if your tolerance is too goddamn much so anyway in Tunisia's ah let's see you got twenty gummies in here so I can say it's 100 milligrams one gummy is a serving and so you're looking at 23 servings in this [ __ ] no I'm sorry so many free calories per gummy okay when you're looking at the fat to zero fats about six grams of sugar and I mean six rounds of carbs and four grams of sugar so if you're on a keto diet this definitely is not the one for you and if you are vegan this is not for you or vegetarian this is not for you and the reason for that is because this does have gelatin in it which is weird though because the main ingredient is going to be agar but then they put gelatin in it so you could have just stopped with the agar instead of putting the gelatin in it and this is why I say this for companies that'll do this I give you when I come into the dispensary and they'll ask hey do you have any vegan gummies right that's understandable I've never remember you might have had a [ __ ] come in and say do you have non vegan gummies even make sense so the average person I'm talking probably 95 plus percent of people do not know the difference between a vegan gummy and when it comes to the taste so if I was a company I would just make all my [ __ ] vegan because it don't matter who will eat it because now it can get to anybody because no one's looking for the gelatin the market is not looking for the gelatin so I would just change that up if I was you [ __ ] because they have some that are vegan and those are good and there's no difference in the taste so to me they might as well just do all of them as vegan so I don't know why they only do a couple of women beginning some of them not but that's that so the other dope thing with this company is that they do them in sativa indica and hybrid so I like that because now you can get a little specific with your filling and your effects of [ __ ] and some companies stick to just doing this shit's hybrid which i think is it I think it makes sense because you know if the person walks up and that's the only gummy there some people would not [ __ ] with it if it's in the car and not [ __ ] wouldn't fit sativa but if it's hybrid they're like all right let's go [ __ ] it let me get it so I see the positives of that however the ones who are able to beast like specific admission I see there should fly off the shelves way quicker then a hybrid ones so this one right here is a cran a crammed pomegranate punch weird [ __ ] I don't know but it did taste good and the other cool thing with this is that it's enhanced nano molecular technology that they put in here in gummies and what man no molecular means whoa I don't even understand how that makes it react faster because it makes it react faster but what that means is that's just like a way of like I guess you could say measuring like how the speed of your molecules changing inside of your body so I think what's happening here is that they've sped up the process somehow of making the molecules in your body change for you to feel that humming um it's scented at two hour waiting game these [ __ ] is like probably 20-30 minutes if that like I got to give it to a one what was it last weekend for some reason I couldn't sleep welcome to 1:30 was up like a [ __ ] and I had to go rock climbing at like 10 o'clock or so I was tired as [ __ ] didn't want to go because I hadn't had any sleep whatsoever so I took ten milligrams of this [ __ ] and this [ __ ] was like a six hour energy drink like it was dope it really worked there was no crash I was like goddamn that [ __ ] is pretty bomb and so I like that versus that two hours you don't know when is gonna kick in type of filling cuz I've had that [ __ ] happen before once and some edibles cup but god I took the [ __ ] because it took so long for dumb [ __ ] to kick in I'm sitting there and I'm like mm-hmm hey y'all see that leprechaun run by look how things are turning out of nowhere you forgot you took some [ __ ] so uh I like these because they react a lot quicker so I definitely say give these shits a try now let me show you what they look like they like in little coin shapes and they are gluten free for all you gluten-free [ __ ] out there so it's a little sugar sprinkles on top of it mm-hmm so I'm fine and taste of them are really good no no she was bomb man actually there's really really good so it says that the candies Awards I never saw this really the winner most accurate formulated edible I guess that you mean it's pretty consistent and what they're doing in it I guess it's on mark of what is supposed to but yeah I got a really say my Anisha it's a pretty dope and another thing is some people don't like it we on 5 milligrams per they like oh how come I can't get nothing stronger it's still a hundred milligrams in the package whether I gave you 10 10 milligrams or 25 milligrams it's still the same [ __ ] amount and I personally like when they can chop it down like that because first of all some of these gummies are just good goddammit and I like that [ __ ] so I like to be able to eat more than one and that's one thing the other thing is you have more control over your dosing so let's say you want to go 25 instead of going 20 or 30 like 20 is not enough but 30 is too much so you just want to be at 25 I ain't the one for biting the [ __ ] in half and then putting that [ __ ] back you got me [ __ ] up I don't think that smart I don't think that's a sanitary I think this is like a nasty bout [ __ ] you put that [ __ ] back into the bag with the rest of my fingers now you'll slime it and touch the other ones he you nasty so for me I like to go put five milligrams and so I can like micro dose my [ __ ] and I can have more than one I will say this does give you a little bit of after cannabis he tastes but who gives a [ __ ] it's [ __ ] candidates like I hate when people be whining over to flavor like my Adeline fat and in my mind I'm like I would like to taste the vodka but I'll still take a shot I know you know like oh I just love that case well you say you like the taste of survive that is because it was smoother than the dog [ __ ] you started on back in the day so get the [ __ ] out here so you don't get a little cannabis taste just you know manna lemon woman up and grab you chronic leaves and [ __ ] take the tents guys damn it but even with that being said it's really just a good good gummy but you do get a little bit aftertaste a little bit weak but anyway so definitely I say [ __ ] these if you find these [ __ ] I say get them I'm gonna ask the the company when I see them why they don't just do it all it just you know Eggar and just make them all plant based versus doing the gelatin I say this ain't no like oh go on and be vegan and about that this is literally just to me from a company standpoint it'd be like if I was only in the company I would just make it where I know everybody can get it but I wouldn't even promote them as being safe vegan I would just put them out on the shelf and let them be what they are so that would be me if I was the one doing it but anyway that's the end of this video I hope you guys enjoyed it like I say have you seen these [ __ ] make sure you get them and before you get out of here make sure you subscribe and hit that peace you can get that [ __ ] notification alright and go follow me over on Instagram so anyway I'm out of this [ __ ] y'all keep the love going y'all love each other y'all keep the peace going and be peaceful too each other and I would see our [ __ ] a [ __ ] slated piece the one I want to hit the sequel we in the jungle smokin we in a jungle smokin", "D7xYWUnC8UE": "hi everybody this is Jen from cookies cupcakes and cardio comm today I'm going to be showing you how to make gummy candy we're going to be using the nostalgia electrics gummy candy maker and I'm going to be showing you how to make the little tiny gummy bears and this giant one so let's get started so when I opened the nostalgia electrics gummy candy maker what I found inside were four individual trays like this and then four of these silicone liners so we've got worms fish and then two gummy bear components it comes with two of these heating pots and then this is the heating machine part that and that all the heat comes from that metal part in the center there it also came with a large gummy bear mold and a set of fairly exploit Ori instructions so I'm going to go through my recipe on how to make the gummy bears using this machine so the first thing we want to do before we start making our gelatin mix is we need to fill up the each of the trays with a layer of ice so I'm going to put about half of the container in make sure you want to make sure that your ice is level so it doesn't make any indents into your gummies so I've filled up the other ones already and now I'm going to turn my machine on the my one thing about this kit is that this machine does take quite a while to heat up that's my one complaint but I'm going to give you an alternative when I show you how to make the Jumbo gummy bear so into this pot is going to go 1/2 a cup of water and that's about its maximum capacity as well and then I have one container of a for serving amount of jello which is 85 grams and it's going in and in with it as well is three envelopes of gelatin which equal about 21 grams so you just put all that into the pot give it a stir and then you have to wait so the waiting is going to take probably about 10 minutes and it's going to start to thicken up right away and don't worry I started worrying right away that it will I'd ruined it but just you have to wait till it gets the pot gets really hot and it will get hot so be careful that you don't hurt yourself and you want to make sure that all the gelatin has dissolved in the water so when that has happened I'll be back to show you what it should look like so my gelatin mixture has been heating now for about 10 minutes and I can tell it's ready to go because it's real iqua fide and also the gelatin is in here is dissolved completely so that tells me it's ready to be poured into the molds but it's gonna take that off now another slight complaint here is that the little heating pot is a little bit unstable so I don't want to be pouring this hot liquid while the heating pot is kind of a sided so I'm just gonna turn it off and take it and put it over to the side now really handy are the little spouts on the side here so I can just gently pour them into the molds and fill them up so it takes about 15 minutes for these smaller ones to set so I'm gonna fill up all of my molds here and then I'm going to show you in the meantime while these ones are setting I'm gonna show you how to make the Jumbo Teddy the Jumbo gummi mold to make the giant gummy bear we're going to be using berry blue jello you can use any flavor that you'd like to and it takes two packages and these are for serving packages and they equal a hundred and seventy grams in total we're going to be using six packages of the Knox gelatin unflavored and that equals 42 grams 1 cup of water and the Jumbo mold that's included in the machine kit so let's put this together and make the giant gummy bear so in this one I'm going to show you a different way to make the gelatin and you can do the same for the smaller jellies that I showed you previously if you don't have the machine so all you have to do is pour your unflavored gelatin and your flavored gelatin into a microwaveable dish or a bowl or one like this I like this one just because it has a pouring spout then taking a whisk just whisk it up together and then you're going to put this mixture into the microwave for between a minute and two minutes and what you're going to be looking for is a nice liquid consistent seikhs that's going to start to gel up again like it did previously and making sure that all the little crystals have just melted into the liquid so I'm going to do that now and then I will be back now that my mixture has mixed together completely I'm going to pour it into my gummy bear mold and then once I've got it all in my mold it's going to go into the freezer for the quickest solidification you can leave it on the counter that's just fine but putting it into the freezer will take about half an hour to 45 minutes so I'm gonna pop that in and then I'll be back to show you how to unmold your little ones which are probably going to be ready now once it's been about 15 minutes all you have to do to check to see whether or not your gummies are set it's just to give your mold a little wiggle and I can tell that they're nice and solid so to remove them from the silicone mold it's really quite easy you just can pick them up pop it out like that and then just pry away with your fingers like that so our final step is to remove the jumbo gummy bear from the mold so this is just like I did with the silicone molds so you're just going to pull back on the sides and then pull it out and it's as simple as that so I'll be right back to close the video so there you go everybody how to make a gummy candy using a gummy candy maker now what I liked about the gummy candy maker was the molds I thought they were really cute and I especially liked the Jumbo mold but what I found disappointing was that the maker didn't come with any gelatin and the length of time that heating up the gelatin using the machine than it comes with it just took a long time with what you can do in the microwave for 1/2 two minutes so that's my review of the gummy candy maker I hope you enjoyed the video remember to give it a thumbs up if you liked what you saw and if you'd like us to review a different product make sure you leave that in the comments I'd love to see what you guys are interested in buying so I will see you all again next time bye you", "itjKYWD-H50": "as i made this chamois and gummy bears it's so good", "MxPBmxnLivM": "[Music] two wheats the marijuana animal review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and today we are talking about krispity krunch II no I'm just joshing with you we're not talking about Peter Barnes but I'm on camera one because they're good too because they're high in fat and three because we're actually reviewing a hundred million gummy bears what's correct we are reviewing the ED of your 100 milligram Getti gummy bears today looking at in another this is another in this series if that appeared that we're going to be reviewing smaller dose to the last time we took these if history is going to repeat them itself these will taste awful and won't get me that high I'm hoping against hope that both of those things aren't true but there are no guarantees so the peanut butter minims just that just bad to help me get some of this as the best part of this th e so that's why I'm eating news those are gonna taste so much better than these I have a feeling alright let's open it up here oh man I thought last time this packaging was easy to open but now it's not looking so good balls all right I'm gonna have to grow grab some scissors technical difficulties back that's a negative anytime you have to go for the scissors she'd never have to do that finally finally let's give it a sniff oh man Oh smells like gummy bears with weed here we go that is awful oh and it gets worse it's got that harsh aftertaste oh oh they're so bad oh why would you do this to yourself and get gummies guys why why candies and goes-- why I don't understand it I really don't but I'm willing to keep doing it for you guys just because you seem to like them I I I'm not sure I get it so the head of pure 100 milligram gummies guys I'm going to finish these bad boys off not looking forward to it and I will see you in two hours to let you know how they are feeling and let's hope against hope one last time that they are the exception to the rule and I am coming to you blazed in two hours but not too optimistic see you two hours peace it has been two hours since I had the head of your gummy bears 100 milligrams and nothing really I can't say nothing I little high it's sort of as equivalent if I had maybe smoked a small bowl recently so on about in line with what I thought not a good value proposition at ten dollars not at all they tasted awful tasted really really bad and I'm not very high there isn't really a lot to say about the etta pure gummy bears and then they taste terrible and they really don't get you that high I have a few more and appears to review and I hope things turn around for them and again I want to I do want to say that I think these are more potent than like the infused creations that I've had so take that as you will but you know just gummies and candies just don't do it for me they may do it for you edibles you know can everybody experiences them a little bit differently maybe they just don't seem to work but I'm willing to give ed up here a fair shake in the future reviews guys and I hope you will too should you stick around for future reviews and thank you so much for watching this episode we'll catch you on a future one peace hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "CuS8zdDf4Ro": "hey everybody hey guys Justin and Jennifer here with Ravi yoga and wellness so glad to have you joining us today we want to share a brand new product that we just got into the studio I guess it's been maybe a couple of months now months it's Smokey's gummies edibles they are actually out of Oregon and this company Smokies started with a THC product a product that includes THC and they only recently just started having CBD products on their lineup as a result you don't see terribly much information on their website but that is why we wanted to do this review it's really funny the the salesman you're really good of an away the salesman gave me a call it was a random maybe Friday afternoon and wanted to know if we wanted to carry these in the studio and where yoga and wellness studio so I thought no I actually no I thought no we don't need any more gummies and he said no no let me just send you these I'm telling you as soon as you've tried them you'll buy them and he was right they're good he sent me five different varieties and four gummies and one hard candy we still carry all of those in the studio and they were so good the first one I had is a different one that that we will review later the first one I had was so good I couldn't just eat one ga - no I ate all of them I one of all this so I basically had no beauty function the hard candies only had 15 milligrams so there was I think it I think I did the math it was like 85 milligrams so I must have had only four samples anyways I was not high because there is zero THC I did see it let's show them that there's that on the back corner there's zero THC so I was a high but but let me tell you ladies I did not care no should I think you're the rest today I was like what is wrong and then I put in a huge order because I love them and so does everybody else so in this bag you get ten gummies that are 25 milligrams of CBD each the nutrition labels right here on the back there is about 2 grams of sugar per gummy so it's not too bad for those people out there that are concerned about sugar and bean gummies they are 25 milligrams and each gummy right here well I'm just reiterating it there that's a logic of me CBD love all the gummies are gluten free they're not all vegan friendly they do have some vegan friendly options and we carry we have so couple of those flavors in the studio though we also have some sugar-free options as well yep that's true but today's review is on the watermelon flavors not just watermelon it's sour watermelon so I'll just take it from the team so you're gonna notice like when you open they come resealable which is really nice oh my gosh and I'm having trouble getting it open this might be a sign I did not I did not and they're little bitty squares and they're super delicious I actually really like the sour kinds of candies and so this is like a holler back to like the lemon heads or what are those super sour candies that the kids love these days anyway so they're a better sweet tarts but they're gummies but these are gummies in there there's no that's our daughter she just went potty okay so we will have to finish this review very quickly so this um you'll see a little bit of the sugar on the outside it tastes amazing you can eat half of it and then you get like half of the CBD but we preferred all of it so we like to eat all of it yep and if you got our website they said they're revamping their website so it's really because of the THC and because the laws in Oregon have changed to where they can't market gummies anymore because of kids obviously so the website will be updated in the next couple of months is what they said that they're a little bit behind but I wanted to show you the website a little bit they also said I actually talked to our rep on the phone today here is here is the about page well let me see if I can show you my inner I'm only as fast on my internet so as you can see it's a really nice website it's really pretty the problem is the about page is pretty it's it's pretty bare-bones right now they do not offer the third-party test results they do not offer any of the like ingredients list and you also can't buy the products online from their website yet however you can buy them from our thrive hemp store website thrive hemp store calm we should be able to keep the inventory updated there I hope and if you ever have any doubts you can give us a call at four to three to nine zero to three to six again this is in the US we can ship inside the US once you start shipping overseas it gets a little hairy I believe I know that several other CBD companies do have trouble trying to ship overseas so if you're interested in trying a really good it's absolutely delicious gummy it has 25 milligrams of CBD isolate it is not the full spectrum it is a nice lip we absolutely love the Smoky's brand CBD we sell a whole bunch of these things have actually kind of over passed our other brand that we had in the studio and so we absolutely love them and think you should try it out the sour watermelon is awesome so is basically every flavor so as a result of that we're gonna like review every flavor so that we get to taste them that's right so if you like this review or have some products you would like us to review send them to us yeah yeah and leave us a note below let us know what you think of the Smokey's CBD gummies with 25 milligrams each and if you want to buy some check us out at thrive hipster calm see you soon buh-bye thanks so much", "QfHhEF4uQzE": "right I was right about one in it's so good I'm

stuff that we need and the ingredients are mango juice powder unflavored gelatin maple syrup two silicone molds can be any type of moles a pan and always to stir up your ingredients let's get on with the video so we start putting the mango juice but after the mango juice remember it can be any type of hunger any of your favorite flavors okay and then the powder unflavored gelatin and after the maple syrup and now we start mixing okay and after a couple of minutes of mixing it should be like this like a very thick consistency and then you have to make sure that all of the gelatin chunks have dissolved now when you're done mixing you have to let it set for three to four minutes and then we put on the stove let's see you later nothing's on the stove to put on medium heat and start mixing and start mixing forth three to four minutes now that it's done mixing turn off the heat and then it's gonna be ready to put in the mold okay like the pan here and put the syringe in Phil is here or you can put everything into a bottle and squeeze it in so we were needed a couple of ones here and this is how it turned out we're gonna make more remember guys remember not to spill outside and

got gummy bears you want CBD I got CBD you want CBD gummy bears I got CBD gummy bears what's up guys at your boy big J coming back at you again today from big Co TV where you watch decide in vain and today as promised I've got gummy bears all right but I've got gummy bears with CBD in them alright and they are amazing I've been using these two weeks ish I mean I've been using CBD on and off for quite a while alright and it actually works wonders for me for a lot of different things but we'll go into that in a minute these things they taste good they work well and it's an easy form for you to take your CBD that's what that's all I can say if you haven't tried CBD you truly need to try alright it's not a gimmick it's not you know you see all these wonder drugs if you're one of those people like me that don't like to go to the doctor you don't like to take the prescription stuff you're not a big fan of over-the-counter of this over-the-counter that and you just want something natural to help ease what you got going on try these alright just trust me and try these so without further ado let's go ahead and check out the bottle alright so here you go we've got the Big Daddy pack of CBD FX gummy bears as you can see CBD FX help gummy bears the 60 count oh yeah the Big Daddy does contain full spectrum CBD they are gluten-free non-gmo and vegan all right which is cool you got a you know there's a lot of vegan folks out there these days a lot of people that can't do Blut inand all that stuff you can still have these alright you can still have these that's cool trust me it's cool ingredients organic cane sugar organic tapioca syrup water organic seaweed extract natural flavors and colors organically grown CBD rich hemp oil gummy bears contain no corn syrup no animal gelatin no artificial sweeteners which leads to guilt-free indulging never tasted better very true these are delicious the statements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose treat or cure any disease always consult with your physician before use underage sale prohibited that's what I was talking about earlier the FDA hasn't said you know the FDA of course being the FDA says that you can't make claims you can't do this you can't do that about CBD because they haven't studied it so all I'm going to tell you about is my own personal experiences with these but we'll get to that again cannabidiol CBD is CBD FX is naturally occurring in the industrial hemp plant and legally imported and produced very important it is legally imported and produced CBD FX does not sell or distribute any products that are in violation of the u.s. Controlled Substances Act the USCS a hashtag feel the difference will roll around a little more supplement facts a serving size is two gummy bears so basically there are 30 servings in here 16 calories per serving so that's 16 calories for two gummy bears no fat 3.6 grams of carbs 2 grams of sugar 20 milligrams okay of hemp per serving and 10 milligrams of CBD per sir roll it around again and bang we're back to the front now for my favorite part I'm gonna go over some facts and eat a couple of these alright guys so as promised here it is got my facts sheet now just so I can make sure I'm telling you the right stuff so on the bottle you saw the CBD is legal that is used inside this product you may have looked and went well why is CBD legal you know I've heard the CBD isn't legal done it up let me go over that okay our products are exempt okay meaning CBD FX's products are exempt from the CSA and DEA s drug scheduling practices which classify whole half extracts as schedule one drugs because extracts from the stocks of European grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice and that is where the hemp is grown that these guys use to extract the CBD it is grown the biomass is over in Europe their product does meet the standards of the 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp which means it has to contain less than 0.3% of THC in the gamete or in the product period in the CBD oil period and again they only use CBD that is derived from a European biomass so that's how it's legal it is also non psychoactive and non psychoactive hemp was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 so there are your working facts now let me tell you a couple other things that are also some facts these things are freakin delicious alright the red they're my favorite color alright they taste like a fruit punch slash cherry I mean they're delicious so pop the cap you're gonna have a little safety seal I just normally yeah I just shut my thumb through here they gave me a couple bottles of these but I figured to show you your fresh bottle so pop it open and really they are little gummy bears I mean they look just like gummy bears and they basically tastes just like gummy bears except with a little pop so there you go it really is just a little gummy but I mean you know what I love these things so now that the FDA which you can and what you can't say let me roll that around so you get a nice glamour shot there since the FDA has determined what you can and can't say I'm just gonna tell you some personal experiences for me again I've been using CBD on and off three years what it does for me and in particular the CBD F FX products what they have done for me I used to be the guy that goes to bed let's say 10 o'clock at midnight I'm still up why cuz my brain won't stop okay it won't turn off I'm just going going going going going sit there flip through social media think about work think about this think about that couldn't shut my mind off I popped two of these half hour hour before bed I'm out and when I'm out I mean I am out don't wake up in the middle of the night no tossing no turning just everything just shuts down that's nice alright that's what I use it for also I work in a warehouse during the day yes that's right I am NOT the YouTube famous you know YouTube superstar I have a day job um and a work at a warehouse I do a lot of walking around you know up ladders down ladders all kinds crap I come home I am sore alright pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away okay after a workout at the gym pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away I mean it's not it's not a super drug but it takes the edge off for me okay other people you know say they use it for anxiety and stuff like that I don't really know if I have anxiety but I will say when I do take them it puts me in a just a nice mellow mood but it's not anything that you that you aren't functional you know I mean I could eat these in the morning before I go to work put in eight hours all day and still be totally fine doesn't make me drowsy even though it does help me fall asleep but the reason that helps me fall asleep like I says it just helps me turn my mind off so that being said I highly suggest you try something like I said if you're like me you don't like all the over-the-counter crap you think a lot of stuff that the doctors give is just you know blah blah mumbo-jumbo because they want you know Big Pharma wants to show some pills down your throat try these all right just try them what's the worst that's gonna happen it doesn't work for you okay sorry you know but I'm telling you most of the people that I talk to they've tried this it works for once you find out how many you actually need okay just because it says take two too might not work for you you might need four you might need six okay try it don't just write it off if it doesn't work the first time okay trust me just give me a favor and trust me on that it does work it really does I wouldn't I wouldn't I'm not the snake oil salesman all right so I'm just gonna be done trying to convince you hopefully you take my word for it and

the apple cherry I have it is gonna tell you all about the c4 and the quality and the taste anyways the taste I did not like it and the good thing about I got from GNC the good thing about GNC is that you have a 30 day policy return I went the next day which is today and I returned it and I exchanged it for this one the lid I've never heard of it before well only once I try to sample but the guy from there he said you know it's one of the best selling ones over there and this is the gummy worm flavor and pretty much the supplement facts are close to the c-4 when it has three point two grams of beta-alanine and it has 250 milligrams of caffeine so c4 I think it has 250 or 300 the ultimate one okay so almost the same I'm pretty sure the pump is gonna feel alright I'll test it out I've never taken it before I'll test it out the flavor I'm pretty sure is gonna be good to the gummy more so I'll let you guys know how I feel how it tastes on all that stuff okay so if you haven't checked out the c4 make sure you go check it out let me know what you think and comment below let me know if you guys want me to do a views of you know protein or certain type of creatine well creatine there's there's one coming at you cuz I'm currently taking the ghost one it's called a ghost sighs I'm testing it out I've taken creatine before and it did work very well and I'm testing this one out

okay I still feel like I fit in on my wrists right now the feedings started to go away but I worked out for like what over hour hour and 15 minutes and the pump lasted I don't feel the shakes afterwards so overall I give it a 10 out of 10 I think I'm gonna stick with it for a while till I start responding to it and that's what I'm cycle ah six-week on they say or like a month and a half

you with another weed review we review number 10 today I'm doing something a little bit different we're going to do an edible review it is Incredibles indica Fruit Chews it's a hundred milligrams each one of these is ten milligrams and there's ten of them in there so each one of these right here is ten milligrams so I'm gonna go ahead and give those a try I'm gonna pause the video wait till I start feeling the effects and then I'll start the video back up again and we'll see where we go from there are these it's been about 20 minutes and yeah they're pretty effective you can feel it right off the bat I'm sure as time goes on as time progresses they get stronger and stronger but about 20-25 minutes in boom you can definitely feel that they're definitely there it's you know I mean it's definitely very very very effective no indica I don't know how you're going to feel the difference between indica and sativa when you're eating when you're eating edibles I don't know because it affects your body so much I don't know how you would be able to feel the difference between an indica and a sativa but these are in different shoes so yeah I don't know you know I'll be able to tell but um yeah these are pretty effective the price point for these ten of these gummies which equals a little over a hundred milligrams cost $17 they were on special for $17 I think they were normally like $19 or $18 so they weren't special for $70 I think it's well worth it for seventeen dollars you get blasted out in your brain basically 100 milligrams is pretty good thousand milligrams is insane

me son and I fell in love with them so I just want to see if I was able to make it myself and I'm standing like this because I'm like leaning down because I cameras right here I did it chair and so um so yeah like I see these companies then I'm making dance and immense people so I was just like maybe you can make it at home see if you can make it at home and except for ordering it glad like forwarding it so now who are I seen a couple of videos repo doing this and so what I'm going to use I'm sure I'm going to use these premieres very open because in a1 ISM and then I'm going to be using some Tajin and then some Chum way and that's a lot of people using like I don't know it's colic mega mega to Miguelito something like that it's kind of like da hue like the powder whatever but I guess is just like those I have the spicy yes and I'll be poor using like Lucas and I feel like Lucas would be like what there but um I didn't get that I just wanted to do it with like stuff you have at home ready and I feel like the majority of Mexicans already have like chamoy in the heat for sure the heat you could do it this way or you could do it the other way if you want to add more stuff to it so if you want to see me do this I just felt like it'll be something to do and record me try it because the one that they sent me where the ring looks like the little circle what's it called that means whatever and then they sent me the worms I finally know what the Rings like I wish I would've bought some rings like the water really really bad they're a fire but um the ones they sent me were like super super spicy like I felt like they added something else into it that made you like spicy cuz I was like choking because it was like really spicy um I'm just gonna be using that so if you want to know how to make these um gummy enchilada like that's what it's called but yeah then keep on watching I wish I would have got like a bunch of cuz it will do skittles they do skittles all they do gushers and just like the gummy bears and the rings and just all of that but I'm just gonna do something simple just to show y'all and let y'all know how it tastes so what I'm going to do first let me adjust this I put it down so y'all can see better I'm in my kitchen because I feel like this is better nighty because we have like the LED lights or whatever in here hmm and I don't have a red light so might as well okay so on this one I'm going to be putting the tawheed [Music] [Music] if we get started I bought this and you little I got a fiesta or oh I think I got this at a bit Caudill somewhere by help yourself I got some Adamek goggle and I use the majority of it you see how much is gone I used the majority of it on ok so I just tried the Chumlee and I'm talking and it didn't really stick so I didn't want to show that because it was just gonna be a waste of time so I found this other the other way to do it so let me show you to make it more sticky you're going to need some powdered sugar I already had this cuz um last time I made some french toast and then you're gonna need half a cup so you're gonna need half a cup of the powdered sugar and just like a little container to having it so it says to do half a cup of powdered sugar but I don't think that's true because half a cup is too much [Music] [Applause] I do like that much kilala meant a half a cup and this whole thing and then they only have a little bit like this so they'd be lying and then I'm gonna it says true teaspoon so I'm just going to do that and then I'll mix it and then I'll be right back it's why Michael did for ten seconds this is how it looks so now I'm gonna get the gummy worms and then um put them put a little bit in here and I'll put the gummy worms on the boat and shake it a little bit someone put the gummy bears in here I [Applause] think that's good I want just a little bit I mean our last favorite so much just save the rest for him and then I'm going to pour this want to pour a little bit cannot see and then I'm going to shake just so like um the stickiness cook over they're all stuck together and I'm just going to pour on it they're really sticky in the way that I did it before with just wrote the like I mean bears in the chamoy and then roll it in the Tajin but it really doesn't work that way cuz it's like really slippery in this way the dummies are like really um sticky so it sticks to the cushion cuz I like them spicy the garlic try now I really want to try this one it looks really good he required my reaction oh this one looks so good I just want to try it I see how that looks and it's like really sticky can you show you the rest and if you want more like spiciness to it you could add more so let me try this mmm you saw for the look it just gives your leg a different taste they just are like just plain oh my god they're good but I feel like it'll be better if I put if you just add different like the old Lucas packs or whatever the little ones that they so you could get them like at the grocery store or I'm dinkum so if you like this video please I'm trying to talk blow because there's a guy here doing my restaurant yeah and I lay asleep right now so just try and do this video real quick here so yeah if you like this video it's easy and bomb please give it a big thumbs up and don't forget to Like comment share and subscribe and I think I'm gonna do it a video tomorrow sorry I don't know today is Tuesday so just stay tuned up Ali pause this video tomorrow I have to edit it tonight and everything but if I like this video now I'm gonna do more like just with more candy and skittles and just like a variety of stuff please comment down below share this video and yeah thank you for watching", "8Q20EGzHN9A": "How To Make Sour Gummi Candy Hey everybody I've got a really good\nrecipe today I'm gonna show you how to make sour\ngummy candy this stuff tastes better than the one get store and it's really easy to make you just need a few ingredients.  for the\nwet ingredients one cup of apple juice and one half cup of corn syrup for the dry ingredients you need a six-ounce pack of Jell-O or 2 three ounce packs.  today I'm trying it with strawberry and you need a matching pack of Kool-Aid.  ideally you should have the same flavor. you can mix and match but until you get the hang of this I would stick with the same flavors Jell-O/Kool-Aid combinations that work: Grape/Grape Lime/Lemon-Lime Cherry/Cherry Watermelon/Fruit-Punch you need four envelopes of gelatin.  if you\nstart making this regular which you might it's going to be cheaper if you get the twelve packs and you need some citric acid (1 tablespoon or 15ml) this you can buy at any pharmacy or\nchemist depending on what part of the world\nyou're in and but they might have to order it for you but it's usually takes a day or so it's\ndefinitely worth the wait. so what you're going to do is turn the heat on to medium, about. that's not going to burn the pot, don't worry about it the liquid is going to be in pretty quick. you get one cup of clear unsweetened apple juice. if it's a little short or over, it doesn't matter then get 1/2 cup of golden corn server and measure that pour that in now for this recipe you should have a silicon spatula it just makes life just so much easier for\nall of it give that a brief stir and just let that come to a full boil over medium heat while the liquids are heating up, I'm going to prepare the dry ingredients start with the Jell-O, cut the pack open get that in a bowl with a tablespoon next the Kool-Aid. there's no particular way to mix this up so it doesn't matter how you do it then the gelatin. I like using scissors for this saves a little bit of time. cut the tops off, pop that all in there now the citric acid you got to be really\ncareful with this okay you definitely don't want to put too\nmuch though like any dish you can adjust it for taste so that's all the dry stuff in what you're going to do is carefully mix this up, picking up the powder from the bottom until it looks \nbasically even the liquid hasn't come to a boil yet what I'm going to do is prepare the pan in the meantime for the pan I use tin foil cake pans\naround 7-8 inches something like, and I get some plastic wrap so what do you do you tear off enough of a long piece so that you will have some overlap and make sure you do this away\nfrom the stove heat okay you definitely don't want this near an open flame, it will melt pretty quick press the plastic wrap into the pan like that so on either of the short sides nearly up and that you've got a really good overlap on\nthe far sides take that away for a bit it's nearly reached a boil at this point if you're going to be\nwatching it constantly, yes it is safe to turn the heat right up now what's important is that you do not\nsplash liquid up the side of the pan because if you do it will stick and it\nwill burn which is what you don't want alright.  so what I'm going to do is carefully nudge the heat up here okay so this is the stage of boil you're\nlooking for you'll notice on the far side of the pan a \nlittle bit did splash up and burn but as long as I don't pour the candy out through that, it should be okay if you want to test it what you do is gently move the spatula through the bottom of the pan and it comes to a full boil.  that's what\nI'm looking for turn the heat off put that to the side. get your dry ingredients ready and basically just pour them right in like that. set that to the side and now turn the heat back on right down to low heat though the purpose is this is to keep just enough heat going under this\nthat the gelatin dissolves completely before I put it in the pan it's been two or three minutes at low heat and what I've been doing is I have been\nscraping down the sides avoiding the burned patch to get the mixture back down into the main mass of ingredient here. it's very important\nthat you stir gently because even with that you can see that there are air bubbles that have been put into the gelatin and you\nreally don't want that it'll clear up when it settles but you still may have some on the top okay for this part I do get a glove because the pan has become pretty hot. and I'm going to pour very very slowly and if you'll notice the burnt piece is\nnot in here there you go now for those of you that don't like those\nbubbles on the top I'll show you quick how to do this like I said all you're going to do is lose\ncandy and once it's cold no one is really going to notice and no one is going to fault you for having an air bubble in things that taste this good, and if they do well just don't give them any, alright. there you go. pick that off, scrape it into a bowl and go again and if there's some that just won't quit you can just nudge them off into a corner I'm going to let this set on the counter top basically until it doesn't jiggle see that, there is way too much motion and\nwhen it's nearly set, I'll pop it in the fridge for a few hours and I'll show you how to cut it. so the gummies have been in the fridge for a couple of hours that's what it looks like now. this should come out quite easily. you just grab it on both sides there pull it right out of the pan, put the pan on the side that's clean. you can give it a quick wipe if you want and definitely use that again. before you turn it over you want to make sure that the plastic wrap is not stuck in too bad it looks pretty good so it's going to take it quick, turn it over, then giving it a tug from the sides you want to make sure it's all clean that edge is up, that's good see what I'm doing there, hold it flat that came off all in one piece what you're going to do is start cutting. make sure your hands are clean it's still a bit sticky. you're going to cut it in pieces like that. you can either use a small knife like I've got if you want to get fancy and do worms and stuff, you can do that actually I think I will get a larger knife, it's a lot easier and I'll show you, just a minute if you get a nice French knife and after you cut one strip off what you do is get there kind of rock it through what you want to do is pull off strips like this once you've got your strip pulled off, I would do them all in strips like that first so once you've got enough room, then you want to start cutting them up like that in little squares that's what I have that bowl there for see on the other side there you might have a few air bubbles and who\ncares. I think those are pretty good treat size I'm going to finish chopping these up there is today's recipe, sour gummy\ncandy I really hope you guys try this out,  it's\njust awesome, it really really is look at the color of that and if you wanted, you could if you\nwanted get a cookie cutter or something and maybe do little shapes or stars or whatever\nyou felt like if you could get a small enough cookie cutter for this.  personally once people have tasted these things, they won't really care what they look like so once again thank you for watching my\nstuff and I'll see again", "i-JX7qnWkR0": "[Music] kitty up so the ingredients that we're going to need for our gummies are pretty much the same as the original you're gonna want two packages of the um jello this is the three ounce the small box or 85 grams whatever flavor you'd like two tablespoons or two packages of unflavored gelatin so two packages of those nox unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water room temperature and a half a cup of water ice cold you have to have ice cold water to bloom gelatin we're going to want a quarter cup of light corn syrup for those of you who don't like like do not like corn syrup you can use invert sugar glucose honey or a gob you just need a syrup in there and what it does is it creates a barrier between your sugar crystals so that they don't come back together that's why it's needed some type of syrup we are going to need a quarter cup of can of butter a quarter teaspoon of citric acid a half a teaspoon of gour gum and gorgum is an emulsifier which allows us to bring oil and water together because as everybody knows they are mortal enemies so in order for them to be able to become friends you use an emulsifier and what an emulsifier will do is it takes each molecule a water molecule and an oil they go in together in a bubble and it creates a bubble around uh those two molecules so it creates its own um kind of uh it creates an emulsion that's what it does and that's what emulsion is bringing oil and water together to be a uniform liquid you cannot use xanthan gum it is not an emulsifier it is a thickener and it is a stabilizer it is not an emulsifier gum is an emulsifier a stabilizer and a thickener as well as it has a natural gummy uh texture to it which helps with your gummies and for those of you who don't use it or can't get it uh you can use soy it would be one teaspoon of soy or sunflower lecithin the other reason why i like the gourd gum is it has no flavor whereas lecithin does and i don't like the flavor less of them in substitute of water if you want to add a little bit more flavor boost you can use these kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters or basically any juice that doesn't contain real fruit if you do use a juice that has real fruit you have to use a mold inhibitor like this little the lorraine's mold inhibitor and that is a must otherwise they will go moldy in a couple of weeks then this is optional this and alcohol or um everclear the 94 alcohol or grain alcohol a really cool trick alert with this uh which you'll have to wait till the end to see it um but yeah this is an option um or if you make tincture you can use your tincture provided it is made with the high percentage alcohol it has to be the 94 ish around there for flavorings you can use the lorraine flavor oils i'm today i'm going to be making uh lemon raspberry so i'm going to start with a lemon base split it up split out half raspberry and make the other half of them and make them look all pretty gel food coloring now if you want to create a solid background white food coloring a thing with this you can only use one or two drops if you use too much your gummies will not set no matter what you can freeze them you doesn't matter what you do they will not set if you use too much very important one or two drops only and i think i've got all the ingredients here covered let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made all right so the equipment that we are going to need is basically the same as the old recipe there is one major difference we are going to throw away the immersion stick or the hand blender that apparently is a very bad thing for our gelatin so on top of creating a mountain of air bubbles so that your gummies don't turn out nice and clear it also breaks the gelatin so for any of you have this white goopy stuff on the top of your candies the silicone spatula or silicone whisk is going to resolve that issue so we're not going to use the hand blender silicone only metal will damage uh the gelatin who knew it was such a delicate little flower so silicone spatula very important silicone or a wooden spoon a little strainer or a bigger one if you've got one doesn't have a small one a small um saucepan heavy bottom is preferable and on heat transfer which means when you look at the bottom of your pot there is no discoloring um it's always one even if it is discolored in spots it means that your pot gets hotter in those particular areas and it can damage your uh your product so heavy bottom not heat transfer is the best thing to go for you of course your gummy molds these bottles are one of the best for dispersing your um dispensing your syrup into the into the molds they're by a sweet sugar bell and two reasons i like is because it uses the decorating tips which makes it nice as well as they have a very deep um lip to them whatever you call this a lip screw thing if you use the dollar store ones or ones that um have the really short short neck on them and then uh you're more likely it's the lids gonna pop off because the syrup is warm there's not a lot well the pressure on it it just pops them off so fair warning either that or um one of these candy funnels uh works great as well or the little odd dropper things that those some of those molds come with you're going to need some parchment paper and a drying rack i think i have most of the equipment covered you know me i always forget something um so let's jump right into those ingredients and let's get this made so on to making our candies so the very first thing we want to do is to bloom our gelatin so i've got my two tablespoons of gelatin here and you want to um sprinkle it onto your ice cold water and as i said for gelatin to bloom correctly water has to be i size very very very cold so we just want to sprinkle it across the top so this way it doesn't clump and then you're going to stir it into the water make sure it's well mixed in and that there's no lumps now one tip for you when you're doing this with your unflavored gelatin while you're mixing it it should start to um form into the texture of um of applesauce if it doesn't then you need to add a little bit more gelatin either your gelatin is not as strong or used a little too much water over whatever it is it's probably not going to be um quite enough so like this is just a little too soupy so i'm going to add in just a sprinkle there we go so that's more the texture that you want see like applesauce and then i usually toss mine into the fridge until i need it so i've added my um two boxes of jello to my pot already and then in goes our light corn syrup or whatever syrup you choose to use and yes you can use can of syrup and our other half a cup of water now this is one thing i learned the citric acid does not go in until the end so you never had your citric acid while you're preparing once everything's done and heated that's when you add in your citric acid the acid works like acid it melts things so it interferes with the cooking or the setting process if you add it in too early same thing if you use the cooked version make sure to only add it once you're done so once you've got your water and your corn syrup and your jello in the pot you just want to get her mixed and turn your heat onto low so we don't need to use a double board a double boiler as long as you keep it on lower minimum you're good if you start to see any white streaking take it off the heat immediately so you're just going to continue to stir this until the sugar and everything is dissolved okay so i've been stirring on low heat here for about 10 minutes we're pretty much done so you look at the bottom there and you can see it's it's nice and clear and when you stream it it looks clear so now that portion is done we are going to get our unflavored gelatin now that our jello and our corn syrup and that is done we are now turned off our heat this is when we're going to add in our citric acid uh so a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and again citric acid is what prevents your sugar from crystallizing right essentially it's an acid and it continues to melt things there is such a science and chemistry with sugar and water and acids and stuff it's like wow mind blowing so quarter teaspoon of citric acid in there give her a little gentle stir so next goes in our unflavored gelatin what i like to do is to cut it up into little squares makes it easier to melt and so we're just going to let them sit there for just a minute or so and then you just want to gently stir until your until the unflavored gelatin is all completely melted then once your gelatin is all melted and everything is a uniform color and texture that's how you know everything is melted and night skins come together everybody's being friends in the pot now we're going to add our can of butter and our gourgum so in goes our butter half a teaspoon of our gum and i use the strainer um so that it'll evenly distribute it over the uh butter um otherwise it can clump up and as well you want to make sure to sprinkle it onto the butter part and not the candy syrup because again if it hits the syrup part it'll clump the oil or the butter will make it melt it's a pretty wild uh ingredient i have to admit we're just gonna get that evenly sprinkled over our butter and we're gonna let that sit for one minute all right after it's been sitting there for about a minute we're going to start to whisk this now you don't want to go crazy whisking because as i said too hard breaks our gelatin it is going to break it a little bit but we don't want to go too gentle because we actually have to create be able to break that oil down small enough so that it can create an emulsion so it's finding that happy medium so i just kind of get it started here so we're trying to whisk with minimal air bubbles and then we have a look and take a look at the top and see if you see any kind of oil slick if you do continue to whisk it a little bit longer and then check it again if you still see some oil um coming up to the top you see some oil slicks happening we can add in a little bit more gour gum but this time you're not going to add it directly into the pot just get your bowl that your butter was in there's enough oil in there to deal with it and we're just gonna take a little bit like about an eighth of a teaspoon and you stir it into the oil into the butter it dissolves the gore gum as otherwise as i said if you just dump that in now it'll just lump up once it's dissolved into there just add it in like soup and whisk it again again have a look so here i've got some air bubbles we have a little bit of other gelatin broken a little bit but nowhere near like when we use the um the uh pan blender much nicer so now that we have this as our base here now is when we can add our flavors and our color so this said i wanted to do lemon raspberry so i'm going to split this off to half about right so for this side i'm going to add just a little bit more lemon and to this side i'm going to add in our raspberry it's probably a little too much raspberry and we're going to add in our colors so i'm going to keep the yellow which one do i want to keep clear i think i'll keep the yellow clear and i'm going to make the red solid so as i said if you've got the white um food coloring you have to shake it up really really well if it sits on the sits in your cover it has a tendency to separate so you really want to mix it well otherwise it leaves little white dots so that might be a little too much it's always let's do a couple drops a little heavy handed and i'm going to whisk this one together oh these red food coloring that's a pretty color now because i'm pretty sure i've added too much white like i said i only got to add in one or two drops because i kind of went a little heavy-handed likely this red isn't going to set but what i'm going to do is i'm going to quick test it i'm going to put a little bit into a i'm just going to put a little bit into a into a dish i'm going to throw this into the fridge for a couple of minutes to see if it sets up if it doesn't i'm going to add some additional gelatin to that side all right so my little test here it it's setting up that was just a couple minutes in the fridge we're setting no problem now if you'd done that and it was still sticky sticking to your finger then you would want to add about a half a tablespoon of additional unflavored bloom gelatin so you would bloom a half a tablespoon to three tablespoons of cold cold water and add it to that to the solid side but we're good and i went ahead and i added my yellow to my yellow side here and now what i'm going to just do is i'm going to let them sit for just a couple of minutes and allow the air bubbles to come up to the top and that white icky stiff stuff to come and we can pull that out before we pour it into our bottles so our syrup now has been sit and set for a little bit and it's cooled off and you can see kind of that layer on top here take your strainer and just very gently scoop that out so this is the kind of the air bubble a little bit of the broken gelatin but we can get a lot of that out before we put it in the bottle and then with your strainer and you just want to hold it over the bottle and pour your syrup into the bottle dead on on that one not bad and now we're ready to cast our candies so a tip for you put your molds into your freezer before you start that way they're nice and cold and your gelatin your syrup will start to solidify right away especially if you're doing two colors that way they won't all bleed together another tip for you before you pour turn your bottles upside down put your fingers over the tips and just tap them what this will do is bring all the air bubbles to the top or to the bottom of the bottles so again helps make it much nicer candy okay then and then just fill up your molds now one thing important with your molds is don't fill them all the way to the top you want to go just just below it go all the way to the top it creates a ridge that gets icky it gets hard these are guys you're gonna look so cool yellow on yellow is tough it's hard to see it especially when it's clear so this recipe will make about um about a hundred or so of this size mold that i'm using probably about 300 of the teeny tiny and probably about 60 50 60 of the larger size all right so my gummies have set get your cooling rack your drying wrap parchment paper design your rock [Applause] and just pop out your gummies now if you can stand them up if they'll stand up better but if not just lay them down and then after about 12 hours flip them and let them fully dry out i usually flip them a couple times a day i walk by and do my flip and these guys will take about 24 to 48 hours to fully dry out and you want to make sure that you have a dry place humidity will not help your candies dry out at all drying and humid do not work together so if you do have a human place um if you can get a dehumidifier that will greatly help you out so i'm just going to finish uncasting these little guys and i'm going to go into the next step and show you the little trick with the alcohol and what that does and then how to successfully uh sugar sour coats your candies so be sure to stay tuned so this is the size of the candies when you take them out of the mold and that's the size of the candies once they dry so they shrink there a little bit there all right so here's a trick that i learned a tip that i learned and um it's gonna make your lives a whole lot easier especially for those of you guys who ship and we're having troubles with your candy sticking together what you're going to do is you're going to take your everclear or your um everclear or alcohol depending on where you're from anywhere you're 94 or up percentage alcohol put it into a small spray bottle remember the equipment that i always forget to tell you small spray bottle was one of them so put your alcohol into a small spray bottle so we want to give our candies a bit of a generous spray here and then just mix them up let the alcohol get into all candy all over and again if you can do this with tincture if you've got your tincture provided you did it with the uh the high grade alcohol and once you do that just put them out rip them up and let the alcohol evaporate it takes about 20 minutes or so and that's it it creates um kind of creates a bit of a barrier it keeps your candies um chewier for a longer period of time so i've had these guys out for about four days and see they're still perfectly squishy and gummy and not dried out looking or anything and that's what the alcohol helps to do and it also prevents them from sticking together all right so the next part is how to successfully sugar coat your gummies all right so this is the really other cool thing that i learned how to successfully coat our candies so for the most part you take them out you coated them they melt it it gets ugly we're not happy because that's because we're doing it wrong well the reason is and citric acid as i said is an acid if there is any moisture it is going to cause it to uh to melt so that's what's happening is you take your candies out of the fridge it's warmer outside of your fridge you know room temperature it automatically creates moisture from cold to warm or if you just automatically put your candies in or there's any moisture it the strict acid will melt so in order to successfully coat them so they don't what you want to do is once your candies have fully dried after a couple of days and if you do the step with the alcohol coating and they're done take your candies take a drying rack and just spread them out onto the drying rack then you're going to get your pot of boiling water here and we're going to just hold the rack over the steam just move it around so our candy's getting cut getting steamed up here and we don't burn our hands so what we're doing here is we're creating them we're giving them a little bit of a heat steam melt to create a bit of tackiness and then our candies stick and they don't melt so once they feel kind of gooey a little bit gooey there it doesn't take very long just dump them into your sugar your sugar mix now for the most part you do about a cup of sugar to a quarter teaspoon or so of the citric acid and then taste that these guys didn't get steamed and give that a taste and see how you like it then just add a little bit at a time until you get the desired sourness that you would like or you can just sugar coat them you don't have to do the sour so once they're done you put them in the bowl mix them all up get your wrap parchment paper i don't have enough room ah i so need a bigger table then just shake off your excess and if there's any ones that didn't get coated just hold them over the steam and that's it onto the rack they're pretty much ready to go they take about 20 minutes to dry fully dry out and that's it you will have your sugar coating that will not melt and there you have them nicely coated sugar sour coated uh gummies that aren't going to melt on you all right guys so that's everything i have for you today i hope you enjoyed that video even though it was a do-over but good so is you did get to learn a couple of new things and that should greatly improve your candies all right so and once again thank you so much for joining me today and i hope you have an awesome rest of your day bye", "aW4iRWw0T7U": "hello I'm Jerry Ford god I have a candy sucker you know type thing here that I used to I used to eat these things all the time back in the back in the 90s when I worked for a restoration company and I worked with a lot of Hispanic guys and this this is what they introduced me to these are the bureau mango suckers from the grupo Bimbo company yeah they got me they got me anything and and I I used to after they got me hooked on these things I used to like go by on myself at the Merc and eat those little Mexican market that's for you that's where you find him and you get good prices there you know then when I worked at the same time I worked for the restoration company we would we went on a on a job that that we ended up going over to Texas and and when we was in Texas we were close to the Mexican border so we went across the board and went to a little a little store over there and yeah screaming big bag big bag to these things for for really really cheap prices and how about private three or four bags of them took him back to sorry took him back home and I had a little office and I would had a little store going myself in there and I would sell you know energy drink soda pops suckers and all kinds other candies and stuff and it was kind of a convenient thing for all the guys to they you know they would come over to my office and I would sell him an energy drink a cold coffee like the frappuccinos and stuff like that and I would take the money and I would go buy more stuff and I'd make a little bit of a profit it wasn't nothing big but it was a fun little thing plus the guys had something had resources they could just come to me and get something you know and I had you know had a little refrigerator in my office and I kept a stop with soda pops of stuff but oh yeah these little suckers these little bureau mangrove suckers are like I said I carried this thing with me all the time on jobs and stuff at first you know when they first introduced me to these suckers and I was I was a little surprised because I wasn't expecting you know what these things are these are these are candy covered are there candies there are chili powder coverage suckers is what they are Schuyler it says chili covered mango acylated a kick a kick a keep a sick you dude I can't read that good lollipop artificially flavored ingredients sugar corn syrup citric acid and qualia chili pepper I douse iodized salt contains milk and peanuts or making to contain imported and distributed by bar sell USA made in Mexico alright get in this time it's been a long time I found these at a little grocery store not too far from where I live I was surprised I saw him two dollars for a bag tin this is what they look like kind of a kind of a dark brown color that's kind of shy see the shininess got that it's probably the what they just you know you know the candies probably wet of course when they put that chili powder on there but usually makes me cough you got to get through the chili powder first get to the candy but look good me and to you gotta like chili bother the ball so it's not gravity and like a 12 pack or something like that with these things actually might not been that mean but so I've been you know trying to link them with what we're using stuff as I've juiced up 8.5% ABV let's clear this vido mango with that with this wheel Wow that's pretty good that's pretty good they got other stuff to that store getting better hmm you can get these in other other forms other kinds they make them and make this one that you like give you a little packet or chili powder and then the sucker and you can dip it in it and then lick it up the they like a thick coat of the chili powder it's coming off somewhat it's getting down to the candy you get a little bit of sweetness with it now put it you know see dip the strong chili powder is gone it doesn't heat up just a little bit left the lighter stuff that's but yeah these are good if you see these and you like chili powder and like these kind of things pick them up if you've never tried it before well good [Applause] [Applause] very good all right well I'm gonna get there um thanks for watching I appreciate it let me know if you try these um if there's other Mexican type candy

talking about edibles customers come in here with all sorts of different requests whether that be dietary requests or different methods of ingestion or uptake or effect whatever you're comfortable with chances are we've got it for our first edible I want to talk about gummies gummies are the most popular edible and we've got the kiva camino gummies today they're cannabis infused gummies but they also add terpenes which is unique that gives it more of a indica or sativa feel just really nice tasting Class E gummies these are wild berry it got a pineapple habanero flavor a blend I'm apricot and my personal favorite the sparkling pear Prosecco next we've got sublingual strips sublingual strips are a small tab that you put in your mouth and let dissolve on your tongue you may know cookies and brownies as your typical ingestion method but what's unique about these is that those other edibles take up to two hours to take effect whereas sublingual effects you can start feeling it in 15 to 40 minutes you don't run into that this isn't hitting it's been an hour and nothing's working I'm gonna slam some more and then two hours it all hits and you're done and finally we've got tea now cannabis and tea have been a match made in heaven since time immemorial I find that this slightly caffeinated green tea is a really nice chill but focused way of ingestion it's absorbed through the stomach so this is another faster method than digestion and what I find with tea is that as you sip it it comes on in sips as opposed to like a boom there are different types of tea this is a caffeinated green tea there's non-caffeinated herbal tea this has a little blend of CBD as well really nice for chilling out so those are some of my favorite edibles on the market right now feel free to come by the can we stop in and check them out yourself", "psLn_JaNtfE": "[Music] hey everybody thomas malloy here senior editor with c-store decisions magazine with another edition of our product

"three amazing items left hopefully on the dish the dankness here colors pedro sweet sativa hawaii heartbreak pre roll and this shall we WOWY chocolate ten and ten so let's shuffle it that's pretty good shuffle there we go come on disc a dankness give me something good to eat look at that I got it that's pretty good I guess it's chocolate time chowie Wow eat chocolates it's legal edibles here we got this shall we Wow a milk chocolate coming in at a meager ten milligrams of THC but also ten milligrams of CBD so I never get into the CBD I never found any good use for it or anything anyways I thought I would get this just check it out with something a little different because those bang ones I had they were ten so this is a 10 with also 10 of this so we'll see if it actually does anything I have no idea so I'm just reading the back here it's got some little instructions here says the balanced chocolates are made with 10 10 and 10 each piece can be split into two squares to enjoy with friends what yeah right fucking a bunch of people all sitting around on a 10 milligram fucking chocolate bar are you kidding me we recommend starting with just one square but then waiting to feel the effects before having more while you wait you could invent backstories for Street strangers anyway I don't understand what that thing is talking about that's all crazy but it says start with one square and there's two squares or yeah two squares well you know what fuck that I'm gonna start with two bars because fuck that here we go open it up here Nano somebody my tolerance is just way too high so I figure two bars should give me an idea see there's one kind of neat actually not melted which is nice in Alberta right now they had to recall chocolates or something because they're all melting and I can't sell them at the moment which although I guess that would encourage you to make your own and while making their own you'll probably make them way stronger and for way less money so you probably are gonna hurt them so there we go two of these shall we Wow he's you know what should we take a look with a microscope here we go up close on the chocolate with the microscope [Music] that's neat you can see like the grooves you can check them out the grooves where the letters are see that it's getting super close-up on that look at that I'm getting a top-down view right on top pretty cool huh it's going close still cool I guess it's still cool I don't know these things look ok let's break it open OOP looks cool looks like chocolate so yeah I guess I'm gonna have to eat these fucking things and we'll see how it goes okay well here's number one holy that one mm-hmm not bad [Music] hmm nice tasting chocolate very nice tasting chocolate they mean a cool thing no not really though so this will be neat to tell because I do have a pretty high tolerance I make my own cannabis oil all the time and I have it every night I've had it every night for like three months so my tolerance is up there so this would be a good indicator how this stuff is for people with a high tolerance I would say high edible tolerance not high smoking or vaping tolerance but high edible tolerance so I'll be cool [Music] anyways I'll be back need is too of course but I'll be back I'll let you know how this is I'll come back in like 45 minutes or something do like the other ones there I'll check back in in a little bit so it's been 50 minutes and say these things and I do feel a little something but it's so light they almost don't know if it's even anything it's like it's like if you're sitting here and you think you hear a knock at the door so you go over in your check and then you open the door like you look around there's nobody there so you come back and sit down and 20 min 20 minutes later you're like did I just hear a knock at the door and you run over you look again nope nothing there nobody's here so that's what it's like so far for these fucking things and you know how much these cost there were seven dollars and 20 cents each so this is like $15 what it seems like now is like fifteen dollars thrown in the garbage because this stuff is absolutely pathetic fucking shit but I will give it another 45 minutes I'll be back so I'm back here with the spend another hour so I have two hours after I've eaten these fucking things ten milligrams THC 10 milligrams CBD these are seven dollars and 20 cents each so this here is like $15 I pretty much just threw right in the fucking garbage so this stuff here is absolutely pathetic is severely underpowered severely overpriced I'll rarely say this but do not buy legal edibles they're not worth it they're fucking garbage you can make your own stuff way more you can make way more potent stuff for way less using stuff that you buy off OCS I do it myself like I'll put a link here's a link right here check out that that's how I make my oil my cannabis oil and it's way better so much better than this garbage and the funny part is I make it out of my garbage like I make it a vape scraps not even you know it cost me nothing to make it really so what the fuck is the point of these things I have no idea I don't think I'm gonna buy any more legal edibles maybe I'll try the candies the gummies I haven't tried those yet but anyways that's it for now two things left on the disk of dankness you like checking those out and I hit the subscribe button and the the Bell there it'll tell you when they come online but for now that's it for the whatever you call these things these cherry pieces of shit absolute garbage anyways see you later have a good one everybody", "70ypJJgNbDg": "hello and welcome to another edition of Tobes tries so today's product struck me is very interesting when I saw it on the Shelf sort of appeals to me I suppose you could say these are 7-eleven branded seven select gamer gummies so you know I'm a little bit of a gamer nice little collection of video games that I like to play but I also like energy drinks so I figured hey well the product itself appeals to me the marketing behind it I don't know kind of offends me only slightly so it looks like there's kind of three shapes in here there's like a generic 3 button controller there's an actual energy drink can and then there's like a weird guy with the headset on yeah so on the back that says gamer gummies get in the game with 7 select gamer gummies just the right mix of fantastic fruity flavors ready set you win and I don't know if you've ever played a video game where you just like turn it on and automatically you win but the kind of sounds boring like I like a game that has I want to go to the challenge but I thought it was interesting that says fruity flavors on the back and then energy drink flavored on the front and then it notes that there's no caffeine added so you're not actually going to get the effects of an energy drink see they smell terrible I don't even know what this snow is so you got the green like I said is the kind of generic 3 button controller pad there the yellow which is let's see there you go a can and it just says energy on it read that and then you got the guy who's like overly happy with his like gamer headset on yeah go ahead and give me any choice I guess well Saracens are supposed to be energy drink flavored we'll try the yellow one that says energy on it first No it doesn't really have any flavor at all I guess maybe a slight lemon flavor I mean that just might be my mind thinking Oh yellow lemon try the gamepad next I think this is funny that has three buttons because the only you like I mean it's been generations since there's been a 3 button controller yeah like the old-school Genesis controllers have three buttons like the Sega Saturn controller had three buttons but this doesn't even have like joysticks or like you know triggers on it I mean it's just an outdated controller scheme and it tastes exactly the same which is to say it doesn't really taste like anything and then last but not least obviously we have our our gamer a guy a little happy gamer guy this headset you must not be playing any modern games because those chats are always so toxic you never have a smile like that same flavor and it doesn't taste like energy drink at all and it has a distinct smell of something that like I want to say I recognize but it doesn't it's not energy drink by any means like I was thinking oh these are gonna taste kind of like redbull gummies or something I don't know what I was expecting or they were all gonna have their own unique flavor I call em in the lime and I don't like a cherry or something but they all just kind of taste like sugar try all three of them together well since they all taste the same that was just like having a larger version of the gummy in my mouth I do like the plain like looks like I don't know Forza or need for speed or something anything it's got like a generic guitar neck poster like is that so listen to my guitar hero yeah really sure how I feel about these sons fruit flavor on the back it says energy drink flavor on the front they don't get really any fruit or energy drink flavor the consistency of the gum is okay it's no Haribo but a nice little chew to them i want to say this little bag like a dollar or something obviously from 7-eleven so if you're in the mood for some gimmicky gummies give these a try I'm sure most 7-elevens will be carrying these I saw them on their kind of end cap where they have all that are like newer items I like to check that area because I've gotten some good stuff from 7-eleven in the past these are like very middle-of-the-road like if we're doing the rating out of five these are like two and a half but otherwise not terrible I don't really have a whole lot else to say about him like I said as somebody who plays a lot of video games and collects video games I thought they were kind of funny like oh let's appeal to gamers because gamers were headsets and drink energy drinks and use controllers can feel like there's other stuff that you could have put in there obviously we look like licensing issues like they couldn't put in like a Pokemon character or like a Mario character or anything like that so they just went with the yeah this is that generic enough controller in the headset wearing guy and energy drink in

for almost half of the nearly 70 million dollars a month earned by local marijuana businesses according to the Colorado Department of Revenue but the market has not avoided controversy over consumption and accidental ingestion have generated considerable negative press so I travel to Denver to learn more about what goes into the production of these sweet and savory pop goodies and to find out is anything being done to resolve its issues today we are with Julie at sweetgrass kitchen Julie is one of the pioneers of the edible cannabis movement hi Julie hello thanks for being here so I heard you are going to let me cook some products right so let's go I'm gonna start baking you ready for me I wish I could the marijuana Enforcement Division requires all employees to have a badge in order to work a licensed marijuana facility I think it's because my paralegal Greg told you I'm a terrible cook so I don't believe you but can I at least help out you got it Oh may I help terrific so what's the next step Julie as we've got to put on our hair nets our gloves and our aprons and we can get started hi gang sweet cross kitchen specializes in butter based edible products we make brownies cookies and a seasonal pumpkin pie both on the medical side and the recreational side so when you say that pot is in your food it's actually in the butter right Hanna water is made when cannabis flowers Lauren fine silver this you are the head chef here at sweetgrass kitchen yeah and you're giving up your duties for the day to me okay so chef do you mind if I help out a little yes we we can help oversee the process okay keep close eye on me ah okay so what are we doing here we're making single serving peanut butter cookies today okay so tell me what to do I'm ready let's go are you guys scared a little bit he's going into a field and hit the bottom of the bowl at something that's very important is that we mix all of our products thoroughly and that ensures that the final product is to Majin s what's the recommended dosage for a consumer someone who buys the products I recommend that if you've never tried edibles before or it's been a really long time to start with five milligrams or less and wait at least two hours if you aren't feeling the effects yet you can always eat more I always tell people you can always eat more you can never eat less Julie I've added half of my dry ingredients what's next after this the next step is portioning out the products into single serving cookies and because you don't have a badge and because portion control is extremely important we're gonna have to let chef Lauren and her team take it from here something that has been a concern in the edibles market in Colorado is overconsumption and accidental ingestion the edible industry is 45% of the market right now the backlash has mostly been with edibles and while you can say okay I recommend my consumer only have half a cookie or one cookie if it's your first time there's no way to control what someone eats right right who in take the pot out of the equation if you send me home with a box of cookies who is just going to eat one there's certainly a responsibility on the consumer level to redirections and of course follow them something that the cannabis Business Alliance and the edibles council has done to minimize overconsumption is create an edibles education handout what we found were four most important points were start with one serving or less wait up to 2 hours don't mix with alcohol or other controlled substances and of course keep out of reach of children and pets and in the original child-resistant packaging in March 2014 according to a report by the Denver Police Levi's fam bah a college student visiting from Wyoming jumped to his death from his hotel room after eating six times the recommended dosage for edibles to sweetgrass kitchen cookie wrappers were found in the hotel room the coroner ruled the death accidental the incident with Levi Samba was was very tragic but it's important to remember that marijuana was not the cause of death when you say marijuana marijuana wasn't the cause of death and maybe I'm just speaking as a lawyer an autopsy was performed on the young man and the autopsy revealed that marijuana was in fact the cause of death well a significant contributor is is that what was in the autopsy report marijuana is not a toxic substance it there's no amount of marijuana that can actually poison someone to the point of death some say that's not true American scientist magazine reported that consuming 100 to 1000 times the effective dose of marijuana could in fact lead to death and while that makes marijuana less toxic than alcohol the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment wants to ban the majority of edibles saying they violate the laws requirement to prevent marketing to children since marijuana has been legalized for recreational use there have been many reports of children accidentally ingesting the product and then ending up in the emergency room that is true and certainly a valid concern accidental ingestion by children is something that that the industry has worked very hard towards minimizing through very strict packaging requirements including child resistant packaging very stringent labeling requirements but the good news is that in the past several months there hasn't been a hospitalization of a child so what that shows me is that people are now becoming more aware of the intensity of these products and the importance of keeping it out of reach of children we reached out to Children's Hospital Colorado and they had a different take saying they've treated 14 children this year seven of whom required intensive care the hospital predicts it will treat double a number of children as they did in 2013 and as for sweetgrass kitchen their staff has quadrupled and their profits have increased five hundred percent since recreational marijuana has been legalized", "NtGmqEIz9to": "[Music] another review and today I'm doing candy yeah I'm doing baked Bros gummy bears again these are baked pros gummy bears this entire contrack ajiz 150 milligrams of THC 10 milligrams each piece and there is 15 pieces in here so 15 doses and this actually has directions on the bag most of them normally don't but it says start with one dose which is 10 milligrams I love worth up to 90 minutes for effects and consumers needed suggested use temporarily reduces pain stimulates appetite sleep aid and relief of nausea okay so again baked pros gummy bears 10 milligrams each you know guys you know I'm a lightweight so I'm just gonna start with wine right I'm going to cut into this right now I need to cut it again because evidently I didn't cut below the seal this cut low enough that I'm not cutting all right to hit me and just because I'm going for I get it so honey bear squishy yeah Oh something got put the sugar around it because he's very cannabis II and you know I tend to stray away from edibles that have a strong lead taste because I just don't like the V taste that's a personal thing you might I'm glad I read this it says testing accuracy plus or minus three milligrams of THC per piece oh and that's the thing would be good you kind of always don't know exactly how much teach so you're getting and that's why it's best you're like you know trouble I'm and then wait a little bit before you try nothing but they're gummy bears and they're good it's like to me once you get past that initial taste of it like the cannabis taste hmm I guess the sweetness other kind of mellows that out a little bit to me and they're good they taste like gummies you know like gummy bears but growing up and coming beers right and these are things that these especially when you start talking on gummy treats and things like that candy that kids normally eat or that they gravitate towards if you're medicating that way please you know make sure that you're keeping those out of the reach I mean seriously because for them all they see is gummy bear they don't really understand any of this other stuff okay so now that I'm done this is going back into my weed safe and again yes I can have a week I do have a weed safe and I try to keep my things away I have four kids to a grown and then the two youngest or in their team so just because sometimes it's candy and it might look you know killing even though they're old enough to understand what it is I still keep it you know am i safe just you know to keep it away from him but faith grows very good and as far as um I mean there's 15 in here so I mean this is a good amount to dose with okay and when I bought this actually bought this Micra so it's been a while but the price says $31 again baked bros and so many other companies out there they always they're always offering you know not always but sometimes they're specials that you can catch at your dispensary and there are places like weed Maps who else but I go to online they will actually send me notices about different specials that dispensaries are having and a lot of the companies offer you know boku you know buy one get one so what might be you know $31 you may end up getting tuning and that's actually what I did I think for sure I didn't pay the full price for this I end up getting something free or it was on discount or something so like I always tell you be mindful about the specials and deals that your dispensaries have because you can I'm getting your medicine or action alright alright guys that is it so also available in 75 milligrams and 300 milligram bags so you have options okay alright I will talk to you guys later alright y'all take care [Music]", "WRL7-qAYkjY": "hello everyone back

make videos sell stuff yeah they make videos but what it is it's a website you can go to vat19.com and it's a website thing it's kind of like a novelty site wouldn't sell like 500 me were no gummy bears like wasn't there like a seven foot Python gummy bear or got 7 foot Python it was like gummy 6 pounds yeah they have a lot of novelty stuff that you won't just find in stores like huge gummy bears I think they have a seat that you can actually sit down that looks like a gummy bear yeah but it's not actually it was like a gummy bear but it's not me no thank you a good mythical morning I did like gummy versus real food where they had the real food and I know everybody Oh everyone we probably will do one of those too but then I know that another channel that we watch the crew brothers yeah they have done collaborations with that 19 so we'll probably put a card the real deal you got yeah the crew brothers really do have that connection yes about 19 subscribe and tell them we sent yes so we have gummy jalapeno which is really sell raffle we have a habanero pepper which is really orange and we have ghost pepper that's really cheery now these are actually spicy like I've heard from some people I'm not sure this is nervous my lips they're a little like they're eat pretty much equivalent to the regular peppers so what jump right into it I so what we're gonna be doing is for the next few episodes of Zack and dad we got a whole bunch of that 19 stuff yeah but not a whole bunch but we got a few items so we're gonna do a whole mat night we're going to probably do a whole bat 19 series umm so stick with us for the next few videos I think you're really gonna like it make sure you share it with your friends and family all right we probably so anyway this one is just second so this one is it's called gummy jalapeno pepper so it's like a gummy it's like a like a gummy bear but it's it's in the shape I think of a jalapeno and it's supposed to kind of have that taste of a jalapeno in a gummy oval units I think it actually says actually look at this Wow yeah show that sure family there yeah so it does look like oh it does look like jalapeno but it literally is let me feel like it literally feels like I area literally feels like a big gummy gummy worm so let me let's smell it actually just smells like a gummy worm all right a gummy bear it actually supposed to be in the flavor of so it is a jalapeno flavor but also sour apple and it's what it does smell like like a sour apples so here which I don't care either okay all right mmm now I get a little something like a flavor yes it really does taste very very good it tastes like oh like a gummy bear or gummy worm very sour apple they're very sour about matter of fact at first that's all I had and I thought oh there's no heat at all now it's building its really now I'm kind of getting that jalapeno eat that makes me a little nervous of the habanero and then the ghost pepper if does it has got a little bit of a bite so all right let's give it a looks let's do it quickly because we love town let's give it a spice rating well we're not gonna be doing five ratings even though the gummies are good yeah spice okay I will just do spice ratings for these okay the green apple it's really good you know how to do flavor readings won't we care that's too quickly though okay let's do it three two one seven three two one three one delay there yeah it's really low point five good I'm glad you didn't we'll keep it to one oh yeah let's do a flavor rating okay okay three two one eight it was yeah why it's very good very good I will eat more of that when we're done alright the next one is what habanero habanero same concept it's gonna look like habanero but it's gonna have that feel the texture and the taste and the consistency of like a gummy bear or gummy worm okay now this one is supposed to this is a habanero when it's supposed to be an orange flavor with it as well so we'll see how that goes and my little big finger is trying to get in there to open it there we go yeah it does it really does look a habanero it's nice now let me just look at here I just want to look at the ingredients quick where does the hobbit' it habanero it's actually pretty pretty well up there it has some of the ingredients of the gummy is but the gummy worm but then it does have habanero pepper kind of up on top here hmm alright let's see what happens again these are gummy habanero peppers chip it dip it it's just a really dense very dense I like orange I love orange there are good flavor again check that nineteen out I think you'll be impressed I personally break the flavor higher than the jalapeno because my I just love orange yeah he's one of the best one of the best gummies I've ever had when it comes to flavor hmm that's really good great orange I love orange give us a thumbs up if you like orange let's know what your favorite pepper jalapeno jalapeno now banheiro or ghost pepper again I have milk just in case hopefully we won't need it we'll see all right hmm to tell you that well to tell you the truth to me it didn't really even get I didn't think he got that much hotter than the habanero or than the jalapeno I don't but flavor but flavor was really good all right let's do I eat first let's do are you ready all right three two one three you're still staying at the one okay um cuz yeah it's there I can tell there's some heat there you're some peak going on and it is building actually a little bit but that orange flavors are really coming through alright let's do a flavor rating three to one night oh you're even going up no it's same to me it's the same great flavors the Orangemen about areas tha as this is the sour apple but I'm not gonna go up okay alright the last one that we're thinking is going to be the hottest is the ghost what's it called ghost pepper here ghost pepper goes ghost pepper gummi gummi and whit flavors is supposed to be tipped about Jerry all right excellent look so pair up alright we're getting it open here and again this is a ghost pepper one and man it's so sticky and it's so dense there we go okay it's still pretty speech Airy pretty big does it smell like cherry oh man I don't really like the smell of cherry oh it is an incredible cherry flavor I love cherry I like it is it tasting maraschino cherry I love maraschino cherries so matter of fact if you you know just open up a bottle and just drink the juice forget the cherries Oh do any of you remember kitty cocktails those are like the non-alcoholic little kiddie cocktails that hit would have the maraschino cherries in and like 7up or sprite or something like that if you remember that give us a thumbs up those are really cool of my childhood I remember those alright a little more nervous about this one because this is ghost pepper and I think there is yeah ghost peppers kind of right in the middle right I don't smell pepper at all I just smelled cherry so chip it dip it very good now with these the heat builds wait harder than the others wouldn't you say yeah these are pretty hard this one jumped jumped a lot dad you got some milk yeah I want to try dog mmm are you going for it oh wow do you think the habit new is Wow looks like you had your jalapeno and then you how do you have an arrow and then you had your ghost pepper wow it's a good jump right in the face oh wow it's warm but it surprised me because the habanero make those pepper I do one yeah oh wow okay let's do a spice reading at least a few thousand yeah let's do a spice rating on this one before I it's on my nose was starting to run to what you can tell is part of that all right even though it was pretty hot are you ready for a flavour well go for it are you ready for a spice ring it

review of wild edibles now these are a delicious way of consuming cannabis or the consistency to match so finding your perfect dosage is honestly really easy my favorite is about thirty milligrams or three pieces which I personally found was the perfect high before you start hitting that area where you start getting anxiety here and there you know ten milligrams was also a very comfortable micro dose amount it was a really easy high and you weren't really gone you were just chilling having a good time the packaging was a fun experience honestly I really had a good time just opening it up for twenty dollars for a hundred milligrams this is like your average price and honestly it's a really good flavor it's consistent and it's really potent which make it worth trying but it honestly is just another edible on the market there's nothing so special where it's like oh man I'm gonna keep coming back but honestly it really is a great product and I would do it again alright guys thanks for checking this out just like subscribe share do all that good stuff and I'm out [Music]", "Ur6nBVrs800": "they look so cute don't they so good hi guys welcome back today i'm going to show you how to make sugar-free gummy bears with coconut oil for these sugar-free gummy bears the ingredients you're going to need is your coconut oil the gelatin something to flavor your gummies so these are just those sugar-free flavoring packets that you put into your water these ones i have are kool-aid sour green apple and i'm also going to make some of them with some sugar-free crystal white lemonade so you can use these flavor packets of any kind that you like or you can also use these type of sugar-free water enhancers whatever you'd like to flavor it will work i have some citric acid because i want mine to be sour again you don't really need citric acid but if you do want to be sour this is how you'll do it if you don't have citric acid and you still want them to be sour you can crush up vitamin c tablets um which will really give the same effect i have some spray which i'm going to use for my molds and soy lechen which i have in capsules like this but you can use the liquid version that would be better so you can do soy election or you can do sunflower election um ideally you want to do the liquid one not the pills because i'm going to have to break these open to put them in um the liquid one on amazon was just like kind of expensive to deliver to canada so i just went with these so you need these to keep the coconut oil from separating um from the gelatin and water mixture and then if you don't want to store them in the fridge and you want to be shelf stable so you can just keep them in your drawer in your pocket or wherever and they can last for months you're going to need a preservative this is a potassium sorbate mixture it's very very simple to make i will post a link below on how to make this all right our first step is to bloom the gelatin so this is very important to make sure that your gummies have a proper texture um so we're going to do this first before we do anything else because we have to let the gelatin sit so we need half a cup of water so you're going to want a larger dish for this if you have it in a smaller dish the surface area of the water will be a lot smaller so it won't be as effective so you could use a pyrex dish or anything that's like a little bit bigger than the average bowl so we're going to put our half cup of water in here and then i'm going to sprinkle three packages of gelatin or if you're not using the packages you could use like two and a half tablespoons of gelatin so i'm trying them now after they've sat for a bit and i feel like because it's hot in here and it's summer and the last time i made these it was winter so it's a lot colder i think i would use a little bit more gelatin so maybe like add an extra package or um another tablespoon just in case it's hot where you live um so that it doesn't so that it stays like fully hard enough it still does look fine like this though but if it's really hot in here it might melt a bit so good so you just want to sprinkle these over the water so you're getting as much surface area as you can some of it will overlap and that's okay and we're just going to leave this to sit for about five minutes no stirring just leave it as is so while this is sitting and blooming we're going to add a couple more ingredients to it um we're just going to put them directly on top they don't need to be stirred in just yet we'll just get it prepared for when we're ready so the first thing is our potassium sorbate mixture we're going to do 1 8 of a teaspoon of this we're going to add some citric acid again this isn't necessary but if you want them sour this is what you'll use for your vitamin c tablets and i'm going to do about half a teaspoon because the mixture the flavor packets that i'm using these kool-aid ones and crystal light already have a lot of citric acid in it and i don't want to have too much or it will break the gummies down so we're just going to do half a teaspoon and then we're going to add in our legend if you have the liquid kind you can add in about half a teaspoon to a teaspoon in my coconut oil i already have legend mixed in so if you don't already have that in your coconut oil you're going to want to make sure you have it in here i am going to still add some tear just for safe measure as i don't have that much in my coconut oil oops so i'm going to do two um little capsules i'm just going to cut them open obviously i'm making a lot of a mess and not even really much of that got in there okay let's just do another one here and we can just leave this for now um there's no reason to stir it in we will stir it in when the gelatin has bloomed i do want to mention that these gummies because they're sugar-free and aren't using um sugar or corn syrup they're going to have a little bit of a different texture than a regular gummy bear so they're going to be a little bit more jello like but i mean to sacrifice it's a sacrifice i'm going to take for less calories if you are looking for a gummy that is more um like an actual gummy i have a video on that and i'll post in a link below now let's measure out our coconut oil we're going to use a quarter cup you can use a little bit more a little bit less depending on how strong you want them to be just don't go over half a cup i think that you would need quite a bit more gelatin if you're going to do that so i'm going to spray my measuring cup just so the coconut oil doesn't stick to here and we don't waste any of it now i'm just going to pour in a quarter cup and i did take this out of the fridge a while ago so that it would liquify that way it'd be easy to pour now that we have this measured out we can warm up our gelatin mixture so we'll just take this and kind of um solidify it into this little i don't know mushy thing so we can just take that whole thing and add it into our little saucepan and we can bring this to the stove okay now we can turn the stove on to medium heat and we will just let this melt while i'm waiting for this to melt i'm just going to spray my silicone mold so they're ready once everything is done okay it looks like this is melting a bit more now just wait till that's fully melted now we can add in the coconut oil so i'm just going to pour in my coconut oil and just i should have been whisking that at the same time actually so pour it in slowly and whisk while you're pouring it in that'll help emulsify it and make sure that the oil isn't separating from the gelatin mixture so let's make sure we scrape this all out so i'm just checking to make sure that the um oil and the gelatin has binded together and it looks like it did and i believe that's because of the soy legend if you don't use soy election it probably will not bind properly and you'll find that it will separate so the legend is an essential okay now i'll just wait this um for this to start bubbling a little bit we don't want it to boil but we do want a couple bubbles to form um and then it should be good to pour into our molds so while it did emulsify together i feel like it could be better so i'm going to use my immersion blender now i know not everybody has an immersion blender which is why i was going to try and avoid using it um so while this did separate a little tiny bit the gummies would still turn out fine um i mean it looks pretty good but because i have an immersion blender i am going to use that to combine it all a little bit better but that isn't necessary if you don't have one [Applause] so i can tell it's starting to heat up quite a bit um i can see the steam coming out so i'm just gonna lower the heat a little bit so i'm like medium low now all right so again the emulsifier is not required but if you have it it's a nice touch to just ensure that everything is evenly distributed that way for your dosing you can really tell how much coconut oil is in each gummy whereas if you don't have the immersion blender and you're just hand whisking it there might be a little bit more coconut oil and one gummy over another so i want this to heat up a bit more and get a little bit thicker so i'm going to turn the heat back up to medium and just a few more minutes until this thickens up a little bit more all right we can finally see those little bubbles starting to form i think that means that it's about ready so let's just stir that a couple times and then we're gonna turn off the heat so i just turned off the heat this should be good to go now i want my gummies to be two different flavors like i said i'm gonna do the sour cream apple and the lemonade but you don't have to do two flavors you can just do one so now that our mixture is done on the stove we can add the flavoring but because i'm doing two flavors i'm going to put it into two separate bowls if you were just doing one flavor you could mix it directly into the pot okay so i'm going to add my flavor in and you can add as much as or as little as you like you could also use like i said those little liquid water enhancers so in this one i'm going to do the kool-aid sour green apple oh my gosh it smells so good that color is so pretty just make sure we don't really have any chunks left in there we'll just kind of squish them up with our spoon you want to make sure you're doing this while it's still warm you kind of have to act fast because it does kind of like form a layer on the top so we have to act fast to avoid that if not we could just throw it in the microwave for like 20 seconds so i don't know i think one packet is enough but it's hard to tell i'm just gonna taste this and see okay so it tastes good with just one package but i think i want a little bit more you can kind of taste the coconut oil a little bit too much alright that color is even better it's so green now i'm going to flavor the other one with some lemonade no okay well i'll taste that that needs more lemonade i'm really glad i added that citric acid in there too because that sour taste is so nice i almost could have had more but i mean it's risky because you don't want to break down especially because lemonade is pretty much already all citric acid and of course if you want you can double this recipe it won't have any um effect negatively you can do it double tripled whatever works for you oh yeah that tastes so good now that we've got our flavors mixed in they're ready to put into the molds so i put my molds um on a tray so that it's easy once they're filled to pick it up and put it into the fridge um i've just learned that after a few times of having to try and pick these up when they have gelatin in them so i'm going to do swirls with my two colors um not necessary but just how i want to do it now that i filled them all up we're just going to put them in the fridge and we'll wait until they have solidified i think that's going to take about like 10-20 minutes my video just cut off but they are done so i'm just popping them out of their molds and then i'm going to put them up to dry so i'm just going gonna leave them under the hood fan and my microwave um for about 24-ish hours i just want them to kind of dry out and that way um all the extra excess moisture is gone and then i'll just put them into a little baggie and keep them in my drawer they look so cute don't they anyways i hope you guys enjoyed my video i hope you guys enjoyed my video please give it a thumbs up leave a

pretty much forever um it's not everyday they release a new flavor and they very rarely do actually the most recent one was the big sour patch they also released I think a tropical one which I did try on the channel so um this one is another fruit flavor of sour patch to join sour watermelon and sour strawberry that I also tried on the channel that is gonna be sour mango mango sour patch so we're gonna try these out see how smell very interesting clone this is what a sour patch mango looks like um let's give it a shot bottoms up hmm I want to try one more just to see if that opinion holds up before I say it time's up so flavor-wise they're very good it's a very nice mango flavor honestly it's one of the better mango candies that I've had usually don't see mango that often as a candy this is a very strong one so very good job on the mango flavor honestly the part that disappoints me is the fact that it's marketed as sour patch and of course sour patch you expect it to be pretty sour these are very tame um like the first one I had the reason why I had a second one is the first time I didn't really get any sour whatsoever the second one I got a little bit but it's not very sour um maybe that's because of the mango I'm not really sure but it's not incredibly sour so if you're specifically looking for a sour mango candy you might be better off looking elsewhere but if you're just looking for a solid mango gummy these are worth your time they're they're quite tasty they have a good mango flavor so I enjoyed them I think they're good they're just not incredibly sour so if that's what you're looking for that's not what you're gonna get so that's gonna do it for this big CTV taste test hope you enjoy it it look for plenty more taste test videos throughout the summer we're gonna try to do some cool new things on this channel as well as the thrill seekers show so be on the lookout for new videos new series all kinds of stuff coming to this channel over the summer that's gonna do it see you next time bye [Music] let me [Music]", "mabfxc09iq8": "hey guys welcome back to my channel today I'll be sharing the super easy recipe and this seems to be the latest craze right now all the kids are eating it everybody's buying it and do you know what I'm gonna share with you my simple version of it because it's so easy to make you're gonna need a bag of gummy bears and this is the party size it's twenty eight point eight ounces and you can use whatever gummies you have at home I also have these sour watermelons like GE but you can use sour patch kids you can use lifesaver gummies whatever kind of gummies you have use it anyway powder is basically plum powder it's a popular thing here in Hawaii and they have different brands as well but this Brown seems to be the popular one here you're also going to need lemon strips the Jade Brown is my favorite one if you can't find that they have different brands I found these as well they're called Rocky's and they also have local kind snacks some one that you don't want in don't get this don't get the lemon peel because this actually has seeds in it and you don't want that in your candy we're gonna also need one lemon juice from one lemon and just a little bit of sugar as well so let's get started the first thing you want to do is go ahead and blend your lemon strips in a blender the consistency that you want and you want it really fine and shred it because this will help to quote the gummy bears at the end when you're ready for alright so next you want to go ahead and juice one lemon and I have this little gadget here alright so I have my lemon juice and I actually measured this this is equivalent to two tablespoons of lemon juice so you want to go ahead and pour that in a bowl you also want to add one tablespoon of sugar two teaspoons of leaky moy powder and you want to go ahead and mix this until the sugar is dissolved completely so the sugar has completely dissolved at this point you want to go ahead and give it a little taste to see if you want it sweeter and if so go ahead and add in another tablespoon of sugar but I kind of like it this way because the gummy bears is already sweet and the lemon strips have sugar in it as well so I'm gonna just stick with one tablespoon next step is to add the entire bag of gummy bears go ahead and give it a good mix and make sure that the gummy bears are evenly coated with the lemon syrup [Music] here is a close-up of the final product you can see that every single gummy bear is covered with those lemon strips and that's just how I love them and I also went ahead and put the gummy bears and these little plastic containers cuz I'm gonna just give it out to family and friends anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this easy recipe give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below and feel free to share my video if you want to anyways thanks for watching guys and I'll see you guys next time Aloha", "HUb6baa_ym4": "hey guys welcome back to my channel I hope you guys are having a good day you know what I mean like I'm so sorry for my wheel being in the way but um here's the thing I can't do anything about it because I don't have my tripod my tripod broke I try to get a tripod the other day and they didn't have any for some reason so I'm guessing I need to either order one online or just somewhere else I don't know what to really do about it but right now you're just gonna have to kind of deal with this I couldn't move it but then I'm gonna be like up here to video so I don't know what you guys would prefer see I'm saying like I just don't have any like flat oh that kind of worked okay okay we're gonna roll with it anyway so today I'm doing a quick little review on an edible eye balm I love edibles I mean I love him but at the same time they're deadly to me they're strong girl I took a edible for 4/20 it was the la familia hot chocolate one I took the whole thing and that thing smacked so today I didn't really want like a chocolate or like a brownie I wanted something like more candy like so I got the Smokies edible and these are in the sour blueberry fruit shoes basically so it's a hundred milligrams there's two milligrams of CBD per not per actually the whole bag is I guess that's what it is now per serving it's 10 milligrams of THC so per gummy and then 2 milligrams of CBD in one little gummy so I'm not gonna do the whole thing and by the way you guys this review is going to be really really [ __ ] forward really honest I'm gonna tell you guys about the taste I haven't opened these or anything yet so I want to record like my reaction of like the taste that I get instead of like trying them and then coming back and then you know my thoughts would be kind of you know what I mean so yeah anyways these are vegan this is a vegan uh thing not all of them are weakened from this brand so if you are vegan and you know you stay away from Dairy and stuff so I'll definitely ask them which one is the vegan one because I know not all of them are vegan but I know that their dairy they're gluten-free all of them are gluten-free but not all of them are vegan so I just got this because of the flavor you know what I mean so I'm not vegan so it doesn't matter to me but it's a good thing that it is vegan so I don't mind it and I don't really care so yes so the ingredients on here is just sugar corn syrup pectin I don't know what that is but it is citrus acid natural and artificial flavoring FD&C blue one which is probably like the color of the candy soy let union I don't know and then cannabis extract so the weed basically you know so yeah the sugars in this is four grams I'm thinking yeah per piece it's four grams so if I'm gonna have three of them for 12 grams of sugar when you do the math it's kind of a lot so these are sour they're Fruit Chews had crafted gluten free vegan and so I watched a review on these and people said that only 40 will do the trick I'm gonna try 30 just because I want to see how I feel and if I don't feel it as much I'm so sorry about the [ __ ] Sun oh my god but if you don't feel it as much then I guess well if I don't feel it as much because you're not going to taking them I am but if you don't feel it as much then I'll take then I'll take another one pretty pretty much but I know how adipose are they sneak up on me I keep eating them like I eat them and then I keep eating them and then boom you know so these were $21.99 okay before attacks at my dispensary so I think with tags and all the little bag they charge me for because I've got to break minds it was like $25 so basically it's really easy to open I just rip this up hopefully it's easy to open it cuz I haven't even opened it yet already strong it's kind of like this there's like a little this in here and I'm guessing you pull that apart and they open up they smell like blueberry literally like [ __ ] they smell like powder aid okay you guys the blue powder right that's what they smell like I totally spot on that's what I'm getting and they look really cute and like flat and big oh they're soft they're like super gooey look at all that little sugar let me just you know I'm saying basically they're just coated in sugar they're sour they're pretty big I would say they're like as big as a [ __ ] let me see some money up in here so this is a quarter and then they're a little bit bigger than a quarter even so okay you guys so I'm gonna try one and I'm gonna see you in like a week [Music] mm-hmm gather my thoughts okay so I'll say this they taste really good they have they're sweet they are sweet you know I'm saying like I'm not really like a candy person but I like gummies and like sour stuff so I can make an exception but they're really good I had one of these they don't taste like we do know what I'm talking about you know when you take some edibles and they have that weird like nasty aftertaste of the weed you know you can you feel on the back your throat and all that I don't get it with these ones so I'm gonna take another one this is gonna be my number two you know I'm gonna take the three in front of you guys so you guys know what's real and I'll check back in with like in an hour and two I got some laundry to do so I'm gonna be a little bit busy and then they're just gonna hit me like a truck and I'm gonna be gone you know what I mean I don't know I hope so I hope these are strong they were saying these were strong so they better be so this is gonna be twenty you know what I'm saying these are really good you guys like even if they didn't have ween in it I would probably eat them they're kind of like okay they're like a sour patch kit all most like they kind of remember that but they're not as sour they're like they're like up from sourness it's like a good five it's it's the perfect amount it's honestly good with this week and see what I mean so I'm gonna eat one more you know I'm saying well you know we get lead tea today [Music] he was a [ __ ] fly in here anyways these are really good I wish they had like a pack where they had like all the little flavors that would be really dope like you know they had blueberry rhinos berry that would be mom like a little mixed assorted pack but yeah so I've had if I'm gonna have three out of like seven left so that's 70 grams seven milligrams so basically I'm ready to eat another one this is gonna be thirty and I will check back with you guys and an hour or I think on the back it tells you yeah wait two hours so I'm gonna wait two hours and I think he's gonna give me pretty lip but I don't know because I'm not smoking at the time maybe I will smoke a bowl but I'm not gonna like smoke because I feel like when you smoke weed and you take edibles it's both of them combined and it's just too much so I'm really trying to see how strong these are going to be just with 30 milligrams and if you guys the real tea on this you know I'm going to eat the last one and then I'm gonna go and go do my little [ __ ] wash my drawers and then I'll be back and then I'll tell you guys how they are so yep sure yeah of course chuckles you guys but I told you guys I did a little bun you know what I mean it's like a tank guys so it's like eight o'clock now I took those three edibles at 6:00 it was kind of like noise in there but anyways there's six it's been like two hours I smoked a bowl I'm not really feeling it all that much so I'm gonna wait until like 20 more minutes see if it kicks in and then if not I'll take another alignment so then I'm gonna give it the complete fill out two hours so you know it's good at all so we'll see but if not I'm gonna take one more or maybe two more to see if it's gonna hit me later but yeah that was 30 milligrams and it's been like an hour and 40 minutes I don't really feel anything but I'm gonna wait 20 more minutes because you know how they are they hit out of nowhere so I'll be back with you guys I'm kind of talking fast I'm not trying to but it's just a quick update you don't even a brief summary so I'll be back and I'll see you in a bit hey y'all so it's an update it's been I think a day or so two days I don't know when I recorded that video but basically I'm here to give my initial and final final thoughts you guys about that edible the was it the sour blue raspberry by Smokies the gummies the Fruit Chews to be exact you guys they were [ __ ] smacking okay when I had the 40 milligram that night oh my god was I gone was like on I kept [ __ ] eating I didn't really felt them like hitting me like instantly instantly but I felt like they really creeped up little by little and I also feel like it took a little bit longer for 40 milligrams to hit me it took like I would say to and I have hours and then I was just like Munchie [ __ ] madness you know I was eating anything I was just eating chips food I ate even after my dinner like have some snacks if you're gonna eat some edibles because trust you're gonna need up and then what's getting pulled in here okay and then I took 50 milligrams that I think the day after okay I took 50 milligrams and that actually hit me a little bit sooner I would say that one they fit me I don't know why maybe like maybe because the timing that I took them at I feel like the first time I took the 40 milligram I took it at like 4 to 5 so it was like kind of late afternoon already so you know it girl was tired she was doing her SH and she was tired but the second time when I took it I took it earlier in the day I took it out like 2 o'clock because I wanted to be like awake and [ __ ] at least enjoy my high you know so I took the 15 milligrams and on this sweet so I took him I took him I'm chillin literally I would say two hours later two hours and ten minutes later it hit me I was at Walmart I was grabbing some things and that [ __ ] hit me like a brick like oh my god I was literally in one of the aisles and I was just [ __ ] dying you guys and I know you guys don't really care because don't everybody feels that way but I was legit like [ __ ] dying like over nothing and I was just like the [ __ ] but I realized that okay the edible so I know decided it's my cool I left Walmart and then even when I was home after that my boyfriend looked at me and he was like you're [ __ ] what did you do like I guess I was that [ __ ] high guys but I was like I just knew what it was you know to me that I didn't feel like I looked that [ __ ] high but I guess to somebody that you know from their point of view they would get it but um yeah to me I was really [ __ ] high but still productive so I would recommend taking them on like a very like good day that you're not gonna do [ __ ] you're gonna be eating a lot you're on your own time definitely don't do it if you're gonna go into work or something like that it's noticeable if you're high you know what I mean it is for me so my eyes got a little they got sleepy they got a little low they got red so you know but you guys the edibles smack I totally recommend them I'm going to try other flavors you guys I'm gonna do more reviews on this monkey's fan because I think it's probably one of the good ones okay really good really good so I've been totally gonna recommend to you'll I haven't tried other flavors but I definitely like the sour blue raspberry because I'm a sour person so you know I like sour candy so they were really my cup of tea so if you guys are into that I definitely recommend these edibles so that is my review you guys I don't want to keep going on and on and on but the same thing basically I rate him a 10 the taste is a 9 out of 10 the potency is a 10 out of 10 because I was gone with 40 so that's good because you can literally take 40 40 and then maybe the other two before work because it's like okay they're not gonna hit you as hard at vicious 20 milligrams you know what not as me as hard but like so like 42 like 60 it's like the perfect range for me yours might be a little different so I don't know so be careful but your dosage and all that dogs barking so I'm just gonna go and yeah you guys have a good day I'll see you on my next one bye bye", "vAEkwfmT4-Y": "okay I see Anika lollipop than boxing that there gentleman a paddle being a local of plural marriage gender in a year being back on it there [Music] well baby blow what

long they've been out on the market but this is a receivable bag you can see right here that you can snap the clothes and keep it contained to them and go bad faster and stay fresh um this is sour then sweet if you can see that sour that's sweet when they're low slogan this is mango the flavor is mango and a nice packaging because you kind of get see what the mango um sour patch are gonna look like before you get them out of the bag that is really cool I do like this nice little bag because you don't get a whole lot but you get just enough what you steal it time and then you can share with other people or you can just you know or yourself whatever you want um anything else you want to know a fun fact there's 100 calories in this that's one thing just beware there's there's a sugar it's a sugary candy there's I love the red Laura they're awesome but these are new we're testing out the mango they do have artificial flavor that's good to know that means get the true flavor of what we're trying to get here is the mango so let's rip these open and see what we got here okay we rip them open when these up open it up I'm gonna seal it got here we're gonna take a little whiff oh you could definitely get the mango flavor that's for sure I definitely smell the mango flavor let's pull one out and see what it looks like this is what a Sour Patch Kid mango looks like see on both sides just let you know you see the sugary let's smell it closer up they really do smell like mango now let's give it a bite and give our first impressions what it looks like what what it tastes like it tastes like mango has a sourness but it's not a sour as the original but sour enough that gives up gelatinous inside you taste more in gelatinous inside you can really taste it you're actually kind of good these are the you're not a big fan of the more sugary ones of of the sour patch kids these would actually be good for you if you like mango flavor if you don't then don't even worry about trying them I'm gonna try it again again soon as I think I get this jelly flavor inside cuz like on like more of a like a fruit snack or jelly get that smells really great taste like it and I love it it's not too sour E because if you're not don't like sour too much on salary cuz it balances the mango flavor the sourness doesn't overpower the mango so that's one thing I like about this I do like these but they're not my favorite I like there is no better but these are great you're not my favorite but these are great ones that um they made let's give them that a bite a hole well together and see what it tastes like again you have anything else we're gonna find out hmm Jonas mango hmm that's actually really good but they're not my favorite ones the original are the best nothing's gonna beat the original but these were are good hmm I eat more of these mmm I just taught myself before I eat the whole bag come on neon hmm he's a fantastic they shouldn't make these a lot sooner whoo these are Wow these are good not my favorite line but they're still excellent now go get them cuz I don't know they're brand new I don't know how long they been out are there in your markets or their actual gas stations or where you can buy these sour patch kids mango the flavor is just enough flavor of the mango balance it with the sourness but the sourness of the overpowered the mango so it makes it a great snack come on down stop them they oh you're fantastic I get these up great I'm gonna give them to me I'm gonna give them I want to say a hundred but they're not my favorite so I'm gonna give it at eight in my in the line there is more better serving in the eight so this is my review on the sour patch kids mango you heard it first from me oh it's out crowd if you like this video please like

marijuana edibles welcome to wheats guys the marijuana edible review show the one where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's late at night and I'm ready for bed but I can't go to sleep so that's why I've got my cushy punch hundred milligrams here indica variety right here you know Ben so I'm hoping this is going to do the trick this is the second time of reviewed cushy punch I reviewed their TKO formula before 200 milligrams and found it to be pretty disappointing to be honest it did not do much for me since that time I have had several several people come up to me and say and I come up to me I mean comment online that's what I mean by that I've had simple people comment to me online saying give Chris you budget another chance sometimes that their formulation isn't as strong as others but when it hits it really hits so I decided to give it another chance and this seems to be the perfect opportunity when you're ready for some sleep with the indica variety so let's go ahead and open it up give it a taste and I'll come back to you guys in just about two hours after this and hopefully be ready for bedtime so let's find out if that's going to be the case or not okay so we've got our little jar here it looks like a little butter Pat actually a little pad of butter that you would get at our restaurant it's a hundred milligrams of THC in here I said before so let's go ahead and open her up and slope her to him and hopefully get ready for bed in the there we go there's our corner and there she has one big gummy pop her out for little rivulets they're not gonna care just gonna plump the whole thing I'm not it's not super great it's better than the like confused creations or those kind of edibles I've done as good as the flourish it sort of tastes more like a flourish type edible than the infused creations or at a pure or any of those two so it's better than those but it's not as good as the flourish company's in terms of taste so from here guys I'm just going to wait it out and hopefully in two hours I'll be ready for bed so I will see you guys then I'll see you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the way the wheats reviews work for you it's just going to be a couple of seconds so I'll see you on the other side of the break and for me it'll be two hours and I'll let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeds guys and I'll see you soon peace mission accomplished I think and a slight redemption for cushy punch I am ready to go to bed quite sleepy at this point looking forward to hitting that pillow and I feel pleasantly buzzed for one hundred and milligram edible this cost me eight dollars at my dispensary all-in with all the discounts so you know pretty affordable 400 milligram edible and I do feel about about a six maybe five and a half or so so you know I'm not super super high by any means but you know definitely high noticeably high and ready to hit the sack so I'm ready to give cushy punch another chance try another one there edibles because they earned their Redemption with this one I just there 200 milligram did not see you know any stronger than this for sure maybe it's just as people have told me their potency seems to fluctuate up and down so maybe this was just a stronger batch but we'll review some more could you punch in a few to see if my opinion changes but for now this was a pleasant surprise and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat skies and we will check you out on a future review peace", "ErYTX7raBKU": "guys guys i'm eating okay

"Bfv8BWZ-Xc0": "[Music] hi everyone and welcome back to my channel today i'm going to be showing you how to make these apples that are going to be wrapped with the bulbarindo which is the tamarindo some chamois and tajin if you want to know how to make these just continue watching and i'll show you how let's go over the ingredients first okay so i'm going to go over the ingredients first what you're gonna need are some green apples um you don't have to use green apples but you can use red ones or yellow ones but this is what i'm gonna be using today um you're gonna need some tahin you're gonna need some chamoy gotta make sure that you use a bowl and then inside we have um the chamoy so you need maybe like a little brush or something you're gonna need some wax paper wax paper and then the main ingredient is okay so these ones you can find at any mexican store or you can even find them at walmart or dylan's wherever you go you're also going to be needing these big jumbo uh skewers make sure you get the thicker ones if you get the smaller ones they're they're going to be too thin okay okay i'll show you real quick you need to make sure that you wash your apples and then you take off this little thing and then you have your skewer and you stick it on top make sure you kind of go halfway you don't want to go all the way through just like this okay so the first thing you're going to do is you're going to get four purparindos i used four because my apple was a little bit bigger but you might end up using two or three just depends on how big or small your apple is okay what you're going to do is you're going to open them you're going to put them on a plate make sure that you're able to put this plate into the microwave put them in there for about 10 seconds okay so after 10 seconds in the microwave for my microwave they're pretty soft and you can fold them and work with them okay so what i'm going to do first is i'm going to put them all together and form like um a ball like this if you have gloves you can use gloves i don't have any at the moment so i'm not using any gloves okay just like this it gets pretty sticky so you're going to be needing some powdered sugar and i forgot to mention this at the beginning so i'm sorry um it's just regular confectioners sugar you're going to put some on the wax paper and you're going to put some on your rolling pin so that the tamarindo doesn't stick to the rolling pin and it doesn't stick on the wax paper either you're going to be using quite a bit it's okay if you think it looks like it's a lot but i thought the same thing but it's not it's perfectly fine okay so now what you're going to do is you're going to put it down on the wax paper pat it down a little bit and then you're just going to roll it and try to get it into like a circle and just continue to roll it out till you get it pretty thin you don't want to get it too thin because because then it's going to start to break make sure that you add a little bit of the confectioners sugar just like how i am right now if you don't it's going to start to stick so it was sticking to my rolling pin so i had to do it i know it looks like it's a lot of the sugar but it's fine if you don't put it um i thought the same thing i thought whoa this is a lot of sugar but when i watch some other videos but if you don't put it it's gonna start to stick and it's gonna be hard to work with so as you could tell i made it pretty round um pretty big size this is how big you probably want it well you got to make sure that it goes and fits around your apple so that's how big you have to make it what i'm going to do now is i'm going to put some chamois with my brush onto the apple just like this and then after i brush all the chamois onto the apple then i'm going to get the tamarindo wrap and wrap my apple just like this make sure you put chamois all over your apple and it looks like we're ready to go now you're gonna grab grab it like this and then you're going to form it around and try to cover it all up it does start to get a little messy and that's fine the chamois kind of starts to leak out and it gets the tamarindo kind of wet but that's fine because we're going to be getting the tahin and putting it on onto the apple also make sure you kind of try to smooth out the try to smooth it out here you can kind of see there's a couple of creases and just use your hands and just try to form it into like a perfect little ball um apple whatever but um see right there i'm showing you just smooth it out pressing it and i was pretty happy with the way this one turned out it was obviously like it fit just perfectly fine so there you go now i'm going to wash my hands okay so now what we're ready for is a tajin i'm going to be putting some into a bowl and you're going to need like a spoon or something to put it on i have i think like a little teaspoon and then before you put it onto the apple you're going to be putting some more of the chamois we're putting more chamois onto the apple because you want to make sure that tahin really sticks onto the apple so just like this make sure that you're covering your whole apple with the chamoy just so that um the tahini really sticks on there and you could kind of see that i missed a little piece of the apple that i didn't cover very well and that's fine guys just try to cover your apple as as best as you can now what you're gonna do is you're gonna get the tahin and you're just gonna pour it all over your apple like this make sure that you get every part of that apple so that it has tahin um this was our first time making the apples my sister brenda was here with me that day and so she was kind of helping me record and um she just said why don't we make these apples and i said okay fine then let's do it and so here we are just like that and we are done what do you think okay so we're gonna go ahead and cut one and see um [Applause] all right guys so let me know what you think comment down below tell me what did you think of this apple try it out if you try it out let me know um again guys thank you for watching if you're new here don't forget to

aloha mai kakou my name is Ralph and welcome to my kitchen where I like to share on my favorite Island and Hawaiian style recipes and today I've got a treat for you we'll be making the Huy lemon peel gummy bears this has been the biggest snack craze right now in Hawaii it's nothing new but since everybody's been home and craving all their favorite foods this has come up more than ever it's a simple recipe that you can make at home it includes the Huey the Huey is a Chinese dried salted plum you can use the Huey in the seed form or in the powder form this recipe uses the powder form this also uses lemon peel which is another Chinese dried snack and gummy bears of course now you can use any gummy snacks that taste great gushers strawberry belt peach rings anything really you can use the sauce on fruits as well it's really yummy the kids love it toss it in the freezer if you'd like make it a cool treat before I get started I'd love it if you'd subscribe to my channel by hitting that red subscribe button down below and don't forget to the notification bell so you can be updated everytime I post a new video and I post new videos every week also don't forget all the recipe instructions and ingredients are always listed in the description box below so how they might come along and let's make so many lemon peel gummy babies all right first we're going to get the lemon juice I like to use fresh lemon but if you want to use the artificial ones from the store you can roll the lemon with the palm of your hand and cut in half this will help get the lemon juice out easier then you're gonna squeeze the lemon to get the juice now I have a kabillion of different kitchen gadgets but for some reason I don't have like a regular juicer I have the full-blown juicer that you throw the whole thing in but I figure I just squeeze it here because most people don't have one anyway so if you squeeze the lemon and place your hand underneath you can catch the extra seeds that fall out if some slip away from you just make sure you get them out of a bowl when you're done [Music] next you'll take your lemon pill strips and place them into a food processor if you don't have a food processor you can use a blender we'll go ahead and grind it until you get fine pieces continue to grind it down until you get the strip's down about this size next we're gonna make the sauce take a bowl and add the lemon juice that we squeezed earlier some granulated sugar and some of the human father Meehan whey powder can be found at most grocery stores in Hawaii you can buy it online on Amazon at crack seed stores around it's pretty easy to find all these go ahead and mix that up until well combined and you're gonna go ahead and add your gummy bears toss the gummy bears in the sauce until well coated [Music] then you're gonna add the ground-up lemon-peel lastly stir it up and enjoy [Music] and that's how you make lemon lemon peel gummy bears really easy right if you try this recipe or any of my other recipes please let me know leave a comment in the comment box below what's your favorite thing to put the Himalaya powder on and until next time Hui hold thank you for watching my mom's video", "24MYEYY9quo": "hey guys welcome back to kiwana's kitchen i'm kiwana for those of you that are new here welcome my name is kiwana in today's video i'm going to share with you all on how you can make the most delicious mexican candy ever some dirty worms slash pico pico slash dolce enchiladas guys when i say this candy is so good you have to give it a try so if you want to see how i make them keep [Music] [Applause] watching okay guys real quick we're going to go over everything we need to make our mexican candy i have some extreme airhead belts here these are so good they are like my all-time go-to kid i ain't gonna even say that i'm i ain't gonna even say that because i have so many favorite candies but this right here is definitely one of them so um i don't even a lot of y'all like that so um yeah we have these we have some gummy worms that we are going to need as well again you can use what you want you can use gummy bears you can use the little peach rings you can use the watermelon candies you can pretty much use any gummy candy that you want and here i have my whisk we're going to need a whisk because we need to kind of beat this powdered sugar i have one cup of powdered sugar which we are going to need as well because that chamoy is very very sour and um yeah you definitely want something to sweeten it up so we're also gonna need some of this lucas mango candy this right here is like that powdered candy if you guys remember like the straw where you got to rip off the top and pour it in your hand and just lick like lick that pretty much is what this is right here this is so good okay so so good and it has a bit of a kick to it so if you like a little heat in your candy um yeah this is definitely that and it ain't too you know too too strong or spicy but um yeah guys it is so good and um just like with the um straws you just kind of rip off the top with this right here you just kind of twist that off and pour it in your hand and just lick it guys and like i said this is so good if you guys have not tried this or what people that are not you know mexican or whatever um because this is mexican candy so i'm pretty sure you guys have tried it but those who haven't guys i would say definitely give this a try if you like candy that is if not just go ahead and do what you do but these are so good and i actually got these from walmart they came in a set of ten so um you can see here we are missing four my daughter love these things and they're very very cheap they're like two dollars and um ten cents or two dollars and ten cents two dollars and like 37 cents or something like that and you get 10 of these little jars second we are going to need some tahin and of course some chamoy and this right here is like my all-time go-to because it is so good in that color do you see that color right there guys that right there lets you know that this chamois is authentic because they have some out there where the color is like brown and um yeah it's not true chamoy sauce okay chamoy true chamoy could even get that out it's like a tongue twister true chamoy is very very red okay like a vibrant red color so that's what you're looking for so yeah we're gonna go ahead and get started and start to put this mexican candy together okay guys so in the bowl here that i have my powdered sugar and i'm gonna start to try to attempt to break down some of those pieces of the powdered sugar i don't know where my sieve is you guys know if you have a sieve you can run the powdered sugar through it and you'll end up with a very fine powder but again i don't know where mine is so i have my whisk here to kind of help out with the process of breaking down that powdered sugar i'm now adding in my chamoy sauce i'm going in with one cup total of chamoy sauce i'm not going to add any more like i always say you can definitely adjust these ingredients to your liking from what i saw in the other videos they use way more of the ingredients that i'm sharing with you guys here but again i just suggested it to my liking so i got my whisk and just gave it a good mix and you guys can see the pieces of the powdered sugar all throughout the chamoy sauce okay so i just continued to whisk it a bit to kind of break down some of those pieces so i then popped this into the microwave for about 15 minutes and it worked out perfect because it did take out a lot of the clumps of the powdered sugar but it still had some in there but it's fine so what i did was i started to go in with my other ingredients i added in my tajin i went in with one tablespoon of tajin so like i said guys from what i saw in the videos they use way more than one tablespoon of tahini and um you guys know tahini kind of got that citrusy little with a kick to it but um again i just added in one tablespoon so if you want to add in more definitely do that so now i'm gonna go in with my mango lucas and guys when i say this little jar here is packed with powder oh my god it is packed with powder okay i'm only going to use half of that and look at how much came out of that i want to say that's about two tablespoons of that mango lucas that i added into my recipe here and i just gave that a good mix as well but like i said i only paid like two dollars and 37 cents for that at walmart and it came in a pack of 10 and that was for that mango lucas powder and if you guys are wondering how that tastes it's like a spicy sweet taste it's spicy and sweet i think it's like cayenne pepper along with some other kind of sweetness that they have in there but um yeah i got that mixed in i then went in with my gummy worms and then i added in my airhead belts okay for those of you that know about the airhead belts you already know you got to break those apart they're like already pre-cut but you just have to pull them apart so i just got those in there and then i got them coated in that chamoy sauce mixture and um yeah guys i did not add in all of the gummy worms that i wanted to add in there um i did eventually go in with some more and i gave it a good mix as well now like i told you guys from what i saw in the videos they add way more of the chamois the tahini the uh mango lucas um and some even use tamarindo um in there i think i said it right tamarindo like a sauce or whatever but i just didn't want to add that in here but um yeah i just got those coated as well gave it a good mix and i let these sit a bit before um yeah me and my daughter split this up because you guys already know how my son get down and he was not going okay so um yeah just made enough for me and my daughter and these will last you a while so um yeah guys that is pretty much it if you guys are into the sweet spicy tangy type candies i would definitely say give these a try but until then i hope you guys did enjoy my video if you did please give my video a thumbs up support my channel by subscribing and until next time you guys

i really do appreciate your support i really do mean that i love you guys so today i'm going to show you how to do the sour version of a gummy uh gummy candy so this has got includes the gelatin and a cooked syrup candy syrup you combine them and we then apply the sugar sweet and sour sugar right afterwards so we don't have to wait for it uh to dry uh or to figure out when we need to add it we add it right afterwards and um all right so i'll just get right started we'll get into the ingredients the equipment that you're gonna need and then how to put everything together all right well thank you so much for joining and i hope you enjoy the video okay so this recipe is done in two stages well technically three because we cook in two different stages and then we combine everything so for the first gelatin for the jello half you're going to need three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of your favorite jello flavor a quarter cup of light corn syrup a half a teaspoon of citric acid a half teaspoon of gour gum and a quarter of a cup to a third of a cup of your can of butter and for the liquid you're going to need um a quarter cup that we're going to heat up to boiling and then a half cup that we're going to be using to bloom our gelatin and you can use any liquids that you like i like to use these um kool-aid or the kool-aid jammers these ones are good because they're a water-based and they're clear so you don't have to contend with color and they're also half the sugar so again you're not going to it helps cut back on the sugar since we got a whole ton of it in it that totally up to you though you want to definitely stick to a clear type liquid those powerades if you like those type of things those vitamin waters if you like them i don't like them they do not add the greatest of taste but if you do add juices like with it have real fruit juice in it then you're going to want to use a mold inhibitor because mold will develop very quickly and if you want to add additional colors or flavors uh we can do that i'm going to be adding 2d fruity and so i'm going to kind of make it pink and purpley i don't know tutti frutti colors and if you want to have a nice solid uh background you're going to need white food coloring so that's for the gelatin part the jello side gelatin side for the cooked candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar a half a cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water so for the equipment that you're going to need you're going to need a double boiler so you can use any pot and metal bowl i like to try and use a thicker thicker metal so that it doesn't get too hot you're going to want something to disperse your candy i love using these bottles they work great and they've got the piping tip which makes it really nice or you can use an eyedropper now this recipe is a little bit thicker so i'm not sure how well an eyedropper is going to work with it you're also going to need an oops timber you're also going to need a smaller pot for your sugar syrup and a candy thermometer two spatulas you're also going to need a hand blender and if you're going to be splitting your syrup either by doing different colors or flavors you're going to need a measuring cup to split that out if you're just doing all one you don't need that or in in lieu of a hand blender you can use whisk in a very strong forearm so the first thing that we want to do is we are going to bloom our gelatin and we are going to heat up that other quarter cup um you may need a little bit more liquid if you do you can just add it in later on if needed so we're going to heat this up in the microwave for about a minute and 20 seconds and we're going to sprinkle three tablespoons of gelatin unflavored gelatin onto our half a cup of liquid you want to kind of evenly spread it and then you're going to mix it in so that it is thoroughly mixed and that there are no lumps so you want it to kind of look like light up you want to look like applesauce and then you're going to just set that aside for five minutes and we're gonna add our boiling liquid to our jello mix and you're gonna stir that oh and you're gonna start you're gonna put your heat on to the lowest setting we just want our water to get hot we don't want it boiling gelatin melts at just hot water so we just want a hot water bath and we're going to stir that in and we're going to add in our corn syrup that's our quarter cup of corn syrup and we're just going to stir oh sorry and we're going to add in our half teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to stir that i said until it's dissolved it takes about five five six minutes or so for all of that to melt and in order to get this stuck gelatin off the side you can use some very hot water and a brush and it'll just you can wash that off otherwise if you don't it won't it doesn't melt and then it you'll get bits and stuff in your jello then you also want to make sure when you're stirring is to rub your spatula across the bottom because the sugar and the gelatin can stick to it and you don't want that so you want to make sure you'll feel it you can feel it smooth on the bottom if there's stuff stuck you'll feel it kind of rough you just kind of want to work it off scrape it off then once your gelatin or sorry your jello is fully melted we're gonna add in the gelatin and what i do is i just kind of cut it up into smaller pieces just like this and just in she goes and you're just gonna gently stir that until it's melted and if your water is hot now if the um your pots nice and hot you can turn off the heat you don't gelatin required doesn't require much heat at all to melt and if it gets too hot the gelatin will break which means it's not going to have that it's not going to your candies aren't going to set that well and the sign that you'll know that it's too hot is if you start to see white foaming stuff white foamy stuff happening on the top of your mixture here on your syrup now that everything is melted we are going to add in the can of butter and our gour gum and the reason that we have to use gour gum is it is an emulsifier and it is going to allow your oil and your your water to come together as one as one liquid versus being oil and water you know don't mix together an emulsifier allows them to come together as one solid solidified unit in short it basically mushes the oil and the water together to live happily we're going to pour in the our can of butter and i've used a third of a cup so as you can see adding you're adding the can of butter or oil to our gelatin you can mix and mix and mix until the cows come home no matter what those two are never going to blend together now you might get the appearance if you kind of whisk really really quickly you have the appearance that it's combined right that kind of looks like that's all combined however if you go and you set that and if you want to set that up now all of the butter would raise to the top of the mold now if you've got one of these little strainers or a strainer it's great for doing the guru so we're going to use a half a teaspoon of gargum and you're going to gently sprinkle evenly sprinkle it over the top if you don't have a strainer you just want to make sure to try and get it evenly over the top there this will adhere to the oil and allow it to mix in with our with the jello and i'm going to let that sit for a minute and now we're going to get our trusty hand blender [Music] and you'll continue to mix that until it is completely all one color all one unified color you don't see any kind of streaking or any kind of any difference whatsoever that's when you know it it is fully blended and emulsified and you're gonna be how about that texture and once that's done we're just going to let that set to set aside and leave it on the hot water but turn off the heat and then we're going to do our candy syrup all right so for our candy syrup we're going so for the candy syrup you want one cup of sugar a half a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water you're gonna mix that together until it is blend till it's all mixed up and your sugar starting to dissolve and we're going to turn the heat on to medium-high and you're going to stir the syrup until it begins to boil so as soon as it starts to boil then you are going to stop stirring that's when we add the candy thermometer and we don't stir it again and then you're also going to want to grab a jar of hot water about whatever something of hot water and a brush so you can wash down the sugar crystals off of the side and that'll prevent your syrup from crystallizing once it begins to boil there we're going to add our candy thermometer i'm going to try to add the candy thermometer now if you ever wonder why i kind of have this weird looking thing the one that i have said it setting on it that thermometer doesn't always work for me it occasionally will fail um this i like the digital but the digital um doesn't have any way of holding on to it it's more meant for just kind of sticking it into checking a temperature and then i have to use the tin foil to protect the digital from the heat so that's why i kind of have this weird makeshift candy thermometer and we're going to cook this syrup to 208 280 degrees soft crack now you can go a little bit if you want your candies a little less chewy you can go a few degrees less you can go to about 275. if you want them a lot chewier then you can go to 300. i seem to find the 280 is perfect for it well for what my liking anyway so we're going to continue to cook that syrup until 280 degrees just remember to wash down any crystal any sugar crystals that may form on the sides just to let you know you're doing this at the medium high it will go fairly quickly so don't leave the kitchen normally you do the sugars at a lower temperature so you have a little bit of time this doing it at the higher temperature it will go very quickly so i'm traveling you don't leave your kitchen and then you also want to get a pot of just cold water or a bowl of cold cold water stand by uh we're gonna put the bottom of the pot in that to stop the syrup the cooking process so we're at 276 270 see how quickly it starts to go 278 279 280 leave the candy thermometer on because we want to bring this temperature down to 240. you can turn your heat off leave it in the water until the temperature starts coming down and then we're just going to set it on the side here until that temperature comes down to 240. so once your temperature comes down you can remove the candy thermometer and we're going to add in ow be careful the syrup is still very very hot you're going to get your gelatin mixture and you're going to have a look and you're going to make sure that you don't see any green or anybody butter separation now you might see a little bit of cut like see how that color there difference that suggests your jello that the air is coming out of so don't worry about that what you care is if you see any kind of green or oily looking so that's good we're going to pour this into this candy syrup and be very careful when you're stirring this now your gelatin is going to be a lot more liquidier than the liquid liquid ear i know i come up with my own words uh then the candy syrup is going to be thicker it's also going to start to solidify as you can see on the spoon that's why you're going to gently stir it and we're going to turn the heat on to bury it to the lowest temperature and you want to make sure to take your spatula and go all the way around the edges the syrup will has a tendency to stick along those edges see so i like to use the hand blender whoops to make sure that everything is fully uh mixed together and blended and emulsified [Music] and then you're just going to gently stir to make sure that it's all nicely mixed so now at this point is when we're going to add in our flavor and additional colors if you like or as i said if you want if you're not doing that you can just go ahead and put this into your bottles right now and get ready to distribute into the molds so i'm going to be adding one of my newest favorite flavors tutti frutti love this flavor i usually use about a cup and a half and again you just want to gently get that all mixed in now if you are going to be splitting uh if you want to do two different colors this is this point you're going to put it to the transferred over to your measuring cup and split it in half or if you wanted to do two different flavors then do that before split it in half add your different flavors but i'm just doing one flavor base two colors okay so i have got now whenever you look at a um a measuring cup always look at it straight on get down at the level and look at it straight on if you look at it from a down level you see you don't get an accurate reading that looks like two and a quarter cups however it's more like two and a third cups so for this one i'm going to do i'm gonna add some more red and i like to use the no taste red i hate the taste of red dye i can always taste it and everything so i like the no taste red the one thing about it however is it doesn't have quite the intensity of red that the regular does but i'd rather forsake a little bit of the intensity on the color versus the intensity on the flavor there we go that's a nice red and the other side i'm going to do purple i'm going to add in some pink i want a more pinky purple versus a dark purple and a couple drops of blue now mix that up see what we get now right now because we did i didn't add the white into it and it looks like it's a solid color it's actually it'll come out kind of still a little bit translucent so if you want to get a solid background and that it's not going to lighten up or get that kind of clear or translucent look you want that solid opaque then you need to add in the white so i'm going to add a couple drops into white on both sides so we have here when we add in the white it's going to dull down our color a little bit so that i'm just going to add in a little bit more of the red and add a little bit more to the purple purple i think i'm gonna leave i like that color but the red i wanna looks kind of orangey and see how much nicer that color is now it's a lot richer and gives you more that solid background makes it opaque versus having that translucent look to it and now i'm just going to get ready to pour it in the bottles and distribute it into the molds all right so now we're ready to distribute into the molds and you can go do half and halves now don't fill up your mold all the way to the top if you do it ends up leaving a sharp edge on your candy that dries out and it doesn't make your candies very pleasant so don't fill them all the way up to the top and it's also when you're trying to pour try and keep it to the middle and just let it distribute it out once you have your mold set up while all filled up you put it into the fridge for uh two hours sometimes it may take a little bit longer basically two hours or until they're set all right so it's been a couple of hours and our candies are ready to come out of the molds and we're gonna make up our sugar sour mix so you're going to add one cup of sugar and to that you're going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid cut it and you want to make sure to thoroughly mix that in so you're going to get even citric acid on everything not just get like a big hunk of it on one candy that's kind of gross so you want to make sure to thoroughly mix it in now the nice thing with this recipe is as soon as we take them out of the molds we're going to put them right into the sugar this sugar mix you don't have to worry about waiting for them to dry or partially dry before we can add it and the reason for that is citric acid is water soluble so when you do the other gummy recipe when you just take them out they're still wet and gummy bears are essentially water and gelatin so as soon as there's any moisture on them the citric acid will begin will automatically begin to melt it doesn't do it on this because you have the sugar coating or the sugar candy syrup in there that helps protect the gelatin and that's why they don't melt as soon as you put it on and that's why this recipe is way better for doing sour or sugar coated candies now these guys are going to be a lot stickier than your regular gummy recipe so you just kind of pull it and they'll start to peel out and then you just work them out and then just pop them right into your sugar sour mix and as they warm up a bit uh they will start to get a little more tacky so no worries as long as you can pull them out of the molds they're good and they do stick to your fingers they do just kind of put it down into the sugar you can just kind of rub it in and it'll get them off that's nice once the your sugar or your sugar sour mix is on they no longer stick together see look at that and then you just put them on the rack to dry as per usual now what i like to do is i like to put holes in my parchment paper so that way you're getting air from both sides it helps with drying the other nice thing with this recipe is it doesn't take anywhere near as long for these to dry as the regular gummy recipes they're pretty much dry in a few hours to overnight now if they do start to get a little too warm and too hard to get out of the mold just put them back in the fridge for a little while if you actually keep a little bit of sugar on your fingers once they get a little bit sticky it'll help with them not sticking to your fingers a little aid with them coming off see if they stick they will fuse just pull them apart now if you're taking these out and they're just not coming out they're way too sticky um they're too gooey you can put them back in the fridge for a couple of hours or um and if you take them out and they're still not going to come out what you can do is uh put them in the freezer for about an hour take them out put them back in the double boiler on low re-melt them and add a half a tablespoon to one tablespoon of bloomed unflavored gelatin and that should add enough a little more gelatin there that'll fix that right up and if you find that they are too gummy oh sorry not if they're too gummy if they're too chewy they're like rubber bands again same thing just put them back on the double boiler on low remelt them and add a couple of tablespoons of um liquid to it and mix it all in until it's all melted recast them and that should take care of that problem if you've taken them out and there's um your butter is all risen to the back same thing just put them into the double boiler re-melt them add a little bit more gargum and re-emulsify make sure to use the hand blender or your whisk really really well like i showed you earlier so again if they're stuck like that uh check first to see just gently work around if they come away then you're good you can pull it out of the mold but if they're doing that they're not coming it's not coming away at all then they need to either go into the longer go into the fridge longer or to add some more gelatin to them they are a little bit more work but they are definitely worth it in texture and flavor in everything i've pretty much abandoned the other gummy bear recipe personally i just use this recipe now i'll just do either sugar coated or the sweet or the sugar and sour mix option is if um they are being really sticky um they are kind of coming out they're set but they're just really sticky um that can happen because it gets it picks up a little bit too much moisture in the refrigerator you can just let them sit in the molds for a couple of hours on the counter before taking them out that'll assist in drying that out a little bit now if you can stand your candies up it's a good idea some of them won't stand up though too small to whatever decides so if you can stand them up great if not you just want to flip them over every couple of hours until they're dry and as i said before this recipe and the drying time is it's a lot less time and that's it for them so just leave them out and enjoy some awesome sweet and sour gummy candies so that's my tutorial on sweet and sour gummy candies these are the little bad boys they haven't dried yet but you can see they're really nice they're little that little squishy now because they're still wet tastes awesome so i hope you give this recipe a try whether you want to do just sugar coated or the sugar sour it's a great recipe i'm sure that you'll love it if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments i'll always get back to you and i think that's everything i've got for you today well thank you so much for joining time diamond delight edibles wish i could get that straight um thank you for joining diamond delight edibles it's been a pleasure have a wonderful day [Music] you", "BP8Qcs_6C-k": "today I'm going to show you how to make three different kinds of sour chili chamoy candy so first we're gonna add our candy then we're gonna add some chamoy then we're gonna mix it up now we're going to add some of the chili powder and you can add more or less of the chamoy it's up to you I like to add a lot of chili powder because it makes it more sour I've got to add half the lemon and we're going to stir it up add some more chili powder till it thickens you see the consistency there Candy's ready for refrigeration and if you notice it's really no measuring it's all in your preference if you want more chamoy you can add more chamoy if you want less you can you can add more of the chili powder and that's it", "lkTLGySENVU": "Hi Bold Bakers! Store-bought gummy bears, although delicious,\ntend to have tons of foreign, unpronounceable ingredients in them. So I want to show you how you can make them\nyourself at home with just four ingredients and all natural sugars. So let\u2019s get started. Being able to bake is so great for a lot of\nreasons. One in particular is that you know and can\ncontrol what goes into your food. My one tip is always is to use quality ingredients. We\u2019re going to start out by preparing our\nfruit for our homemade gummies. So I have some strawberries that have been\ndefrosted. Feel free to use fresh, but when berries are\nout of season, I like to use frozen. Now what we\u2019re going to do with these is\nput them into a food processor and make a puree. We\u2019re just going to puree them until they\u2019re\nnice and fine and there\u2019s no lumps. Next, we\u2019re going to take our puree and\npass it through a sieve. Now we do this step because we want to remove\nseeds and we also want to end up with a nice, smooth strawberry puree at the end. So we have our lovely fruit puree, we\u2019re\ngoing to head over to the stove and combine it with the rest of our ingredients. In a heavy-bottom saucepan, add in your strawberry\npuree, water, lemon juice, and honey. And then heat all of these ingredients together\nuntil they just come to a simmer. Now that our mix is simmering, it\u2019s time\nto add in our gelatin. Now if you are vegan or don\u2019t eat gelatin,\nyou can always replace this with agar powder, which you can buy online or at a health food\nshop. Sprinkle your gelatin over the mix and then\nwhisk it in until there\u2019s no more lumps and your mix comes back up to a simmer. Ok perfect. So I\u2019m going to take this off the heat. I can see that there\u2019s no lumps of gelatin. It\u2019s nice and smooth. If you do find lumps of gelatin in yours,\nyou can feel free to pass it through a sieve again to remove those. To make these real, authentic gummy bears,\nI\u2019m going to set mine in this mold I got online. It\u2019s really inexpensive. However, if you don\u2019t have one of these\nmolds, you can always line a tray with cling wrap and this\u2019ll work just as well. You\u2019ll just have to cut our your gummies. I\u2019m going to put a link for this mold along\nwith the recipe for my gummy bears on biggerbolderbaking.com. If you\u2019re using a mold, lay it into a tray\nbefore you start filling it up. Pour your mix into a jug with a small spout\nso it\u2019s easy to pour into the molds. And also, if you see any bubbles floating\non top, just scoop that away with a spoon. Now just very slowly, fill up all of your\nmolds with your gummy mix. If you see any air bubbles, just pop them\nwith your finger. So when I worked as a pastry chef, one of\nmy jobs was to make the sweets for after dinner. And every night, we made pate de fruits, which\nis exactly what this is. It\u2019s kind of like a fruit paste. Ok and that\u2019s them done. So now remember, you don\u2019t just have to\nmake strawberry. You can make any flavor you like. I also made blueberry homemade gummies and\norange flavored homemade gummies. The orange flavor is particularly easy because\nyou just use orange juice instead of a puree. Once you\u2019ve filled your mold, we\u2019re going\nto put our gummy bears in the fridge overnight so they can set. If you like this video, don\u2019t forget to\nsubscribe to my channel so you don\u2019t miss out when I upload a new one. So I made these gummy bears yesterday because\nI wanted them to be nice and set so I could show you. If you\u2019re using a mold, just go very gently\nto ease out your gummy bear. You don\u2019t want to damage him. Just look at this little gummy. He is adorable. And the best thing about it is you made him\nand you know exactly what went into him. It\u2019s all good ingredients. You can create any fruit flavors you like\nso the possibilities are endless. Don\u2019t forget to head over to my website,\nbiggerbolderbaking.com where there is a recipe on how you can make your own sour gummies. Thank you so much for watching and I\u2019ll\nsee you back here next Thursday for more Bigger Bolder Baking.", "SwShBN4kTqg": "[Music] hello welcome back to operating sec this is a special video collaboration with Julie from a beautiful horizons we will be releasing videos for some healthy Easter treats for kids make sure you check out Julie's channel if you like this video make sure you hit the like button and subscribe to my channel that's first thing I want you guys to know about this recipe video is that it's extremely simple your kids can help and you're going to want them to help and it doesn't use crazy fancy ingredients you can kind of make it your own and try all kinds of different flavor combinations the only special thing that you guys are gonna need are these silicone molds and I will put a link down below they are the cutest little things adorable in this pack that I got off of Amazon there are three different colors and it comes with three droppers which make filling molds so easy so you guys I hope that you try out this recipe video and make sure you let me know and give me some feedback how you liked it let me show you guys what you're gonna need in order to make these super cute delicious nutritious gummy bears let's go ahead and get started for the first recipe we're going to be making a citrus blast flavor and for that you're going to need two karekare or large oranges and then you'll need a citrus juicer if you guys want to skip this part and just buy some store-bought orange juice it's okay I'm not judging and since I didn't have any lemons on hand we will be using bottled pure lemon juice and this is organic also need some unflavored gelatin you guys can get this at natural food stores or I can put a link down below where you can find it off of Amazon - this is grass-fed gelatin I just have it transferred into a mason jar here on a technical note pineapple cannot be used in these gummy bears the pineapple will not actually set up with the gelatin and for our sour grape recipe you're going to need some grape juice and some lemon juice and then for our last recipe you will need some home brewed kombucha we have a berry flavor and but not least you guys want to make these into sour gummy bears you're just gonna need some vitamin C powder we got this from Amazon and I will put the knife down for that below as well and we're gonna toss those gummy bears and this vitamin C powder and they're so sour and fun okay let's get rolling [Music] in a saucepan I'm just putting one cup of juice 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and then I am slowly whisking in the gelatin at a medium-high heat until the gelatin is all dissolved if you dump it in really fast you're gonna have globs of jello so you want to take it kind of nice and slow and whisk it right in and now using the dropper that came with the molds you're just going to fill up those molds one by one and this is the part where you're kids helping you comes in really handy because it's not difficult at all but it does take a little bit of time so having someone to do that alongside you it's just a really great thing for about 15 minutes okay so I just got these out of the freezer and I think they are ready this is kind of fun if you guys like popping you know those packing bubbles I think that you'll really like doing this too [Music] so I have all three flavors made up and these are ready for vitamin C so I'm just gonna put about a half a teaspoon in with a ziplock baggie and then shake it around it's super simple and it makes some really tasty and fun and sour likes like a healthy version of Sour Patch Kids so just you wanna shake that around zip it up give it a shake me shake you need help with the zipper what oh good job fine to 300 [Music] not really good mmm the orange one is so good why is that tastes like pink yours is candy that I used to eat some this is like bringing you back to my childhood what is that mmm wanna taste one of the

"fZxfgoCs4OA": "these are the fight of fusion fiber gummies five grams of fiber and six B vitamins sugar-free gummies there's ninety in this package it's also besan folic acid some vitamin b6 vitamin b12 some biotin some pantothenic acid I have a plus B vitamins the UM this is the end of January 2017 the expiration date is on the bottom here this is some June of 2018 and it purchase from the end of January 2017 plastic shrink wrap around the top and it goes this whole labels yeah it's one of those push down and twist like a tell them okay and then it's got another cat here that you justice has peach raspberry and berry flavors two of these equal five grams of fiber and sugar free so it's long like 15 calories I have them here on a paper plate except any in a dime and a nickel so you can judge the sizes there seems to be a orange color so that's probably peach and then a pinkish color and then a darker berry color so to visa 5 grams of fiber 15 calories they found these fiber 1 bars also has 5 also have 5 grams of calories 5 grams of fiber but they have like 150 calories so I'd much rather eat two of these to get my 5 grams of fiber than one of these Plus these are if you're lucky you can get it myself at 250 for a box of 5 and here we have 45 servings for less than you know $10 so now let's see if yeah nice and squishy like gummies are supposed to be one side has a swirly pattern and the sides are smooth now mostly what the tastes like the mouthfeel is just like we're clear gummy bears they don't stick to the teeth they're not sticky the orange is definitely peachy tasting but I couldn't really tell that much of a difference between the dark berry color and the lighter berry color taste wise but they're good they're a lot better than these fiber bars a lot less expensive and the same amount of fiber so for the less than $10 I paid for these I think it's a good deal and I think that you will like them as well if you like gummy bears definitely",

everyone today we're making pickled mangoes and this is what we need just any type of container or mason jars that you'll be putting your mangoes in rice vinegar I have here three mangoes and licky moist seeds this is the main ingredient and if you don't have any like my seeds leaking powder is okay as well and then we need a cup of water and also any salt I'm using Himalayan salt but Hawaiian salt would be best for this one I forgot to include it on here but you'll also need some brown sugar first I'm cutting the tip of the mangoes and then we start peeling after peeling the mangos then we start cutting it and we're just cutting it around the bone area and then after cutting everything we just slice it into thin slices [Music] then taking any container I'm using mason jars here and we're just placing those mango slices inside the container after filling up the mason jars with the mango slices I'm putting Lavoie seeds I actually put three little seeds in there in each container which gave it more flavor now it's time to make the pickle juice which will be putting inside the mason jars first we have one cup of water one cup of rice vinegar 1 tablespoon of Himalayan salt 1 to 2 tablespoon of the leading powder and we have 1 cup of brown sugar and we're gonna be just mixing this until the sugar is dissolved and once that's done we'll just evenly distribute it to all of the jars and I usually chill it for about a few hours or so it's really good when it's chilled and mixed together I hope you guys enjoy [Music]", "NvLcVeAwem4": "[Music] the cannabis market is the wild [ __ ] West and there isn't a grizzled Sheriff and his loyal deputies around to keep you safe from all the bandits welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I get a lot of questions about people asking for tips for determining if an edible is potent as advertised so today guys I'm gonna share with you five common sense tips on how to avoid getting scammed when it comes to buying edibles getting scammed at the dispensary is pretty easy it's a nascent market with little to no regulations and zero accountability there's also lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of money to be made so lots of money and no accountability equals sleazy scores for scammers and fraudsters and it's bad enough when dispensaries and growers mislead their customers on what strain or how potent the flower they are buying is but at least the customers can see the product they can verify its weight they can smell it or whatever other rituals they have to test their weed sure they may not be getting the premium product that they are supposedly paying for but if they're buying an amount they will generally get that amount edibles however are much easier to scan customers with a customer can't verify that 200 milligrams or whatever listed on the package is really 200 milligrams they don't see the edibles getting made they can't see it being packaged if you want to buy a product you've got to take the company at its word that their product is potent is advertised store that your dispensary isn't gonna sell you a shitty product and good luck with that so I don't want to scare anyone away from edibles because they're [ __ ] awesome there are tons of great and reliable edible companies out there and more certain to come soon and experimenting and trying new products is half the fun but before you go and buy something expensive you've never seen before try utilizing these five tips to save yourself some money and some heartache so tip number one don't trust weed maps or your bud tender for their recommendation both these places especially weed maps is swamped with a bunch of bots and fake reviews that amp up a lot of really shady companies like lol edibles or infused creations all those have been pumped up by their respective companies and they mislead you and also speaking of people that mislead you your bud tender may very well mislead you they may have some kind of sales contract or sales target for some specific edible or they may have some kind of relationship with an edible manufacturer and they may be just be trying to sell you something that is not very good I've certainly seen it happen many times I've seen a lot of bud tenders Hocking lol edibles saying it's you know the second coming do not be fooled by them do your own research ahead of time don't trust weed Maps don't trust your bud tender know what you're looking for add of time so tip number two is in this case you want to judge a book by its cover or you want to stick to those reputable brands and what I mean by judge a book by its cover is looked at like the packaging is the packaging nice is the packaging fancy does it really show off the edible and all its glory I'm just talking about canna Co I'm talking about Korova here these guys have great packaging vibrant packaging that really shows off and sells their product and generally speaking the fancier the packaging the nice of the packaging the nicer the product maybe because they have the money already from being a bigger brand to invest in their packaging you know I'm sure it's the dog wagging some tail here a little bit as to what comes first but really take a look at the packaging do not buy anything that's just in like a plastic ziplock bag with a sticker over it it's usually going to be a bad product you want to take a look and make sure it has respectable packaging faziz that's usually a pretty good indicator that it's going to be a decent product so again judge a book by its cover and stick to those reputable brands stick to the big-name guys out there the big-name guys are big names for a reason again that's gonna be your Korova that's gonna be your Kiva that's gonna be your Kanaka that's gonna be your flourish the big guys are big again for a reason and they all have nice packaging so again look for the fancy packaging stay away from crappy packaging it's usually a pretty good indicator that what's inside is just as what's it's just as crappy as what's on the outside so tip number three is baked goods are good and chocolate is the best so I'm gonna go ahead and combine this with don't be a dummy stay away from gummies that is mostly true almost all gummies are bad with a few very notable exceptions like flourish do not get infused creations do not get at up here you're gonna see a ton of prepackaged edible or gummy edibles out there and they are almost always terrible with again a very few exceptions when it comes to gummies if you see flourish go and pick them up but outside of that stay away from the gummies there are usually a little bit cheaper than other things usually sometimes even substantially more so but that's for a reason because they are not as potent as advertised so stick away from the gummies State stay close to the baked goods your cookies and your brownies not even the Krispies like the rice krispies treats the fruity Krispies i'd stay away from those as well I don't find those to be as potent your brownies and your cookies are your best bets but for the absolute best bet go with the chocolate bars that is the best way I have found on all of my reviews for getting THC and the most potent gram for gram has always been chocolate bars kiva bang for twenty two phones say all those great ones there's so many out there and it's usually if you can find a chocolate bar it's gonna be a fun fun ride so again tip number three baked goods are good chocolate is the best stay away from gummies alright so that brings us to tip number four and that is to look for independent lab testing results this is a big one if you can find on you package or somewhere actual lab testing results that is he and don't just look for them to say lab tested look for the actual results you'll see tons of edibles out there lying about being lab tested and then this that and the other but if they don't have that actual result printed on the package it's no good plenty of people will lie about being lab tested or they'll get one product lab tested and say their entire line is lab tested if you don't see the actual results it's wasn't lab tested just go with that so look for that lab tested results look for independent verified results printed on the package or if not printed on the package printed it on a sheep close by something that will let you know that is as potent as advertised so again if you can find those lab tested results and it comes up as potent as advertised go and pick up that product it's gonna be good to go and then finally our fifth tip here is the most important one and the one that I cannot stress enough and that is you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles if there is a deal that seems too good to be true if you see a 500 milligram rice krispies treat for ten dollars don't go running for your wallet to pick it up and buy up the entire stock because they're lying to you it's not gonna be 500 milligrams it's probably not even gonna be twenty milligrams it's probably just gonna be an operation to fleece you out of your money if something seems very expensive there's usually a reason for that if it seems out of line it's probably because it is high quality stuff made with quality cannabis and quality ingredients and it's gonna stand apart the best edibles out there do cost a little bit more but they are absolutely worth it and almost invariably true if a product seems to be too good to be true in terms of price it absolutely will be so stay away from anything that seems to be too good to be true in terms of pricing and make sure that you know edibles are expensive guys so don't be surprised when you have to pay 22 bucks for a hundred and eighty milligram chocalate bar that's just gonna be the way it is out here but again you get what you pay for so if you pay that premium for that chocolate bar that fancier looking brand you're almost certainly going to be rewarded in terms of potency or taste or whatever the case may be so you absolutely get what you pay for and guys those are our five tips there just to run through them one more time don't trust weed maps or your bud tender for your recommendation do judge a book by its cover stick to those reputable brands number three baked goods are goods chocolate is the best stay away from gummies number four look for those independent lab testing results and then number five you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles what you pay for is what you get so if the deal seems too good to be true it very likely is and guys that's gonna do it just follow those five tips and you should be ready to enjoy some high-quality edibles and if you guys have any other tips or pointers that you want to share just leave a comment below and we'll be sure to include it maybe in a future video or pin it up there at the top we'll

you're saying two weeks ago you see you couldn't find these I walked into the same store this time and found the exact thing I was looking for but could not find two weeks before it same job no kidding these are casick I must Scott gummy candy so I'm happy to a found them because somebody requested a review of these as usual these come individually wrapped moths cop though goomy okay gummy candy these I believe are heart-shaped also physic the artwork on the package and indeed it is a true fact this is what they look like on the inside these look really delicious they're exactly the color you would expect to documents I reckon if you put these in the refrigerator and they would taste a lot like grace that's the mental barrier that I'm having to the difference between this and the actual item here's an interesting fact in a blind taste test involving hi-chew I was unable to tell the difference between the Muscat and a grape flavor of course I was blindfolded I can definitely tell the difference with these on the other hand I mean I do prefer the taste of Muscat to grave and although it might just be my imagination then you do know if you saw the video a couple weeks ago that grape is not one of my favorite flavors I find this much less offensive so I mean to give kassig I must get gummy candy a four out of five as usual they're a very happy flavor I just prefer Wisconsin great but also this has a particularly hilarious description on the front of the package its translucent color so alluring and taste and aroma so gentle and mellow offer admiring feelings a graceful lady enjoy soft and juicy kassig a Muscat gummy candy I will say they were soft and juicy but at no time it could be in the mind of a graceful lady so thank you very much for watching this I will see you again soon comments suggestions always welcome in the space provided for that", "JqhDejT6d5M": "I'm not really an edible person but I have to tell you whatever they put in this thing they've done a good job I [Music] bought a couple of quarters at a dispensary the other day and they offered you know a freebie and so I decided to go with the edible that they were offering and it happened to be a kirova Saturday morning cookie sample and took it home tried it out and I got to tell you I really really like this brand I really like this I mean I'm not familiar with edibles you might have a particular brand you like I came across these and whatever they're putting inside this thing I got to tell you it works really well for me I think these things are awesome you might have other brands that you particularly care for but I highly highly recommend you try the kirova I am not affiliated with them in any ways and just you know came across them at random and I really really like this cookie plus it's only 150 milligrams so I would maybe recommend to kind of start with these if you're just getting into edibles as far as dosing goes it's a good idea to start small now like I said this is 150 milligrams and you know other cookies and other things in other bars and other products they have you know 250 500 I've seen it even a thousand milligrams which is for me is it's too much you know I can't quite do that type of a thing but this packaging here says that it's got 15 servings per package so if you do the math it's like 10 milligrams per serving so if you're able to divide the cookie up as evenly as possible you can kind of figure out your dosage from there and I would probably you know I would say start with 20 milligrams these things can you know come across you anywhere from 10 minutes to you know 45 minutes to an hour depending on your metabolism and kind of like what's going on with your body and stuff like that so I always like to pass along the information which is kind of the thing with edibles because you know dosing is such a it's such a gray area definitely be careful with this don't eat a whole one for the first time if you're just starting out because you probably would have not such a great experience and you might not you know you might not come back to pick up some more this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much in size even if you're a beginner start with twenty milligrams you know and see see where you go give yourself a little bit of time wait for about half an hour or so and see how you're feeling you know if you go on to maybe an hour hour and a half and you're still you know you're feeling good but maybe you want to feel a little bit better maybe try another ten twenty milligrams and then just call it good and see where you end up there some people will just you know eat something go I don't feel anything and eat some more I don't feel anything and all of a sudden they're just they're just blitzed it's the first time for them that would be that would be a shame because they wouldn't receive the benefits of the Saturday morning cookie so you know if you're just starting out that's what I would recommend for you to do dosing wise hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud symbol calm and the kirova Saturday morning cookie thanks

candy so what big epic a candy is if you guys haven't heard they have an Instagram page and their name is like pika pika TX and they have the promised candy ever they have like they're like gummy where I'm scary bears nerd ropes they have fruit gushers they have all kinds of different like candies but they're filled with like tomboy or like chili I don't know but they are so good and they're not like super spicy they're like perfect so me and my husband and my family were so in love with them we thought they were so bomb so we figured why not make it ourselves so I um try different things until I kind of found out what was the closest to the taste um I tried to do just all the hain and that was like way too salty way too sour not good so then I tried this recipe and this one was pretty close okay so what you're gonna need is hot water and then I have in here this is powdered chamoy it is this but in powder form and then I have like just a dollar store wanna be like Vahine off-market die heme it's just like off-brand by Hayden I got it at the dollar store sugar and gummy so I got I got this at the dollar store - so I got gummy worms I got these sour squares I got gummy bears and I got a nerd rope okay so what you do is we're gonna need the hot water first and this sugar and you're gonna pour a bunch of sugar a lot of sugar and mix it up in it's hot so it should kind of like dilute the sugar make make it all you know not raining okay so once the sugar is in there all that so well that's it I'm going to make my concussion so I'm gonna put a bunch of this I'm gonna put about to do this and then we're gonna mix it all together and just not a lot of this because that's really like salty I'm sorry so it's just a little bit of that okay so then what I'm going to do is I'm gonna take these okay so you're gonna mix them around make sure that they get coated with candy completely coated okay guys so now they're like a little moist so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna pop them in the fridge for a few minutes and then I'll back and pull them out and they're gonna be dry not like all wet okay excellent now I'm gonna do the nerd rope and this is my first time doing the nerd rope last time we did like I think we did gummy bears gushers and sour patch kids so this is my first time doing the nerd rope so I don't know and that's gonna work out dip it in the water the sugar water you guys can get this one's harder too yeah this one's harder probably should have put it in the water longer okay guys check that out okay so this one I'm gonna taste it now oh that's good and it's pretty close remember guys this is Chum wine powder chum Oi and I actually got it from Mexico my cousin brought it for me I don't know if they even tell this here I did get this from Mexico this is powdered chamoy that is your answer trust me that's a nice so once you take them out in the fridge they kind of dry down a little bit and they just hide them in there for like 5-10 minutes but I put them in the freezer but they kind of dried down and the longer you leave them in there the more they dry down and guys there's that nerd rope I almost ate the whole thing um but yeah the more they dried down and I wish my husband and my kids were here to try them but they're not there's Joe in school but that is pretty much how I made the pika-pika candies", "4lLn0PhkakM": "[Music] [Music] hey guys mr. and mrs. Smith here and today we're going to be reviewing the heavy hitters cannabis infused gummies we have strawberry pineapple to try today we're actually very excited to try these uh if you don't know already heavy-hitters is possibly our favorite brand I would definitely say I would say it's also primarily smoke heavy hitters for our everyday cartridge and then when we want to like it up a little bit we'll grab some other stuff but heavy hitters is definitely always on a cartridge for us so we're also going to be trying the heavy hares GSC I say trying we've had it many times but we haven't been able to find it for a while not what you are it kind of it kind of went out of stock just weird it used to be available a lot in like 2018 but it kind of just fell out of favor except for certain places would still carry a guy in town by our main delivery service was no longer carrying it but they had it the other day so I had to pick it up cause it's been too long it seems like they almost haven't had it in stock since the name change so JSC used to be Girl Scout cookies I don't know if they changed it in others stances I'm pretty sure it was part of the laws that happened I'm pretty sure it's part of the laws that happened in 2018 for California that's they weren't allowed to call it they can't call it candy I believe they can't use the term candy and they can't use the term anything that could be marketed yes towards children can't market towards children right Paul any so that's why it says gummies or it'll always seem medical or cannabis like that they never never make yeah that would be appealing to a child exactly it can't be bears or anything like that so I mean it's a good law honestly I totally understand why there's some other laws that happened in 2018 which I will give you a refresher on right now now there was some weird stuff that happened when California passed a recreational marijuana back in 2018 I believe it was one of the things that happen is towards the middle of the year they actually switched it to where edibles could no longer contain more than a hundred milligrams per package now if you work in the medical marijuana industry or if you were a user or anything like that prior you know that there used to be packages up to a thousand milligrams in just one treat and what that used to be really good at is you could like just take a nibble off of a treat throughout the day and just kind of keep yourself dosed and medicated off one treat for a whole week basically but they changed it because there were way too many people who would come into a dispensary have no idea what they were doing by one of those really high potency edibles eat the whole thing and then they have a really bad time and end up going to the emergency room they got sick of dealing with that so they made a law saying you can't have more than a hundred milligrams per package there are certain things you can get around that such as cannabutter tinctures and pills those three items you can definitely get in higher doses than 100 milligrams but for edibles and then kind of cookie or anything like that max you're gonna get in a package is about a hundred so today we're reviewing B's from heavy hitters and the way they went about with these twenty milligrams per piece is you can actually rip the pieces in half so it's actually two servings per piece so it actually comes in two to ten milligram servings which I'm pretty sure is the law is that each piece inside a package can only be ten milligrams or something like that I know five to ten milligrams is a state recommended serving I'm not a hundred percent clear on the laws but it's just an unfortunate thing that happened with edibles in 2018 but I am absolutely dying to try these guns so let's go ahead and open up to the [ __ ] strawberry cuz I'm Joey it's been it's been a long time looking for out that let me grab the a7 r3 with the 70s [Music] [Music] yeah we just won't have us we won't help you all this video it's just not working at the moment six and a half hours Nathan I might open the pineapple real quick to maybe these do not open well I feel like we should show just how much of a struggle these were to open just like a montage of the [ __ ] difficulty this is bad this one opened much easier but that first package it just ripped in such a way that it was really hard to open but this is just like the other one has a really strong smell I figured it's it's really strong artificial pineapple mmm it's it's kind of a a bit herbal but not like too herbal it's not like overly pungent or anything like that like you're not gonna have you're not gonna get in trouble they're just keeping these in your drawer or anything like that like no one's gonna smell it yeah I don't know if this has any actual like pineapple juice or anything in it it doesn't have it listed on the ingredients mm-hmm so we're not sure if this is artificial flavoring or real bad no artificial actual coloring and flavor so is that natural flavors that display really use the natural coloring and flavor like or is it a flavor that's kind of that's kind of weird I don't know if I feel someone from heavy Harry's modified food yeah I don't mind it I mean that's just what I mean the people are heavy hitters you might want to put that it is natural flavoring as well like actually specified natural color and natural flavoring because natural color and flavoring just sounds a bit odd it's it leaves it up to the imagination as to is the flavoring also natural or just natural color you're always a nice flavoring this yeah always alright so let's try the pineapple yeah I'm gonna do a full 20 but I'm gonna show the camera how it splits so this is the gummies from heavy-hitters it's a square and if you look very carefully there's this little seam in the middle that if you pull whoops it starts to come apart yes it does if you start to pull it comes apart very nicely into two perfectly even ten milligram pieces so let's start well I'm actually just gonna eat the whole thing at once wait so where's our list of like criteria so I know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing bring it up go on top down your mouth and just roll around a little okay yeah my hands are all sticky now you know I gotta say I'm a little disappointed I'm a little underwhelmed actually I had I had much higher hopes it could just be the pineapple yeah because I mean the strawberry definitely smells better than the pineapple the pineapple is a little strong it's kind of it's very herbal forward which isn't a bad thing a lot of people enjoy that it's not a bad flavor necessarily but it is definitely herbal forward if you're looking for something that you could just totally mound shun and forget that there's weed in it not that we recommend it's not gonna be that yeah definitely don't recommend that but I mean like if you're if you're a fan of someone who like Eric or someone who likes really really flavorful very liked gummies that don't aren't bitter or plant alike at all this is not for you this is made to be strong and to be potent and it definitely tastes like it so keep that in mind and next up we have the strawberry so let's go ahead and pop these open and yeah will rate them in a second let's try the strawberry and I want to go ahead and split this one yeah because there'll be 30 milligrams each mmm much better much better mm-hmm all right strawberry is actually really good um I would say it's definitely pretty it is still has that herbal flavor but um let me bring up the criteria so we can actually start to break these down aftertaste yeah yeah really bad yeah I would say it's a bit odd I I'm almost feeling a little bit um disappointed I know me too it which it sucks because I'm such a fan of their oils but that's where comes in would we be as disappointed if we hadn't hyping it up so much yeah we did we we've also we've held on to these for about two weeks we've been waiting and waiting and waiting to try these specifically for the on camera experience and you know I think that also kind of built it up the fact that we've been we've been like dying sitting on me dying to try them the whole time and I mean they're they're good [ __ ] effects for sure by new user mm-hmm will probably like would probably really like it however its strong grams each heavy hitters recommends 10 milligrams as a dose the state of California recommends that california recommends that I personally have very low tolerance when it comes to most things so if you're like me I would definitely recommend starting with 5 milligrams when it comes to edibles but I mean you've been doing it you've been using medical using marijuana medically for two years yes so her tolerance is pretty high so we can handle the 30 we just say no problem but the big thing is though from let's let's go ahead and actually break this down but the main thing that I'm getting from these is but from trying both of them it is quite herbal forward the the flavor is there the strawberry is much sweeter and more flavorful I would say than the pineapple pineapple is a little more herbal forward as well but let's actually start talking about our rating categories here and give these are actually solid score each [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we're also gonna open this GSC

today we're going to be trying yet another one of the Casa guy gummy flavors apple gummy candy every drop of fresh apple juice carefully pressed from the reddest apples shining in colors of the cheeks of a snow country child is yours to enjoy in each soft and juicy Cassie guy apple gummy candy these are so hard to hold oh and when you open the bag it smells like you're walking through an apple orchard and as always these come individually wrapped ah budet apple gummy and greedy and i'm not sure why but like some of the Cassadine companies these are actually heart-shaped instead of round which is great but it's kind of more effective with the red ones i suppose and soft soft soft companies are the Softail company's anywhere eat the duck about us well I like apples me and this is about as close as you can get to eating an apple without actually eating an apple what is this standing to me with these classic I Cummings is how they how accurate the flavors are like you know the mango once tastes like mangos the lemonade ones tastes like lemonade and so long down the line at night they are so close that if you weren't sitting there something on a Gumby we actually thank you for eating the real thing in a lot of a lot of cases and that is definitely true with Castle guy Apple gummy candy which is why I'm going to give these a 4 out of 5 I think these are tremendous and the only thing I'll say about them is that they are actually a little tiny bit sweeter than an apple this is the one minor flaw and I'll thank you once again for watching this feel free to subscribe if

job", "iwMgD51_zEk": "first off I just want to give a little disclaimer saying that I do not condone the use of any legal or illegal mind-altering substances the contents of this video are created purely for education it's inevitable that there will be people who consume these substances therefore it is extremely important to educate people on the effects and how to properly use them so edible pot is a lot different than smoking it it's more potent it's processed in the body differently and the effects lasts longer the difference with edibles is that the active ingredient the chemical that gets you high THC is processed in the liver before the user experiences any effects the original THC from the edible is converted in the liver into a more potent metabolite 11 hydroxy THC it's estimated that this compound is about four to five times more psycho active than normal THC and because the edible has to go through a portion of the digestive process before effects can be felt it can take 30 minutes - as long as two hours before a user feels any effects because of this people who don't feel any effects after an hour so might want to reduce only to have the entire thing hit them like a train all at once an hour later so my advice just wait it out it may take a while but it will come on and unlike smoking cannabis in which the effects last about two hours and gradually drop off after a quick climax right after inhalation edible pot takes its time before it reaches its peak in effect and this peak lasts longer typically the effects of edibles lasts four to eight hours when it comes to the effects there are certainly similarities between smokeable and edible weed but there are some properties that appear to only occur strictly on edibles there are two main reasons someone would want to consume an edible the first is for medical benefits such as aiding symptom relief of stress or anxiety or to help one sleep and the second is simply just for recreational purposes just to have a high and have a time aside from these two reasons there are actually a few people in the psychedelic community who use edibles and very high doses in a similar way to what one would use LSD or magic mushrooms for but we'll touch on that aspect at the end of the video so now we are going to get into what you can expect to feel from the different doses of weed edibles but firstly it's important to know that tolerance is everything tolerance plays a huge role in your experience and if you're an everyday pot smoker you'll likely have to take a much larger dose of an edible that someone who has no tolerance to THC in order to feel the same effect so take the following effects of doses I give with a grain of salt as this is just generally what you can expect to feel when you take this particular dose so first off we have the micro dose and this ranges anywhere from one milligram to about 2.5 milligrams of THC it's unlikely you'll experience any active effects from this dose but it is possible for people who are hypersensitive to the effects of THC this dose is more just for purposes such as mild relief of pain stress anxiety etc people who Micro's THC edibles might also report increased creativity and focus the effects of this dose are pretty passive you likely won't feel any different fundamentally this can be somewhat compared to people who micro doze LSD and magic mushrooms who do so for similar purposes next we have the low dose which ranges from two point five milligrams to about 15 milligrams and the two ends of the spectrum can be very different especially for people with low tolerance to th see someone consuming the edible for medicinal purposes will experience stronger symptom relief and this dose can also be used for people who have trouble sleeping you may begin to feel a sense of euphoria and that classic high feeling where coordination is slightly impaired and overall perception is altered but if this dose the high is unlikely to be overwhelming and because of this this may be a good dose to try for a first-timer in my own experience there isn't a significant difference between this dose and edible in your average smoking weed high the medium dose ranges from 15 to 30 milligrams someone with a decent THC tolerance still may not be feeling heavy effects here but for many vistas can make them pretty high it's at those dose that people may start to feel negative effects such as anxiety and paranoia you might ask if people use weed for relief of anxiety stress then how could this dose bring on anxiety and stress well THC has biphasic effects which means the substance can have opposite effects in different doses anxiety can be reduced in lower doses but can actually be stronger in higher doses so if you're taking edibles for symptom relief it is important to be aware of these biphasic effects the drug in half coordination and perception will likely be altered at this dose that agree to which it is altered will likely depend on your tolerance some people might start to get the classic red eyes from being high maybe some people experience close eye visuals for me personally I tend to have a close eye visual on low to medium dose weed that looks kind of like this let me know if you have experienced the same type of visual in the comments the high dose ranges from 30 to 50 milligrams this dose will likely bring a significant high even to someone with tolerance and for someone with low tolerance this can bring an extreme high their coordination will definitely be impaired somewhat you might feel a strong euphoria maybe you'll feel very laughy some people's mouths get very dry and get cottonmouth this is due to THC mimicking a naturally occurring chemical called an and amide which binds to cannabinoid receptors in our saliva glands which causes saliva production to decrease you might also get the classic munchies and just want to absolutely binge eat it's important to remember that the effects of THC impacts everyone differently so no two people's high will be exactly the same and you likely will only experience some of the effects I listed not all the very high dose ranges from 50 to 100 milligrams I would say it's more likely than not that you will probably experience some negative effects at this dose but the high may become so intense you may feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed people often experience a rapid heart rate panic nausea in headaches at this dose so definitely don't venture into this realm if you don't know what you're doing for someone with an extremely high tolerance this dose might not be too heavy but for the average person this will likely be overwhelming there are still medicinal benefits at this dose but is only used for people who really need it as this dose is sometimes using cancer patients to boost appetite and is also used for people with certain inflammatory disorders personally any dose at this range or above just completely puts me on my ass the come-up is nice for me as I feel very laughy energetic and social but once the effects really start peaking I honestly begin to struggle to stay awake and wish to do nothing else but to find a cozy place to lie down and fall asleep this may have been due to the strain though as THC isn't the only psychoactive chemical we it's just the most prominent CBD is the chemical that aids with sleep and this chemical also plays a role in the overall effects of the weed and the amount of CBD in the strain will most definitely impact your experience and finally the extremely high dose is going to be anything above 100 milligrams I've heard of some edibles having 250 milligrams some having 500 and even some containing as much as a thousand milligrams obviously the effects will get significantly higher as those increases a 100 milligram edible might not be incredibly strong for someone with a very high tolerance but certainly 500 milligrams is going to put anybody on their ass be very careful of consuming edibles this powerful as there will certainly be negative effects due to the intensity it's in these very high doses that have experienced visuals reminiscent of a psychedelic trip on say LSD the visual might be something kind of like this and speaking of psychedelics there's many people who report having psychedelic like trips from high doses of weed edibles the world-famous Joe Rogan likes to discuss edible pot as along the same lines as psychedelics such as LSD psilocybin mushrooms and DMT saying that edible pot can take you down the rabbit hole there's a comment I found from someone on reddit that I thought described as similarity of the psychedelic feeling on high-dose edibles perfectly not long ago I did a hundred milligrams of THC edibles and had zero tolerance on my couch my eyes closed and no music it was awesome and the peak was over three hours I swam through the psychedelic mind a tunnel with many doors and behind each door was a memory of mine I went through them and had Total Recall I could recall past memories memories of being born my first laugh before thinking and the experience that my first thought as an infant the pure thrill of thinking now the effects of THC in the brain is nowhere close to resembling that of a psychedelic classical psychedelics interact directly with the 5-htt to a receptor in the brain and cannabis does not do this from doing research it seems to be that weed edibles tend to resemble psychedelics more often for people who have already had experiences with psychedelics in the past it's likely more often that this psychedelic feeling is also associated with strains with higher THC levels and lower CBD levels as CBDs antipsychotic effects will likely lessen the psychedelic effect but if you find yourself feeling like you're in the middle of an intense psychedelic trip I'll say what I've always said before let the experience consume you surrender to the substance let your mind flow freely and try not to attach yourself to these thoughts just simply observe don't make any attachments so that's about it for this video hopefully you have a better idea on what you can expect to feel by the different doses of weed edibles if you're new start low THC affects everyone slightly differently so see how you react to the substance stay safe consume responsibly and you'll be fine if you seek to support my work on a deeper level consider joining the patreon I run a book club on there where we read one book a month about topics we go over on this channel if that interests you definitely consider joining as always guys have a great day and peace [Music]", "6eOw9MLpuKA": "[Music] 20 I'm back with an overview I am at the auditorium or whatever right here in Los Angeles and I'm better Munch out on these stony patches that I just got a dispensary let's see how these are they look like sour patches I better take the whole 350 milligrams the whole thing I'm about to take the whole thing while I'm out here cuz I got like an hour parking and I'm not trying to really wait I've been waiting to eat them at the house but we've been out all day so I'm even here look the different colors they're little squares they're not the little sour patch figures and I got about like 10 of them so they smell like candy I do smell a little bit different in between they don't taste different that all tastes the same no matter what color they were um first time I ever see these they look like the exotic cards for some reason but they're edible got a matter dispensary for $15 so why not I will be coming back they get an hour to to see what the fix were and let you know they were worth the $15 or not so for now just stay tuned and Cheers and stay hi hi guys I'm back as I breathing for 23 hours later after taking 350 milligram edible I did not feel anything guys I went to the observatory in LA and I was up there for like 2 3 hours and they did not even kick in I had my moon rock art and I think after like 2 hours that I waited to see if they kicked in I just started hitting on the moon rock art and I got me it got me high as hell but these they didn't do anything for 15 bucks I bought these at a dispensary in Compton and yeah these are not worth it at all guys definitely 15 bucks down the drain but you know you pay for what you get or you get you get what you pay for and these two out of 10 don't even try ever if you come to LA so let me know if you want me to do more edibles don't forget to Like and subscribe comment down below and stay tuned and stay high [Music]", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea", "ghfwmZOlgtk": "hey guys this is Ali green something Marius medicinals I'm here with Chad drew this is pot talk on world viral TV [Music] all right here we are back in studio a we got Chad to CT in the booth and we've got one of brands in the house with our friend Kim Juana how are you my friend Kim I love it when you're around yes showers a ball of I'll always a ball outside my dude always she's always got this smile going all of sunlight shadow is like the ultimate self confidence booster yeah thank you I I think that's a compliment right no confidence yeah it definitely is hey wanna you can see it all the way across my belly wanna dude I went up to your facilities outside of Boulder you walk me around we took a picture next to some trays and candies and stuff like that in the water facility it was awesome Katie a candy company before Tim you know I'm not sure I've actually ever toured one i when I was out on the road with OD paste once we went to a chocolate factory but I think all we did was go into the gift shop yeah we've been told our facility when people come in it's like Willy Wonka on steroids like the river those are in the secret room you didn't get to see that part takes a lot of envelope positive gummies let me it's interesting I remember growing up up in wheatridge where the Jolly Rancher factory was at and they used to take us on tours as kids and to see the differences between having infused then and not having infused is so so minimal in so many ways anyway I love seeing I loved seeing your facilities beautiful place to work I bet I know you got a love work in there absolutely I do wanna is a really great place to work you know I've been company almost three years now and just the right that we've grown has been really phenomenal and I just I can't say enough about the culture and the company it's it's just a really good place to be so so are you guys you guys how is the other states moving to the other states treating you guys so far it is working out really well for us we've been in Oregon for a little over a year now and we are just launching in Las Vegas so it's super exciting we've actually got some people up there this week who have been doing a lot of events and press for us I'm not sure exactly how many stores were in yet because they're their recreational still kind of Rolly now goes a little different than it is here in Colorado yeah I but it's going over really well we're receiving a really good response from all of our products so those two states so we're definitely in we've got some plans to roll out some other ones this year most notably I think Illinois is probably going to be the first one it's gonna be a medical only that will be in by the end of the year we've got some other things working on the East Coast you know it's just a lot of framework with the regulations and especially the new states that were just voted in with my selection yeah yeah but yeah we're moving on and it's it's been a really good experience for us I love watching how you guys have grown I think you guys have been you have set the precedent and represented you know a boulder company or being you know considered a boulder company you know I mean there's the Denver companies that the boulder companies I think that you've completely represented out there well in the spirit of growing and doing things you guys have new some new products that are coming out absolutely it's been a busy first quarter of 2017 for us yeah it has been you know we really this year's really the year that we really wanted to move forward and just roll out the new products and so most notably we relaunched our jewels which is this candy right here and what's really great about those is when we were able to bring those back after the regulation changes that happened last year here in Colorado we were able to bring them back with a five milligram dosage as opposed to a ten milligram dosage like our gummies are in a lot of people really really like that lower dosage one thing you get to eat more so that's great and then also you know it gives you that more consistency and the hard candies are always really popular because you get a little bit that sublingual kind of dosing you know as opposed to the full digestive gonna suck on it for a while that's right gotta have something to suck on you know they're they're awesome I have so many friends that enjoy having the jewels enjoyed having the jewels before they had to be changing around I think that I wouldn't encourage my friends at work to be high but if you're one of those people that needs to medicate during the day while you're at work it's a great discreet way it's a great dis yeah absolutely and so those have been really great we were really excited to bring those out along with our newest flavor of the gummies blueberry and as we affectionately call him the bloops but you know this this product has a really interesting backstory to it how we came up with the flavor formulation so these are all the same flavor here yes they are very berry and what was really interesting on how we came up with this formulation was last fall I heard you guys talking about Tony Romo in the Broncos earlier well we actually did a special edition gummy flavor during the football season we called him game days he did yeah and what we used with that formulation we already had an orange flavor that we had in our regular game they say it's like little footballs I wish yeah there's a regulation against that unfortunately yeah that could be appealing to children yeah so we we formulated the blueberry to go along with the orange so that we could have the orange and blue theme going on right well what happened was that they were so well received and everyone was so excited because the blueberry was a new flavor go Broncos yeah well I just have to say so keep going absolutely they were so well received that even after the blue after the football season you know the I guess officially over with for the Broncos was after pre playoffs but so we ran those through Super Bowl and we received such a great response to the blue berry that we brought it out in its own flavor now so it's our newest flavor we've had those about two or three weeks now yeah I'm super popular it's a great fruity flavor you know it's not like a blue raspberry candy kind of fake taste or anything really baby we carry more at Colorado Arms Company I bought myself a pack I came over here and I gave some to my friends I'm not gonna lie I gave some I think I I think I gave two to a couple people but one to most people mm-hmm everybody loved the flavor glad to hear that they like said they've been really popular it's been kind of really awesome because I've had a lot of people who've always liked our watermelon flavor and they're now they're blueberry converts yeah exciting well yeah what's coming down the pipeline the rest of the year what's the next quarter got in store for you Oh lots of new products still coming out saw my son they're still in the R&D stage some are actually you know we've got them set into production we're gonna be dipping our toes into the land of CBD so we've been asked for a very very long time to come out with a formulation because our gummies are so popular with CBD and the head of THC that is hopefully the next product line that will come out we're really excited about that because we really want to be able to offer a CBD option to both medical and recreational patients at an affordable price point and you know with our research into the CBD market that's what we've kind of found is that the the pricing is not really affordable out there for a lot of patients but a lot of customers yeah uh people want to try it but you know he wants to you know spend a hundred ollars to try something here you know totally yep so yeah that um we're really looking forward to having a kind of a low-cost um CBD gummy option and that will or won't get you high we usually not we actually that you can't you you never know and that there's a chance that it can so if you're worried about it then don't [ __ ] do it but for the most part CBD mostly reacts with at least a tad bit of THC that's why it's gonna be available for the most part in dispensaries you can get it through the mail and stuff it's just pure CBD from a lot of different folks but I think that the way that the the companies that are established within the industry are gonna be able to implement the little bit of necessary THC is probably gonna be pretty vital absolutely and you know we're there's still so much to learn about you know the Kaminoans in marijuana you know we obviously you know know a lot more about THC than we do any of the other ones CBD you know is part of the plant naturally it occurs in there so you know nature knows what it's doing those were actually put in there to work together you know simultaneously um you know we're still you know trying to figure out the perfect ratios for you know how much you know THC you need so you know that's still an experiment but yeah they are complementary to each other but CBD does have a lot of properties that we know of so far that THC doesn't right um it's very it's very good for as anti-inflammatory it's so you know a lot of like pain and chronic conditions actually come from inflammation in the body the CBD definitely you know can almost be billed as you know a superfood in that matter because you know tumeric and all the other superfoods we hear about you know that our anti-inflammatory CBDs right up there with them yeah it's a very calming effect and it actually has a lot more effect for pain relief then THC does and you don't get that you know you don't get that heady high you don't get that you know sighs I'm at you know that the whole thing and you know people don't like to feel high you just want to feel relief and I think that's a lot it will seek out cted for that and I think that they're gonna be refining the entourage effect and refining it over and over to figure out what cannabinoids and what elements of THC can work together to be able to help out with that ailment or that I mean I know that the entourage effect had been brought up downtown this last week week I think it was actually Monday in regards to PTSD being added to the list of conditions so that's we know so where are we add on that when is that gonna happen you know I haven't heard read through all the legislation I generally when they pass these things they usually go into effect later the same year or the next year yeah usually ill I got I know into the past all the you know we always get hit in October whenever they changes this is actually a good change this is a change that we're looking forward to it's a necessary one I think it's absolutely a necessary one and I think that you know one thing that is really important here in Colorado to our medical program is having you know enough patients to feed the program because the way our legislation works around you know the particular was with medical and plants and growing and all that good stuff but I think what's really going to help us I think it's almost like a shot in the arm to the medical industry Amber Alert lose its vehicle I kept hearing the beeping like the siren and I was like what is going on like we just go through Amber Alert Amber Alert it's hilarious to me happens all the time I know that the PTSD thing is gonna be really really cool be for wanna because you guys are teamed up to bit a bit more with Grover vets and what mhm absolutely and you know just like just to follow up with that I think for Colorado it's really going to be a much needed well I mean just the fact that we have such a so many military bases and such a military presence on Colorado I think we have a lot of vets living here and obviously I'm you know PTSD could happen to anyone but we most associated that you know with the military service so I think just opening that and you know that expansion for those people is really going to be huge not only for the patients but for the industry in general it's much needed totally totally agreed I think that the veterans play a key part in the research in the in the coming years of cannabis because they think there will be a lot that will be coming back from all of the war times and whatnot that we'll have to kind of show and use as examples of how beneficial it is to gifts and recognition to you as well women's day thank you yeah you know it this is something else guys learn about the day of Valentine's Day they give you a heads up I just tagged my wife on Instagram just like an hour ago or less you know it's funny story actually saw something they were a lot of news and stuff we're encouraging women to take the day off kind of making it like a day without women kind of can't just like like working women can I get the the protest point of it but it seems like and I know like I think it was the Washington Post or somebody who had the article this morning like it's just turning out to be a privileged woman's day off because actually women they need the money can't just take a day off of work amen yeah I actually saw that like at some school district um I can't remember somewhere on the East Coast they had so many teachers who would request the day off that they had to actually get close schoolers apparently they took it pretty seriously there I wanted to know initially bringing this up what is it like to be a strong woman in this industry I think that it was beneficial for you to be here today because you are one of the strong women there we have a lot of really good women friends that are leaders and shakers and movers in the cannabis industry what is it like in their shoes that way you know honestly it's right it's really kind of amazing because when I got into this industry I really had no understanding of how there were in this industry and you know working from the side I work you know as a vendor you know I guess I have the privilege of working with so many dispensaries and so many dispensary groups and owners and so forth there's an amazing number of women who actually own marijuana companies our owner is I all right our Nancy Whiteman is you know obviously a woman and so sweet - wonderful and but you know there's there's a lot of women who actually own businesses and you know there's a there's actually a group called women grow that's a women's networking group for men who work in the marijuana industry and you know all things all data considered and everything the cannabis industry is actually being billed as the first industry where women are going to be more dominant as business owners as you know Chiefs and officers then you know any other industry we know I mean you look at the tech industry you look at the steel you look at you know pharmaceutical all those you know are very dominated by men and so you know we're poised to be you know the first industry that actually you know has more women you know than men possibly you know in those hiring positions and I think she's a lady is KITT the lady cannabis would want it you know what I mean I think well you know we cannabis in general it's the girl you know we all know the female plant we always go after that you know it's only fitting you know that it is an industry that you know does empower women the way it does so for me it's been a really really great experience mostly because you know I've not experienced so many of those barriers as opposed to other industries that I may have in the past but also just getting to know which is all they're really just badass women in this industry like the girls that women grow I love those yeah for sure but it's it's yeah it's very fitting drew gets the award for a question of the year right there have to end it on that one but job real quick where can we find you online wanna brands calm okay yep we've got all of our products on there we've got all the different states we're in if you want to chat with us you can send us an email give us a call

subscriber thank you so much and welcome back so today I'm going to be doing a sugar-free can of butter gummy candy recipe that's mouthful uh and so for all those people who diabetic or don't like sugar or on a healthier on a healthier version this is a healthier version of a gummy bear for you so I don't really have much more to say all the instructions and everything or coming forward so what about further ado we'll just get started okay so what we're going to need for our sugar-free cannabutter gummy candies is three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of sugar-free jell-o for our liquids you can either just use real lemon juice you could use these flavored waters that have no sugar or any juice that has no sugar at it and you can just use water and for additional sweetness we can add in some honey or you're gonna need a half a teaspoon of gorga a half a teaspoon of citric acid a quarter to a third of a cup of canned butter melted can of butter and if you want additional colors or flavors you can add those in as well you can use the the oil base or the gel based flavors the equipment that you're going to need obviously your mold whatever molds you want to use a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler any pot small pot and metal bowl that fits you know you don't want it to touch the bottom so you want it to have enough room and that you can do a makeshift double boiler you're gonna need a bowl for blooming your gelatin something to disperse your syrup so you can knead these bottles are great because they've got these tips these piping tips on them which makes it really nice for dispersing however any squeeze bottle or dropper will work measuring spoon a lips a hand blender if you don't have a hand blender a whisk and a very strong forearm and that's about everything obviously spatula and I think that's everything that we need to get started so we'll put all the ingredients together and go over the measurements so the first things that we need to do is we're going to turn our heat on to the lowest we just want to get the water hot once it's hot you can turn it off and next we are going to bloom our gelatin so you're going to need 1/2 a cup of your liquid and three tablespoons of your gelatin you want to evenly sprinkle it over the top and then you want to make sure to stir it in then stir it up so that there's no lumps and then you're going to set that aside for five minutes to let it bloom next you're going to take a quarter cup of your liquid and you're going to microwave it for a minute or minute and 20 seconds until boiling your going to add your sugar free jello to your double boiler and you're going to add that quarter cup of boiled liquid in and you're going to stir it up until your gelatin or - your jello is dissolved and while that's melting if you want to this is when you can you would add in two tablespoons of honey if you want to add some additional sweetness to it now if you don't like the taste of honey I'm gonna say don't do it because you are gonna have that bitter taste of honey pour it in it and you also want to add in a half a teaspoon of citric acid try not to get it on your spoon like I just did you actually want it in the pot and you'll just continue to stir that gently until everything is dissolved now that everything is dissolved we can add in our unflavored gelatin so what I like to do is time to split it up in the bowl like this so it's all in pieces and it it'll dissolve quicker and you're just going to stir that in until that is completely melted now this should be warm enough to melt the gelatin but if you find that it isn't melting you can put it back on the heat for a few minutes so I had to add mine back on the heat there because it wasn't melt melting it was actually starting to solidify so I'm just got that back on the heat so that it's melting now if you've got a bunch of jell-o and gelatin stuff stuck around the sides and you can't get it off but you can just use is hot hot water and a brush then you can just easily then wash it off wash it down into the pot now that everything is melted and all dissolved now we can add in our canna butter and our Garg um so just dump in your butter your can of butter actually add in 1/2 a teaspoon of Garga now if you have one of these little strainers it's great because you can use it makes it eat nice to just evenly distribute across the top if not just try and make sure you kind of sprinkle evenly across the top of it and once all that's on you're gonna let it sit for a minute and then we're gonna get our trusty little hand blender or our whisk and now we'll get our trusty hand blender and start blending [Applause] [Music] once you're fully mixed you just want to let stir it gently so we can start to work out some of those air bubbles and we're just gonna let it sit for a couple of minutes now at this point once everything's done and incorporated if you want to add in any additional flavor or color this is when you can do it so I'm just gonna add in a little bit more red to up that red a bit and I get this no taste red because I hate the test a taste of red food coloring and Wilton's makes this no taste red which is great the only problem is is it doesn't really give you the same intensity red as the regular red does but I'd rather forsake a little bit of the color for the taste because I really don't like that kind of bitter taste that red has and next I you can use ready to pour into your bottle or you can just use your eyedropper to distribute it into your molds and we're just gonna do that next and now you just distribute into the molds and the things you don't want to fill up the mold all the way you want to just leave it a little bit of the a little bit of the edge there otherwise it creates a sharp edge on your candies so and and it tends to dry out so it's not very it doesn't make it very nice so you want to keep it just below the below the top and once you fill up your molds you're gonna put it into the fridge for 20 to 40 minutes or until they're set another thing you want to try to pour right into the center of the mold and let it distribute it I know some of them you can't they have to be little feet or legs or tails but if you can otherwise the reason is again it's not it causes it won't stick to the sides and cause that edge and if you've made these before and have done it to the top you have that kind of sharp rigid edge that always dries out and it just doesn't make your candy very pleasant that's the reason all right so I'm gonna put these into the fridge to set by the feel of it it feels pretty like it's already starting to set so probably 20 minutes is all they're gonna need now if you want your candies to have a go back to the clear more clear looking what you can do is just put it on to the heat on low heat for a few minutes and the air bubbles and that will work out and it'll go back to that clear that clear look all right so they've been studying for 20 minutes they're ready to come out now so what you want to do is lay some parchment paper down on a wire rack what I like to do is I like to poke holes into my parchment paper so that way I can get air coming up through the bottom as well just hit this with driving don't have to is just something that I do and you're just gonna stand your little gummies up if you can some will stand some won't that's it you're gonna just leave them out to dry for anywhere from 24 to 48 hours there's your gummies your sugar-free gummies see there's one that we let's that I let sit on the heat for a little while let the air bubbles come out of it and that's it there you go sugarfree gummy bears cannabutter sugarfree gummy bears gotta make that clear all right let's get one of these little bad boys a try so just like a regular gummy bear or gummy candy no difference there okay all right tastes really good so it's really going to be dependent your taste be a big factor on the liquid that you use so you definitely want to use something that does have a lot of flavor or definitely your favorite juice no sugar added juice probably those nectars are good again if you're diabetic I'm not sure about that sugar contact I know there's not extra sugar added but I don't know how much regular sugar like natural sugars are in there if that's good or not but that may be an option as well if you do though use a nectar or any kind of real fruit juice I would recommend using mold inhibitor lorraine's makes a mold inhibitor that you can order online you may be able to get it in your specialty store and if you're using any type of real juice or real fruits in your gummies all right so that's about all as well I hope you enjoyed it if this is the

that no no I took it I took it later in life I don't think it's I think most of these psychedelics where you have bad experiences what you're having is your own psychological dilemma and then your battle with whatever the the drug or the psychedelic is trying to do to you versus what your ego is trying to control and keep it from happening I mean I've seen a lot of people have bad trips on some of the worst trips I've ever seen people have was from edible pot edible pot is one of the strongest things that people don't recognize mm-hmm it's it's a very different drug than smoking it and when you know you when you think of things that can take you down the rabbit hole you don't think of edible pot people think of pot is just like oh you're gonna get a high maybe you can get too high but you're just getting high but boom when you eat it it's a completely different animal yeah literally like physiologically it's a different really yeah it's create something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than THC and what it's like not even psychoactive in smoking it it's a different drug that's a little different totally different drug that makes complete sense yeah it's a different drug it's processed by your liver well there's something called the one pass that passes through your liver and the THC gets processed into eleven hydroxy metabolites Google it's trippy [ __ ] I've way stronger registered on some Micro dos versions of mushrooms that I have to add two of them and they were it was great it just made things a little bit brighter have you ever microdose yes you know does that all-time hey white oh really Ron white so micro dosing [ __ ] yeah cuz I'm on this new drug it's called mushrooms and I just take a little bit every day woah yeah I

amazes me about these casual guy gummies they just taste so much like the fruit they're made out of and then very often is the case as is in the case with this that they are actually made with a fair amount of grape juice or you know some natural flavoring they're very very very dark though hey look hot all this being said uh grape is not my favorite flavor i am much fonder of this particular grape than i am however of you know that fake grape pop tasting stuff this is much better i'm going to give castle guy grape gummies a three out of five now if you're the person who likes grape you

it's getting really messy my taste buds are going crazy guys it's sweet its sour spicy I don't know if I got extra spicy might looks redder than you guys I think a lot of people would be intimidated by this drink because it's literally like hot sauce and mangoes and that's what you're drinking but it's so good guys you have to try it it's worth it I like it a lot like probably more than boa more than Bobo says she spends all of her money on Bobo so guys ciao mango gets a thumbs up from Rosie and me pretty sure what do you think um thumbs up for the straw she already ate okay next we have sabotage several I've been waiting to eat this okay so that's like puffed wheat snack and this is gonna be spicy guys love me are you ready for more spicy stuff by Z and sours like black pepper and pork skins but it's week that's what it's this is a new favorite it doesn't have a lot of flavor besides just like salad I just like the texture like it's really crunchy well this would be a good guess my so what do you guys think of Sabri tonus okay that's what you call I wish I had more flavor like if it was a bit more flavor like maybe some garlic in there onions I think that's what we're

later Rosie that's gross stop it but they're making Coco Bandera into play-doh all right it's really moldable moving on to the next snack next we have the really popular Mako this is probably the

try in the comments below and until next time bye [Music]", "pUhJnKKQDTE": "as marijuana becomes legalized throughout North America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the munchies? check out our AsAP stop video that breaks down the science behind that by clicking the screen or using the link in the description and subscribe for more weekly science videos every Thursday", "Jcd1EG0JuFA": "how long are a so SOS air and today we're bringing it far Kubat hate we we've upgraded one more level from the last video you see of this the sheriff Maxima from iridium Bharath come and scrape back at you with a box [Laughter] you are right people 1000 milligrams cool off in a big giant mother a buzzing with his people I Italia honestly finally got there which slowly slowly the box will be improved but everything takes time look at the size of dice good day you know what we want to do that yet ripping it up oh you can't so what I'll do is I'll be there you are as our pumps ego he's little patch", "lDqiO2Bmrmg": "it's dominik here the mother you need to cap this time we're doing a child bestel special yes dolphin go um oh I'm gonna do is gonna put three Suites leave Leave leave oi um up its way down three of them no no yeah I'm rubber spits them out loses hey in me like and like comment and subscribe go really ok ah this is how it looks like I got this woman looks like okay on three not put a minute and get in the camera haha ok I'm 303 did one now go you can big-goblin you just wanna get ready one two three go what I don't want it do it Thank You way to do oh yeah I with you how much you get 0 0 Rayna ok I'm serious and 1 2 3 haha well all over me about ready go yo face my eyes burning good sorry now we spit it out I on my skin Paris that's it for today to do oh my god you gotta follow me on instagram at Dominic got the fever tae guys hey I don't know like comment subscribe to this channel peace", "9eUIhvGKKiI": "Hey there! Welcome to Life Noggin! Oh there's a fog rolling in! Wait a minute! [Blocko Sniffs] That's not fog! People have been using cannabis as a sleep\naid for decades, mainly due to the feeling of relaxation and calm it\u2019s commonly associated\nwith. And many believe that it can even help with\nsleep disorders. Studies evaluating the effect of cannabis\non sleep go back to the 70\u2019s, but, because marijuana use has been illegal in the United\nStates since the 30s, research in this field has been largely restricted, and we are still\nlacking verifiable evidence of its effects on health. But scientists have been studying its main\nchemical components for the treatment of many medical issues, like the nausea caused by\ncancer treatments, seizures in children, pain and different sleep disorders. Before we get into how it affects your sleep,\nwe should probably talk about how it all works. What we call weed, pot, or marijuana is actually\na mixture of the dried flowers of the Cannabis sativa plant. It can be smoked, vaped, brewed in teas, made\ninto foods, or concentrated into resins and oils. No matter how you take it, the chemicals in\nthe plant will make their way into your bloodstream, travel throughout your body, and end up in\nyour brain. How fast you feel the effects and how strong\nthey are depends on the method of ingestion. And your experiences can range from relaxation\nand euphoria, to anxiety, fear and panic depending on how much you take and the potency\nof the drug\u2019s active chemicals., Some who have taken large doses have even experienced\na temporary psychosis, including hallucinations and delusions. So it\u2019s really, really important to be careful\nwith how much you\u2019re taking and how. And cannabis use has been associated with\nharmful side effects on brain development and the lungs, and can even result in addiction. The main chemical in cannabis is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol\n- but you can call it THC. THC is a psychoactive chemical, which means\nthat it can alter your mind. It does this by attaching to neurons in your\nbrain and activating them. This disrupts normal mental and physical functions,\ncausing the sensations typically associated a \u201chigh\u201d. Cannabis also contains another chemical that\nis not psychoactive, called cannabidiol, or CBD. Older studies looking at the effect of the\nwhole cannabis plant on sleep had mixed findings, with some indicating that it can help you\nfall asleep faster and stay asleep, and others showing it can decrease REM sleep,, - which\nis thought to be involved with storing memories, learning, and regulating your mood. More recent studies focus on these major chemicals\nin cannabis, THC and CBD. They found that THC may only have a short-term\nbenefit, with continuous use causing a habit or dependency, as withdrawal from the drug\ncan cause difficulties sleeping.,, Studies also found that THC caused daytime\nsleepiness and bad moods, increased the time to fall asleep, and reduced the body\u2019s circadian\nrhythm - which is needed to regulate your sleep/wake cycle. However, medicines made from it could help\nwith certain sleep disorders like nightmares associated with post-traumatic stress disorder\nand obstructive sleep apnea. It\u2019s clear that more research needs to be\ndone before any definitive conclusions can be made. But, until then, it may be better to stick\nto natural sleep methods like avoiding caffeine, exercising, and keeping a regular sleep schedule.", "DGlNc6tjTT8": "the cannabis edible one of the many glorious ways to consume cannabis they're tasty they're filling and best of all they get you high so you've been thinking about trying a cannabis edible for the first time to see what all the hype is about you should know that eating cannabis edibles to party your relaxed can be a fun and rewarding experience but remember THC does have the ability to intoxicate and should therefore like anything else be used responsibly I have before us the ultimate guide of all you need to know to guarantee an awesome edible experience ladies and gentlemen I give you the puffs puffs posts official guide to edibles I shall start us off with a story that is all too common among so many edible users and me Gwen Gwen wants to try cannabis edibles for the first time and enjoy a healthy dose of THC with her friends tonight she's inedible and eagerly awaits the euphoric effects she waits and waits expecting to feel something at any moment a full hour goes by and still no feeling of a cannabis hi she waits and waits another full hour still nothing by now Gwen is growing impatient and suspects that the edibles she ate just aren't potent enough for her she eats another edible this one should do the trick no more than five minutes go by and suddenly Gwen is hit with a full-frontal TC sensation she is consumed too much and the effects are overwhelming her she spends the rest of what should have been a fun night feeling over intoxicated what went wrong here did the edibles do this - Gwen or an a momentary lapse of preparation did Gwen do this to herself to find out what happened here we need to delve into the rules of edible consumption and examine just how Gwen broke these rules rule 1 know your notes unlike alcohol cannabis THC is a very safe non-toxic substance with no known lethal dose however much like alcohol when somebody ingests more than they can handle there can be some undesirable side effects excess of THC beyond one's threshold can result in a temporary increase of anxiety agitation elevated heart rate or even vomiting one of the biggest mistakes when made right off the bat was eating a cannabis edible without inquiring what the dose was one thing to remember for your first time is to start low and slow with a more manageable 20 milligrams of THC eaten will give you higher than 20 milligrams of TC smoked so you may have to dial your usual dosage back of it most health experts recommend a conservative 5 to 10 milligrams of THC to start you off just because your party animal friend can down cannabis animals like their potato chips and function fine doesn't mean you should immediately follow suit understand that everybody has different limitations when it comes to metabolizing THC the process of knowing your dose is crucial to gauge how much TC you can consume comfortably without erling yourself into a sour experience know your limits stay within it rule to wait just wait there is a difference between smoking and eating cannabis when cannabis is smoked your lungs absorb the cannabis right away and you feel the high instantly but when you eat cannabis it is processed through the liver and may take anywhere between one to two hours to feel the full effects another one of Gwen's many errors was failing to recognize this waiting period she mistook the delayed process of the edible digestion as it being ineffective in doing so she overcompensated by doubling her dose unnecessarily now any negative sensations she feels off the first edible will compound two hours later when she fully digest the second one she what when should have done was relaxed sit back eat Cheetos and let the edible run its full course so if you take an edible and you were waiting to feel for its effects but they never seem to arrive don't worry just wait some more give your body the appropriate amount of time to fully digest the edible and then decide whether or not you want more THC in your system rule 3 know what to expect so you've taken the appropriate dosage that best suits you and you've exercised patience and waiting for the substance to run its course good job the effects kick in the process of liver digestion is much more thorough than lung intake and your body will therefore absorb more properties from the cannabis at best you may feel a very cozy and content feeling or experience a heightened libido and increase sensuality rule 4 there is a time and place for edibles especially if it's your first time try not to drink alcohol while on edibles whose can magnify the effects of THC potentially making the user too hot I also would not recommend driving working or operating machinery after you take them since they can't intoxicate you instead it may be wise to reserved an entire day set aside for them like maybe the weekend or on a date you can just sit back and relax these conditions are optimal because you can feel the effects of an edible six to eight hours after ingesting them so be ready for a long day of fun taking an edible before you go to bed is also an option since the effects can combat insomnia for many people just like baby pictures and recounting your last trip to Las Vegas there is a time and a place for edibles so I hope you learned a thing or two from our guy remember when trying any new substance do your research find out the ideal dose for you educate yourself on what you can expect to feel and know when the best time to consume them is with all that being said I wish you all the best of trips follow these rules and I can guarantee you a safe and fun edible experience every time

taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste of a spring break danger you", "3XCHoEynnoY": "I'm gonna take you through the shopping do's and don'ts of CBD skincare what to look for what to avoid and I'm going to be reviewing my top favorite CBD skincare products and of course being will be joining us this is cheddar cheese bean or bean for short he is our little rescue job that we got 5 years ago and it makes sense for our CBD film because he also takes CBD CBD that I got from healthy spot but before we dive into the shopping do's and don'ts of stephenie's skincare I just want to run down a few of the CBD basics for you guys and don't worry this is gonna be fun and cute and brief so CBD is just one of 80 different cannabinoids found in the hemp and cannabis plants and the way that it works is the CBD cannabinoid it attaches to different receptors in the body and it works to create homeostasis so homeostasis is just kind of a fancy word for saying balance or equilibrium so if we have all this inflammation in our bodies the CBD attaches to receptors and just tries to bring everything in line so that it's in balance again how cool is that right so cool and this is why it's DVD is everywhere in the beauty world because inflammation really is at the heart of a lot of different skin issues like acne rosacea dermatitis redness in the skin or blotchiness and so CBD is able to help with all of those so let's jump into my shopping do's and don'ts for CBD skincare my first shopping do is to opt for full-spectrum or buff broad-spectrum and the reason is because full-spectrum just means that they've taken the entire plant and they've put it into the product so that means leaves stem flowers possibly seeds stalks everything is in there and so in addition to getting these beautiful cannabinoids like CBD you're also all of the powerful antioxidant properties within the plant itself you're getting the omega-3s you're getting the terpenes which are the essential oils of the plant you're getting the flavonoids which have insane antioxidant properties and you want all that together because those components when paired with the CBD have synergistic powers they work together to create a more powerful anti-inflammatory result but the thing with full spectrum is that it does contain a little bit of THC so if the product is a hemp product it's gonna have less than 0.3 percent THC if it's a cannabis product and it's full spectrum it's gonna have anywhere from 3 to 35 percent THC and I know there are some people out there that are wary about THC and just want a product that doesn't have it at all even though it's not gonna hurt you if anything it also has positive benefits too but I do know that some people just want to avoid it and if that's the case then you want to opt for what's called broad spectrum and broad spectrum is essentially the same as full spectrum they use the entire plant when creating the product so you're getting all of those antioxidant benefits from the plant and you're getting the cannabinoids but they go in and they extract the THC so that there's zero THC my next shopping do is do buy sustainably source organic product and I'm not one of those like preachers saying you have to have everything organic but when it comes to CBD products you really want to be very mindful of the sourcing and make sure that it's as clean sourcing as possible because and cannabis plants are called phyto remedial plants and what that means is that they are soil cleaners so they pull out all of the heavy metals and any chemicals that are in the soil and they absorb so if you are using a CBD product that doesn't have clean and good sourcing you know the plant is gonna have all of those pesticides all of those you know chemicals and the fertilizer and then you yourself are gonna be ingesting that now my first shopping don't is don't buy isolate and you're probably wondering what isolate a me well an isolate is where they go in and they extract just the CBD from the plant they take it out and drop it into some coconut oil or some kind of carrier oil and these products are substantially cheaper than broad spectrum and full-spectrum products but they're not gonna be as effective and the reason is because when you're just going in and you're taking out the CBD yes you still have the CBD but you're leaving behind like I said all the flavonoids the terpenes the omega-3 is all the beautiful rich antioxidants in the plant that works synergistically with the CBD you're leaving behind people are probably asking well then why do they even make isolates cuz it's cheaper because it's easier when you're just extracting CBD it's so much easier to measure how much CBD you're putting into your carrier oil then if you compress all the plant matter and you have to try to measure out the THC in there this the CBD that's in there along with other cannabinoids and antioxidants that are in there it's much more difficult and it's more time consuming to do that now my last shopping don't is don't be afraid of products made from the cannabis plant I feel in our culture there has been a long history of stigmatizing cannabis Oana but when it comes to CVD skincare the cannabis plant is so powerful it has more resin on it that's really rich in CBD than the hemp plant and so to get the same levels of CBD in hemp products they have to use just a lot more of the hemp plant I just recommend if you're open to trying them dabble in it try it I highly recommend it so that wraps up my shopping do's and don'ts for CBD skincare and now I'm gonna dive into some products that I've been testing and highly recommend so the first brand that I'm gonna recommend is this brand called flora and fast and they will be getting the organic certification later this year it is a beautiful brand that makes CBD products from cannabis and I have been testing out their age adapting facial serum which I freaking love so much I like to use it very very liberally at night I'll apply almost a full dropper to my face it's very smooth and a light oil it does not absorb fast so you're gonna have oil on your face which is why I like to use it at night and then I'm used my Gua Sha and I'll massage my face and it's so amazing I wake up in the morning and my skin is brighter redness is reducer on my chin and my nostrils almost overnight it just sues that inflammation and it feels so good does not clog my pores whatsoever makes my skin feel very very hydrated and I just I just I love this product so if you're open to trying a CBD skincare product that's made from the cannabis plant I highly recommend checking out flora and bast so this is their topical one and then the relief potion this is a sublingual product and it has like a cute little pump pump here and you just do like a couple pumps under your tongue I like this for during the day it makes me feel like very relaxed and it just helps with my anxiety so again if you're looking into CBD products and you're open to try and once from the cannabis space definitely try out flora and fast and I've linked it up down below because I do have a discount code for you guys 420 off from floor and baths if you're interested in checking it out and they also are available now at Sephora now the second brand that I'm gonna recommend is Lord Jones and you may have seen this brand because they are available in Sephora also and there's two products of theirs that I've been testing out there royal oil which is for the face and there's body oil now the royal oil has about 10 times as much CBD as the body oil which is why it's more expensive this one is about a hundred dollars this is 66 but I've actually seen really great benefits from using the body oil on my face and I would have to say between the two based on price and results I would actually go with the body oil I feel like it's a better value I don't know hundred dollars for it versus this I feel like works just as well and it's sixty six dollars I say go for the body oil now it has a rollerball which I really love for application and I just roll out at night or sometimes I do it like a few little dabs and then kind of Pat it in for the day but this brand is fantastic if you want to avoid THC completely because it's a broad spectrum brand so if you're looking for broad spectrum this is the brand to check out now the last product that I'm gonna recommend is from this brand two cranes which I absolutely love products sustainably sourced it's grown in Denver Colorado and this is an ingestible product you just take a dropper I do about a full I'd say like I do three-quarters of a dropper and do it underneath my tongue every morning and it has helped so much with my stress and my anxiety and as you guys know stress and anxiety play a huge role in how our skin looks and how it feels so I really love taking this one in the morning and I love taking it before I could have any kind of social engagement I have social anxiety I know you're probably thinking that's kind of strange because I'm so outgoing and talkative with you guys here but I have a tendency to Oh like overanalyzed myself like kind of question like oh my god did I sound stupid like why did I say that or what did that person think of this and like freaked myself out but since I have discovered this two cranes product like I don't have it anymore I take a dropper before I go to meet Fred I just feel relaxed I feel calm I feel present I feel clear and I just feel like I can be myself without having this like chatter in my brain that's constantly causing me to question things so that has been a really huge game-changer for me and I highly recommend this for anyone who is looking for a CBD product to use during the day for anxiety is it doesn't give me any like physical heaviness some other CBD products that I have tried make me feel mentally and physically relaxed which is not great if you want to get done during the day so those I really am saving for the next video where I'm gonna be talking about the best CBD products for sleeping that's it guys um thank you so much for watching this video you like this video give it a big thumbs up it helps me get my videos visible and out there into the you
