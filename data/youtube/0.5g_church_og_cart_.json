{"-gdysmn5LEE": "well Aloha brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel it's your man Kimo back to do another review for all you cannabis enthusiasts and connoisseurs out there this time I've got a 5-10 thread of a cartridge coming to you from Palmetto cannabis that's sundial cannabis company it's agent orange it's a sativa hybrid stream it's coming in at 800 milligrams THC and one point two six milligrams of CBD so that's about 80% THC and less than a percent CBD so it's gonna be a high THC heavy-hitting cartridge really excited when I bought this I'm gonna admit I cheated a little bit I did buy it a few days ago and I was excited to try to open it up I've been faking it the last few days stuck it back in the cart in the container here to show you the package I'm gonna hate this packaging it's awful I'll show you on the front it shows to open the package you push it on the sides and you push open the top it's easier said than done like I was pushing pushing pushing I'm glad I didn't record the initial truck time I opened this package because it was real futile effort took me a while but after a while I just find out that usually if you play enough pressure on the sides and push in and pop you can open this packaging is horrible I can't stand the packaging and then when you do open it up you got your car to gene there it's nestled nice and safe away in this foam little cutout but it's straight through for me because you want the orientation of your cartridge to be upright and by having it designed in here you know this is probably gonna sit on the shelf like this or like this and your oils gonna be you know on the side it's gonna potentially clog or plummet your device not a cool design choice Palmetto I don't like that at all you know and strike three for me is this packaging big hard plastic and flung away what do you need all this packaging for this little device I don't like it you know it's it's horrible to me so packaging no good Paul metal so once you open it up though you do get this lovely little cartridge hopefully that's coming in nice and clear you see it says Agent Orange on the bottom and what I think is a really cool retro font I'd it the big bold letters you see the oil in there it is pretty dark doesn't move around a lot as you can see I've aped a lot of this the last few days it's a little dark almost kind of orange I'm wondering if the glass is actually tinted orange to go with the whole Agent Orange vibe I don't know let's get these rubber nubs off here with a mouthpiece condom get the battery put it on we're gonna vape a little bit here I've been vaping a lot of this I got some opinions on it but let's just take a rip right now as you can see is not a lot of vapor production it's not like a lot but it's enough gets the job done it is a little harsh so you can tell you're taking a drag that's one of the downsides to it after about four or five drags it gets a little harsh on the throat and I have coughed a little bit using this over the last few days but the taste you do get you're expecting orange oh you're expecting well Agent Orange gonna be citrusy orange II yeah not so much there's a little bit of a citrusy orange on the inhale and on the exhale it's a little tiny bit is there but it's mostly a kind of spicy peppery flavor cannabis flavor mixed in with the orange so it's a little bit sick you see with kind of spicy on the inhale on the exhale you lose a little of citrus and it's mostly just kind of a spicy peppery flavor it's not bad it's just not orange or really citrusy it's alright but like I said it's a little harsh so if you're going if you're really reefing on it you could COFF a little bit and you might feel a little irritation in your throat that's kind of the negatives the positives are the effects this this hits really good I find it to be a bit of a creeper strain don't really notice the effects for about 10-15 minutes and then all of a sudden you feel a Deadhead band effect come on and it comes down over and your smile comes up and I travels down your body and you feel energized and focused though like it's a really clear high you feel really focused and clear but you feel kind of happy and just like an overall general mood you're not really hi you got a bit of a headband effect but you're really focused and clear and just happy and conversational sociable it's a good get things done strains 50 times training good wakey bait string good any time stream however I will say that if you really refine it it kind of overdo it a bit start getting into you know quite a number of drags when the effects do kind of start to take over they're pretty intense at first and you know they wear off after a few minutes and they they develop into that sort of really focused clear high but you can make this pretty intense high it's kind of fun if you really want a refund get a little stone this is a great anytime babe because like I said it does dissipate into sort of a clear head in it you know certified so you're not all stony all day this this is great anytime Cape I would recommend it it's a good value it's forty five bucks I paid for it and you know it's point five grams it's gonna go about as far as any other 510 0.5 gram cartridge out there it depends on the use depends on your mileage mileage berries with you know how much you use it in your experience so thumbs up I recommend it I really like a good job Palmetto cannabis changing down packaging I can't stand your packaging I really like your cartridge I really like your oil I really like the Agent Orange pick it up if you see it it's a good deal that's the end of the review hope you all liked it leave me a comment let me know what you think that he tried it do you like it do you not

"RJ2aSj41K1g": "[Applause] [Music] [Music] Harrisburg and I'm sorry from camp recently our local country act came to the market and when you prepare to absolutely not it very much you learn elevated water Alex from the mosque is was a church to the chamber is very different from traditional cartridges and be a great innovation to the market this is Pat and this is three so do you know why we design a country that wastes from any death yes okay you know it's a bit quick do for the wait card industry also an innovation fall technology when you keep in China more pure and healthy way for clients so I'm trying various ways to achieve that for a long time so since the USA raised a new standard have Meadows we believe this all custom attitude we are definitely that to just them the PD tank X is completely for your time matters the whole you want to contact any metal parts inside so it's very healthy and keep okay happy to know that and not as your measure allows the technology innovation do you know it great okay the cartridges features the most advanced ceramic technology in our company is the four generation of the media sir McCoy ensures your quality product is delivered effectively in in fiction it's still different viscosity of Sidney Poitier see oil providing smooth and constant jobs okay thank you so much yes many of our trying they just complain about when they buy some regular gas cartridge on the market they're always that can it just happens but with our UNIX judgment in size and their dog without looking forward it is 100% more like change your eyes also won't touch any metal in size so when you use other cartridges the medical waste pollution oil so it is a quite a sex waking style when you use this countries and so the cream gas chamber here you can see the natural color of the oil you can see that it is where a chat is for customer to buy and last but honest without a faction of the heavy mantle or some regular mantis the taste will be extremely Paris especially when you add different flavors it is very a good starting point yeah okay great first up we designed a unique pattern core series it so when they connect together it looks Mohammad if you know Mom just to contact us okay see you next time bye-bye", "evWCqaf4EX4": "hello my name is Kip and I'm the account executive for Northern California and Alaska here at Jupiter research and on this week's episode I'm going to teach you how to take apart to C cell cartridges the first type of cartridge I'm gonna demonstrate for you is our glass cartridge the glass cartridge has a twist off or a threaded mouthpiece which is really easy to take off all you do is unthread the mouthpiece from the cartridge and there you have it we do not recommend refilling our glass cartridges or our plastic cartridges due to the fact that the refilling may compromise the integrity of the ceramic and therefore compromise the experience the flavor and the taste the next cartridge I'm going to demonstrate for you is our ATP or a plastic cartridge the plastic cartridge comes with a press bit mouthpiece which is camp very evident and extremely difficult to remove removing the mouthpiece could result in damaging the cartridge the mouthpiece or result in a loss of oil I'm going to try to demonstrate this by taking a pair of channellock pliers and twisting in a counterclockwise motion you will notice that it is a very difficult process and you can hear the cartridge actually being damaged and there we go it's broken the next cartridge I'm going to demonstrate is actually a pod that fits into the uno and the dart device you will see that the pod is covered by the mouthpiece and in a way that the pod fits into the mouthpiece is flush and is press fit which basically gives you no way to remove it I know a lot of you had questions regarding the refilling of C cell cartridges and the removal of the mouthpieces in conclusion C cell cartridges are not designed to be refilled in the end acade compromise the flavor the taste the potency and overall paper ization experience if you have any further questions shoot us a DM or comment below thanks for watching", "PfO_QlEVP0c": "you probably heard the same pay now or pay later and that can apply to your health as well today I'm going to focus on two words move and cap and how we keep in for exercise and healthier foods into your day easy let's go down that road [Music] hello faithful people I'm Marlene Gary is at the church right now pre-recording the Sunday service it'll be so nice where we could go back to live streaming and he will have people that can be gathering together and get in the pews and worshiping together oh we're looking forward to that today I'm going to talk to you about some things that some misconceptions about exercise and about how to eat healthy there are some things that you may or may not know that can make it easier for you so that's what we want to talk about today the first one is moving when you move you keep things flexible you keep your joints flexible you keep your muscles flexible so finding ways to vidiian moving is a big deal now you can do some of these things even when you're sitting in your chair right now while you're watching this video you could be raising your arms up and down you can be flexing your feet up and down point your toes forward put them back point them again bring them back you can be doing things like that leave her while you're sitting those things will all help just to kind of keep the blood flowing and keep circulation going those are easy anybody can do those going back to the saying of pay now or pay later and how that applies to your health you can either take the time now to take care of yourself and to do some very simple things really it's not that complicated it's a hull up here so if I can make things a little easier for you to get over that and see that there are things you can be doing now then you won't be paying for it later you can either invest the time in taking care of your health now or you can invest your time and money into taking care of your sickness later so let's start with what you're doing right this moment you're watching this video on how to get healthier don't just sit and watch it carry your phone with you your laptop put it up higher do something so that it's more eye level or carry your little tablet with you whatever you need to do whatever you're watching this on you don't have to be sitting to do it you don't have to sit and watch a movie you can get up and you can do stretches and exercises like really simple things stretching is a big one have you a cat or a dog when they first wake up what's the first thing they do they stretch because it keeps them limber it keeps them flexible it keeps the tendons flexible it keeps the joints and everything all working better if you keep them if you keep using them you've also heard the same use-it-or-lose-it well that goes for your body as well if you're not using your muscles if you're not using your joints if you're not using those parts of your body they're going to deteriorate that's just the way it is ask anybody who's ever been on bed rest for a length of time and they will tell you how miserable they feel and they're laying there and when they first get up and start walking around and moving again it's hard so if you can keep yourself in motion every day not all day but just throughout the day that will help a lot one of the things you can do is use I put the timer on your phone or on a little kitchen timer or something every 15 minutes if you can set the timer on your stove and it's a distance away from your office desk or your wherever you're sitting or in the living room and you hear that buzzer go off you're not gonna want to keep listening to that so every 15 minutes or if they're at the very most every half-hour set that timer so that you're going and having to go shut it off and then while you're up and moving just keep walking for a while one of the easiest things you can do and it requires no special equipment just some good walking shoes is all it needs is to go for a walk every day 15 minutes will make a big difference and gradually you'll start to get to a point where you can go farther you can go a little more you do a little more you don't have to run you don't have to jog just walk walk at your own pace if your pace right now is really slow that's okay it's progress and everyday you'll gain more strength and every day you can walk a little bit more a little faster and a little farther it's all about using what you have so you don't lose it if it's too rainy too windy too cold too warm now whatever reason for maybe not going outside for a walk then just do it in your house just walk back and forth between the room dancing you know what it's such an easy thing to do I mean just nobody's gonna say anything you're in your own home and if your kids laugh at you big deal tell them well I see your moves and get them gone you can dance easy small little moves you can you can do be flamboyant and you can just go all over the room whatever you want to do but that's okay you can just that's it's a fun way to do it and it lifts your mood as well and don't we all need that these days it's really important to keep your strength up one of the things you can do is if you can't get down on the floor and do a push-up do it against the wall just push yourself away from the wall and then towards the wall and just keep doing that for a while it's very important the older you get to have some upper body strength in case you were to fall and you are home alone you want to be able to get back up again another thing you can do too for that very purpose and for building stability is to sit in a chair and raise yourself up folding your arms in front of you and then sit back down again it's going to build your core muscles and it's going to give you something where you can get up and down pretty easy after a while and it's not gonna be uh-oh every time you get on a chair anymore there are a lot of videos on YouTube there are apps you can get for your phone there are ways that you can even book there are books there are DVDs I mean there's really no excuse because there are exercise programs for every level every age just if that's what it takes if you need something like that to motivate you to get your going then do it it's always more fun to do it with someone right now with the stay at home orders soon lifting somewhat we are going to be able to start getting out a little bit more doing more things with others but for now there's no reason why you can't do a yoga class with your friend and stay six feet apart the whole time I mean this whole idea of staying home was is really keeping people from seeing each other and that is I mean seeing someone is not going to spread the disease just saying so it's okay if you're six to eight feet away from someone when Gary and I go for walks we've see people out in their yards and we stop and talk to them it's we're keeping the distance we're not just spreading anything except some goodwill and just cheery talk there's nothing wrong with that so if you have someone that you like to exercise with you know if you live in a small town and you have a sidewalk on on either side of the street you and your friend can walk together on each side of the street or we've done that even we've talked to people who are on the other side of the street and we were talking to them as we were walking along with each other it can be done so if you need someone to do it with find a walking partner who can walk with you until we can get a little closer to each other there's always that really really great exercise I mean of doing steps or doing levels if you're stable enough to do them when we go someplace if there is say something on the second or third floor or even the fourth floor and we have a choice between an elevator or stairs Gary and I always take the stairs take the stairs if you can if you have them if you can do stairs then do the stairs if you don't have someone to exercise with like I mentioned in a minute ago track yourself beat you can be recording on your phone even like I record ever all of her videos are on my phone you can record yourself and your progress each day and boy you know what if you record your progress of what you did each day and you don't step on the scale don't go by that go by hon you're starting to feel so if you get get to a point where after two three weeks you start looking back on those earlier videos you're gonna see a big change and boy if that isn't a motivator to keep going so I think you got the idea moving in some way shape or form as many body parts as you can is going to help you to stay limber flexible and build strength and now we're going to talk about how to add more healthy foods into your day people are sometimes using the excuse well I don't know which diet to go on I I keep looking at all these different diets I'm confused by them I don't I don't understand what's poleo what's gluten-free what's what's Kido you know I don't understand what all those mean you fruits of vegetables see the nuts foods that are high in antioxidants high in fiber high in the things that your body your body needs to function properly limiting the processed foods I hate to break it to you but Froot Loops does not have fruit in it it doesn't count and potato chips it's not a vegetable okay I'm talking about real foods and your plant foods are the key ones that you want so anything that grows in the dirt anything that grows on a a bush or a tree or a vine those are the things that you want to have at least half of your meal that's where the word half comes in I want you to remember that half of your meal and it can be more if you want it can be a hundred percent if you want but at least half your meal every day should be fruits vegetables being seeds or nuts or a combination of all of them so how do you do that well instead of using spaghetti to make spaghetti you can buy zucchini spirals or you can buy a zucchini and get one of those little spiraling tools and spiral it yourself and eat that instead you're getting a lot of veggies in that meal or what we do is we steamed cauliflower and we put our spaghetti sauce on that and a lot of times I'll add sometimes I'll add meat to it and sometimes I add your fruits and vegetables right now it's I'm telling you they're in abundance in the grocery stores because everybody is clearing out the aisles of all the processed foods that their body doesn't need and does not perform well with and they're passing by the very things that they really need how hard is it to eat an apple you take it out of the refrigerator you wipe it down good and you eat it you don't have to cut it you don't have to cook it up to anything just eat an apple if you want to cut it up add some and add some peanut butter to the plate and put some different seeds on that and dip it in that or your celery I love making smoothies I make smoothies every day and smoothies are so easy to get a multitude of fruits and vegetables in your diet very easily every day now if your idea of cooking is taking highly processed chicken with a very thick heavy batter made up of ingredients you can't even pronounce and putting that in the oven that's not cooking if you cannot find an alternative way to change that to something healthier and there are plenty of ways you can do that there's tons of cooking channels and cooking shows and things like that out there but if you absolutely just absolutely have to have those have a good side dish of some kind of veggie with it a big salad with several kinds of veggies chopped up and put on top of it yeah it takes a little time it takes a little time to to add those things in but won't it be worth it when you're feeling better maybe you can get off some of those medications you're on maybe you're gonna lose some weight I mean there's a lot of benefits to doing that and so if you want to start out with baby steps just add a nice big leafy green salad to at least one meal a day and I'm most salads you can put anything you want I mean if you want to add some broccoli or cauliflower florets to it or chopped up carrots or celery or maybe cut up a orange and put that on a salad that's really refreshing maybe put um how about some beets you could put some beets on it just cut those up you can get those ready-made beets are really good for cleansing your liver and a lot of people don't like the earthy taste or whatever and that's the sometimes because it's really hard when you buy them when you buy them in the store and they're dirty and everything it's it's just sometimes it's easier just to do this if that's an objection you have for not buying beets then do it this way I get these at Costco and they're organic they're cooked and they're packaged in shrink wrap so they're they're totally fresh they keep for a long time so this is a really good thing to have maybe even in your pantry yeah I bought these in April and they're good till till the September so there's no preservatives naturally gluten free I don't know why they even put that on there I think that's kind of funny but anyway look at the ingredients organic beets nothing else just beets no added sugars the sugars that are in it come from the beets themselves that's what you want to be looking for when you see a label that says no sugar or zero sugar or zero calories or zero whatever look at the ingredients and see what artificial flavors they put in and instead you do not want to put that in your body maybe you don't want to take the time to cut up your fruits and vegetables okay no excuses this is from Pasco it's the Kirkland brand of their organic mixed vegetables and the ingredients are carrots sweet corn peas and green beans see that's all that's in it no other preservatives no preservatives no salt seasonings no salt or anything like that and no added sugars and it's cheap casco pretty much sells things at warehouse prices and they make their money on your memberships so that's what pays everybody's paycheck is when you buy a membership you're helping to support families who work there the same thing was there with their three berry blend frozen fruit I use this in a lot of smoothies and what are the ingredients raspberries blueberries blackberries no high fructose corn syrup no bad stuff at all it's all just the fruit now the sugars are 10 grams but they're coming from fruit so they're gonna be there's gonna be some in there but it's it's all natural sugars from the fruits now here's another example some people like to buy those ready-made packets of oatmeal and have you ever looked at the sugar content on those have you ever looked at all the other ingredients and preservatives that are in them when you can be just doing this in about the same amount of time you can cook this on the stove now we like the steel-cut and look at the ingredients what's in it organic whole grain oats that's all and zero added sugars well look who I picked up yeah your lucky day I hope you enjoyed this video I hope it helped you in some way I know a lot of it was just kind of baby steps because if you want the

star right there where you are we join me movies with you you personal relationship to start our first warm-up as always I want us to warm up our shoulders do something to target more the top upper body and we'll glue the neck the neck so let's just warm up those shoulders once again the upper by doing some arm servers right would you slow the slower you do them the more your muscles are going to be activated slow muscles are straining and they're there it worked pretty good the slower you go as you see we're going to do some leg exercises the slower you go so keep doing these with me by now you can feel it rushing to those muscles those shoulders are going to start feeling tight go back the other way if you want to do it a little circle big wide circles what I would suggest little circles if you're doing two when you might end up pulling keep doing those back to the truck I know those should be burning okay now as always taking little weights you gallon jug last week this is a functional strength exercises meaning these are key when you daily everyday movements house you have to pick something up and don't want to be off balance so what you're going to do make sure the first we're going to do shoulder length apart the feet shoulder length apart wait the jungle everydays one hand stimulating the off-balance feeling whether your legs are more balanced you'll have to close mandal foaming or less dangerous right grab the wing like this you're straight now your heels if you can't go - no you can't go with lower back straight butt out that's fine if you jingles hello

the weight on one side let's get back there you go go buddy now back to the other but if you wait until the readings are based on the quick okay take your weight straight up if you want I'll use two of them you have two waves you have everyone do it you think them leg up back up we go one leg at a time three four ah six ever ate rest a little bit I'm not giving us a whole lot of risk because the sake of time but you can take all the rest you want remember when you do please during the week-long get to don't give yourself too much slack but you know ray do this right now they can this leg up transfer the weight to the maintenance on the ground up it up two three got a crunch hold a stool four five six seven eight Robel fearful eight when you take place easily this is what you're saying both watch them you can take two it's too much weight we're going to do the same squatting motion but like a lunch like this straight down the gullet you need touch the brown one well the one that's next you can two three four five six seven eight slow the slower more you're working tan the next one he west a little bit go to the next chief my breathing's are really pretty heavy don't go too wide don't stay too narrow again I show a little by now now of course because of the quarantine situation we wanted to incorporate this interpersonal relationships incorporate some exercise but you guys at home kind of these together something for the midsection for your core while also targeting these shoulders are going to do we're going to take these shoulder man shoulder things to do like how we're going back all the way one side don't stretch too far don't hurt yourself for the Artic trying to keep this facing forward Doris little gear is okay we use this together make those chest muscles activate out we'll work the top of your shoulders and get built in your chest here also squeeze it together that's the tough part drink one snack yeah let's go that's one one two that's two right time this looking for okay I already got a beat the sweat on my forehead yeah way too deep your time you don't have a weight just clap your hands together and keep those palms push together slower if you want to just keep it going the whole you know what else that's boom when you can do that keep the stomach muscles tight as you can push push push and I think we'll finish up the moves touch your toes chuckles hamstrings all right in your last couple minutes like we did last week we'll end on a high note if you want to use your weights for this I encourage that you do if you don't in an easy way to extend all the way up with you too if you can you start to get tired two punches if I'm dropping I'm good 30 seconds he's nearly okay just like that just on the slip keep those punches a high level level with me now have to do them with me weights will drop the weight will drop the weight which will make it great library you can go faster just keep it moving all the way up all the way extended to what and there you go I think if you're doing those with me you can see I'm sweating I hope you are too until next time please remember interpersonal relationships are just as crucial to your health as eating and sleeping well because you're injured I can talk last week trust one another trusting in the Lord Thank You Wesley I see I can see some of the participants breaking a sweat at least I'm imagining that you are breaking a sweat I was moving too I was there moving in my hands you know one scientist said ow you know all we have to do is move mean just move your legs move your hands if you are restricted to a chair just move we were made to move we learned that when we discussed activity a couple weeks ago so thank you again and a question was asked whether or not we're gonna have or simply nah next week next week being um Easter Sunday and so initially we we did not plan to but since you're all at home why not anyway if you could just send a send India a response to the question should we have all Christian health seminar next week time if you are gonna be available and you think we should have it just indicate my texts are calling in you have the numbers or just relating that information to your table leave we'd love to know what your what's your opinion what do you think about us having it so please let us know also we want to a number of you are asking about a workbook they workbook that you got a copy of and some of you were asking for some of the responses or the answers and some of those workbooks and so this evening we wanted to share some of that with you they last two weeks ago we pretty and that we talked about trust there are pieces of shared trust he will share some of the answers to that as well as interpersonal relationship but for activity if you here to take your workbooks out those of you who have one if you don't you can again indicate to us and we will try and get one to you but the question and this is on page 20 so if you have your workbook and you can reach to it it's page 20 or you could just write record their responses so we have exercise X the first question was at the first statement is exercise or a mind the word mind and body next word is body slows the effects of aging so here's a recipe here you wanna slow down effects of aging do your exercise and not just your number to regulate the word there's exercise we're gonna exercise the brain to build a strong mind they were there's exercise number three start each day with a healthy breakfast eat low glycemic foods those are foods in which they Lucas is not sorry the carbohydrate is not very quickly converted to glucose so here oatmeal and your whole-grain these are low have low glycemic index and so these are the types of food we encourage you to eat at the beginning of the day for your breakfast moving on we'll talk some about that in subsequent seminars next question food is healthiest the way the ground there's God created it so the word is God and finally the brain needs large amounts of oxygen that's what's missing there large amounts of oxygen to function optimally that was helpful I'm just filling the blanks and as I mentioned earlier Barry when he takes over it would and share with you the responses or the answers to those questions on the trust as well as interpersonal relationship understand we have Agnes we've we were with us and I'm gonna turn over to her right now as she walks us through nutrition facts thank you if you have guests it's going to be I'll show you in the next slide okay good afternoon this is Agnes and today I'm going to talk about the food group with a bad rap and we're going to go to talk about fats the classifications effect Loxley if you can turn to the next slide okay here we go here I've listed pets in three categories here the first one is unsaturated fats and it comes primarily from vegetable sources and they are much healthier for you and under this heading we have two kinds we have the mono unsaturated fats as well as the poly unsaturated fats and that includes a omega-3 fats which is too low it's good for lowering your cholesterol your triglycerides so the second group is saturated fats it comes primarily from animal sources and those are less healthy because they tend to up your arteries now the the category of fat is trans fats trans fats is found in some processed foods it is an unhealthy kind of fat and should be avoided so let's take a look at this slide here so you see this al Fariq three categories here you have trans fats saturated fats and you see a X P star beside it which means to say try to avoid this or at least at least eat as little as you can and then you see a check mark on unsaturated fats that's the one you want to have in your mousse because this do not clog your arteries as you can see I have put different examples on it so I think if you go to the next slide you can see the examples better here we go so I'm saturated fats versus saturated fats so if you look at the category of our answer to the facts you will see a la Vida from plant sources by avocados there's a good that the mayonnaise if you use the light like mayonnaise nuts olives then the different oils canola oil eat peanuts corn soybean safflower sunflower grape seed flax seed oils lose that belong to unsaturated fats then you have margarine you have also seeds the flat seeds pumpkin says means sunflower the some good seeds and then you have salad dressings especially we're encouraged to use light salad dressings now let's move to the category on saturated fats you see the bacon you see butter now coconut someone you may be surprised that coconut is actually listed as saturated fats the jury's still out there and has not removed it from that category because coconut oil and cream if you set it in room temperature it was to live our solidified so and so it is actually saturated now if you look at the creams the heavy creams light and wick creams half in half they all belong to saturated fats the cream cheese the Lord in the different kinds of oils like coconut and palm oil palm oil you find that in a lot of our cookies and cakes they are saturated oils then shortening and sour cream so let's look at the next slide here now what tell me about trans fat trans fat is actually trans fatty acids so it's a type of fact that it's man-made what happens is the manufacturer will what they are we take vegetable oils which is good eyes and then pretty much tweak it to make it into a semi solid state so is that really an unhealthy substance that is made through the hydrogenation of oils so hydrogenation solidifies liquid so for trans-fats it increases the shelf life so that's why it's so to our food manufacturers to increase the shelf life of foods as well as the flavor flavor stability of oils and foods that is wine you find out our cookies and cakes have transfected added to it so it doesn't spoil that easily you can live out your a lot of breads and cookies for a week and it doesn't grow mold it's because of the trans fat in it as well so let's take a look at the next slide here so I can transfer do why are we worried about trans fat because trans fat can raise your bad cholesterol the bad cholesterol is LDL sometimes we call it the lousy cholesterol and yeah it will lower the good cholesterol which is your HDL or the healthy cholesterol so it really a trans fat can spell double trouble for your heart because it costs of your a please so be way that if a food has less than 0.5 grams of trans fats per serving the FDA says you can legally label it as having zero trans fat so even if you read the label as transfer as zero grams they can technically have about 5.5 grams of trans fat in it so then how do we know if there is trans fat in our foods well the code word for trans fat is let's take a look partially hydrogenated always so if you're reading your ingredient list on your label which with our tissue next week if you see this word partially hydrogenated or hydrogenated oils it really means is the other word for trans fats so yeap and probably don't want to buy that package of just slip it back on put it back on the shelf there so let's take a look at the next slide here so here are some examples of foods with trans fats in them as mentioned I say the crackers the cookies the cakes the frozen pies when I talk about cakes usually usually kicks down pre baked and and frozen and other baked goods you have like snack items like microwave popcorn frozen pizza fast foods vegetable shortening and some stick mutterings do have trans fat in it and talking about that we also have a coffee creamer refrigerate the dough now your biscuit dough or your cinnamon rolls etc and ready to use frostings now let's talk about peanut butter here most peanut butter has trans fat in it except the natural kind so when I'm counseling patients we usually encourage them to use the natural peanut butter the natural peanut butter is the one that the oil rights rises to the top actually peanut butter Shawn you have two ingredients peanuts and a little bit of salt anything else is about pretty much junk so try to eat choose the peanut butter only choose the natural kinds all right so let's move along here so let's look at some dietary fat and recommendations number one choose a diet that's low in what saturated fat and cholesterol use nonfat dairy products use light salad dressing light mayonnaise and soft top mutterings the worst kind of margarine is one there is the stick kind so choose always like olive oil canola oil and cannot always limit high fat meats use more vegetable protein foods limit baked goods eat fewer fried foods and avoid trans fat be careful when eating out because a lot of the stuff have trans fat in it so it's important to read food labels because it will give you a lot of information there so how much fat should I have well the answer is one to two servings of added fat but some of the fat is already present in your protein foods so therefore we do not need to add in so much added fat into our meals if a person is going to lose weight so one serving might be I'll do it if not the max is two servings so let's look and see what the serving effect looks like so we're going to say that it contains 5 grams of fat and 45 calories so example someone serving effect is 1 teaspoon of oil it's already one serving a pet 1 tablespoon of salad dressing 2 tablespoon of avocados a lot of people say well avocado some good so I'm gonna eat 2 of them but that would be overdoing it just because effect and I think that has good fat we cannot overdo it so to taste 2 tbsp of avocado is actually already serving effect and look at nuts a lot of people are eating all the eating on the nuts they say where they are not so good it's very good but even a good stuff we cannot overdo it so one serving of almonds and cashews is only six it's not half a can 10 peanuts for walnut house and one teaspoon of marjoram so as you can see on the examples we do not need a whole lot of that so a little bit goes a long way well that concludes my presentation and I will give the screen back to brother lately oh thank you so much Agnes so much about food made me hungry in a minute though we'll be going over to Sandra's kitchen we promise that we will open up the lines to those who may have a question for you at time or comments [Music] oh I see in in Inga's ing es Inga's up I pronounce that right we're gonna take your call Inga's using an iPhone go ahead please hello yes go ahead I'm sorry I didn't hear what you asked me we're taking questions on Agnes presentation about fats did you have any question or comments on that oh no I I was just taking notes on what she was seeing and listening thank you though okay yeah welcome you could please go back a newt so generally anyone have questions for Agnes or any comments you'd like to make if not removing right around you okay going once gone all right we're gonna move right now into Sandra's kitchen Sandra you ready for us I think you are with the cooking demonstration for today hellowho even number one welcome separation helped who demonstration my name is Tonya Fulton and I'm about to demonstrate a special Calif found on page 65 before we begin let's say a word of prior a better father thank you for your gracious rushes thank you for your openness so I'm going to use my [Music] [Music] [Music] this is a mush DeMatha so then I can always add okay now so that's one pack up to Patong tofu from extra firm and now I will be highly in mind one teaspoon onion powder okay one teaspoon onion powder okay when I put the authorities and then I'll be putting in teaspoon garlic powder and afterward I'll be putting a stalk of celery already find the chopper so I'm putting in my celery has regulated and then we're going to have energy egg replacer this is energy egg replacer because we do not use egg so we use this you can either use it right or you can mix it with water so I firmly see Miley in them I'm gonna pour some water which I have right behind me here and the spoon over here to mix it the reason why I like to use a dry ingredient you got egg replacer make it easier for me I don't have to mix I just pour it in there but for today I'm going to be mixing it with some water okay so this is gonna be it is to holding the rope together that's what it does it's a little bit it's gonna be thick and mix it out and then I'm gonna pour it into it the rest of the mix from the container as you can see this is what is going to be it looks like creamy very me like white and creamy it looks like as you can see this is what it looks like hey takes a little time mixing it out and maybe that's why I prefer to music in my team right so now I'm going to pour it into my mixture okay almost finished with this top takes a little time this but I guess you better get a better result when we mix it I'm gonna use dry it but I prefer dry anyway come back okay so now so now I'm going to use one and a half cups of pecans already crying so here I am facing all together which [Music] the nicest thing about is if you have ready make it easy for you to put it on and now I'm gonna put my McCain deep like season in it and then I mix it around and mix it to make sure it well now I'm going to put in my walk-up special chain which is here I told you [Music] [Music] but I put it in so that I can on Nelson anytime you get them in the soft so I don't have to melt it but if you like you can if you put it out before you're ready for a little bit soft head if not you have to melt it if you want to use it take it from the frigerator to use it right away they take a little more time together you can either put it in the microwave and you second get it melt attic or you can leave each other who attends with you to get a little melted and that's a ball I'm gonna be puttin you saw your milk which is one cup of soya milk okay you can use all your milk or you can use almond plain almond milk to mix it together [Music] okay this is what it's going to be looking like and then this is free may for any holiday point any spring party olive oil I wanted you can use your preference so now I'm gonna just pour it into the pan [Music] you can use a smaller deeper one or you can use the same size as this this is a I'm not sure what size - it would be but it you can use a great pan or you can also use this permutation that goes in it or you can use your choice but when you are doing this you have a choice of what you would like to use okay so now my loaf is ready and it's ready for the oven and this is what oh that looks like finishing so now I'm about to put it in the oven because it's already really welcome back now we're finished our table so I'm about to take it out of the oven now okay it was not within an hour in I have to cut this loaf and something we can also serve with the chicken gravy brown gravy you use chicken light season to make this one you'll find it on page 64 so you can go to page 54 and find the recipe for gravy or you can also serve it with any gravy that you like so this is the finish markets this thing is pretty hot so I'm gonna breed up with you closer to you can see the finishing work this is the book okay it's looking good so I'm about to cut this road to see what it tastes like okay here I go it's a bit soft you see when you get colder it gets a little bit more firmly so at this point it's still a little bit of salt okay and I got my little bit crunchy and the outside it can be soft inside but crunchy on the outside because that's the way I like my loaf okay so now I use a spatula and I transfer it to a plate and I would like I'm getting ready to taste it now okay in as you can see this is quite pleasant and a plate so I'm showing you so I'm about to taste it all right can I taste it yes you may taste it too right also you may serve it with mashed potato it will be in gravy it is very delicious now we take the worm so now I have to do something so I leave it here to get cool and bye until next time take the Arab winter doing cooking class with you okay thank you sister Fulton that that special K loaf look very good you know if you've never had a special K loaf I'm telling you you are in for a real treat I love special K loaf and I'm not at all surprised to see brother Fulton get into that kitchen and grab it so as we continue to move through our program I wanted to introduce to you the video presentation that we have for you today on interpersonal relationships what I love about the creation health model is that there's a focus on not only health for the body but also health for the mind and how it interplays with one another when you have a healthy body and you have a healthy mind that's when you achieve optimal health and so that's really what this presentation is about and that's what this video was about so hope that you sit back relax and enjoy the video presentation that we have for you this evening as we explore the I in the acronym creation health on interpersonal relationships [Music] in 1985 on average each of us have three people in five important matters by 2004 and today research indicates that 25% of Americans have no 1 2 3 5 it is it's sad to realize that one out of every four people in need with socially isolated this social isolation is associated with a host of emotional and physical illnesses in general people tend to engage in destructive behaviors such as alcoholism smoking overeating because the only relationships in relationships tell one javadi and a quality of life we'll also see some ways to create and maintain healthy relationships as you know our theme for this seminar is living life to the fullest which is God's will for our lives social connection is one of the things that makes this possible so what do we mean by social connection or social connectedness well in the broadest sense it means interacting with others and that means with God as well as other people relationships are one of life's greatest blessings healthy interpersonal relationships include good communication sharing touch encouragement and trust these qualities create an environment of Hope trust and belonging let's learn a little more about the latest research on social connection and its profound impact on health and wellness [Music] isn't it amazing how time spent with a friend can make you happy but researchers are becoming more and more alarmed by a certain trend people are disconnecting from each other socially in 1985 on average each of us had three people in whom we could confide important matters but by 2004 only two and today research indicates that 25 percent of Americans have no one to confide in isn't it sad to realize that one out of every four people you meet is socially isolated and this social isolation is associated with emotion in general people tend to engage in destructive behaviors such as alcoholism smoking and overeating to help cope with their Lohan's because the only thing in life that really matters is our loving relationships friends family even pets say hello to one of my buddies Oreo speaking of which do you have a buddy and I'm not just talking about a pet somebody who loves you and wants to help you if your answer is yes then you just may have a three to five times lower risk of premature death and disease we need friends and today we'll see and hear so let's join dr. Winnie King ending information on interpersonal relationships what do you think buddy Oreo says yes there are people in my life who just make me smile whenever I think of them they lift me up and make my there are people who well you know those kind of people it's an undeniable fact that good interpersonal relationships improve our life dr. Dean Ornish writes this about friendships I'm not aware of any other factor in medicine not diet not smoking not exercise not stress not genetics not drugs not surgery that has a greater impact on our quality of life incidents of illness and premature death from all causes [Music] President Abraham don't to a part of one slide cyst specially during the cold and flu season but consider this counterintuitive study volunteers were given nasal drops that contain the common cold virus and as you would expect most of them became infected but those were the most friends or less likely to develop pull symptoms social connection and interpersonal relationships foster good health and happiness meaning friends equates with better health after the video okay hey everyone I'm not sure if I'm one as far as I can tell okay well as far as I can tell I'm still viewing Joe rightly screen so once we get that situated okay here we go so we're gonna start the presentation but I just need a few moments to pull the presentation up so that I can share the slides with you so if you just give me just a moment and I'll be happy to share this very very informative presentation I will say I like the science of interpersonal relationships so we're gonna be looking at some some scientific studies today I hope I don't get too far into the minutiae of that but but but I think you're going to find it very very interesting as we begin this topic so here we are on creation health and we're on the I of the acronym creation health rendered personal relationships create a full and happy life just a moment please well I'm still trying to get myself together here we are okay and so here in this slide we're just showing the the acronym and we are here on interpersonal ownership people are essential to well-being so relationships and health a social system is vital to our health and this is going to be a proven fact and we'll see some studies that demonstrate that your your relationships can make the difference between sickness and health and I'm also going to show you some information to prove that as well so the Bible tells us in Genesis chapter 2 verse 18 and the Lord God said it is not good that man should be alone it's just very interesting to me as Adam was looking at all of the different creatures on the earth he saw that they were all paired up he felt lonely for himself he wanted to have a mate as well and so God us to be that way as you can see here in this slide God created us to benefit from relationships and he himself craves a relationship with us so this presentation will focus on number one how your social connections predict your health by affecting your longevity and quality of life and two we're going to help you to create and maintain healthy relationships so we're just gonna go over some tips on how to on how you might go about doing that and of course our theme text john 10:10 i have come that you may live life to the fullest or live or have life and have it more abundantly so when we talk about social connection what are we what are we talking about and a broadest sense it's a means it means that you're interacting with others especially with God but with other people you're interacting with nature you're just getting out and doing some things and so indicators of healthy interpersonal relationships include good communication servanthood sharing and we're going to talk more about these types of topics here so sharing touch touch is such an important part when it comes to interpersonal relationships we didn't see that part of the video but there are some studies on on on touch and how it affects your perceptions of how you interact with others encouragement and trust they create an environment of hope closeness and a sense of a sense of belonging one that you can confide in so you already saw in a video a message here from dr. Dean Ornish what I want to I want to redisplay that because dr. Dean Ornish is a physician that works on reversing heart disease and when you think about his program mostly you think about the low-fat diet you think about the exercise you think about all those kinds of components which is good but when he's asked what is the most Cornette thing about your your your program what works the best and his response is the relationships that are built in his programs he says that I'm not aware of any other factor in medicine not diet not smoking not exercise not stress not genetics not drugs not surgery that has a greater impact on our quality of life incidence of illness and premature death from all causes and also want to point out here that this is what makes the creation health models so intriguing because we've split up into our groups and then we work with each other we create a community within our groups and that's what makes I think one of the main factors that makes the creation health model so effective in improving our health so do you ever find yourself feeling sad lonely or depressed and if you do you're not the only one one-third of people have reported feeling lonely loneliness here twenty-five percent of Americans have no one at all to confide in twenty five percent twenty nine million people twenty nine million people live alone now when we say live alone what I think what what what that slide is trying to say is they live alone and then there's no other social outlet they are by themselves okay and then loneliness is becoming a major disease as we find now that we're more in a society where people don't communicate face-to-face anymore unfortunately here during this coronavirus outbreak we're having to communicate more through online means but what we find here is that people who don't have those abilities are feeling more and more socially isolated so there is a three to five times greater risk of heart disease with loneliness loneliness and isolation affect your health negatively and causes premature death by up to five hundred percent which is just a mind-blowing number so support from others do you have anyone who really cares for you who feels close to you who loves you who wants to help you and someone that you can confide in if you can answer yes to those questions then you have a three to five times lower risk of premature death and and disease from all other causes this again is taking out any other factor in your health just having those connections lowers your risk for premature death and you will see some more information on that as we go along so loneliness as you saw in the video already increases incidence of alcohol and drug abuse increases smoking here a lot of church-going folks we may have this one overeating loneliness definitely causes a lot of overeating perhaps overworking you just spend your time at work since you have nothing you feel like you have nothing else to do increases depression and again premature death by 500% now time to get into some of the some of the science I love these studies one study I want to point out here is the Alameda County study this is a longitudinal study they say follow 7,000 people for 40 years so it's just an amazing study but the long and the short of it what they found is people classified as lonely and isolated had three times higher mortality who didn't even make it through to the forty years or people with and then conversely people with many social context had the lowest mortality rates the amount of social support was the best predictor the best predictor for a good health how much social support you have you're living for somebody else when you when you're when you're connected to other people the best predictor for good health so characteristics of people who live past 100 years old they're active but number two look at that they're socially connected they have they have people that they can can interact with friends and family they're not smokers they have healthy diets and then of course they get they rat their rest and they live with the purpose here's another study that I wanted to point out to you this study of cancer patients who participated in a weekly support group for 90 minutes they looked at them and they looked at their death rate and then they looked at the reoccurrence of their cancer so six years later people in the support group had a 70% reduction in death rate and almost half of reoccurrences so people in a support group here you can see in this blue bar their death rate was much much lower than people who they found who had similar cancers that did not participate in a support group here you find in this category the reoccurrence so yes the cancer recurred but even the reoccurrence was much lower and people who were in a support from people who had those connections versus people who did not participate in a support group you can see their reoccurrence rate was much much higher so support and your immune system when you when so when social support is increased our loneliness is reduced the immune system is actually strengthened we kind of talked about that a little bit last week when we when we talked about how your immune system is strengthened when you feel a connection with the Lord so a boost to your immunity here they did a study where they sprayed that virus in a nasal spray there were 276 people who had agreed to do this but 276 healthy volunteers were exposed to the common cold virus but interestingly enough the people who were had more social relationships they had they were less likely to actually get sick from that nasal spray when they were exposed to the common cold virus so that's a very very that's a very very interesting study as well so connectedness and recovery so here is a no this is a very interesting study this study was you've taken two group he's got people he separated them out into two groups and one group you gave them special care you showed them what their surgery was going to be like they the both groups had surgery by the way I'm sorry you showed in one group what their surgery is gonna be like what the post-operative period was gonna be like what the pain was gonna be like you showed the relaxation techniques and then after the surgery what they did was they had the anesthesiologist come around not just once a day to make rounds they came around two three four times a day so they developed this connection to the surgery team they developed this connection with the anesthesiologist whereas the other group they just went through the normal surgical procedure during a normal care that you normally get nobody received subpar care but in the test group they received extra care extra support extra attention and what they found was the people who received extra care they reduced their post-operative narcotic requirements by 50% just the extra care to extra attention and they decrease their hospital days the hospital stay about 2.7 days so you can just see how social connectedness is just so critical the healthy mind is a healthy body here's another study 2320 men who survived a heart attack well they had these men that survived a heart attack they went back and studied them over a five to nine year period what they found people those men who were in high-stress environment who were socially isolated they were four times more likely to die from this heart disease than men who were more socially connected and lived of course on a lower stress environment and this is true controlling for other important prognostic factors such as your genetics how much exercise you get what your diet is like your weight your smoking history those things controlling for those things we still found or the researchers in this case still found four times more likely to die if you were socially isolated here's another study so the people in Nippon Japan what they found here is that these are the people who have the longest life expectancy some of the people who have the longest life expectancy in the world well there are people who emigrated from that community from that area of Japan and and they studied them the people who immigrated to Honolulu into San Francisco 11900 Japanese what they found was what what the reason one of the reasons why they do so well with their life expectancy is that this is a very tight-knit community they share things they are very socially well-connected and what they found was the people who immigrated to other areas to Honolulu and to San Francisco when those people retained their traditional Japanese culture of support they had the same prevalence of heart disease the same low prevalence of heart disease as those people who just lived right there in Japan so it's just so critical as we can see here that your environment affects your health your your practices your daily activities really does affect your long-term health so social support again in your immune system when social support is increased immune system is strengthened relationships interpersonal relationships there's a buffer to disease as we've seen and complications from any age we even see where you have higher social support during labor they decrease the need for c-section and even decrease labor time social connectedness and adolescence so this is interesting study they studied 90,000 teens eighteen thousand of their parents and basically what they found is to make a long story short cause I know we are short on time already what they found is kids who feel connected to family church school community were far less likely likely to participate in behaviors that put them at risk and here's another slide that demonstrates that adolescents who are connected to their parents their families and their school community are healthier than those who are who are not so not only do we want to make sure that we're socially connected as adults we also want to make sure that our children especially our teenagers have social connections they have social outlets people that they can interact with and form a community hopefully a healthy community so social connectedness and marriage does your spouse know that you loved them that you know and you know you don't think you have to ask ask that question but it's such an important question that's your spouse know that you love them if they if they don't please make sure that they know here's another interesting study so what they found here was they took people who have a blocked coronary artery okay now I don't know in the study whether or not they unblocked it whether or not they just put them on medicine what happened there but what they found is when they just took these people with these blocked coronary arteries and they followed them over five years those people who were who were married who had who had healthy marriages had a higher survival rate than people who did not and this again is just taking out all the other factors just looking at the fact that they were connected they had a higher survival rate of that terrible disease where your coronary arteries blocked when and also could decrease your function of your heart happily married women and had a stronger immune system here again and report less depression and loneliness connectedness and older adults what predicts positive aging a good marriage at age 50 and of course of course low cholesterol at age 50 as well so we've got to be careful about ice cream intake as well as other things so the loves influence we talked about love last week a little bit when we feel loved we choose healthier behaviors that is a common common thing I want to talk a little bit about pet relationships we found some very interesting things with that one year after being hospitalized with chest pain or heart attack 6% of pet owners died compared to 28% of patients who did not own pets so you just find out that that connectedness with pets that unconditional love that you can get from a pet we find that we find positive health benefits from that this finding again is independent of other factors severity of your disease exercise other known factors it's independent of that we're finding that pet owners generally speaking have higher survival rates from these from these illnesses the DVD we didn't get a chance to see it but the DVD gives us pointers gives us tips on ways we can improve our interpersonal relationships you want it points out reaching out to those saying hello being interactive with people mingling going around and and just having conversations with others and that's something that you know even I still work on volunteering is another big thing we're gonna see I have some more studies but we're going to see how volunteering helps accepting people unconditionally so the helpers hi a sir 3296 volunteers doing all kinds of helping 95% of those who regularly help others experience of helpers hi they actually it made them feel good I'm sure many of you can say that you can excuse experience that where you feel good when you help others and you gain health benefits so here's an interesting quote about volunteering about helping others and asking the overworked person to make additions to an already busy day I can easily imagine a skeptical laughter of readers who feel sufficiently pushed to the wall by their existing job responsibilities it is ironic but true that one way to relieve the pressure is to do something extra actually doing something for others who takes away the stress that you may feel in your everyday job john d rockefeller

six seven six seven eight zero okay better if you're ready you do have some answers I think for interpersonal relationship as well as trust you might want to share those now thank you okay thank you brother Utley I I like the way that you did the answers I like the way that you did the answers to the Activity one unfortunately I didn't think to create a slide for everybody but you what I'm going to do is just sort of read the answers to you and share it with you that way so I'm on the week six interpersonal relationships in your study guide here small group discussion guide and I'm turned to page 28 so I'll give everyone a moment to turn to page 28 and their small group discussion guide and you'll find some questions there that are related to the video and I wanted to share those responses you'll you'll find that some of the questions we can be answered out of the presentation but I want to go ahead and share it with you so if everybody's there on page 28 right there at the top it reads in 1985 on average each of us had blank people in which we could confide and the answer there that you want to select is or don't you want to input is 3 in 1985 on average each of us had 3 people in which we could confide the next line goes into in 2004 what number sorry 2004 that number had dropped to blank people the answer there is to in 2004 that number had dropped to two people

baby Joby [Applause] ha [Applause]", "0ZngCDY99bY": "Nearly 16 million children in the US have\ninconsistent access to enough nutritious food. The American Heart Association recommends\nhigh-school aged children eat 3 servings of vegetables a day. In Tennessee only 13% will achieve that goal. Nearly one in five adolescents skips breakfast. Disordered eating is our standard of living\nin America. One in 3 children in Tennessee drinks two\nor more sodas every day. One in three children is also obese or overweight. I see obesity as one of the most visible forms\nof malnutrition that we have today. Babies who are breastfed exclusively for 6\nmonths experience fewer and less severe infections, and see improved cognitive development. In Tennessee, only 4% of babies will be breastfed\nexclusively to 6 months \u2013 the lowest rate in the US. We are setting our children up to not be as\nhealthy as they could potentially be. By age 15-18 months, the most common vegetable\neaten by children in America is french fries. What is standing between us and a healthy\nrelationship to food? One responsibility we have as parents is to\nprovide our children with healthy nourishing food; food that will help them grow and develop. But what happens when children don\u2019t get\nenough healthy food? And how do we know what is healthy to begin\nwith? In this episode of Children\u2019s Health Crisis,\nwe\u2019ll look at our relationship to food and examine why we eat what we eat and how that\naffects the health of our children. Stay tuned. The day is just getting started at Mooreland\nHeights Elementary, part of Knox county schools in Tennessee. Food is important for schools, Just like handing\na kid a book or giving them a bus ride to school providing them a meal is a critical\npiece in the education and personal development of the student. District- wide Director of school nutrition,\nJon Dickl, wants kids to start their day right. Breakfast is probably the greatest area for\ngrowth and the greatest area of need. My primary role is to support the education\nprocess. My product that I produce is not the food\nthat I serve, it\u2019s the students that they become and the adults they will become. Breakfast at this school is unique. It\u2019s served in the classroom; not the cafeteria\nand it\u2019s free for every single student. We are in a really unique situation in time\nwhere we have students that come to us that are nutritionally deficient On the other hand\nwe have students on the other end of the spectrum that are suffering with childhood overweight\nor obesity. So school is for some of our students a sole-source\nor close to sole source of nutrient dense food. We are very careful in how we craft our menu. Our breakfast menu usually has a minimum of\nthree protein contributions a week, The offerings of whole grains and the necessary requirement\nrequirements of the fiber from that. The fresh fruits and vegetables provides a\nmore healthy body, than simply filling up on a carbohydrate. Research shows children without reliable access\nto food perform worse on math problems and are more likely to have to repeat a grade\nlevel. When breakfast is offered, fewer children\nwill be late or absent from school. We hear research and we know statistics and\nthe data about how important it is the children get to eat every morning, but just to get\nto come in to the building every morning and know in my heart that my kids have eaten is\njust a great relief. I don't worry about them and I don't think\nyou can research that. The American diet has really deteriorated\nover the last several decades. we have come to a place now where people are\neating a lot of processed foods are not eating as many fresh fruits and vegetables we're\nnot eating as many homemade foods and because of this people are consuming significant amounts\nof sugar of fat and of sodium. The forces that drive what we eat are actually\npretty straightforward. I think we eat what we can afford; we eat\nthings that we can get easily and we eat things that taste good and in our environment, unfortunately,\nthe affordable tasty easily accessible foods are often not the ones that are good for us. The foundations of what we eat and why are\nshaped by food behaviors set in infancy and early childhood. For experts, the early years are the most\nimportant. Even babies first food sets the tone for the\nrest of life. Breast milk is a living fluid. It's genetically designed for the baby from\nwhom its mother came from. So it's not just fats and proteins and sugars,\nit really is about the immune boosting qualities. There are many benefits to breastfeeding. In the short term, breastfed babies have fewer\ninfections and gastrointestinal problems. Long term, research suggests breastfed babies\nhave less risk of asthma, obesity and certain types of cancer. But the benefits don\u2019t stop there. Breast-fed babies know that they are getting\nfull after they have consumed a certain amount of fat in the milk. And we know that the longer the baby stays\non the breast of the higher the fat intake is. the same is not true for bottle feeding - bottle\nfeeding even breast milk might not happen the same way and formula is homogenized so\nthe fat is mixed through the out throughout the entire feeding. When babies are able to regulate their own\nfeeding time and time again when we aren't watching clocks and stopping them when we\nreally watch their cues to let them know that they are in charge of their own food; that\nreally does have a lifelong lasting effects of being able to understand what it means\nto be hungry. And what it means to be satisfied without\nbeing overly full I think that's a problem that a lot of us have even as adults We should\nbe eating when we are hungry and not eating just because culturally it's acceptable to\ndo so. According to the 2013 Breastfeeding Report\nCard, 60% of mom\u2019s in Tennessee will ever try to breastfeed their baby. By 3 months, 18% of babies will be breastfed\nexclusively. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends\n6 months of exclusive breastfeeding. Only 4% of Tennessee babies will meet that\ngoal, the lowest percentage in the US. How we respond; how our body will know if\nwe are hungry or full that starts as we are a developing fetus, because that set point\nthat thermostat that lives in your brain and your brain architecture is being developed\nas the fetus develops its then further developed in infancy, and its reinforced or not. So if you are overfed as an infant, you set\nyour thermostat at a higher level. That means that you will continue to eat regardless\nof whether that is necessary to feed your body and your own growth that's the opposite\nof what we consider to be functionally good. Now, as you are developing, likewise, if you\nmove into the age of the 3 to 5. Your body, your brain your intestines your\nmuscles your bones, everything is being laid down like the foundations of a house. You've got to build a strong foundation if\nyou want to build your first and your second or third story on top. As infants become toddlers, they move on to\nsolid foods. In America, that often means graduating to\nthe kids menu. Once babies are weaned and start having solid\nfood. Those first few months I think parents are\npretty careful. But I feel like something happens at age 2\nwhere suddenly it seems a good idea to take your child to McDonald's for a happy meal. Parents seem to want to give their child more\nof these foods that are just part of our culture, and that's when you need to be really careful. We are a family of five: mom and dad, three\nkids; both parents working. We go to church every week, twice a week sometimes,\nbut you know your typical family that you would find in Nashville or anywhere. Sherrica Proctor and her family considered\nthemselves health conscious. But like many families, they were busy. I was working anywhere from 55 to 60 hours\nweek so it is whatever I could pop in the microwave and pop out onto the table for the\nchildren. And if it was easier for me to stop at the\nlocal fast food chain I would. The Proctors aren\u2019t alone. Fast and convenient foods have become the\nnorm for families across America. As our society has changed and the role of\nwomen has changed and most families now have two working parents. We really are reliant on foods that are fast\nand foods that are easier to get on the dinner table. After a career with the EPA, John Patrick\nhas returned to his roots. He is testing a sustainable model of agriculture\non a small farm near Nashville, Tennessee. For John, what we eat is determined by what\nwe plant. I would say in the 1920s. There was a subtle shift in the way that we\nfarm, and that's when subsidies began, After 1970, things have changed dramatically. That is when the USDA started pushing more\nand more subsidies going out to large farms and directed towards commodities by Earl Butts,\nwho was the agricultural secretary at the time, and his famous words are, \u201cGet big\nor get out.\u201d As a result, commodity crops in the US did\n\u201cget big.\u201d Production of corn, soy, wheat, cotton and\nrice ballooned in the United States. It pushed us towards a surplus of certain\ncommodity crops. Corn was the number one, followed closely\nby soy because they usually they go into rotation. So that changed, What are we going to do with\nall this food that we are growing and where's it going to go? In the case of corn, one use was high fructose\ncorn syrup. With it, food manufacturers could sweeten\ntheir products at a fraction of the price of sugar. It\u2019s in the corn syrup, it\u2019s in the fruit\ndrinks, it\u2019s in the ice cream it\u2019s in the baked goods; it's prevalent. Today, conservative estimates say all Americans\nover the age of two consume an average of 132 calories from high fructose corn syrup\nevery day. Last year, 95.4 million acres of corn were\nplanted in the US, with around 4 million of those acres destined for High Fructose Corn\nSyrup. To put that in perspective, the top 34 vegetables\nplanted in the US measure a combined 1.7 million acres. Of all of the crop land in the US 60% of it\nis planted in grains, 2% of it is planted in fruits and vegetables. That doesn't match the dietary suggestion\nby the USDA. If you look at MyPlate. It's pretty much split up into little 25%\nquarters where you have grains, meat, fruits and vegetables and then a little dish over\nhere of dairy. So grains over here\u2019s 25% and we have fruits\nand vegetables which make up almost 50% So we have 60% grain going to 25% and 2% going\nto 50%. That's way out of balance, shouldn't we be\ngrowing more fruits and vegetables, shouldn't we be incentivizing those farms to be more\ndiverse. I see obesity as one of the most visible forms\nof malnutrition that we have today. While we are consuming excess numbers of calories\nthe nutrients per calorie are so low that we are not actually getting what we need to\ngrow healthy. So we are malnourished as we are overweight. The question is are we to blame for the foods\nwe eat or is it our environment that has conditioned us to consume. People think that they are eating because\nthey've chosen to eat, but I think that the research is just so clear that our environment\nmakes a huge difference in what we end up eating. Typically, when you're around food; you eat\nmore. And what we've seen over the past couple of\ndecades is an increase in our surrounding of food. You're constantly reminded that you're hungry\nand your constantly reminded that something looks good. And so, you know, you eat first with your\neyes, and then your nose, and the last place you eat is with your mouth. Highly processed \u2013 calorie rich foods are\nnot only abundant, they are also the most heavily marketed foods. The food and beverage industry spends $1.6\nbillion every year in marketing directly targeted to children and adolescents. The products that are advertised the most\noften to kids and teens are sugary cereals, fast food, candy, and sugary drinks. I don't think there is a big economic incentive\nto advertise healthy fruits and vegetables to kids. On television alone children see about 13\nfood at every day and teensy over 16 ads a day. Now you don't even have to be sitting in front\nof a screen to get the ads kids are getting ads on their iPhone's their eye pads physically,\nwhere ever they are. Even marketing at the grocery store directly\ntargets children. Think about the middle of a supermarket aisle. The highest sugar cereals and the ones with\nthe biggest cartoon characters are always going to be eye-level with the child that\u2019s\nin the shopping cart. Manufacturers realize that in order to sometimes\nquiet a child, you'll say okay fine, that's what we\u2019ll buy. But human biology is also compelling us towards\ncertain foods. We preferentially move towards foods that\nare high in fat and sugar high in salt. We\u2019re not thinking about it, we just move\nin that way. And it's because we used to live in more of\na feast or famine condition and you could not predict it and so if you scanned the horizon,\nwhich is what you're doing with your eyes all the time. We preferentially go to the high-fat, high\nsugar, high salt. That way, were we to happen upon a time of\nfamine, we would survive. In this environment, where that is no longer\nan advantage but it becomes a disadvantage, this is a great challenge for us. All of this means that in order to navigate\nthe current food environment, you have to have your guard up. But not everyone has the same level of defense. In Tennessee, one in four children is food\ninsecure. When you\u2019re food insecure that means you're\nnot getting enough calories and you're not eating nutritiously. Second Harvest food bank of Middle Tennessee\nis a part of the food system that often goes under the radar. It\u2019s usually by the third week of the month\nthat we start receiving calls from individuals. And so they need something to supplement that\nthrough the end of the month. There are individuals that are really struggling. They have jobs, they\u2019re underemployed, they\nmay have unusual expenses such as high utility bills. So then they have to make decisions. Do I pay my utility bill? or do I put food\non my table? In the past, food banks like Second Harvest\nhave relied on non perishable processed foods to fill bellies. Food Banks traditionally, we would just take\nwhatever came to us and we will always take those donations. Now though we've started looking at the type\nof food that we\u2019re distributing, what type of food we were giving out to people. Food insecurity is often concentrated and\npeople living in areas with high food insecurity can have trouble finding fresh fruits and\nvegetables. Where I live is an older part of Nashville,\nthe closest place to get something to eat is pretty much a strip of fast food restaurants. there\u2019s one grocery store and I'll be honest,\nI\u2019m not really that all that comfortable going there. So that's frustrating. Its going to take me 35 minutes to go to a\ngrocery store or anywhere that has fresh produce. For people to truly have choice so that they\ncan make healthy choices that means that the food offerings need to be accessible affordable\nand acceptable. Those three elements are very important. Vanderbilt University is researching what\nit takes for families to improve their diet and overall health. We focused in two of the most under resourced\ncommunity areas that is in South Nashville and in North East Nashville. These are very diverse communities and they\nserve many different types of people, but many of them deal with the issue of food insecurity. Focusing on families with children age 3 to\n5, the GROW Trial is banking that if interventions can work in food insecure areas, they can\nwork anywhere. We give very simple advice. A good skill is start with the outskirts of\nany type of grocery store that is where you're going to see fruits and vegetables that's\nwhere you'll see the things that are closest to how nature intended them to be start on\nthe outside and then be intentional as we walk down the middle of those isles; what\nyour buying and why are your buying it. Families participating in the GROW Trial meet\nfor 12 weeks with a trained counselor. Together, they will learn cooking skills,\nhow to create a balanced diet, and how to read a food nutrition label. When you read a label. Rather than understanding the entire label,\nwe will teach with tools look at just sugar and fiber content. So less than 10 for sugar more than five for\nfiber just remember two numbers. The trial also includes lessons on parenting,\nhow to manage screen time and encourage things like getting enough sleep and enough physical\nactivity. A lot of what we do is about being intentional\nabout how we make our choices and interact with our environment to feed our bodies. It's healthier to slow down when you eat if\nyou can actually extends your eating time so about 20 minutes than your body can give\nyou cues to let you know when you're full, should you stop eating or you still hungry,\nshould you keep eating. You override the automaticity by being intentional,\nand it's doable, but it is not the default of how we currently interact with our environment. Once the classes are complete, participants\nwill routinely check back in and can call a counselor when they have questions. The Grow trial will last three years and involve\n600 families. With the GROW Vanderbilt program it taught\nus that eat what you feel is comfortable but just create some habits and know what\u2019s\nhealthy. Taking the time to read a label in the store\ncan be a little tedious when you have three kids but if you have them involved it's an\nexcellent educational tool. I want them to understand what they are eating. It's not about being the perfect nutritionist\nat all it's all about just making better choices for you and your family. Parents can only take their children so far. Eventually, children have increasing control\non the food they eat. The motivations for food behaviors become\ncomplicated as children reach adolescence. The social pressures on kids today is entirely\ndifferent than when I was a kid. What I'm seeing the most of is this pressure\nto be perfect. Now perfect entails a lot of different things\nincluding athleticism, grades, performing on a stage etc but what seems to be the underlying\ntrend is body image. Kids as soon as they learn how to read, write,\ntalk, move around the world they become aware of their mass on this planet. So what I'm seeing a lot of that this point\nis these kids are trying to control food, control their relationship with food, try\nto dominate their body in an effort to be quote-unquote perfect. We live in an environment with very mixed\nmessages when it comes to food on the one hand we are targeted by the industry, especially\nchildren and adolescents to eat high calorie and energy dense foods that contribute to\nweight gain at the same time, what we see from the fashion industry from the diet industry\nare messages that really communicate that an individual needs to be thin in order to\nachieve success in our culture. Research shows bullying based on weight is\nthe most common form of bullying in the school setting, but it also happens at home. Children are vulnerable to weight stigma even\nfrom parents and siblings and the consequences of this are very devastating for children\nweight based bullying leads to things like depression and anxiety, low self-esteem, poor\nbody image even suicidal thoughts and behaviors , and it also leads to things like engaging\nin very extreme weight loss methods, engaging in binge eating or eating more food or avoiding\nthings like physical activity often because physical activity settings are where these\nchildren get teased the most. When left unchecked, negative behaviors can\ndevelop into mental illnesses such as eating disorders. There are spikes in trends of eating disorder\nonset. A lot of spikes we\u2019ll see around middle\nschool and high school. That seems to be a really vulnerable population. Before an eating disorder really can be diagnosed\nthe child is usually engaged in several years of disordered eating Eating Disorders are on the rise, especially\namong males. There are a lot of myths about eating disorders. A huge myth is that it's a girl problem. Another big myth around eating disorders is\nthat you have to be overweight or underweight to have an eating disorder and that\u2019s simply\nnot true. It's not about weight; it's not about the\nfood; it\u2019s about your relationship with your weight and your food. It's supposed to be pleasurable to eat. What food is not supposed to do is trigger\nany positive or negative feelings about our self or our place in this world. We really need to messages that empower children\nand families to be healthy regardless of what their body size is. But the second step is that we need to create\nan environment that makes it easy for families to be healthy. For someone who is really looking for the\nopportunity to make some small changes the dinner table is a great place to start. Family meals in every study they come out\nlooking like a positive thing. It sounds simple but its actually a lot of\nwork, but I think it's an investment that is worth it. I used to feel like the school food environment\nmimicked culture. And I think today the school food environment,\nwe are affecting culture by what we are serving. It goes beyond just feeding kids. It's creating a better life for our students. Beyond their time that they spend in school. Everyone should have access to enough nutritious\nfood and understand what the body needs to grow and develop. In our current food environment, it is not\nalways easy to know what is healthy. But reclaiming food as a source of nutrition\nand sustenance, listening to our bodies and allowing hunger and satisfaction cues to drive\nthe way we eat; will help us find balance. And eating a greater variety of foods, will\npoint us in a direction of better health.

"AGEGZKGmJvc": "am I getting wasted on Bourbon over here at Arby's let's keep this out YouTube and social media keep this out guys a tnk back again with another one for you jump on remove went to Arby's today a gang to take a look at one of three sandwiches that are signalling the return of that brown sugar bacon from last year only this time we've got some Kentucky bourbon sauce thrown into the mix that's right guys we've got some barrel-aged Kentucky Bourbon sauce being added to the brisket turkey and steak sandwiches over here at Arby's and since I've done the brisket sandwiches in the past I thought I would take a look at the steak version today I don't really get that too often so I thought I could gotta go and I got to tell you just from the bag itself this is very hefty we all know that Arby's has gotten meat Kraft unlock they definitely have the meats over here huh bomb sexy is this truly gonna be the bourbon bacon and steak well guys we're gonna take a look at that as we always do up close and personal and I've got plenty of horsey sauce to go here too so it's gonna be pretty awesome guys let's go in first to peep this out meat craft in effect over here at Arby's with the all-new bourbon bacon and steak let's take a look under this toasted specialty roll and see what we're gonna be sinking our teeth into all right as always over here at Arby's you get a nice portion of meat on the bottom and in this case we've got some of that nice angus steak right over there talked off with some of that smoked cheddar looking very very tasty always they're nice melted and gooey on top of that we've got some of their brown sugar bacon a return from last year very nice there but the big draw with this one guys aside from the return of that brown sugar bacon is the aged barrel Kentucky bourbon sauce that you're seeing on the very top of this bun here right now some more of that bacon looking very thick cut and finally to round it out as well as to add a little crunch to the mix we've got some crispy onions all along the top there guys this is looking pretty nice indeed the Bourbon bacon and steak over here at Arby's let's sink our teeth into it and see how bombs sexy it tastes definitely smelling a little sweet and smoky with little hint of Dijon which is another way of saying fancy mustard let's just give this a go and give this a shot right now the bourbon bacon and steak over here at Arby's mmm that angus steak definitely falls apart pretty quickly guys I'm getting a little bit of a hit of that Kentucky Bourbon sauce which is really that Dijon that you're gonna see on the very top over there so far not too much on the bacon front let me bite into that brown sugar bacon since I miss trying it last year there it is mmm it's pretty sweet definitely strong in that brown sugar tip guys it goes really well with the smoked cheddar that you're gonna see in there and a little bit of the crunch of those onions in there as well but overall I got a safe for the angus steak I know that they're known for the brisket over here at Arby's it's a little on the dry side just a little I guess I kind of expect that I mean the brisket is their signature right so the steak itself is a little on the dry side but I got to say the moisture that you're getting from that Kentucky Bourbon sauce along with the sweetness and the crispness of the bacon really does add to the overall package what you know about that horsey sauce baby let's crack into one of these packages right now and see if we can kick up that bourbon bacon and steak yeah it is going down today little horsey sauce action all right I'm excited already let's get it there it is oh yeah the bye to that horsey sauce along with that brown sugar bacon kicks it up ridiculous gang this is really something else and when you add that to that Kentucky Bourbon sauce that's in there aka the fancy Dijon mustard this is actually pretty awesome instantly gets points just because of the horsey alone mmm Oh ma'am let me just say I'm super glad they hooked me up with five additional horsey packs to go guys the horsey sauce kicks up the Bourbon bacon and steak pretty nicely pretty bomb sexy over here at Arby's some really nice flavors on this one guys the return of the brown sugar bacon from last year plays very very nicely with the newly introduced barrel aged Kentucky bourbon sauce aka the fancy mustard that's pretty much what it is I'm definitely not getting wasted off of it that is for sure but the flavor goes very nicely with the overall package there my only gripe with it is that the meat that I chose the steak over here at Arby's is not as moist and flavorful as the brisket and I guess that's to be expected because they're known for the brisket over here at Arby's but I do have to say the smoked cheddar does help out in that department adding a little bit of creaminess to the overall sandwich but the topper for me guys and I think you know this already is gonna be that horsey sauce this is the go-to condiment over here at Arby's it really lights it up it's got that bite it really brings out the overall flavors and when you combine everything together you're gonna get a pretty pretty satisfying sandwich guaranteed with that no matter which meat you choose so on that bomb sexy for your face scale of 1 to 10 I'm gonna have to give the Bourbon bacon and steak over here to RV's a strong 8 out of 10 it really does satisfy in the flavor Department a combination of that brown sugar bacon along with the barrel-aged Kentucky Bourbon really mixes together nicely and when you add that horsey sauce on top of it guys forget it it really doesn't matter what meat you choose that is just a very flavorful combination definitely give this one a shot over here at Arby's because it's worth your time and that's it for now gang this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out definitely getting horsey with it over here at Arby's taking a look at the

February). The earthquake struck the Canterbury Region\nin New Zealand's South Island and was centred two kilometres (1.2 mi) west of the port town\nof Lyttelton, and 10 kilometres (6 mi) south-east of the centre of Christchurch, at the time\nNew Zealand's second-most populous city. The earthquake caused widespread damage across\nChristchurch, killing 185 people in the nation's fifth-deadliest disaster. Christchurch's central city and eastern suburbs\nwere badly affected, with damage to buildings and infrastructure already weakened by the\nmagnitude 7.1 Canterbury earthquake of 4 September 2010 and its aftershocks. Significant liquefaction affected the eastern\nsuburbs, producing around 400,000 tonnes of silt. The earthquake was felt across the South Island\nand parts of the lower and central North Island. While the initial quake only lasted for approximately\n10 seconds, the damage was severe because of the location and shallowness of the earthquake's\nfocus in relation to Christchurch as well as previous quake damage. Subsequent population loss saw the Christchurch\nmain urban area fall behind the Wellington equivalent to decrease from second to third\nmost populous area in New Zealand. == Casualties ==\nOne hundred and eighty five people from more than 20 countries died in the earthquake. Over half of the deaths occurred in the six-storey\nCanterbury Television (CTV) Building, which collapsed and caught fire in the earthquake. A state of local emergency was initially declared\nby the Mayor of Christchurch, which was superseded when the government declared a state of national\nemergency, which stayed in force until 30 April 2011.Of the 185 victims, 115 people\ndied in the Canterbury Television building alone, while another 18 died in the collapse\nof PGC House, and eight were killed when masonry fell on Red Bus number 702 in Colombo Street. In each of these cases the buildings that\ncollapsed were known to have been appreciably damaged in the September 2010 earthquake but\nthe local authority had permitted the building to be re-occupied (CTV and PGC buildings)\nor protective barriers adjacent to them moved closer to areas at risk of falling debris\n(Colombo Street). An additional 28 people were killed in various\nplaces across the city centre, and twelve were killed in suburban Christchurch. Due to the injuries sustained some bodies\nremained unidentified. Between 6,600 and 6,800 people were treated\nfor minor injuries, and Christchurch Hospital alone treated 220 major trauma cases connected\nto the quake. Rescue efforts continued for over a week,\nthen shifted into recovery mode. The last survivor was pulled from the rubble\nthe day after the quake.The nationalities of the deceased are as follows. == Damage and effects == Road and bridge damage occurred and hampered\nrescue efforts. Soil liquefaction and surface flooding also\noccurred. Road surfaces were forced up by liquefaction,\nand water and sand were spewing out of cracks. A number of cars were crushed by falling debris. In the central city, two buses were crushed\nby falling buildings. Because the earthquake hit during the lunch\nhour, some people on the footpaths were buried by collapsed buildings. === Central city === Damage occurred to many older buildings, particularly\nthose with unreinforced masonry and those built before stringent earthquakes codes were\nintroduced. On 28 February 2011, the Prime Minister announced\nthat there would be an inquiry into the collapse of buildings that had been signed off as safe\nafter the previous earthquake on 4 September 2010, \"to provide answers to people about\nwhy so many people lost their lives.\"Of the 3,000 buildings inspected within the four\navenues of the central city by 3 March 2011, 45% had been given red or yellow stickers\nto restrict access because of the safety problems. Many heritage buildings were given red stickers\nafter inspections. As of February 2015, there had been 1240 demolitions\nwithin the four avenues since the September 2010 earthquakes.The six-storey Canterbury\nTelevision (CTV) building collapsed in the earthquake, leaving only its lift shaft standing,\nwhich caught fire. 115 people died in the building, which housed\na TV station, a medical clinic and an English language school. On 23 February police decided that the damage\nwas not survivable, and rescue efforts at the building were suspended. Fire-fighting and recovery operations resumed\nthat night, later joined by a Japanese search and rescue squad. Twelve Japanese students from the Toyama College\nof Foreign Languages died in the building collapse. A government report later found that the building's\nconstruction was faulty and should not have been approved. The four-storey Pyne Gould Guinness (PGC)\nHouse on Cambridge Terrace, headquarters of Pyne Gould Corporation, collapsed, with 18\ncasualties. On Wednesday morning, 22 hours after the quake,\na survivor was pulled from the rubble. The reinforced concrete building had been\nconstructed in 1963\u20131964.The Forsyth Barr Building survived the earthquake but many\noccupants were trapped after the collapse of the stairwells, forcing some to abseil\nout after the quake. Search of the building was technically difficult\nfor USAR teams, requiring the deconstruction of 4-tonne stair sets, but the building was\ncleared with no victims discovered.The earthquake destroyed the ChristChurch Cathedral's spire\nand part of its tower, and severely damaged the structure of the remaining building. The remainder of the tower was demolished\nin March 2012. The west wall suffered collapses in the June\n2011 earthquake and the December 2011 quake due to a steel structure \u2013 intended to stabilise\nthe rose window \u2013 pushing it in. The Anglican Church has decided to demolish\nthe building and replace it with a new structure \u2013 a decision which has become controversial\nin post-quake Christchurch. Various groups have opposed the Church's intentions,\nwith actions including taking a case to court. As of January 2015 the judgements have mostly\nbeen in favour of the Church, with one more judgement pending. No demolition has occurred since the removal\nof the tower in early 2012. Since 15 August 2013 the cathedral congregation\nhas worshipped at the Cardboard Cathedral. Christchurch Hospital was partly evacuated\ndue to damage in some areas, but remained open throughout to treat the injured. On 23 February, Hotel Grand Chancellor, Christchurch's\ntallest hotel, was reported to be on the verge of collapse. The 26-storey building was displaced by half\na metre in the quake and had dropped by 1 metre on one side; parts of the emergency\nstairwells collapsed. The building was thought to be irreparably\ndamaged and have the potential to bring down other buildings if it fell; an area of a two-block\nradius around the hotel was thus evacuated. The building was eventually stabilised and,\non 4 March it was decided the building would be demolished over the following six months,\nso that further work could be done with the buildings nearby. Demolition was completed in May 2012. The 21-storey PricewaterhouseCoopers building,\nthe city's tallest office tower, is among the office buildings to be demolished.The\nCarlton Hotel, a listed heritage building, was undergoing repairs after the September\n2010 earthquake damage when the February 2011 earthquake damaged the building further. It was deemed unstable and demolished in April\n2011. St Elmo Courts has been damaged in the September\n2010 earthquake and the owner intended to repair the building, but further damage caused\nby the February 2011 event resulted in a decision to demolish, which was done the following\nmonth.The historic Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings were severely damaged, with the\nStone Chamber completely collapsing.The second civic office building of Christchurch City\nCouncil, Our City, had already been damaged in the September earthquake and was heavily\nbraced following the February event. The Civic, the Council's third home, was heavily\ndamaged in February and is due to be demolished. Both Our City and the Civic are on the register\nof the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.The Catholic Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament\nwas also severely damaged, with the towers falling. A decision was made to remove the dome because\nthe supporting structure was weakened. Several other churches were seriously damaged,\nincluding: Knox Presbyterian Church, St Luke's Anglican Church, Durham Street Methodist Church,\nSt Paul's-Trinity-Pacific Presbyterian Church, Oxford Terrace Baptist Church, Holy Trinity\nAvonside and Holy Trinity, Lyttelton. Sydenham Heritage Church and the Beckenham\nBaptist Church were heavily damaged, and then demolished days after the earthquake. Concrete block construction fared badly, leaving\nmany modern iconic buildings damaged. === Suburbs ===\nOn 7 March, Prime Minister John Key said that around 10,000 houses would need to be demolished,\nand liquefaction damage meant that some parts of Christchurch could not be rebuilt on. LytteltonBuildings in Lyttelton sustained\nwidespread damage, with a fire officer reporting that 60% of the buildings in the main street\nhad been severely damaged. Two people died on local walking tracks after\nbeing hit by rockfalls. The town's historic Timeball Station was extensively\ndamaged, adding to damage from the preceding earthquake in September 2010. The station collapsed on 13 June 2011 after\na magnitude 6.4 aftershock. In 2013, it was announced that the tower and\nball would be restored, and that funds were to be sought from the community to rebuild\nthe rest of the station. SumnerLandslides occurred in Sumner, crushing\nbuildings. Parts of Sumner were evacuated during the\nnight of 22 February after cracks were noticed on a nearby hillside. Three deaths were reported in the Sumner area,\naccording to the Sumner Chief Fire Officer. The Shag Rock, a notable landmark, was reduced\nto half of its former height. RedcliffsIn contrast to the September 2010\nearthquake, Redcliffs and the surrounding hills suffered severe damage. The cliff behind Redcliffs School collapsed\nonto the houses below. Large boulders were found on the lawns of\ndamaged houses.Twelve streets in Redcliffs were evacuated on the night of 24 February\n2015 after some cliffs and hills surrounding Redcliffs were deemed unstable.Redcliffs Primary\nSchool, then located at 140 Main Road, right under the cliffs, was moved to Van Asch Deaf\nEducation Centre, 4.5km from the main site soon afterwards. After 7 years, the school is set to be moved\nto Redcliffs Park in 2020. The cost of the rebuild is set to be $16 million. === Beyond Christchurch ===\nThe quake was felt as far north as Tauranga and as far south as Invercargill, where the\n111 emergency network was rendered out of service. At the Tasman Glacier some 200 kilometres\n(120 miles) from the epicentre, around 30 million tonnes (33 million ST) of ice tumbled\noff the glacier into Tasman Lake, hitting tour boats with tsunami waves 3.5 metres (11\nft) high.KiwiRail reported that the TranzAlpine service was terminating at Greymouth and the\nTranzCoastal terminating at Picton. The TranzAlpine was cancelled until 4 March,\nto allow for personnel resources to be transferred to repairing track and related infrastructure,\nand moving essential freight into Christchurch, while the TranzCoastal has been cancelled\nuntil mid-August. KiwiRail also delayed 14 March departure of\nits Interislander ferry Aratere to Singapore for a 30-metre (98 ft) extension and refit\nprior to the 2011 Rugby World Cup. With extra passenger and freight movements\nover Cook Strait following the earthquake, the company would have been unable to cope\nwith just two ships operating on a reduced schedule so soon after the earthquake, so\npushed back the departure to the end of April.The earthquake combined with the urgency created\nby the unseasonably early break-up of sea ice on the Ross Ice Shelf caused logistical\nproblems with the return of Antarctic summer season research operations from Scott Base\nand McMurdo Station in Antarctica to Christchurch. === Population loss ===\nIn the year to June 2011, the population of Christchurch had fallen by 8,900 people or\n2.4% of its population, with a historic annual population growth of 1%. It is estimated that 10,600 people moved away\nfrom Christchurch, with the 1,700 people difference to the population loss explained through some\npeople moving to Christchurch. Statistics New Zealand expects Christchurch's\npopulation growth rate to return to pre-earthquake levels. The surrounding districts, Selwyn and Waimakariri,\nhave two of the three highest growth rates in New Zealand, at 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively.In\nOctober 2008, the population of the Christchurch main urban area, as defined by Statistics\nNew Zealand, had for the first time exceeded the Wellington equivalent (at 386,100 versus\n386,000), which made Christchurch the second largest city in New Zealand (after Auckland). The population loss caused by the earthquake\nreversed this, with the Wellington main urban area back in second position. Statistics New Zealand's main urban area definition\nfor Christchurch includes Kaiapoi, which belongs to Waimakariri District, and Prebbleton, which\nbelongs to Selwyn District. Porirua, Upper Hutt, and Lower Hutt, all outside\nof the Wellington City Council area, are included in the Wellington main urban area definition. Looking at territorial areas only, i.e. not\nincluding outlying urban areas from other districts, Christchurch continues to have\na significantly larger population over Wellington. == Geology == The 6.3-magnitude earthquake may have been\nan aftershock of the 7.1-magnitude 4 September 2010 Canterbury earthquake. New Zealand's GNS Science has stated that\nthe earthquake was part of the aftershock sequence that has been occurring since the\nSeptember magnitude-7.1 quake, however a seismologist from Geoscience Australia considers it a separate\nevent given its location on a separate fault system. According to GNS Science seismologists, the\nenergy released in Christchurch was equivalent to a magnitude 6.7 earthquake. Although smaller in magnitude than the 2010\nearthquake, the February earthquake was more damaging and deadly for a number of reasons. The epicentre was closer to Christchurch,\nand shallower at 5 kilometres (3 mi) underground, whereas the September quake was measured at\n10 kilometres (6 mi) deep. The February earthquake occurred during lunchtime\non a weekday when the CBD was busy, and many buildings were already weakened from the previous\nquakes. The peak ground acceleration (PGA) was extremely\nhigh, and simultaneous vertical and horizontal ground movement was \"almost impossible\" for\nbuildings to survive intact. Liquefaction was significantly greater than\nthat of the 2010 quake, causing the upwelling of more than 200,000 tonnes of silt which\nneeded to be cleared. The increased liquefaction caused significant\nground movement, undermining many foundations and destroying infrastructure, damage which\n\"may be the greatest ever recorded anywhere in a modern city\". 80% of the water and sewerage system was severely\ndamaged. FaultGNS Science stated that the earthquake\narose from the rupture of an 8 km x 8 km fault running east-northeast at a depth of 1\u20132\nkm beneath the southern edge of the Avon-Heathcote Estuary and dipping southwards at an angle\nof about 65 degrees from the horizontal beneath the Port Hills.\" While both the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes occurred\non \"blind\" or unknown faults, New Zealand's Earthquake Commission had, in a 1991 report,\npredicted moderate earthquakes in Canterbury with the likelihood of associated liquefaction. Intensity\nThe intensity felt in Christchurch was MM VIII. The peak ground acceleration (PGA) in central\nChristchurch exceeded 1.8g (i.e. 1.8 times the acceleration of gravity), with the highest\nrecording 2.2g, at Heathcote Valley Primary School, a shaking intensity equivalent to\nMM X+. This is the highest PGA ever recorded in New\nZealand; the highest reading during the September 2010 event was 1.26g, recorded near Darfield. The PGA is also one of the greatest-ever ground\naccelerations recorded in the world, and was unusually high for a 6.3 quake. and the highest in a vertical direction. The central business district (CBD) experienced\nPGAs in the range of 0.574 and 0.802 g. In contrast, the 7.0 Mw 2010 Haiti earthquake\nhad an estimated PGA of 0.5g. The acceleration occurred mainly in a vertical\ndirection, with eyewitness accounts of people being tossed into the air.The upwards (positive\nacceleration) was greater than the downwards, which had a maximum recording of 0.9g; the\nmaximum recorded horizontal acceleration was 1.7g The force of the earthquake was \"statistically\nunlikely\" to occur more than once in 1000 years, according to one seismic engineer,\nwith a PGA greater than many modern buildings were designed to withstand. Although the rupture was subsurface, satellite\nimages indicated that the net displacement of the land south of the fault was 50 cm westwards\nand upwards; the land movement would have been greater during the earthquake. Land movement was varied around the area horizontally\u2014in\nboth east and west directions\u2014and vertically; the Port Hills were raised by 40 cm.The earthquake\nwas a \"strike-slip event with oblique motion\" which caused mostly horizontal movement with\nsome vertical movement, with reverse thrust causing upwards vertical movement. The vertical acceleration was far greater\nthan the horizontal acceleration.The current New Zealand building code requires a building\nwith a 50-year design life to withstand predicted loads of a 500-year event. Initial reports by GNS Science suggested that\nground motion \"considerably exceeded even 2500-year design motions\", beyond maximum\nconsidered events (MCE). By comparison, the 2010 quake\u2014in which damage\nwas predominantly to pre-1970s buildings\u2014exerted 65% of the design loading on buildings. The acceleration experienced in February 2011\nwould \"totally flatten\" most world cities, causing massive loss of life; in Christchurch,\nNew Zealand's stringent building codes limited the disaster. It is also possible that \"seismic lensing\"\ncontributed to the ground effect, with the seismic waves rebounding off the hard basalt\nof the Port Hills back into the city. Geologists reported liquefaction was worse\nthan the 2010 earthquake. === Aftershocks ===\nThe earthquake generated a significant series of its own aftershocks, many of which were\nconsidered big for a 6.3 quake. More than 361 aftershocks occurred in the\nfirst week following the 6.3-magnitude earthquake. The largest was a 5.9-magnitude tremor which\noccurred just under two hours after the main earthquake. A 5.3-magnitude aftershock on 16 April, the\nlargest for several weeks, caused further damage, including power cuts and several large\nrock falls. An aftershock from the Greendale Fault measuring\n5.3 on the Richter scale hit the region on 10 May 2011. It cut power to homes and businesses for several\nminutes and caused further damage to buildings in the city centre. No deaths or injuries were reported. It was felt as far away as Dunedin and Greymouth. On 6 June, a large aftershock measuring 5.5\non the Richter scale occurred and was felt as far away as Kaikoura and Oamaru. A series of aftershocks occurred on 13 June. A tremor of 5.7 on the Richter scale was felt\nat 1 pm NZT, with a depth of 9 km, its epicentre at Taylors Mistake. A 6.3 tremor occurred just over an hour later,\nwith a depth of 6 km, located 10 km east of the city. Power was cut to around 54,000 homes, with\nfurther damage and liquefaction in already weakened areas. The Lyttelton Timeball Station collapsed and\nChristchurch Cathedral sustained more damage. At least 46 people were reported injured. These were followed by a magnitude 5.4 quake\nat a depth of 8 km and centred 10 km south-west of Christchurch at 10:34 pm on 21 June 2011.Below\nis a list of all aftershocks of Richter, moment, and body-wave magnitudes 5.0 and above that\noccurred in the region between 22 February 2011 and 15 January 2012. == Emergency management == Immediately following the earthquake, 80%\nof Christchurch was without power. Water and wastewater services were disrupted\nthroughout the city, with authorities urging residents to conserve water and collect rainwater. Prime Minister John Key confirmed that, \"All\nCivil Defence procedures have now been activated; the Civil Defence bunker at parliament is\nin operation here in Wellington.\" It was only the second time that New Zealand\nhad declared a national civil defence emergency; the first occasion was the 1951 waterfront\ndispute. The New Zealand Red Cross launched an appeal\nto raise funds to help victims. A full response management structure was put\nin place within minutes of the quake, with the Christchurch City Council's alternate\nEmergency Operations Centre re-established in the City Art Gallery and the regional Canterbury\nCDEM Group Emergency Coordination Centre (ECC) activated in its post-earthquake operational\nfacility adjacent to the Canterbury Regional Council offices. Within two hours of the quake national co-ordination\nwas operating from the National Crisis Management Centre located in the basement of the Beehive\nin Wellington.A composite \"Christchurch Response Centre\" was established in the Christchurch\nArt Gallery, a modern earthquake-resilient building in the centre of the city which had\nsustained only minor damage. On 23 February the Minister of Civil Defence,\nJohn Carter declared the situation a state of national emergency, the country's first\nfor a civil defence emergency (the only other one was for the 1951 waterfront dispute). Meanwhile, the Canterbury CDEM Group ECC had\nrelocated to the fully operational University of Canterbury Innovation (UCi3) building to\nthe West of the city, when the Copthorne Hotel adjacent to the Regional Council offices threatened\nto fall onto the offices and ECC. Once the composite Christchurch Coordination\nCentre was established on 23 February the CDEM Group Controllers and ECC personnel relocated\nto the City Art Gallery to supplement the management personnel available to the National\nController. As per the protocols of New Zealand's Coordinated\nIncident Management System, the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act, and the National\nCivil Defence Emergency Management Plan and Guide, Civil Defence Emergency Management\nbecame lead agency\u2014with the Director of the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency\nManagement John Hamilton as National Controller. CDEM were supported by local authorities,\nNew Zealand Police, Fire Service, Defence Force and many other agencies and organisations.Gerry\nBrownlee, a Cabinet Minister, had his regular portfolios distributed amongst other cabinet\nministers so that he could focus solely on earthquake recovery. === Establishment of Red Zone ===\nA Central City Red Zone was established on the day of the earthquake as a public exclusion\nzone in central Christchurch. Both COGIC, French Civil Protection and the\nAmerican USGS requested the activation of the International Charter on Space and Major\nDisasters on the behalf of MCDEM New Zealand, thus readily providing satellite imagery for\naid and rescue services. === Police ===\nChristchurch Police were supplemented by staff and resources from around the country, along\nwith a 323-strong contingent of Australian Police, who were sworn in as New Zealand Police\non their arrival, bringing the total number of officers in the city to 1200. Many of them received standing ovations from\nappreciative locals as they walked through Christchurch Airport upon arrival. Alongside regular duties, the police provided\nsecurity cordons, organised evacuations, supported search and rescue teams, missing persons and\nfamily liaison, and organised media briefings and tours of the affected areas. They also provided forensic analysis and evidence\ngathering at fatalities and Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) teams, working closely\nwith pathologists, forensic dentists and scientists, and the coroner at the emergency mortuary\nestablished at Burnham Military Camp. They were aided by DVI teams from Australia,\nUK, Thailand Taiwan and Israel. === Search and rescue === The New Zealand Fire Service coordinated search\nand rescue, with support from the Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) teams from New Zealand,\nAustralia, United Kingdom, United States, Japan, Taiwan, China and Singapore, totalling\n150 personnel from New Zealand and 429 from overseas. They also responded to fires, serious structural\ndamage reports, and landslides working with structural engineers, seismologists and geologists,\nas well as construction workers, crane and digger operators and demolition experts. NSW Task Force 1, a team of 72 urban search\nand rescue specialists from New South Wales, Australia was sent to Christchurch on two\nRAAF C-130 Hercules, arriving 12 hours after the quake. A second team of 70 from Queensland, Queensland\nTask Force 1, (including three sniffer dogs),was sent the following day on board a RAAF C-17\n. A team of 55 Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team members from the Singapore Civil Defence\nForce were sent. The United States sent Urban Search and Rescue\nCalifornia Task Force 2, a 74-member heavy rescue team consisting of firefighters and\nparamedics from the Los Angeles County Fire Department, doctors, engineers and 26 tons\nof pre-packaged rescue equipment. Japan sent 70 search-and-rescue personnel\nincluding specialists from the coastguard, police and fire fighting service, as well\nas three sniffer dogs. The team left New Zealand earlier than planned\ndue to the 9.0 earthquake which struck Japan on 11 March 2011. The United Kingdom sent a 53 strong search\nand rescue team including nine Welsh firefighters who had assisted the rescue effort during\nthe 2010 Haiti earthquake. Taiwan sent a 22-member team from the National\nFire Agency, along with two tons of specialist search and rescue equipment. China sent a 10-member specialist rescue team. === Defence forces ===\nThe New Zealand Defence Force\u2014staging their largest-ever operation on New Zealand soil\u2014\nprovided logistics, equipment, transport, airbridges, evacuations, supply and equipment\nshipments, survey of the Port and harbour, and support to the agencies, including meals;\nthey assisted the Police with security, and provided humanitarian aid particularly to\nLyttelton, which was isolated from the city in the first days. Over 1400 Army, Navy and Air Force personnel\nwere involved, and Territorials (Army Reserve) were called up. They were supplemented by 116 soldiers from\nthe Singapore Army, in Christchurch for a training exercise at the time of the earthquake,\nwho assisted in the cordon of the city. The Royal New Zealand Air Force provided an\nair bridge between Christchurch and Wellington using two Boeing 757 and three C-130 Hercules,\nand bringing in emergency crews and equipment and evacuating North Island residents and\ntourists out of Christchurch. One P-3 Orion was deployed in the initial\nstages of the disaster to provide images and photographs of the city. Three RNZAF Bell UH-1H Iroquois helicopters\nwere also used to transport Police, VIP's and aid to locations around Christchurch. Three RNZAF Beechcraft Super King Air aircraft\nwere also used to evacuate people from Christchurch. The crew of the Navy ship Canterbury, in Lyttelton\nharbour at the time of the earthquake, provided meals for 1,000 people left homeless in that\ntown, and accommodation for a small number of locals. The Royal Australian Air Force also assisted\nwith air lifts. On one of their journeys, an RAAF Hercules\nsustained minor damage in an aftershock.The army also operated desalination plants to\nprovide water to the eastern suburbs. === Medical services ===\nThe emergency department of Christchurch Hospital treated 231 patients within one hour of the\nearthquake. The department responded to the situation\nby activating their crisis plan, forming 20 trauma teams. After a downturn in demand, a second wave\nof patients started arriving, many with much more severe injuries. Staff were grateful that they did not have\nto employ triage, but were able to deal with all patients.A field hospital providing 75\nbeds was set up in the badly affected eastern suburbs on 24 February. It was equipped to provide triage, emergency\ncare, maternity, dental care, isolation tents for gastroenteritis, and to provide primary\ncare since most general practices in the area were unable to open.Australia's foreign minister\nKevin Rudd told Sky News that New Zealand's Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully had\nasked for further help from Australia. He said Australia would send counsellors over\nand a disaster medical assistance team comprising 23 emergency and surgical personnel. === Humanitarian and welfare services ===\nHumanitarian support and welfare were provided by various agencies, in particular the New\nZealand Red Cross and the Salvation Army. Welfare Centres and support networks were\nestablished throughout the city. Some government departments and church groups\nprovided grants and assistance. Some residents went several days without official\ncontact, so neighbours were encouraged to attend to those around them. Official visitation teams were organised by\nCivil Defence and there were engineers or assessors from EQC. The primarily wilderness all-volunteer search\nand rescue organisation, LandSAR, deployed 530 people to the city to perform welfare\nchecks. Over the course of a week, LandSAR teams visited\n67,000 premises. === Infrastructure and services === The 66 kV subtransmission cables supplying\nDallington and New Brighton zone substations from Transpower's Bromley substation were\ndamaged beyond repair, which necessitated the erection of temporary 66 kV overhead lines\nfrom Bromley to Dallington and Bromley to New Brighton to get power into the eastern\nsuburbs. Power had been restored to 82% of households\nwithin five days, and to 95% within two weeks. Electricity distribution operator Orion later\nstated the power outages caused by the earthquake added to 3261 SAIDI minutes, or equivalent\nto the entire city being without power for 54 hours and 21 minutes. == Response == On the day of the earthquake, Prime Minister\nJohn Key said that 22 February, \"...may well be New Zealand's darkest day\", and Mayor of\nChristchurch Bob Parker warned that New Zealanders are \"going to be presented with statistics\nthat are going to be bleak\".Generators were donated, and telephone companies established\nemergency communications and free calls. The army provided desalination plants, and\nbottled supplies were sent in by volunteers and companies. With limited water supplies for firefighting,\na total fire ban was introduced, and the fire service brought in water tankers from other\ncentres. Mains water supply was re-established to 70%\nof households within one week. Waste water and sewerage systems were severely\ndamaged. Thousands of portaloos and chemical toilets\nfrom throughout New Zealand and overseas were brought into the city. Community laundries were set up in affected\nsuburbs. Portable shower units were also established\nin the eastern suburbs.Thousands of people helped with the clean-up efforts\u2014involving\nthe removal of over 200,000 tonnes of liquefaction silt\u2014including Canterbury University's Student\nVolunteer Army which was created in response to the earthquake that September and the Federated\nFarmers' \"Farmy Army\". The \"Rangiora Earthquake Express\" provided\nover 250 tonnes of water, medical supplies, and food, including hot meals, from nearby\nRangiora by helicopter and truck. === International offers of support === Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard offered\nAustralia's assistance. The Australian Government also pledged A$5\nmillion (NZ$6.7 million) to the Red Cross Appeal. On 1 March, it was announced that the New\nSouth Wales Government would be donating A$1 million (NZ$1.3 million) to the victims of\nthe Christchurch earthquake.The UN and the European Union offered assistance. Kamalesh Sharma, Commonwealth Secretary-General,\nsent a message of support to the Prime Minister and stated \"our heart and condolences go immediately\nto the bereaved.\" He added that the thoughts and prayers of\nthe Commonwealth were with the citizens of New Zealand, and Christchurch especially.Sixty-six\nJapanese USAR members and three specialist search and rescue dogs arrived in Christchurch\nwithin two days of the February earthquake. They started work immediately in a multi-agency\nresponse to the collapse of the CTV Building on Madras Street. Many of the people trapped in that building\nwere Japanese and other foreign English language students.Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper\nreleased a statement saying: \"The thoughts and prayers of Canadians are with all those\naffected by the earthquake. Canada is standing by to offer any possible\nassistance to New Zealand in responding to this natural disaster.\"David Cameron, Prime\nMinister of the United Kingdom, issued a statement and sent SMS text messages to Commonwealth\nprime ministers. In his formal statement, he commented that\nthe loss of life was \"dreadful\" and the \"thoughts and prayers of the British people were with\nthem\".Ban Ki-Moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, issued a statement on behalf\nof the UN expressing his \"deep sadness\" and stressed the \"readiness of the United Nations\nto contribute to its efforts in any way needed\".China gave US$500,000 to the earthquake appeal,\nand Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao expressed his deep condolences to New Zealand. Twenty Chinese students were reported missing\nfollowing the quake. === Other messages of support ===\nThe Queen said she was \"utterly shocked\" and her \"thoughts were with all those affected\". Her son and heir to the New Zealand throne,\nThe Prince of Wales, also said to New Zealand's governor-general and prime minister: \"My wife\nand I were horrified when we heard the news early this morning... The scale of the destruction all but defies\nbelief when we can appreciate only too well how difficult it must have been struggling\nto come to terms with last year's horror ... Our deepest sympathy and constant thoughts are\nwith you and all New Zealanders.\"Barack Obama, President of the United States, issued a statement\nfrom the White House Press Office on the disaster by way of an official announcement that \"On\nbehalf of the American people, Michelle and I extend our deepest condolences to the people\nof New Zealand and to the families and friends of the victims in Christchurch, which has\nsuffered its second major earthquake in just six months... As our New Zealand friends move forward, may\nthey find some comfort and strength in knowing that they will have the enduring friendship\nand support of many partners around the world, including the United States.\" The President also made a call to Prime Minister\nKey.Pope Benedict XVI issued an announcement on the earthquake in a statement during his\nWednesday audience on 23 February, stating that he was praying for the dead and the injured\nvictims of the devastating earthquake, and encouraging those involved in the rescue efforts. === Fundraising and charity events ===\nVarious sporting events were set up to raise money, such as the \"Fill the Basin\" cricket\nmatch at the Basin Reserve, featuring ex-New Zealand internationals, All Blacks and actors\nfrom The Hobbit, which raised more than $500,000.New Zealand cricket team captain Daniel Vettori\nput his personal memorabilia up for auction.All Black Sonny Bill Williams and Sky Television\nboth made large donations from Williams' fourth boxing bout which was dubbed \"The Clash For\nCanterbury\".Several charity concerts were held both in New Zealand and overseas including\na previously unscheduled visit to New Zealand by American rock group Foo Fighters, who performed\na Christchurch benefit concert in Auckland on 22 March 2011. Local jazz flautist Miho Wada formed the ensemble\nMiho's Jazz Orchestra to raise money for recovery efforts. === Memorial services ===\nA national memorial service was held on 18 March at North Hagley Park, coinciding with\na one-off provincial holiday for Canterbury, which required the passing of the Canterbury\nEarthquake Commemoration Day Act 2011 to legislate. Prince William, made a two-day trip to the\ncountry to tour the areas affected by the earthquake, attended on the Queen's behalf\nand made an address during the service. New Zealand's governor-general, Sir Anand\nSatyanand, attended, along with John Key, Bob Parker, and a number of local and international\ndignitaries. Australia's official delegation included Governor-General\nQuentin Bryce, Prime Minister Julia Gillard, and Opposition Leader Tony Abbott. == Commission of Inquiry ==\nIn March 2011 the government established The Canterbury Earthquakes Royal Commission to\nreport on the causes of building failure as a result of the earthquakes as well as the\nadequacy of building codes and other standards for buildings in New Zealand Central Business\nDistricts. The Commission examined issues with specific\nreference to the Canterbury Television (CTV), Pyne Gould Corporation (PGC), Forsyth Barr\nand Hotel Grand Chancellor buildings. It excluded the investigation of any questions\nof liability, the earthquake search and rescue effort, and the rebuilding of the city. The Commission was chaired by High Court judge\nJustice Mark Cooper with support from two other Commissioners, engineers Sir Ron Carter\nand Professor Richard Fenwick. They took into account a technical investigation\nundertaken by the Department of Building and Housing.The inquiry began in April 2011 and\nwas completed in November 2012. The Royal Commission made a total of 189 recommendations\nand found that the Canterbury Television building should not have been granted a building permit\nby the Christchurch City Council. == Recovery == === \nCanterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority === On 29 March 2011, Prime Minister John Key\nand Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker announced the creation of the Canterbury Earthquake\nRecovery Authority (CERA) to manage the earthquake recovery, co-operating with the government,\nlocal councils and residents, under chief executive John Ombler. === Housing === With an estimated 10,000 houses requiring\ndemolition and over 100,000 damaged, plans were developed for moderate-term temporary\nhousing. Approximately 450 fully serviced mobile homes\nwould be located on sites across the city including Canterbury Agricultural Park and\nRiccarton Racecourse. The Department of Building and Housing also\nreleased a plan for the construction of 500 modular homes. While emergency repairs were performed on\ndamaged houses by Fletcher Construction, rebuilding would be delayed by the need for full land\nassessments, with the possibility that some of the worst-affected areas in the eastern\nsuburbs might need to be abandoned due to land depression and severe liquefaction, with\nthe residents offered relocation to new subdivisions under their EQC insurance policies. === Schools and universities ===\nOn the day of the earthquake, the main secondary school teachers' union, the Post Primary Teachers\nAssociation, had arranged a paid union meeting to be held that afternoon for members in the\nChristchurch area. This meant most secondary schools in the city\nhad closed early that day and most students had returned home before the earthquake hit,\nby coincidence limiting potential casualties.Canterbury University partially reopened on 14 March\n2011, with many lectures held in tents and marquees while work was carried out on university\nbuildings. All courses expected to resume by 28 March,\nwith plans for the April break to be shortened by two weeks to make up for lost time.The\nUC CEISMIC Canterbury Earthquakes Digital Archive programme was established in 2011\nby University of Canterbury Professor Paul Millar. It is a project of the Digital Humanities\ndepartment, with the aim of preserving the knowledge, memories and earthquake experiences\nof people of the Canterbury region.163 primary and secondary schools were affected by the\nearthquake, most of which were closed for three weeks; 90 had full structural clearance\nand were able to reopen, 24 had reports indicating further assessment and 11 were seriously damaged. Site-sharing plans were made to enable affected\nschools to relocate, while 9 \"learning hubs\" were established throughout the city to provide\nresources and support for students needing to work from home. Some students relocated to other centres \u2013 by\n5 March, a total of 4879 Christchurch students had enrolled in other schools across New Zealand. Wanaka Primary School alone had received 115\nnew enrolments as Christchurch families moved to their holiday homes in the town.Due to\nthe extensive damage of a number of secondary schools, many were forced to share with others,\nallowing one school to use the ground in the morning and the other in the afternoon. This included Shirley Boys' High School sharing\nwith Papanui High School, Linwood College sharing with Cashmere High School and Avonside\nGirls High School sharing with Burnside High School and Marian College sharing with St\nBedes College and Unlimited Paenga Tawhiti sharing with Halswell Residential College. Linwood College and Shirley Boys' High School\nmoved back to their original sites on 1 August (the first day of Term 3), and 13 September\n2011 respectively. Avonside Girls' High School returned to its\noriginal site at the start of 2012. Marian College did not return to the original\nsite in Shirley but instead moved to a site at Cathedral College on Barbadoes Street. Unlimited Paenga Tawhiti could not return\nto its central city buildings due to demolitions and it has no long term site. In September 2012, Minister of Education Hekia\nParata announced plans to permanently close and/or merge a number of schools due to falling\nroll numbers and quake damage. The proposals were heavily criticised for\nrelying on incorrect information, leading one school, Phillipstown Primary, to seek\na judicial review over its proposed merger with Woolston Primary. The court subsequently ruled in favour of\nPhillipstown and overturned the merger. The plans were confirmed in February 2013,\nwith seven schools closing, 10 schools merging into five (not including the overturned Phillipstown-Woolston\nmerger), and three high schools taking on additional year levels. == Other impact == === \nDisruptions to sport === Christchurch was set to host five pool matches\nand two quarter finals of the 2011 Rugby World Cup. The International Rugby Board and the New\nZealand Rugby World Cup organisers announced in March 2011 that the city would be unable\nto host the World Cup matches. The quarter final matches were moved to Auckland.New\nZealand Cricket's offices were damaged by the earthquake. Some matches needed to be rescheduled. The Super Rugby Round 2 match between the\nCrusaders and Hurricanes scheduled for 26 February 2011 at Westpac Stadium in Wellington\nwas abandoned. The Crusaders' first two home matches of the\nseason, originally to be played in Christchurch, were moved to Trafalgar Park in Nelson. The Crusaders played their entire home schedule\naway from Christchurch,. In the ANZ Netball Championship, the earthquake\ncaused significant damage to the Canterbury Tactix's main home venue, CBS Canterbury Arena,\nand the franchise's head office at Queen Elizabeth II Park. The team's round three match against the Northern\nMystics in Auckland was postponed, while their round four home match against the Waikato\nBay of Plenty Magic was moved to the Energy Events Centre in Rotorua. AMI Stadium was going to host the rugby league\nANZAC Test, however, on 4 March it was announced the match would be moved to Skilled Park on\nthe Gold Coast. The Canterbury Rugby League cancelled their\npre-season competition. The 2011 Inter Dominion harness racing series\nwas scheduled to be held at Addington Raceway in March and April however the series was\ninstead contested in Auckland. The public grandstand at Addington was later\ndemolished due to damage from the earthquake and aftershocks. === Economic impact ===\nIn April 2013 the Government estimated the total cost of the rebuild would be as much\nas $40 billion, up from an earlier estimate of $30 billion. Some economists have estimated it will take\nthe New Zealand economy 50 to 100 years to completely recover. The earthquake was the most damaging in a\nyear-long earthquake swarm affecting the Christchurch area. It was followed by a large aftershock on 13\nJune (which caused considerable additional damage) and a series of large shocks on 23\nDecember 2011. Finance Minister Bill English advised that\nthe effects of the 2011 quake were likely to be more costly than the September 2010\nquake. His advice was that the 2011 earthquake was\na \"new event\" and that EQC's reinsurance cover was already in place after the previous 2010\nevent. New Zealand's Earthquake Commission (EQC),\na government organisation, levies policyholders to cover a major part of the earthquake risk. The EQC further limits its own risk by taking\nout cover with a number of large reinsurance companies, for example Munich Re. The EQC pays out the first NZ$1.5 billion\nin claims, and the reinsurance companies are liable for all amounts between NZ$1.5 billion\nand NZ$4 billion. The EQC again covers all amounts above NZ$4\nbillion. EQC chief executive Ian Simpson said that\nthe $4 billion cap for each earthquake is unlikely to be exceeded by the costs of residential\nbuilding and land repairs, so $3 billion would be left in the EQC's Natural Disaster Fund\nafter payouts.Claims from the 2010 shock were estimated at NZ$2.75\u20133.5 billion. Prior to the 2010 quake, the EQC had a fund\nof NZ$5.93 billion according to the EQC 2010 Annual Report, with NZ$4.43 billion left prior\nto the 2011 quake, after taking off the NZ$1.5 billion cost.EQC cover for domestic premises\nentitles the holder to up to NZ$100,000 plus tax (GST) for each dwelling, with any further\namount above that being paid by the policyholder's insurance company. For personal effects, EQC pays out the first\nNZ$20,000 plus tax. It also covers land damage within 8 metres\nof a home; this coverage is uncapped.Commercial properties are not insured by the EQC, but\nby private insurance companies. These insurers underwrite their commercial\nlosses to reinsurers, who will again bear the brunt of these claims. JPMorgan Chase & Co say the total overall\nlosses related to this earthquake may be US$12 billion. That would make it the third most costly earthquake\nevent in history, after the 2011 Japan and 1994 California earthquakes.Earthquake Recovery\nMinister Gerry Brownlee echoed that fewer claims were expected through the EQC than\nfor 2010. In the 2010 earthquake, 180,000 claims were\nprocessed as opposed to the expected 130,000 claims for the 2011 aftershock. The total number of claims for the two events\nwas expected to be 250,000, as Brownlee explained that many of the claims were \"overlapping\".The\nAccident Compensation Corporation (ACC) announced it would be the largest single event they\nhad paid out for, with an estimated 7,500 injury claims costing over $200 million.On\n2 March 2011, John Key said he expected an interest rate cut to deal with the earthquake. The reaction to the statement sent the New\nZealand dollar down.In January 2013 Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee said repairs\nto damaged homes to date had totalled more than $1 billion.A KPMG survey in March 2013\nsuggested as much as $1.5 billion could be sucked from the rebuild in fraud.In March\n2013 a researcher at the University of Canterbury said after the quake, residents \u2013 particularly\nwomen \u2013 turned to comfort food and began eating unhealthily. === Cancellation of 2011 census ===\nThe chief executive of Statistics New Zealand, Geoff Bascand, announced on 25 February that\nthe national census planned for 8 March 2011 would not take place due to the disruption\nand displacement of people in the Canterbury region, and also the damage sustained by Statistics\nNew Zealand's buildings in Christchurch, which was scheduled to process much of the census. The cancellation required an amendment to\nthe Statistics Act 1975, which legally requires a census to be taken every five years. The Governor-General also had to revoke his\nprevious proclamation of the date of the census. It is the third time the census has been cancelled\nin New Zealand; the other occasions occurred in 1931, due to the Great Depression, and\nin 1941 due to World War II. Much of the NZ$90 million cost of the 2011\ncensus was written off. The census was ultimately deferred to 5 March\n2013. === Mental health === ==== \nNegative mental health impacts ==== The Christchurch earthquake of 2011 had widespread\nmental health effects on the population. Research following the Christchurch earthquakes\nhas shown that increasing exposure to the damage and trauma of a natural disaster is\ncorrelated with an increase in depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD). Those with the most exposure suffer the most\nfrom mental health deficits, compared with those that are relatively unaffected. Increases in trauma exposure are related to\nincreased dependence on alcohol and nicotine, as well as prescribed psychiatric medication. This information is important to consider\nwhen reacting to future earthquakes and other natural disasters. There is evidence that suggests that the mental\nhealth effects of natural disasters can be debilitating and detrimental to the community\naffected. ==== Positive mental health impacts ====\nEvidence from research on the Christchurch earthquakes reveals that increased trauma\nexposure is not exclusively correlated with negative outcomes. Those with relatively high exposure to earthquake\ndamage show an increase in positive effects, including an increase in personal strength,\ngrowth in social relationships, the bringing of families closer, and realizing what's important\nin life. It's thought that natural disasters, such\nas earthquakes, are able to induce these positive effects because they affect an entire community,\nin comparison to an event that targets only an individual. The damage on a community can lead members\nto engage in pro-social behaviors which are driven by empathy and desire to support others\nwho have endured a similar traumatizing experience. Positive effects, such as a greater sense\nof community connection, can aide in helping the community heal as a whole. Implemented programs can use this knowledge\nto help survivors focus on the positive effects, possibly working with families to help them\nget through the disaster with the people they feel closest with. ==== Predictors of mental health deficits\nfollowing trauma ==== Predictors of poor mental health after a trauma,\nsuch as mental health status prior to a trauma and individual characteristics, can help determine\nthose who will be more vulnerable to developing mental health problems. Those that exhibit lower mental health prior\nto an earthquake will be more likely to experience negative life changes than positive life changes\nwith regard to personal strength. Depressive symptoms before a disaster can\npredict higher chances of developing PTSD following a trauma. People who exhibit lower mental health prior\nto the trauma don't adapt as well following trauma, and show higher levels of PTSD. Personality traits, such as neuroticism and\nlow self-control are associated with a lower sense of normalcy following an earthquake,\nhowever optimism is predictive of lower and less severe PTSD symptoms. ==== Limitations of studying earthquakes and\nmental health effects ==== Studying earthquakes has shown to be a difficult\ntask when considering all the limitations created by natural disasters. Clinical interviews are difficult because\nof the widespread damage to infrastructure and roads, which leads to reliance on self-report. Self-report can introduce bias to results,\nleading to skewed data. Researchers are unable to reliably compare\nan individual's mental health status to their health status previous to the trauma because\nthey must rely on retrospective self-report. Retrospective self-report is affected greatly\nby the individual's current state of distress. The displacement of large numbers of citizens\nfollowing a trauma poses as a problem for researchers of natural disasters. It is predicted that the people who are displaced\nexperience the worst of the damage, and therefore the reported levels of PTSD and depression\nare often lower than they would have been had the displaced citizens been available\nto collect data from. Because large number of citizens are being\ndisplaced, it is difficult to find a representative sample population. For example, after the Christchurch earthquakes,\nstudies reported that older educated females of European New Zealand descent were over\nrepresented in their sample population, which isn't accurate of the Christchurch population\nas a whole. ==== Importance ====\nResearching the mental health effects of earthquakes and other disasters is important so communities\ncan heal properly after experiencing a traumatic event. This is a difficult topic to research because\nfixing the physical damage from a disaster is usually the first step a city takes towards\nrecovery. Each individual can react differently to traumatic\nevents, and more research needs to be done to learn how to predict vulnerability and\naccess the effects to find solutions that work best. Because it has been found that different demographics\nare affected differently, this also needs to be taken into account when finding solutions\nto aid recovery. Different demographics may benefit from different\ntypes of mental counseling to help them recover from trauma. It will be important to have information on\na wide variety of demographic groups because the same mental health treatment will not\nhelp all of those affected by a trauma. == Screen portrayals ==\nWhen A City Falls (2011): feature-length documentary about the 2010 and 2011 quakes in Christchurch\ndirected & produced by Gerard Smyth and released in cinemas in November 2011.

The earthquake struck the Canterbury Region\nin New Zealand's South Island and was centred two kilometres (1.2 mi) west of the port town\nof Lyttelton, and 10 kilometres (6 mi) south-east of the centre of Christchurch, at the time\nNew Zealand's second-most populous city. The earthquake caused widespread damage across\nChristchurch, killing 185 people in the nation's fifth-deadliest disaster. Christchurch's central city and eastern suburbs\nwere badly affected, with damage to buildings and infrastructure already weakened by the\nmagnitude 7.1 Canterbury earthquake of 4 September 2010 and its aftershocks. Significant liquefaction affected the eastern\nsuburbs, producing around 400,000 tonnes of silt. The earthquake was felt across the South Island\nand parts of the lower and central North Island. While the initial quake only lasted for approximately\n10 seconds, the damage was severe because of the location and shallowness of the earthquake's\nfocus in relation to Christchurch as well as previous quake damage. Subsequent population loss saw the Christchurch\nmain urban area fall behind the Wellington equivalent to decrease from second to third\nmost populous area in New Zealand. == Casualties ==\nOne hundred and eighty five people from more than 20 countries died in the earthquake. Over half of the deaths occurred in the six-storey\nCanterbury Television (CTV) Building, which collapsed and caught fire in the earthquake. A state of local emergency was initially declared\nby the Mayor of Christchurch, which was superseded when the government declared a state of national\nemergency, which stayed in force until 30 April 2011.Of the 185 victims, 115 people\ndied in the Canterbury Television building alone, while another 18 died in the collapse\nof PGC House, and eight were killed when masonry fell on Red Bus number 702 in Colombo Street. In each of these cases the buildings that\ncollapsed were known to have been appreciably damaged in the September 2010 earthquake but\nthe local authority had permitted the building to be re-occupied (CTV and PGC buildings)\nor protective barriers adjacent to them moved closer to areas at risk of falling debris\n(Colombo Street). An additional 28 people were killed in various\nplaces across the city centre, and twelve were killed in suburban Christchurch. Due to the injuries sustained some bodies\nremained unidentified. Between 6,600 and 6,800 people were treated\nfor minor injuries, and Christchurch Hospital alone treated 220 major trauma cases connected\nto the quake. Rescue efforts continued for over a week,\nthen shifted into recovery mode. The last survivor was pulled from the rubble\nthe day after the quake.The nationalities of the deceased are as follows. == Damage and effects == Road and bridge damage occurred and hampered\nrescue efforts. Soil liquefaction and surface flooding also\noccurred. Road surfaces were forced up by liquefaction,\nand water and sand were spewing out of cracks. A number of cars were crushed by falling debris. In the central city, two buses were crushed\nby falling buildings. Because the earthquake hit during the lunch\nhour, some people on the footpaths were buried by collapsed buildings. === Central city === Damage occurred to many older buildings, particularly\nthose with unreinforced masonry and those built before stringent earthquakes codes were\nintroduced. On 28 February 2011, the Prime Minister announced\nthat there would be an inquiry into the collapse of buildings that had been signed off as safe\nafter the previous earthquake on 4 September 2010, \"to provide answers to people about\nwhy so many people lost their lives.\"Of the 3,000 buildings inspected within the four\navenues of the central city by 3 March 2011, 45% had been given red or yellow stickers\nto restrict access because of the safety problems. Many heritage buildings were given red stickers\nafter inspections. As of February 2015, there had been 1240 demolitions\nwithin the four avenues since the September 2010 earthquakes.The six-storey Canterbury\nTelevision (CTV) building collapsed in the earthquake, leaving only its lift shaft standing,\nwhich caught fire. 115 people died in the building, which housed\na TV station, a medical clinic and an English language school. On 23 February police decided that the damage\nwas not survivable, and rescue efforts at the building were suspended. Fire-fighting and recovery operations resumed\nthat night, later joined by a Japanese search and rescue squad. Twelve Japanese students from the Toyama College\nof Foreign Languages died in the building collapse. A government report later found that the building's\nconstruction was faulty and should not have been approved. The four-storey Pyne Gould Guinness (PGC)\nHouse on Cambridge Terrace, headquarters of Pyne Gould Corporation, collapsed, with 18\ncasualties. On Wednesday morning, 22 hours after the quake,\na survivor was pulled from the rubble. The reinforced concrete building had been\nconstructed in 1963\u20131964.The Forsyth Barr Building survived the earthquake but many\noccupants were trapped after the collapse of the stairwells, forcing some to abseil\nout after the quake. Search of the building was technically difficult\nfor USAR teams, requiring the deconstruction of 4-tonne stair sets, but the building was\ncleared with no victims discovered.The earthquake destroyed the ChristChurch Cathedral's spire\nand part of its tower, and severely damaged the structure of the remaining building. The remainder of the tower was demolished\nin March 2012. The west wall suffered collapses in the June\n2011 earthquake and the December 2011 quake due to a steel structure \u2013 intended to stabilise\nthe rose window \u2013 pushing it in. The Anglican Church has decided to demolish\nthe building and replace it with a new structure \u2013 a decision which has become controversial\nin post-quake Christchurch. Various groups have opposed the Church's intentions,\nwith actions including taking a case to court. As of January 2015 the judgements have mostly\nbeen in favour of the Church, with one more judgement pending. No demolition has occurred since the removal\nof the tower in early 2012. Since 15 August 2013 the cathedral congregation\nhas worshipped at the Cardboard Cathedral. Christchurch Hospital was partly evacuated\ndue to damage in some areas, but remained open throughout to treat the injured. On 23 February, Hotel Grand Chancellor, Christchurch's\ntallest hotel, was reported to be on the verge of collapse. The 26-storey building was displaced by half\na metre in the quake and had dropped by 1 metre on one side; parts of the emergency\nstairwells collapsed. The building was thought to be irreparably\ndamaged and have the potential to bring down other buildings if it fell; an area of a two-block\nradius around the hotel was thus evacuated. The building was eventually stabilised and,\non 4 March it was decided the building would be demolished over the following six months,\nso that further work could be done with the buildings nearby. Demolition was completed in May 2012. The 21-storey PricewaterhouseCoopers building,\nthe city's tallest office tower, is among the office buildings to be demolished.The\nCarlton Hotel, a listed heritage building, was undergoing repairs after the September\n2010 earthquake damage when the February 2011 earthquake damaged the building further. It was deemed unstable and demolished in April\n2011. St Elmo Courts has been damaged in the September\n2010 earthquake and the owner intended to repair the building, but further damage caused\nby the February 2011 event resulted in a decision to demolish, which was done the following\nmonth.The historic Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings were severely damaged, with the\nStone Chamber completely collapsing.The second civic office building of Christchurch City\nCouncil, Our City, had already been damaged in the September earthquake and was heavily\nbraced following the February event. The Civic, the Council's third home, was heavily\ndamaged in February and is due to be demolished. Both Our City and the Civic are on the register\nof the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.The Catholic Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament\nwas also severely damaged, with the towers falling. A decision was made to remove the dome because\nthe supporting structure was weakened. Several other churches were seriously damaged,\nincluding: Knox Presbyterian Church, St Luke's Anglican Church, Durham Street Methodist Church,\nSt Paul's-Trinity-Pacific Presbyterian Church, Oxford Terrace Baptist Church, Holy Trinity\nAvonside and Holy Trinity, Lyttelton. Sydenham Heritage Church and the Beckenham\nBaptist Church were heavily damaged, and then demolished days after the earthquake. Concrete block construction fared badly, leaving\nmany modern iconic buildings damaged. === Suburbs ===\nOn 7 March, Prime Minister John Key said that around 10,000 houses would need to be demolished,\nand liquefaction damage meant that some parts of Christchurch could not be rebuilt on. LytteltonBuildings in Lyttelton sustained\nwidespread damage, with a fire officer reporting that 60% of the buildings in the main street\nhad been severely damaged. Two people died on local walking tracks after\nbeing hit by rockfalls. The town's historic Timeball Station was extensively\ndamaged, adding to damage from the preceding earthquake in September 2010. The station collapsed on 13 June 2011 after\na magnitude 6.4 aftershock. In 2013, it was announced that the tower and\nball would be restored, and that funds were to be sought from the community to rebuild\nthe rest of the station. SumnerLandslides occurred in Sumner, crushing\nbuildings. Parts of Sumner were evacuated during the\nnight of 22 February after cracks were noticed on a nearby hillside. Three deaths were reported in the Sumner area,\naccording to the Sumner Chief Fire Officer. The Shag Rock, a notable landmark, was reduced\nto half of its former height. RedcliffsIn contrast to the September 2010\nearthquake, Redcliffs and the surrounding hills suffered severe damage. The cliff behind Redcliffs School collapsed\nonto the houses below. Large boulders were found on the lawns of\ndamaged houses.Twelve streets in Redcliffs were evacuated on the night of 24 February\n2015 after some cliffs and hills surrounding Redcliffs were deemed unstable.Redcliffs Primary\nSchool, then located at 140 Main Road, right under the cliffs, was moved to Van Asch Deaf\nEducation Centre, 4.5km from the main site soon afterwards. After 7 years, the school is set to be moved\nto Redcliffs Park in 2020. The cost of the rebuild is set to be $16 million. === Beyond Christchurch ===\nThe quake was felt as far north as Tauranga and as far south as Invercargill, where the\n111 emergency network was rendered out of service. At the Tasman Glacier some 200 kilometres\n(120 miles) from the epicentre, around 30 million tonnes (33 million ST) of ice tumbled\noff the glacier into Tasman Lake, hitting tour boats with tsunami waves 3.5 metres (11\nft) high.KiwiRail reported that the TranzAlpine service was terminating at Greymouth and the\nTranzCoastal terminating at Picton. The TranzAlpine was cancelled until 4 March,\nto allow for personnel resources to be transferred to repairing track and related infrastructure,\nand moving essential freight into Christchurch, while the TranzCoastal has been cancelled\nuntil mid-August. KiwiRail also delayed 14 March departure of\nits Interislander ferry Aratere to Singapore for a 30-metre (98 ft) extension and refit\nprior to the 2011 Rugby World Cup. With extra passenger and freight movements\nover Cook Strait following the earthquake, the company would have been unable to cope\nwith just two ships operating on a reduced schedule so soon after the earthquake, so\npushed back the departure to the end of April.The earthquake combined with the urgency created\nby the unseasonably early break-up of sea ice on the Ross Ice Shelf caused logistical\nproblems with the return of Antarctic summer season research operations from Scott Base\nand McMurdo Station in Antarctica to Christchurch. === Population loss ===\nIn the year to June 2011, the population of Christchurch had fallen by 8,900 people or\n2.4% of its population, with a historic annual population growth of 1%. It is estimated that 10,600 people moved away\nfrom Christchurch, with the 1,700 people difference to the population loss explained through some\npeople moving to Christchurch. Statistics New Zealand expects Christchurch's\npopulation growth rate to return to pre-earthquake levels. The surrounding districts, Selwyn and Waimakariri,\nhave two of the three highest growth rates in New Zealand, at 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively.In\nOctober 2008, the population of the Christchurch main urban area, as defined by Statistics\nNew Zealand, had for the first time exceeded the Wellington equivalent (at 386,100 versus\n386,000), which made Christchurch the second largest city in New Zealand (after Auckland). The population loss caused by the earthquake\nreversed this, with the Wellington main urban area back in second position. Statistics New Zealand's main urban area definition\nfor Christchurch includes Kaiapoi, which belongs to Waimakariri District, and Prebbleton, which\nbelongs to Selwyn District. Porirua, Upper Hutt, and Lower Hutt, all outside\nof the Wellington City Council area, are included in the Wellington main urban area definition. Looking at territorial areas only, i.e. not\nincluding outlying urban areas from other districts, Christchurch continues to have\na significantly larger population over Wellington. == Geology == The 6.3-magnitude earthquake may have been\nan aftershock of the 7.1-magnitude 4 September 2010 Canterbury earthquake. New Zealand's GNS Science has stated that\nthe earthquake was part of the aftershock sequence that has been occurring since the\nSeptember magnitude-7.1 quake, however a seismologist from Geoscience Australia considers it a separate\nevent given its location on a separate fault system. According to GNS Science seismologists, the\nenergy released in Christchurch was equivalent to a magnitude 6.7 earthquake. Although smaller in magnitude than the 2010\nearthquake, the February earthquake was more damaging and deadly for a number of reasons. The epicentre was closer to Christchurch,\nand shallower at 5 kilometres (3 mi) underground, whereas the September quake was measured at\n10 kilometres (6 mi) deep. The February earthquake occurred during lunchtime\non a weekday when the CBD was busy, and many buildings were already weakened from the previous\nquakes. The peak ground acceleration (PGA) was extremely\nhigh, and simultaneous vertical and horizontal ground movement was \"almost impossible\" for\nbuildings to survive intact. Liquefaction was significantly greater than\nthat of the 2010 quake, causing the upwelling of more than 200,000 tonnes of silt which\nneeded to be cleared. The increased liquefaction caused significant\nground movement, undermining many foundations and destroying infrastructure, damage which\n\"may be the greatest ever recorded anywhere in a modern city\". 80% of the water and sewerage system was severely\ndamaged. FaultGNS Science stated that the earthquake\narose from the rupture of an 8 km x 8 km fault running east-northeast at a depth of 1\u20132\nkm beneath the southern edge of the Avon-Heathcote Estuary and dipping southwards at an angle\nof about 65 degrees from the horizontal beneath the Port Hills.\" While both the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes occurred\non \"blind\" or unknown faults, New Zealand's Earthquake Commission had, in a 1991 report,\npredicted moderate earthquakes in Canterbury with the likelihood of associated liquefaction. Intensity\nThe intensity felt in Christchurch was MM VIII. The peak ground acceleration (PGA) in central\nChristchurch exceeded 1.8g (i.e. 1.8 times the acceleration of gravity), with the highest\nrecording 2.2g, at Heathcote Valley Primary School, a shaking intensity equivalent to\nMM X+. This is the highest PGA ever recorded in New\nZealand; the highest reading during the September 2010 event was 1.26g, recorded near Darfield. The PGA is also one of the greatest-ever ground\naccelerations recorded in the world, and was unusually high for a 6.3 quake. and the highest in a vertical direction. The central business district (CBD) experienced\nPGAs in the range of 0.574 and 0.802 g. In contrast, the 7.0 Mw 2010 Haiti earthquake\nhad an estimated PGA of 0.5g. The acceleration occurred mainly in a vertical\ndirection, with eyewitness accounts of people being tossed into the air.The upwards (positive\nacceleration) was greater than the downwards, which had a maximum recording of 0.9g; the\nmaximum recorded horizontal acceleration was 1.7g The force of the earthquake was \"statistically\nunlikely\" to occur more than once in 1000 years, according to one seismic engineer,\nwith a PGA greater than many modern buildings were designed to withstand. Although the rupture was subsurface, satellite\nimages indicated that the net displacement of the land south of the fault was 50 cm westwards\nand upwards; the land movement would have been greater during the earthquake. Land movement was varied around the area horizontally\u2014in\nboth east and west directions\u2014and vertically; the Port Hills were raised by 40 cm.The earthquake\nwas a \"strike-slip event with oblique motion\" which caused mostly horizontal movement with\nsome vertical movement, with reverse thrust causing upwards vertical movement. The vertical acceleration was far greater\nthan the horizontal acceleration.The current New Zealand building code requires a building\nwith a 50-year design life to withstand predicted loads of a 500-year event. Initial reports by GNS Science suggested that\nground motion \"considerably exceeded even 2500-year design motions\", beyond maximum\nconsidered events (MCE). By comparison, the 2010 quake\u2014in which damage\nwas predominantly to pre-1970s buildings\u2014exerted 65% of the design loading on buildings. The acceleration experienced in February 2011\nwould \"totally flatten\" most world cities, causing massive loss of life; in Christchurch,\nNew Zealand's stringent building codes limited the disaster. It is also possible that \"seismic lensing\"\ncontributed to the ground effect, with the seismic waves rebounding off the hard basalt\nof the Port Hills back into the city. Geologists reported liquefaction was worse\nthan the 2010 earthquake. === Aftershocks ===\nThe earthquake generated a significant series of its own aftershocks, many of which were\nconsidered big for a 6.3 quake. More than 361 aftershocks occurred in the\nfirst week following the 6.3-magnitude earthquake. The largest was a 5.9-magnitude tremor which\noccurred just under two hours after the main earthquake. A 5.3-magnitude aftershock on 16 April, the\nlargest for several weeks, caused further damage, including power cuts and several large\nrock falls. An aftershock from the Greendale Fault measuring\n5.3 on the Richter scale hit the region on 10 May 2011. It cut power to homes and businesses for several\nminutes and caused further damage to buildings in the city centre. No deaths or injuries were reported. It was felt as far away as Dunedin and Greymouth. On 6 June, a large aftershock measuring 5.5\non the Richter scale occurred and was felt as far away as Kaikoura and Oamaru. A series of aftershocks occurred on 13 June. A tremor of 5.7 on the Richter scale was felt\nat 1 pm NZT, with a depth of 9 km, its epicentre at Taylors Mistake. A 6.3 tremor occurred just over an hour later,\nwith a depth of 6 km, located 10 km east of the city. Power was cut to around 54,000 homes, with\nfurther damage and liquefaction in already weakened areas. The Lyttelton Timeball Station collapsed and\nChristchurch Cathedral sustained more damage. At least 46 people were reported injured. These were followed by a magnitude 5.4 quake\nat a depth of 8 km and centred 10 km south-west of Christchurch at 10:34 pm on 21 June 2011.Below\nis a list of all aftershocks of Richter, moment, and body-wave magnitudes 5.0 and above that\noccurred in the region between 22 February 2011 and 15 January 2012. == Emergency management == Immediately following the earthquake, 80%\nof Christchurch was without power. Water and wastewater services were disrupted\nthroughout the city, with authorities urging residents to conserve water and collect rainwater. Prime Minister John Key confirmed that, \"All\nCivil Defence procedures have now been activated; the Civil Defence bunker at parliament is\nin operation here in Wellington.\" It was only the second time that New Zealand\nhad declared a national civil defence emergency; the first occasion was the 1951 waterfront\ndispute. The New Zealand Red Cross launched an appeal\nto raise funds to help victims. A full response management structure was put\nin place within minutes of the quake, with the Christchurch City Council's alternate\nEmergency Operations Centre re-established in the City Art Gallery and the regional Canterbury\nCDEM Group Emergency Coordination Centre (ECC) activated in its post-earthquake operational\nfacility adjacent to the Canterbury Regional Council offices. Within two hours of the quake national co-ordination\nwas operating from the National Crisis Management Centre located in the basement of the Beehive\nin Wellington.A composite \"Christchurch Response Centre\" was established in the Christchurch\nArt Gallery, a modern earthquake-resilient building in the centre of the city which had\nsustained only minor damage. On 23 February the Minister of Civil Defence,\nJohn Carter declared the situation a state of national emergency, the country's first\nfor a civil defence emergency (the only other one was for the 1951 waterfront dispute). Meanwhile, the Canterbury CDEM Group ECC had\nrelocated to the fully operational University of Canterbury Innovation (UCi3) building to\nthe West of the city, when the Copthorne Hotel adjacent to the Regional Council offices threatened\nto fall onto the offices and ECC. Once the composite Christchurch Coordination\nCentre was established on 23 February the CDEM Group Controllers and ECC personnel relocated\nto the City Art Gallery to supplement the management personnel available to the National\nController. As per the protocols of New Zealand's Coordinated\nIncident Management System, the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act, and the National\nCivil Defence Emergency Management Plan and Guide, Civil Defence Emergency Management\nbecame lead agency\u2014with the Director of the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency\nManagement John Hamilton as National Controller. CDEM were supported by local authorities,\nNew Zealand Police, Fire Service, Defence Force and many other agencies and organisations.Gerry\nBrownlee, a Cabinet Minister, had his regular portfolios distributed amongst other cabinet\nministers so that he could focus solely on earthquake recovery. === Establishment of Red Zone ===\nA Central City Red Zone was established on the day of the earthquake as a public exclusion\nzone in central Christchurch. Both COGIC, French Civil Protection and the\nAmerican USGS requested the activation of the International Charter on Space and Major\nDisasters on the behalf of MCDEM New Zealand, thus readily providing satellite imagery for\naid and rescue services. === Police ===\nChristchurch Police were supplemented by staff and resources from around the country, along\nwith a 323-strong contingent of Australian Police, who were sworn in as New Zealand Police\non their arrival, bringing the total number of officers in the city to 1200. Many of them received standing ovations from\nappreciative locals as they walked through Christchurch Airport upon arrival. Alongside regular duties, the police provided\nsecurity cordons, organised evacuations, supported search and rescue teams, missing persons and\nfamily liaison, and organised media briefings and tours of the affected areas. They also provided forensic analysis and evidence\ngathering at fatalities and Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) teams, working closely\nwith pathologists, forensic dentists and scientists, and the coroner at the emergency mortuary\nestablished at Burnham Military Camp. They were aided by DVI teams from Australia,\nUK, Thailand Taiwan and Israel. === Search and rescue === The New Zealand Fire Service coordinated search\nand rescue, with support from the Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) teams from New Zealand,\nAustralia, United Kingdom, United States, Japan, Taiwan, China and Singapore, totalling\n150 personnel from New Zealand and 429 from overseas. They also responded to fires, serious structural\ndamage reports, and landslides working with structural engineers, seismologists and geologists,\nas well as construction workers, crane and digger operators and demolition experts. NSW Task Force 1, a team of 72 urban search\nand rescue specialists from New South Wales, Australia was sent to Christchurch on two\nRAAF C-130 Hercules, arriving 12 hours after the quake. A second team of 70 from Queensland, Queensland\nTask Force 1, (including three sniffer dogs),was sent the following day on board a RAAF C-17\n. A team of 55 Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team members from the Singapore Civil Defence\nForce were sent. The United States sent Urban Search and Rescue\nCalifornia Task Force 2, a 74-member heavy rescue team consisting of firefighters and\nparamedics from the Los Angeles County Fire Department, doctors, engineers and 26 tons\nof pre-packaged rescue equipment. Japan sent 70 search-and-rescue personnel\nincluding specialists from the coastguard, police and fire fighting service, as well\nas three sniffer dogs. The team left New Zealand earlier than planned\ndue to the 9.0 earthquake which struck Japan on 11 March 2011. The United Kingdom sent a 53 strong search\nand rescue team including nine Welsh firefighters who had assisted the rescue effort during\nthe 2010 Haiti earthquake. Taiwan sent a 22-member team from the National\nFire Agency, along with two tons of specialist search and rescue equipment. China sent a 10-member specialist rescue team. === Defence forces ===\nThe New Zealand Defence Force\u2014staging their largest-ever operation on New Zealand soil\u2014\nprovided logistics, equipment, transport, airbridges, evacuations, supply and equipment\nshipments, survey of the Port and harbour, and support to the agencies, including meals;\nthey assisted the Police with security, and provided humanitarian aid particularly to\nLyttelton, which was isolated from the city in the first days. Over 1400 Army, Navy and Air Force personnel\nwere involved, and Territorials (Army Reserve) were called up. They were supplemented by 116 soldiers from\nthe Singapore Army, in Christchurch for a training exercise at the time of the earthquake,\nwho assisted in the cordon of the city. The Royal New Zealand Air Force provided an\nair bridge between Christchurch and Wellington using two Boeing 757 and three C-130 Hercules,\nand bringing in emergency crews and equipment and evacuating North Island residents and\ntourists out of Christchurch. One P-3 Orion was deployed in the initial\nstages of the disaster to provide images and photographs of the city. Three RNZAF Bell UH-1H Iroquois helicopters\nwere also used to transport Police, VIP's and aid to locations around Christchurch. Three RNZAF Beechcraft Super King Air aircraft\nwere also used to evacuate people from Christchurch. The crew of the Navy ship Canterbury, in Lyttelton\nharbour at the time of the earthquake, provided meals for 1,000 people left homeless in that\ntown, and accommodation for a small number of locals. The Royal Australian Air Force also assisted\nwith air lifts. On one of their journeys, an RAAF Hercules\nsustained minor damage in an aftershock.The army also operated desalination plants to\nprovide water to the eastern suburbs. === Medical services ===\nThe emergency department of Christchurch Hospital treated 231 patients within one hour of the\nearthquake. The department responded to the situation\nby activating their crisis plan, forming 20 trauma teams. After a downturn in demand, a second wave\nof patients started arriving, many with much more severe injuries. Staff were grateful that they did not have\nto employ triage, but were able to deal with all patients.A field hospital providing 75\nbeds was set up in the badly affected eastern suburbs on 24 February. It was equipped to provide triage, emergency\ncare, maternity, dental care, isolation tents for gastroenteritis, and to provide primary\ncare since most general practices in the area were unable to open.Australia's foreign minister\nKevin Rudd told Sky News that New Zealand's Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully had\nasked for further help from Australia. He said Australia would send counsellors over\nand a disaster medical assistance team comprising 23 emergency and surgical personnel. === Humanitarian and welfare services ===\nHumanitarian support and welfare were provided by various agencies, in particular the New\nZealand Red Cross and the Salvation Army. Welfare Centres and support networks were\nestablished throughout the city. Some government departments and church groups\nprovided grants and assistance. Some residents went several days without official\ncontact, so neighbours were encouraged to attend to those around them. Official visitation teams were organised by\nCivil Defence and there were engineers or assessors from EQC. The primarily wilderness all-volunteer search\nand rescue organisation, LandSAR, deployed 530 people to the city to perform welfare\nchecks. Over the course of a week, LandSAR teams visited\n67,000 premises. === Infrastructure and services === The 66 kV subtransmission cables supplying\nDallington and New Brighton zone substations from Transpower's Bromley substation were\ndamaged beyond repair, which necessitated the erection of temporary 66 kV overhead lines\nfrom Bromley to Dallington and Bromley to New Brighton to get power into the eastern\nsuburbs. Power had been restored to 82% of households\nwithin five days, and to 95% within two weeks. Electricity distribution operator Orion later\nstated the power outages caused by the earthquake added to 3261 SAIDI minutes, or equivalent\nto the entire city being without power for 54 hours and 21 minutes. == Response == On the day of the earthquake, Prime Minister\nJohn Key said that 22 February, \"...may well be New Zealand's darkest day\", and Mayor of\nChristchurch Bob Parker warned that New Zealanders are \"going to be presented with statistics\nthat are going to be bleak\".Generators were donated, and telephone companies established\nemergency communications and free calls. The army provided desalination plants, and\nbottled supplies were sent in by volunteers and companies. With limited water supplies for firefighting,\na total fire ban was introduced, and the fire service brought in water tankers from other\ncentres. Mains water supply was re-established to 70%\nof households within one week. Waste water and sewerage systems were severely\ndamaged. Thousands of portaloos and chemical toilets\nfrom throughout New Zealand and overseas were brought into the city. Community laundries were set up in affected\nsuburbs. Portable shower units were also established\nin the eastern suburbs.Thousands of people helped with the clean-up efforts\u2014involving\nthe removal of over 200,000 tonnes of liquefaction silt\u2014including Canterbury University's Student\nVolunteer Army which was created in response to the earthquake that September and the Federated\nFarmers' \"Farmy Army\". The \"Rangiora Earthquake Express\" provided\nover 250 tonnes of water, medical supplies, and food, including hot meals, from nearby\nRangiora by helicopter and truck. === International offers of support === Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard offered\nAustralia's assistance. The Australian Government also pledged A$5\nmillion (NZ$6.7 million) to the Red Cross Appeal. On 1 March, it was announced that the New\nSouth Wales Government would be donating A$1 million (NZ$1.3 million) to the victims of\nthe Christchurch earthquake.The UN and the European Union offered assistance. Kamalesh Sharma, Commonwealth Secretary-General,\nsent a message of support to the Prime Minister and stated \"our heart and condolences go immediately\nto the bereaved.\" He added that the thoughts and prayers of\nthe Commonwealth were with the citizens of New Zealand, and Christchurch especially.Sixty-six\nJapanese USAR members and three specialist search and rescue dogs arrived in Christchurch\nwithin two days of the February earthquake. They started work immediately in a multi-agency\nresponse to the collapse of the CTV Building on Madras Street. Many of the people trapped in that building\nwere Japanese and other foreign English language students.Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper\nreleased a statement saying: \"The thoughts and prayers of Canadians are with all those\naffected by the earthquake. Canada is standing by to offer any possible\nassistance to New Zealand in responding to this natural disaster.\"David Cameron, Prime\nMinister of the United Kingdom, issued a statement and sent SMS text messages to Commonwealth\nprime ministers. In his formal statement, he commented that\nthe loss of life was \"dreadful\" and the \"thoughts and prayers of the British people were with\nthem\".Ban Ki-Moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, issued a statement on behalf\nof the UN expressing his \"deep sadness\" and stressed the \"readiness of the United Nations\nto contribute to its efforts in any way needed\".China gave US$500,000 to the earthquake appeal,\nand Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao expressed his deep condolences to New Zealand. Twenty Chinese students were reported missing\nfollowing the quake. === Other messages of support ===\nThe Queen said she was \"utterly shocked\" and her \"thoughts were with all those affected\". Her son and heir to the New Zealand throne,\nThe Prince of Wales, also said to New Zealand's governor-general and prime minister: \"My wife\nand I were horrified when we heard the news early this morning... The scale of the destruction all but defies\nbelief when we can appreciate only too well how difficult it must have been struggling\nto come to terms with last year's horror ... Our deepest sympathy and constant thoughts are\nwith you and all New Zealanders.\"Barack Obama, President of the United States, issued a statement\nfrom the White House Press Office on the disaster by way of an official announcement that \"On\nbehalf of the American people, Michelle and I extend our deepest condolences to the people\nof New Zealand and to the families and friends of the victims in Christchurch, which has\nsuffered its second major earthquake in just six months... As our New Zealand friends move forward, may\nthey find some comfort and strength in knowing that they will have the enduring friendship\nand support of many partners around the world, including the United States.\" The President also made a call to Prime Minister\nKey.Pope Benedict XVI issued an announcement on the earthquake in a statement during his\nWednesday audience on 23 February, stating that he was praying for the dead and the injured\nvictims of the devastating earthquake, and encouraging those involved in the rescue efforts. === Fundraising and charity events ===\nVarious sporting events were set up to raise money, such as the \"Fill the Basin\" cricket\nmatch at the Basin Reserve, featuring ex-New Zealand internationals, All Blacks and actors\nfrom The Hobbit, which raised more than $500,000.New Zealand cricket team captain Daniel Vettori\nput his personal memorabilia up for auction.All Black Sonny Bill Williams and Sky Television\nboth made large donations from Williams' fourth boxing bout which was dubbed \"The Clash For\nCanterbury\".Several charity concerts were held both in New Zealand and overseas including\na previously unscheduled visit to New Zealand by American rock group Foo Fighters, who performed\na Christchurch benefit concert in Auckland on 22 March 2011. Local jazz flautist Miho Wada formed the ensemble\nMiho's Jazz Orchestra to raise money for recovery efforts. === Memorial services ===\nA national memorial service was held on 18 March at North Hagley Park, coinciding with\na one-off provincial holiday for Canterbury, which required the passing of the Canterbury\nEarthquake Commemoration Day Act 2011 to legislate. Prince William, made a two-day trip to the\ncountry to tour the areas affected by the earthquake, attended on the Queen's behalf\nand made an address during the service. New Zealand's governor-general, Sir Anand\nSatyanand, attended, along with John Key, Bob Parker, and a number of local and international\ndignitaries. Australia's official delegation included Governor-General\nQuentin Bryce, Prime Minister Julia Gillard, and Opposition Leader Tony Abbott. == Commission of Inquiry ==\nIn March 2011 the government established The Canterbury Earthquakes Royal Commission to\nreport on the causes of building failure as a result of the earthquakes as well as the\nadequacy of building codes and other standards for buildings in New Zealand Central Business\nDistricts. The Commission examined issues with specific\nreference to the Canterbury Television (CTV), Pyne Gould Corporation (PGC), Forsyth Barr\nand Hotel Grand Chancellor buildings. It excluded the investigation of any questions\nof liability, the earthquake search and rescue effort, and the rebuilding of the city. The Commission was chaired by High Court judge\nJustice Mark Cooper with support from two other Commissioners, engineers Sir Ron Carter\nand Professor Richard Fenwick. They took into account a technical investigation\nundertaken by the Department of Building and Housing.The inquiry began in April 2011 and\nwas completed in November 2012. The Royal Commission made a total of 189 recommendations\nand found that the Canterbury Television building should not have been granted a building permit\nby the Christchurch City Council. == Recovery == === \nCanterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority === On 29 March 2011, Prime Minister John Key\nand Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker announced the creation of the Canterbury Earthquake\nRecovery Authority (CERA) to manage the earthquake recovery, co-operating with the government,\nlocal councils and residents, under chief executive John Ombler. === Housing === With an estimated 10,000 houses requiring\ndemolition and over 100,000 damaged, plans were developed for moderate-term temporary\nhousing. Approximately 450 fully serviced mobile homes\nwould be located on sites across the city including Canterbury Agricultural Park and\nRiccarton Racecourse. The Department of Building and Housing also\nreleased a plan for the construction of 500 modular homes. While emergency repairs were performed on\ndamaged houses by Fletcher Construction, rebuilding would be delayed by the need for full land\nassessments, with the possibility that some of the worst-affected areas in the eastern\nsuburbs might need to be abandoned due to land depression and severe liquefaction, with\nthe residents offered relocation to new subdivisions under their EQC insurance policies. === Schools and universities ===\nOn the day of the earthquake, the main secondary school teachers' union, the Post Primary Teachers\nAssociation, had arranged a paid union meeting to be held that afternoon for members in the\nChristchurch area. This meant most secondary schools in the city\nhad closed early that day and most students had returned home before the earthquake hit,\nby coincidence limiting potential casualties.Canterbury University partially reopened on 14 March\n2011, with many lectures held in tents and marquees while work was carried out on university\nbuildings. All courses expected to resume by 28 March,\nwith plans for the April break to be shortened by two weeks to make up for lost time.The\nUC CEISMIC Canterbury Earthquakes Digital Archive programme was established in 2011\nby University of Canterbury Professor Paul Millar. It is a project of the Digital Humanities\ndepartment, with the aim of preserving the knowledge, memories and earthquake experiences\nof people of the Canterbury region.163 primary and secondary schools were affected by the\nearthquake, most of which were closed for three weeks; 90 had full structural clearance\nand were able to reopen, 24 had reports indicating further assessment and 11 were seriously damaged. Site-sharing plans were made to enable affected\nschools to relocate, while 9 \"learning hubs\" were established throughout the city to provide\nresources and support for students needing to work from home. Some students relocated to other centres \u2013 by\n5 March, a total of 4879 Christchurch students had enrolled in other schools across New Zealand. Wanaka Primary School alone had received 115\nnew enrolments as Christchurch families moved to their holiday homes in the town.Due to\nthe extensive damage of a number of secondary schools, many were forced to share with others,\nallowing one school to use the ground in the morning and the other in the afternoon. This included Shirley Boys' High School sharing\nwith Papanui High School, Linwood College sharing with Cashmere High School and Avonside\nGirls High School sharing with Burnside High School and Marian College sharing with St\nBedes College and Unlimited Paenga Tawhiti sharing with Halswell Residential College. Linwood College and Shirley Boys' High School\nmoved back to their original sites on 1 August (the first day of Term 3), and 13 September\n2011 respectively. Avonside Girls' High School returned to its\noriginal site at the start of 2012. Marian College did not return to the original\nsite in Shirley but instead moved to a site at Cathedral College on Barbadoes Street. Unlimited Paenga Tawhiti could not return\nto its central city buildings due to demolitions and it has no long term site. In September 2012, Minister of Education Hekia\nParata announced plans to permanently close and/or merge a number of schools due to falling\nroll numbers and quake damage. The proposals were heavily criticised for\nrelying on incorrect information, leading one school, Phillipstown Primary, to seek\na judicial review over its proposed merger with Woolston Primary. The court subsequently ruled in favour of\nPhillipstown and overturned the merger. The plans were confirmed in February 2013,\nwith seven schools closing, 10 schools merging into five (not including the overturned Phillipstown-Woolston\nmerger), and three high schools taking on additional year levels. == Other impact == === \nDisruptions to sport === Christchurch was set to host five pool matches\nand two quarter finals of the 2011 Rugby World Cup. The International Rugby Board and the New\nZealand Rugby World Cup organisers announced in March 2011 that the city would be unable\nto host the World Cup matches. The quarter final matches were moved to Auckland.New\nZealand Cricket's offices were damaged by the earthquake. Some matches needed to be rescheduled. The Super Rugby Round 2 match between the\nCrusaders and Hurricanes scheduled for 26 February 2011 at Westpac Stadium in Wellington\nwas abandoned. The Crusaders' first two home matches of the\nseason, originally to be played in Christchurch, were moved to Trafalgar Park in Nelson. The Crusaders played their entire home schedule\naway from Christchurch,. In the ANZ Netball Championship, the earthquake\ncaused significant damage to the Canterbury Tactix's main home venue, CBS Canterbury Arena,\nand the franchise's head office at Queen Elizabeth II Park. The team's round three match against the Northern\nMystics in Auckland was postponed, while their round four home match against the Waikato\nBay of Plenty Magic was moved to the Energy Events Centre in Rotorua. AMI Stadium was going to host the rugby league\nANZAC Test, however, on 4 March it was announced the match would be moved to Skilled Park on\nthe Gold Coast. The Canterbury Rugby League cancelled their\npre-season competition. The 2011 Inter Dominion harness racing series\nwas scheduled to be held at Addington Raceway in March and April however the series was\ninstead contested in Auckland. The public grandstand at Addington was later\ndemolished due to damage from the earthquake and aftershocks. === Economic impact ===\nIn April 2013 the Government estimated the total cost of the rebuild would be as much\nas $40 billion, up from an earlier estimate of $30 billion. Some economists have estimated it will take\nthe New Zealand economy 50 to 100 years to completely recover. The earthquake was the most damaging in a\nyear-long earthquake swarm affecting the Christchurch area. It was followed by a large aftershock on 13\nJune (which caused considerable additional damage) and a series of large shocks on 23\nDecember 2011. Finance Minister Bill English advised that\nthe effects of the 2011 quake were likely to be more costly than the September 2010\nquake. His advice was that the 2011 earthquake was\na \"new event\" and that EQC's reinsurance cover was already in place after the previous 2010\nevent. New Zealand's Earthquake Commission (EQC),\na government organisation, levies policyholders to cover a major part of the earthquake risk. The EQC further limits its own risk by taking\nout cover with a number of large reinsurance companies, for example Munich Re. The EQC pays out the first NZ$1.5 billion\nin claims, and the reinsurance companies are liable for all amounts between NZ$1.5 billion\nand NZ$4 billion. The EQC again covers all amounts above NZ$4\nbillion. EQC chief executive Ian Simpson said that\nthe $4 billion cap for each earthquake is unlikely to be exceeded by the costs of residential\nbuilding and land repairs, so $3 billion would be left in the EQC's Natural Disaster Fund\nafter payouts.Claims from the 2010 shock were estimated at NZ$2.75\u20133.5 billion. Prior to the 2010 quake, the EQC had a fund\nof NZ$5.93 billion according to the EQC 2010 Annual Report, with NZ$4.43 billion left prior\nto the 2011 quake, after taking off the NZ$1.5 billion cost.EQC cover for domestic premises\nentitles the holder to up to NZ$100,000 plus tax (GST) for each dwelling, with any further\namount above that being paid by the policyholder's insurance company. For personal effects, EQC pays out the first\nNZ$20,000 plus tax. It also covers land damage within 8 metres\nof a home; this coverage is uncapped.Commercial properties are not insured by the EQC, but\nby private insurance companies. These insurers underwrite their commercial\nlosses to reinsurers, who will again bear the brunt of these claims. JPMorgan Chase & Co say the total overall\nlosses related to this earthquake may be US$12 billion. That would make it the third most costly earthquake\nevent in history, after the 2011 Japan and 1994 California earthquakes.Earthquake Recovery\nMinister Gerry Brownlee echoed that fewer claims were expected through the EQC than\nfor 2010. In the 2010 earthquake, 180,000 claims were\nprocessed as opposed to the expected 130,000 claims for the 2011 aftershock. The total number of claims for the two events\nwas expected to be 250,000, as Brownlee explained that many of the claims were \"overlapping\".The\nAccident Compensation Corporation (ACC) announced it would be the largest single event they\nhad paid out for, with an estimated 7,500 injury claims costing over $200 million.On\n2 March 2011, John Key said he expected an interest rate cut to deal with the earthquake. The reaction to the statement sent the New\nZealand dollar down.In January 2013 Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee said repairs\nto damaged homes to date had totalled more than $1 billion.A KPMG survey in March 2013\nsuggested as much as $1.5 billion could be sucked from the rebuild in fraud.In March\n2013 a researcher at the University of Canterbury said after the quake, residents \u2013 particularly\nwomen \u2013 turned to comfort food and began eating unhealthily. === Cancellation of 2011 census ===\nThe chief executive of Statistics New Zealand, Geoff Bascand, announced on 25 February that\nthe national census planned for 8 March 2011 would not take place due to the disruption\nand displacement of people in the Canterbury region, and also the damage sustained by Statistics\nNew Zealand's buildings in Christchurch, which was scheduled to process much of the census. The cancellation required an amendment to\nthe Statistics Act 1975, which legally requires a census to be taken every five years. The Governor-General also had to revoke his\nprevious proclamation of the date of the census. It is the third time the census has been cancelled\nin New Zealand; the other occasions occurred in 1931, due to the Great Depression, and\nin 1941 due to World War II. Much of the NZ$90 million cost of the 2011\ncensus was written off. The census was ultimately deferred to 5 March\n2013. === Mental health === ==== \nNegative mental health impacts ==== The Christchurch earthquake of 2011 had widespread\nmental health effects on the population. Research following the Christchurch earthquakes\nhas shown that increasing exposure to the damage and trauma of a natural disaster is\ncorrelated with an increase in depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD). Those with the most exposure suffer the most\nfrom mental health deficits, compared with those that are relatively unaffected. Increases in trauma exposure are related to\nincreased dependence on alcohol and nicotine, as well as prescribed psychiatric medication. This information is important to consider\nwhen reacting to future earthquakes and other natural disasters. There is evidence that suggests that the mental\nhealth effects of natural disasters can be debilitating and detrimental to the community\naffected. ==== Positive mental health impacts ====\nEvidence from research on the Christchurch earthquakes reveals that increased trauma\nexposure is not exclusively correlated with negative outcomes. Those with relatively high exposure to earthquake\ndamage show an increase in positive effects, including an increase in personal strength,\ngrowth in social relationships, the bringing of families closer, and realizing what's important\nin life. It's thought that natural disasters, such\nas earthquakes, are able to induce these positive effects because they affect an entire community,\nin comparison to an event that targets only an individual. The damage on a community can lead members\nto engage in pro-social behaviors which are driven by empathy and desire to support others\nwho have endured a similar traumatizing experience. Positive effects, such as a greater sense\nof community connection, can aide in helping the community heal as a whole. Implemented programs can use this knowledge\nto help survivors focus on the positive effects, possibly working with families to help them\nget through the disaster with the people they feel closest with. ==== Predictors of mental health deficits\nfollowing trauma ==== Predictors of poor mental health after a trauma,\nsuch as mental health status prior to a trauma and individual characteristics, can help determine\nthose who will be more vulnerable to developing mental health problems. Those that exhibit lower mental health prior\nto an earthquake will be more likely to experience negative life changes than positive life changes\nwith regard to personal strength. Depressive symptoms before a disaster can\npredict higher chances of developing PTSD following a trauma. People who exhibit lower mental health prior\nto the trauma don't adapt as well following trauma, and show higher levels of PTSD. Personality traits, such as neuroticism and\nlow self-control are associated with a lower sense of normalcy following an earthquake,\nhowever optimism is predictive of lower and less severe PTSD symptoms. ==== Limitations of studying earthquakes and\nmental health effects ==== Studying earthquakes has shown to be a difficult\ntask when considering all the limitations created by natural disasters. Clinical interviews are difficult because\nof the widespread damage to infrastructure and roads, which leads to reliance on self-report. Self-report can introduce bias to results,\nleading to skewed data. Researchers are unable to reliably compare\nan individual's mental health status to their health status previous to the trauma because\nthey must rely on retrospective self-report. Retrospective self-report is affected greatly\nby the individual's current state of distress. The displacement of large numbers of citizens\nfollowing a trauma poses as a problem for researchers of natural disasters. It is predicted that the people who are displaced\nexperience the worst of the damage, and therefore the reported levels of PTSD and depression\nare often lower than they would have been had the displaced citizens been available\nto collect data from. Because large number of citizens are being\ndisplaced, it is difficult to find a representative sample population. For example, after the Christchurch earthquakes,\nstudies reported that older educated females of European New Zealand descent were over\nrepresented in their sample population, which isn't accurate of the Christchurch population\nas a whole. ==== Importance ====\nResearching the mental health effects of earthquakes and other disasters is important so communities\ncan heal properly after experiencing a traumatic event. This is a difficult topic to research because\nfixing the physical damage from a disaster is usually the first step a city takes towards\nrecovery. Each individual can react differently to traumatic\nevents, and more research needs to be done to learn how to predict vulnerability and\naccess the effects to find solutions that work best. Because it has been found that different demographics\nare affected differently, this also needs to be taken into account when finding solutions\nto aid recovery. Different demographics may benefit from different\ntypes of mental counseling to help them recover from trauma. It will be important to have information on\na wide variety of demographic groups because the same mental health treatment will not\nhelp all of those affected by a trauma. == Screen portrayals ==\nWhen A City Falls (2011): feature-length documentary about the 2010 and 2011 quakes in Christchurch\ndirected & produced by Gerard Smyth and released in cinemas in November 2011.

citrus psyllid task force i always work in the community of ojai truly is indispensable emily lives in the east end newsom ranch in ojai with her husband tony and their two children oliver and celeste thanks for joining us today emily so for those who've never been to ojai can you help paint a picture and share some insight on where our pixies come from sure ojai is an hour and a half north of los angeles so we're pretty close to the metropolitan center the town of ojai is quite small just several blocks long the valley as a whole is about 30 000 people we have more orange trees more pixy trees than people going back to my great-great-grandmother so i'm fifth generation and my kids are sixth generation both my parents were born here several of my grandparents and we're still farming the same land that my great grandparents purchased back at the turn of the century i love the ohio valley it's a beautiful place and i think it's really important to keep our lands unurbanized it's good for the environment captures rain water which we're always in short supply of of water in southern california so it's important to keep open spaces they also serve as a protection for wildland fire my dad started planting more pixy trees when i was a child because he realized my brother and i would eat them all up and so he needed more pixies to sell at farmers markets and people were looking for other things to plant and my dad and jim churchill bob davis mike shore they all planted a few more pixies and then you know late 80s there was too many pixies to sell locally and at farmers markets and places where people knew us and knew pixies and so we needed to group together to have enough pixies and i think that first year was like 40 cartons and jim churchill took them down to los angeles and started knocking on doors and trying to find someone to buy them and there were you know there were some pixies from our orchard and some from bob davis's and some from mike shores and gyms and uh we got melissa was interested um they're they're not the prettiest fruit i brought a few here they're small they're kind of pebbly skinned so you need to get people to peel one and eat them and then they will buy them because they're just deliciously sweet the best way to tell that pixies are getting ripe is to look on the floor of my car because that is where my children throw their peels and the closer we get the more appeals there are the flavor is here on these pixies um and this is kind of the typical size of the pixies this year they're smaller but we need to wait until the peel is loose enough to really easily come off um and the color needs to be there so it's hard to tell on a zoom meeting but there's still a little bit of green on this one so we'll start harvesting the last few days of february get the fruit out and packaged and on its way to stores for march 1st that's the goal so we use the same labor contractor we've always used they will come out and pick the pixies into thousand pound bins pixies then get taken by forklift onto a truck we'll pick about anywhere between 40 and 150 bins a day so we don't pick anything until we have an order for it so we have the order in place we pick it the next day we pack it and it is shipped out that same day so it gets to the wholesaler you know within two days of being picked so we don't wax the fruit at all it doesn't have any post-harvest chemicals on it and we feel as small growers we're really trying to grow for flavor and we feel that if you wax a piece of citrus you've sealed it in sealed in the flavor and it's not able to respire like a natural piece of fruit would and it starts to get an off flavor after about three or four days and pixies hold just fine without waxing them there's no need to wax them and the flavor is better without a wax on them so we are selling you the most natural product we can without adding those chemicals to it so feel free to use the peel zest away pixies are great for zesting and uh just a super tasty piece of fruit their pixies we don't pick any pixies until they're at thirteen percent sugar um often they'll be seventeen percent and they are just amazingly sweet no seeds at all easy to segment and just a perfect piece of fruit for any age kids love them because they're so low in acid they have a very low acid content so they appear sweeter they might have the same amount of sugar as another tangerine but since they have lower acid they're sweeter tasting to our palate well we're always looking for new ideas we're very close with our farm advisor ben faber locally who works on projects with soil conservation district and that sort of thing so we're always looking at new ways to improve our soil till adding biomass we don't burn our our pruning clippings we mulch them in place that sort of thing but we're scientifically trying to prove new ways of improving our our water penetration into our groundwater basin citrus trees are a long-term investment you plant a pixie tree you're going to be taking care of it for 30 years i've got two trees just right outside the house here that my grandfather planted probably in the 70s and there are our home trees and this year they've got you know 800 pounds of fruit on there and that is the fruit for my children and their friends well thank you so much emily you know for more information you can visit friendsranches.com or ojaipixies.com and again thank you much stay healthy and keep eating well hi everyone we have a natalie vargas here and natalie vargas is a nutritionist who works with melissa's produce to educate and present nutritional facts and findings on various fruits and vegetables to better understand their vast benefits natalie believes knowledge is power and what you do with that knowledge makes all the difference her personal journey and nutrition started about 10 years ago when her own health was severely impacted by her dietary choices she went to her doctor to solve the problem but their only solution was to take medications indefinitely so she thought of a different solution changing her diet after researching seeking help from nutrition professionals and experimenting with different diet plans she returned to her doctor and discovered her overall health was restored natalie took her diet nutrition into her own hands and it launched her pursuit of a career in nutrition now natalie aims to do the same for others as she did for herself natalie has a bachelor of science in foods and nutrition from cal state polytech university pomona natalie thank you so much for joining us today to talk about all things pixies thank you for having me i'm so excited as you kind of got a little bit of my background i realized just how important food was and how important what you put in your body how it affects you food really was medicine for me and it is for everybody else so after learning more about the nitty bitty details with the micronutrients and the macronutrients and metabolism absorption digestion all of these fancy words but really it just helped me better understand of how nutrition and the food you eat play such a huge role in your overall health i personally use nutrition facts panels all the time when i'm making purchases in the store it really helps you better understand what you're buying and what you're going to be eating later on so i first look at the serving size that's on the nutrition facts panel it's listed at the very top and this pretty much refers to what amount is often consumed it's not exactly a suggestion so it's just people tend to eat two thirds of a cup of ice cream in one serving so they use that as a serving for ice cream it may be different for you maybe a little bit less maybe a little bit more and based off of that amount you can adjust the nutrients listed below for your own benefit i next look at the calories which is the next point it's in really large font so it's not hard to miss and this is the amount of calories listed for the serving amount so like i said before maybe it's two-third cup two-thirds of a cup maybe it's two pieces of whatever the item is it's calories for that amount and next big point is the daily values so these are listed on the right hand side of the nutrition facts panels and it refers to the amount that each nutrient has in reference to how much you should get in a day so 5 is generally considered as low and five percent or less is generally considered as low and then 20 or more is high and the last part of the nutrition facts panel is at the very bottom with the vitamins and minerals so the ones that they have listed as a requirement are vitamin d calcium iron and potassium and these are listed because people tend to not get enough in their date in their regular diet so they list it there so that you have an idea of how much you're consuming so just use those daily values and account it for how much you're getting in that one serving of whatever that may be whether it's some chips or an orange or really whatever it may be so use the nutrition facts panel as your tool it's really really helpful i give it to you this way so in one cup of pixies there is a an excellent source of vitamin c and we typically attribute citrus fruits with vitamin c and there's a reason why it's just about 60 of your vitamin c needs are met in just one cup which really isn't much another thing that you can view on the nutrition facts panel for pixies um is the fiber content it is a good source of fiber surprisingly in just one cup it'll account for about 12 percent of your daily value and then another thing you can look out for is copper although that's not a required mineral to list sometimes it may be there just to show that it does contain a good amount and copper is something that our body uses to make energy and is also necessary for brain development so these are three highlights of pixies that you can keep a lookout for when you're reading the panels each of those diets are pretty different for their own reasons for instance for keto they're often restricting the amount of carbs that they're consuming to five to ten percent of their daily consumption and that's really low compared to what a regular diet has often times they try to avoid fruits or at least you know fruits with high carb content because they are known for their carb content they're sweet there's you know they give you that natural sugar taste but there are fruits that you can eat on keto and that includes pixies too but you can also consider not even eating the whole orange you can peel it and break it off into sections and then you could add that to a salad as an additional you know juicy flavor you could also put it on top of your your fish or your chicken and it'll really marinate in the meat so these are other ways that you can incorporate pixies into your diet as far as for the mediterranean diet they often consume lots of fruits and veggies wholesome grains and healthy fats and of course pixies is going to be a part of that with your fruits vitamin c has many benefits it's actually even considered an antioxidant and because of that it helps reduce inflammation in your body there's a lot of chemical terms i can talk about but overall it will help reduce the inflammation that could potentially turn into chronic diseases later on not only that but vitamin c is good for your skin too it helps with wound healing and with collagen growth it's necessary to build collagen so these are some other things that we can think about and reasons why we may want to eat more foods with vitamin c it's really good for a body it just so happens to be in a tasty fruit but it'll also help prevent some kind of diseases that we can get down the line you know when you typically think of an orange you think about peeling it off eating the inside throwing away the peel first i would say just wash it off and you can reuse it but not only can you reuse it in things like yogurt oatmeal you could you could zest it in it you can add it to your drinks maybe a cocktail or something you can amp up your salad dressing but one of the really good nice treats you could have is added to a muffin or and some bread or something like that and the flavor is really delicious i've even seen a cakes where they have the whole orange in it and it's like who does that you know they usually just add maybe the juice of it but you can really utilize the whole thing and not only does it have you know its own distinct flavor which may be a little bitter for some people but it it has its own nutrients too just like the the pixies itself that contains vitamin c so does peel in just one tablespoon you can meet almost 10 percent of your daily needs of vitamin c people also use it in facial masks which i thought was really interesting you know i saw one where they did an orange peel honey yogurt and turmeric and you know put on your face as usual and then rinse it off and that's even in just another wave maybe you don't like the taste of it there's another way to get the benefits something i do want to try in the future though is to zest it into ice cream i think that's like a really great way to amp up your ice cream i love that you mentioned that because in our pixie booklet we do feature a delicious pixie ice cream so you will be you know tooled up for the consumers watching at home to create this ice cream that we're talking about and we look forward to you enjoying a pixie season as much as we do i have a chef tom

kids and attending his kids games so thanks for joining us tom we're excited to talk all things pixies with you today thank you pretty much from almost day one because um it was one of the first things i that i was introduced to when i started working here and obviously i fell in love with it immediately because pixie is like candy it's like the best citrus i've ever had in my life so it was a i was pretty much introduced to it right away because i started right about the time the season was starting probably 15 to 20 i would say at least i went on a tour of ojai california to the growers and we actually did like a makeshift kitchen on the field i literally built a little kitchen out in their orchard i made a like a shrimp uh stir fry asian shrimp stir-fry with pixie tangerines and and the juice and i actually cooked it up out there while other people were touring and then they came back and i made them all yeah i got them all lunch so that was probably one of them but there's a few there's like you know the the pixie julius drink um i mean i'm a bit older than you but i remember orange julius growing up i remember 50 50 bars looking the ice cream bars growing up so i created this this um pixie julius and it's kind of a combination of those two and so really delicious very refreshing of course you know obviously the juicing right and supremes or you know segmenting and make nice presentations for salads and different things and tarts and things like that zesting the zest is good gives it a little zing to different recipes i zested it and dried it and then pulverized it and i used it as like a seasoning right so it's like a powder so you can use it in sweet or savory dishes wow that's awesome as far as plant-based you can use them anywhere anything savory or sweet totally yeah and you you created this really cool faux octopus salad with the routine can you um share a little you know insight into the recipe development of that we wanted it to be plant-based and i saw this radicula if i forget where it's from it kind of resembles um calamari when you uh cut it up it curls and and the colors are there and stuff so i was like well let's just do a faux octopus salad so instead of using the octopus i use the radicchio you know you always have tofu and stuff like that which i'm not a huge fan of tofu but that's just me personally it's a textured thing you tofu will take on the flavors of everything so it's like it's a filler it you can make it look nice in a dish and it's just a texture thing with me but i know a lot of people love it you can flavor it however you want now you can marinate it you can you put it on a sheet pan put some weight on it put in the fridge you know on some paper towels let it dry out most of the moisture and then you can marinate it with like do like a nice pixie marinade like for an hour or so and then pan sear it so you get a little crunch on the outside and then you you know you can do a number of things salads and pasta dishes all kind of you know things like that where you just substitute the tofu in there for the for the meat well if it's dinner like that if it's like a steak or something like a gla you know a glass of red wine would be nice i mean i'm a light beer guy but so i drink it with any meal but but yeah um or if you're doing like a fish like a nice um chardonnay or something would be nice or if you wanted to do like a margarita or something and rim the glass take some of the juice um pulverized dust with a little sugar and rim the glass with that also and then make your drink and i've actually done it with like bloody marys and stuff too well tom thank you again we really appreciate your time uh you know stepping away from the kitchen for a second to give us the lowdown on how to use pixies in our own kitchens and uh you know for our viewers for you know more of tom's delicious recipes you can check out melissas.com and we hope you enjoy a pixie season as much as we do", "2Ez-_fyqK7g": "[Music] you know like I'm completely protected from this I there's my door right there someone decides to walk out they'll just see me and the teachers walk out there all the time no gang signs of my hairline kid but I got a bandana on cuz you know it's because that's true but like alright so I'm home from school I went with my Nana during the weekend once again which it's I'm happy I love it hello going here it's the Q's dong in war right here it's awesome Ellen you know look that good right now cuz it's just rain but it's are it's just beautiful in the sunshine yes yeah he's my protector I guess hey buddy how are you how are you so yeah I'm not gonna wrap it up my school video cuz like I made a video in school it's you've already seen it so yeah peace out guys", "30khOXUP2Qk": "alright guys today we're going to talk about tremors and vitamin deficiencies so there's mainly two types of tremors resting and essential resting could come from Parkinson's which is a problem in the brain and essential which means unknown they don't know is more in the other parts of the neurology but they don't know so it could be coming from the brain as well essential is eight times more common it mainly happens upon initiation when you're trying to do something let's say you're writing or and it could be of the head shaking the torso shaking your legs shaking whereas resting tremor is not as much on activation but just an arresting state you have this rhythmic movement of your hands or one hand and an essential tremor you have this progressive nerve damage now for Parkinson's and I've done several videos on this realize that insulin resistance plays a huge part in this problem okay and this is why you want to get on a healthy keto plan you want to do in a minute fasting for sure why because this will produce a top ajit which is the repair action of your cells through recycling damaged proteins especially in the brain you can grow new brain cells especially part of the brain where there's damage that's causing problems with dopamine and I did a separate video just on dopamine when you lower insulin you can improve dopamine because you're improving parts of the brain that make dopamine now also if you add vitamin D in there you can also improve insulin resistance and also Parkinson's symptoms Karen and I had a friend who had Parkinson's and I mean this guy he wasn't that old and he can see is just shuffling along he looks really old and he's hunched back and has his tremors and dementia we recommend Kido in a minute fasting and several other things which I'll get to in a second and he's doing fantastic now he's really coming out of it so I've seen for his hand that these actions can greatly improve the symptoms from Parkinson's and of course anything that I'm recommending in these videos is just meant for education is not meant to replace medical care so check with your doctor before making these changes okay then we have essential tremors I would highly recommend doing research on the B vitamins if you look at b12 deficiencies you're gonna see one of the symptoms is tremors okay so b12 has a lot to do with the nervous system and keeping the nervous system functioning you do tend to store b12 for a long periods of time but if you're deficient whether you're a vegan or you have digestive issues and you have maybe IBS or Crohn's or celiac or gastric bypass that could be more of the reason why you have a b12 deficiency in which case you need to take thousands of micrograms of b12 not hundreds so I would do like 2,000 micrograms of b12 every single day some people if they're very deficient and they have a very serious illness need to be injected by b12 make sure that the version of b12 that you take is the methyl cobalamin which is the active form and it goes in a lot better than the other versions alright number 2 b1 very very important if you look at classical b1 deficiency is called beriberi it affects the brain and nervous system especially the myelin sheath the version of be one that I would recommend would be something called benfotiamine which is a fat soluble version even though it's synthetic it seems to work really nice and it doesn't seem to have any side effects but it will penetrate the nervous system a lot better than the regular versions of b1 which are water-soluble also b3 deficiencies can also affect the neurology and create tremors if you're deficient in this case I would probably take 500 milligrams of that and then b6 b6 is a very important cofactor in so many metabolic processes in the body I would recommend b6 as well and a blend of a nutritional yeast okay number three low vitamin E can affect the nerve and the muscle as well but specifically the nervous system so if you're going to take a vitamin E make sure it's not synthetic make sure it's a food base a combination between tocopheryl and tocotrienols okay that's the version you need because if your vitamin E deficiency that could be one reason why you have a tremor now caprylic acid from coconut oil is now being researched for tremors so that's another thing that you might want to consider as well alright guys thanks for watching I'll see you in the next video so if you want to get notified with all my content click the notification bell next to subscribed"}
