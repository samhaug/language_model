{"ArX0FKnsU9M": "hi my name is Joey Papa I'm a coffee consultant and today we're going to learn how to make a caramel cappuccino caramel cappuccinos are a great treat for after dinner or first thing when you wake up in the morning and they're pretty easy to make what we're going to need to do this is an espresso machine some finely ground espresso some milk in caramel flavoring you can find this caramel flavoring at any grocery store down the coffee aisle and you can find it in sugar free as well if you're looking to cut on calories now what we're going to do first and the most important aspect of making a cappuccino is our milk take your milk and you're going to fill it up halfway in the carafe then you're going to take it and put it in your steam wand now the trick is with cappuccinos is to create a lot of foam and in order to do this you're going to take the very tip of the steam wand and place it at the surface of your milk once you've done that and your steam wand is on you're going to scratch the surface of the milk creating foam and you're going to see what we call stretching the milk the milk will begin to rise in your carafe and when it reaches the top of the carafe you can then submerge the steam wand all the way to the bottom once you hear the milk rumbling or the carafe is too hot to touch you can then remove your milk and your steamed milk is complete and ready for a cappuccino next we're going to need to pull a shot of espresso to do this we're going to remove the Porta filter from the espresso machine you're going to fill it with finely ground espresso take your pinkie finger go across the surface to make a smooth even surface take the this the tamper which is the device that is used to press down on the espresso making it compact in the portafilter return it to your espresso machine and go ahead and turn it on to pull your shot once you have your shot of espresso and you have your steamed milk you're then going to take your serving cup and you're going to take your caramel flavoring you can use about 2 to 3 tablespoons of the caramel flavoring depending on how sweet you want your beverage to be after you have your flavoring in there you're then going to add your espresso and then your milk and this is so that the caramel flavoring mixes well in the beverage so we're going to take a shot of espresso pour that in there and then what we're going to do is you're going to pour the hot steamed milk about two-thirds way up the cup once you get 2/3 of the way up the cup you're going to take a spoon and scoop out the remaining foam that's in the carafe and place it on top of your serving cup once you've done that you have your caramel cappuccino again my name is Joey Papa I'm a coffee consultant and today we learned how to make a caramel cappuccino", "VhkcyazIICk": "hello and welcome to the modern at home videos these videos are going to show you how to replicate your favorite high street drinks at home so we're going to start off today with a caramel cappuccino so first of all we'll need some milk if you don't have one of these coffee machines either a quad machine or or have been to cut machine or any sort of coffee machines fine fill up your jug with milk and just put that to one side for the moment the next step is coffee you want to be filling up to 3/4 full and spread it evenly as possible across the whole surface and then you want to attach it on and put the coffee mug underneath you wanted to run so it's about about a quarter to a third full just need to take our coffee gifts they're available from most supermarkets and in here some recipe guides and step by steps on exactly how to make each of the coffees so we're going to take our caramel syrup pouring about 15 mils which is one tablespoon into our coffee take your job place it under the steam on you wanna go Bobby Tex trip to the mill make sure your hands always touching this jargon when it's just too hot to touch take it away and it'll be ready to go if you don't have one of these steam oil on your coffee machines you can easily just put some milk in a pan and heat it up on the stove with a bit of a whisk together air into it we take our coffee and pour directly in to get a bit more the frost into the top of the coffee you can add it in with a spoon if you want to take that extra step you can use a stencil over the top and here it is the caramel cappuccinos become a human vanilla gingerbread hazelnut or even chocolate chip cookie you", "4dKtOsRTf6w": "ready okay the milk's ready pipes all right pick out your favorite tom your chocolate bomb um let's go this one that one looks incredible okay we got your boston terrier mode you got it it's so big i hope it fits in there good thing you've got a big mug out yeah ready hey you're gonna pour it or you want me to i want to okay don't burn yourself it's hot hot milk oh my gosh it's floating oh piper look at all the yummy goodness coming out oh my gosh oh there's marshmallows oh piper oh my gosh this looks amazing oh oh smell that oh it smells like coffee it smells like heaven okay so now we gotta get out and then we gotta go get your bubble bath going and well your regular bath and drop the bomb in so you have a bath bomb and a chocolate bomb okay look at those mushrooms that looks don't burn your mouth", "JerOfC_4lGE": "all right so i'm going to be making a hot chocolate balm today um let me swing over here so i bought some of these candy wafers the milk chocolate at hobby lobby if you don't want to use that um you can go and buy the generic brand or if you want the toll house whatever it is the milk chocolate that's what i would go and not get semi-sweet i mean if you want to try the dark chocolate that's completely up to you i went and bought this big giant container of hot chocolate mix so that way because we need a couple tablespoons of that and then i bought some of these sweet stripes so that way i can do a peppermint one also and then i also i'm going to do a coffee hot chocolate or a coffee bomb too so chocolate coffee balm i guess that's what i could call it i don't really know all right so i put some of those wafers in my bowl and i'm just going to put it in the microwave i've already made a couple of them i'm going to just put that in there for 30 seconds to get the microwave warm um and i've got a couple different one of these this came in a six pack but i cut it down so that way it was easier for me to fit in my freezer i found these little flower ones and i'll show you the other two designs here in a few minutes um but i thought these were really cute and you actually have to use like the oversized coffee cups because these are pretty large and then at the end i'm going to drizzle some of those on the top so this is completely into what you want to do if you want to add some white chocolate you can or you can just leave it chocolate all right so we're going to check our consistency here in which it's probably just started about a little bit i just want to mix them up and they're going to go back in i'm going to put them in there for 20 seconds because i don't want to get too hot [Music] and i already have some in the i had some in the freezer so once i get this melted i show you how i put it in the mold then we will jump over and pull the other ones out of the freezer i hate having long videos that's why i try to pre-plan and have this ready to go now these are pretty wet and they are ready to be melted all right i'm trying to multitask with my phone i had to order a new battery for my camera so i'm gonna have to multitask here but we're just gonna you don't wanna like the first batch that i had made i had got my chocolate too hot so the inside of the bomb is not going to look so hot looks pretty good all right so then we're just going to take our i'm actually going to raise this up i'm going to use my cups to stack so we can have a better look at this all right so i'm just going to take my chocolate and i'm just going to put half and one and half in the other now depending on how thick you get your chocolate i just kind of swirl mine around and kind of see where i need to go because you can do two thin layers if you want or you can try to do one thick layer um doing one thick layer is a little bit harder because you have to pretty much get it just perfect and you want to make sure like along these sides here that you're going to get it thick enough see this has a little bump in the top of here so i have to put a little bit of extra chocolate to settle in the bottom but actually really good i have it to where it's covered the entire thing because i really just want to do one coat is what i want to do i don't really because you have to put it in the freezer for about 20 minutes so i try to do just the one coat this is probably way too much chocolate in here but we'll figure it out too much chocolate said no one ever all right i'm just going to take my spatula here and kind of drive it down all right so that looks really really good i think i've pretty much got it coated i am going to coat a little bit more right there because like i said i want my edges to be nice and thick for when i put them together okay now we're going to take these and we're going to pop them in our freezer for 20 minutes all right let me rinse my hands off real quick chocolate all over myself okay now both of these were in the freezer for 20 minutes and see this one my chocolate got a little bit hard but this is the inside nobody really cares because they're not gonna see it okay so and this is silicone i really like it it's a lot easier if you have plastic molds you have to be really careful and it's just too much work so i'm really glad that i have the silicone ones but i got these cute flower molds and i really like them a lot so this one's a sunflower and see it i mean it kind of decorates it a little bit it's not really a big deal can't see through it or anything's gonna fall out all right see and that one turned out pretty good too all right so i'm gonna set these off to the side so we have two of them they turned out great and then i have one more that i did see this was a six pack and i just cut them into into three strips because it just fits in my freezer easier because i have a oh i just broke that one i have a teeny tiny freezer so i don't have a whole lot of room [Applause] see that just pops out like that and i just busted that one a little bit so we'll have to figure something out for that one we might have to perform a little bit of surgery but that turned out for that one so i'm just going to take these two pieces set them off to the side and figure out how i can fix that maybe we'll do that one with the white chocolate so you can't see it okay so those turned out really good alright so i'm going to set these off to the side because what we want to do next is get them ready for our hot chocolate mix and our coffee mix so i'm gonna come over here and i went ahead and chopped up the little sweet escape i really like these only because they melt in your mouth and i thought well i don't really like i don't mind the peppermint sticks but i like these better so i kind of figured i could try that okay the next thing that you're going to want to do is just get a plate and i'm actually just going to stick it in the microwave for like two minutes just the plate because i want to heat it up so that way i can melt the chocolate like that the rim of this chocolate so that way when i put my stuff in there and i turn this over on top it will melt it and bind it together pretty much okay move my knife out of the way [Music] okay i'll set that one up to the side we're going to work on this one here all right so we're going to open up our hot chocolate mix there now if you can find like the dehydrated marshmallows like the little ones like when you get the packets of hot chocolate with marshmallows in it they're just dehydrated marshmallows they do sell those separate so if you could find those great i would use those but unfortunately my store was all out so i gotta use the regular marshmallow than the mini marshmallows all right so i have a two tablespoon here so i'm just gonna get two tablespoons of hot chocolate mix and i'm just gonna dump it right in there and then i'm going to throw some marshmallows in there pretty good and then i'm just going to put some peppermint in there just like that all right now i gotta wait for my plate to get done it's almost done about 20 seconds i'll save that for the top [Music] i'm gonna go ahead in my other flower i'm actually going to make it into [Music] the vanilla and i bought vanilla caramel so i thought it could be chocolate vanilla caramel coffee so we also need two tablespoons of that that's what the inside of it looks like so i'm gonna grab two tablespoons it smells really good i'm just to pour that right in there like that okay that's what it says to do i'm going to swirl this back around here all right so my plate is nice and warm so i'm actually going to put this over here but i'm going to take this and i'm just going to turn it over and i'm going to swirl it to where it heats up my chocolate and i'll leave a ring and then you just put it right on the top of your other here just like that and i'm just going to take the chocolate that is kind of left on the plate since it's warm and burning my fingers to touch it to where i can seal up some of these little cracks i got just like that it's not gonna be perfect but let's see what we can do at least to where it's not gonna come out just like that and it's not going to come off but it's ready to go all right so i am going to do the same with the this guy here i'm gonna heat my plate up and i'm just gonna pop that right on top there oops he didn't really fit but we're gonna make him fit just like that and use this warm chocolate to bind it together here working out pretty good all right and there we go looks pretty good a little flour all right so we made a hot chocolate one and we made a coffee one so now i'm gonna melt some white chocolate and i'm gonna probably just put it on the leaves of the flour so that way i can spread some of that peppermint on top i'm just gonna put my white chocolate in the microwave for 30 seconds rinse my hand off again now if you don't want to do the white chocolate that's completely up to you you can leave them just how they are they look really cute just like this now i will forewarn you that these are with having this chocolate extra it makes it very rich so make sure you have a really big cup because you're gonna need a lot of milk now you can use water with it i like to use milk when i drink these 20 seconds but let me see here let me see if i can go comparison see this is a regular regular little coffee mug and it just doesn't really fit in there because it's pretty much the same size of it so these are actually like an oversized coffee cup all right so that is pretty melted there i'm just gonna paint this on my leaves my nose always runs when i do this but i'm just gonna add a little bit onto each little leaf here nothing fancy schmancy and i'm just going to top it with some peppermint right and that's it that's my little hot chocolate bomb so i hope you guys have enjoyed this video and here's our coffee bomb too that we're gonna try out it's so cool alright so i hope you guys enjoyed this video do give me a thumbs up and a share and a follow that would be awesome i hope that you all have a blessed day thank you for watching", "FXCRcyclraw": "hey everyone I wanted to share with you guys my husband's favorite drink is the Starbucks caramel cappuccino or you can also do Frappuccino and this is only four ingredients and it's super easy to make and it tastes just like the Starbucks one so you're gonna need some Hershey's caramel syrup your milk of choice this is the one I use you can also use heavy whipping cream half and half milk almond milk whatever you want to use ready whip also you can use your choice Starbucks caramel flavored coffee and that's it there are four ingredients so you could do this several ways but you're gonna need basically one 8 ounce cup of coffee depending on how much you want to make or however many shots of espresso or coffee you want I just make mine in this little one so it's basically an espresso shot but I made it with the Starbucks caramel coffee so you're gonna start out with the caramel sauce first depending on how sweet you want it I normally put about 1/4 of the cup in the bottom and I always put it first so I could see how much I'm putting in there then you're gonna add your milk this is a very big cup I'm making a big batch so I would say about a cup of milk and then you're just going to pour your coffee or espresso shots straight into your cup [Music] stir it and you can either put this in a pan and heat it over the stove if you don't want to use a microwave or you can put it in the microwave for about two minutes to heat it up and then after that all right so I went ahead and I seeded the coffee mixture up and I just give it a stir so the caramel that's down at the bottom gets incorporated and basically your coffee is done but I like to put the whipped cream on it and then you could drizzle some caramel on top and there's your Starbucks caramel cappuccino give me a thumbs up if you liked this video or if you try this and you like it let me know what you guys think", "eyrr8qcxnJ4": "[Music] welcome back to cooking with Glynn and Katie today we'll be making some Amish caramels we first learned about these and Shipshewana Indiana when we were eating at a restaurant and they were selling them for $1 each my dad loves them as we all did and said hey I can learn how to make these so he googled it and we can't wait to show you guys the recipe you'll love it it's delicious [Music] today with the caramels I'd like to have an apple if so I'm gonna pick an apple off our haplin tree [Music] the ingredients we'll use to make to caramel candy will be light corn syrup and I use the Cairo brand one stick of salted butter 2 cups of light brown sugar 2 cups of heavy whipping cream divided you'll use one cup at the very beginning and then when it starts boiling we'll put another cup in there and then finally we'll be putting 1 tablespoon of vanilla flavoring a thermometer is very important in making this recipe you could do it without using a thermometer by doing a test for the softball stage and that's getting just a little bit out of the pan and put it in some water and seeing a little ball full and then when you put the ball on your hand after it cools it kind of flattens out but you don't want to do that you want to get a thermometer they're not that expensive these are standard candy thermometers this is the one I wanted used to make it all the thermometers have it marked the soft ball stage it's 235 degrees and then you can have the electronic one this is an electronic one here but I've shaved my favorite if you look at this one you've got a long cord you can stick this in the pot and you can just stick this on the side in fact it's got the magnets on the back so if it's on the stoves you can just stick it to your stove but it says 77 degrees that's where the temperature it is in the kitchen and then I've got two hundred and thirty five degrees and this is what I want it to be so I'll know when it's finished it's ready to pour it's important to have the right pot to make this dip boils and boils and gets higher and higher you'll be amazed this is a three and a half quart pot and when I'm making this pot the boil comes all the way up to the top and it kind of scares me and so you need a larger pot this is probably a 5 quart pot and this just a little bit bigger and when the boyle comes up it won't overflow and that's very important before we get started it's very important to butter the pan you'll be pouring the caramel mixture in and we'll go around the sides look how liberal this is butter it you want a lot of butter it's very important to butter it well before you start making the caramel because once you do that your full attention needs to be on the pot here to do it before you start cooking I put the thermometer in the pot so which is sitting on the bottom I have the temperature on high don't add the butter and then I'm gonna start adding all the ingredients in here I'm coating the bottom of it I'm gonna put the Cairo syrup in and before I put the karo syrup in this container I sprayed it with Pam so that all the syrup would come out here's the brown sugar and the secret is you have to pack it in there so it's all packed in and now I'm going to put it in and now I'm adding in the whipping cream I want you to know that I'm all ready for my cup of heavy whipping cream so that I'll be ready to add it when it starts boiling one thing that's very important is that you don't use a plastic spoon it needs to be a wooden spoon so your hands and get hot like it would be if it's metal and it won't melt like it would if it was a plastic spoon I'm constantly stirring this caramel mixture and you can see it starting to bubble if you look at the thermometer you see this 209 degrees water boils at 212 degrees and so now it's got a rolling boil I'm gonna start adding the second cup of heavy whipping cream and as I add it I do not want this to stop boiling you want to keep it boiling the entire time so you add and if you see that's not boiling or slowing down a little bit just stop until it starts boiling again and then add a little bit more there's no hurry so just take your time this is 214 degrees and it will stay 214 degrees for a while then all of a sudden to start climbing up and temperature and then all of a sudden you'll get to 235 degrees but notices how the liquid is bubbling up in the pan this has measurements on the side and it's like three and a half quarts right now you can't see how it bubbles and it rises is 221 degrees so the temperatures moving up but look at the volume of the caramel mixture it has reduced to about two quarts here it was three and a half quarts and so as it progresses you can see it changes a bit they look like a little fish or koi want some food coming to the surface they're a little big mouths there now it's 234 degrees now you see how fast it went 234 in just a few seconds it's gonna be 235 so we'll listen to the beef in just a minute it's diesease so it's time to take it off the burner I just put the vanilla in now it's time to pour it into the pan [Music] I I have the caramel mixture in here it's going to cool I'll leave it on the counter on a rack for one hour and then I'll put it in the refrigerator for at least an hour before I cut it after about 15 minutes or so when it cools down a little bit it starts to solidify I'll be putting some salt and I use coarse sea salt and I'll sprinkle that on about half of it because some people like to sea salt some people don't so I normally make half and half and now I've got some sea salt so I'm just going to sprinkle it on here this is going to be a topping which will make it really pretty when people unwrap it okay I have the caramel candy out of the refrigerator now I'm will slice it oh yeah this feels so good only slice what you're gonna be cutting so I'm gonna cut this strip down here and now I'm gonna cut it into little pieces here so I'll cut that in half that in half that in half and that in half see what looks like the first piece is kind of hard to get out of here look at this carrot look how beautiful it's coming out look at that perfect salt creamy you'll melt in your mouth after you have your candies raised you want to wrap them up I just use a plain old wax paper I estimated about six inches at all I cut it in half just fold it over cut it in half I call that the hamburger fold it's kinda like the size of a hamburger bun but I'll do that and then I do the hotdog fold which is like that it's kind of the shape of the hotdog someone cut it right here in the center now I got four pieces it doesn't have to be pretty I put the candy in the center and then I roll it up put it together like that and I'll twist the two sides in and there you go okay we make some caramel students that we're gonna try them this Apple came from our apple tree its net outside it's a black Arkansas apple I've got this caramel sauce that we can put on the Apple now I'm going to try it because it's apples and caramel bit perfect together then I like to try the candy sir look at that Apple see how pretty that is the gooier it is the better it's gonna be man that's gonna be good taste it see what you're thinking okay I'll peel it for you that's good does the flavors work together they do don't they [Music] what do you think this is a caramel it tastes very good what I like about is terrible is that it doesn't get stuck on your teeth it's not chewy it kind of melts in your mouth now is the perfect treat well thanks for joining us this week we had a great time

into this video you read the title of the video you've seen the thumbnail so you already know what's going down you already know what this video is about now i want to say something real quick here before we start the video this is not clickbait but i know a lot of you click this video expecting to see me make this two ingredient caramel candy from scratch that's not exactly what you're getting in this video as you guys know here on the channel i show you how to make things the easy way then i show you how to make it the hard way this one is the easy way so this is two ingredient caramel candy but as you will see it is not from scratch you can look forward to that video in about 10 days to two weeks from scratch caramel candy that's coming up you can also do caramel sauce too and i'm saying caramel candy right now you can use this as caramel sauce to dip things in all kinds of things but the main thing is this right here is not from scratch let's go ahead and get to it here we go [Music] yeah all right guys so we're doing two ingredient caramel candy as you can see right here i'm using the individually wrapped candy that you can buy from amazon or anywhere else from the grocery store i'll put the link in the description you already know that so what i'm doing is i'm actually going to unwrap a cup cup and a half of these caramel pieces right here as you can see i have my infused coconut oil we're going to be using two tablespoons i've done two batches of these at this point when you use three tablespoons it makes it too oily so we're going to be using two tablespoons of the infused coconut oil that seems to be as much as one cup one cup and a half of the caramel can take so the the process is pretty straightforward we're going to unwrap these individual caramels or caramels or however you say it i'm from the country i'm going to be saying caramels i guess i don't know but anyway we're going to unwrap them like a cup and a half i'm going to put two tablespoons of infused coconut oil in there put it in a microwave let me give you a little tip you're going to be putting it in the microwave for three and a half minutes do not do the three and a half minutes together or it's going to be like an explosion in your microwave what you want to do is you want the microwave for one minute let it stop do it for another minute and a half let it stop then you're gonna finish it off with another minute and once you do that make sure that you're mixing it up in between whenever you let it stop but once you do that you're going to be ready to pour inside of your molds right here now i'm using all magical butter products these gummy moles that magical butter has they work fantastic right here that's what i'm using also they have the flexi measuring cups that's what we're going to be using too if i try to do it with the spout of the measuring cup that you see the pyrex measuring cup that's not going to work it's going to be too much going out but by me being able to use this flexi measuring cup from magical butter it works really well and it's non-stick so you don't have to worry about any of that stuff as well as the the molds itself and the spatulas everything is great so if you're interested in getting this stuff magicalbutter.com use base drop keys you'll get 20 off your order but what we're going to do is you can see that we're pouring it inside of the moles it's pretty straightforward what's so great about this is you don't have to worry about whenever you're going from you know space to space with your you know pouring it you don't have to worry about messing anything up because when it hardens up just a little bit you're gonna see it right now i'm going to take a knife and i'm able to put that excess back into one of the spaces filling it up so you don't have to worry about this it's great and so if you need to you know you can put a little oil inside of the the mix mix it up some you can even put it in the microwave for a couple seconds if you need to loosen it up a little bit but you finish pouring it inside the mold that's great now once we do that we're going to put this inside of the freezer here for 30 minutes to shock it real quick here [Music] if you don't have a freezer you can just leave it out on the counter top and it will harden up what's so great about this is this right here is very very stable so you don't have to worry about them dissolving or anything crazy like that once we set them which you can see it's already been 30 minutes so we're going to take it out of the freezer right now popping them out and what's so great is they are set they are set ready to go so you can put them in a bag no problem if you want to re-wrap them in some plastic individually you can definitely do that but they are set you don't have to worry about them melt well of course if you put them in like any extreme heat or anything like that of course it's going to melt but i'm saying just like the ones that just how they came you know from the store they are shelf stable and ready to go super easy this is not cooking with cannabis this is really melting some caramel uh individual pieces infusing it with some coconut oil and reforming it you could do bars if you wanted to and like i said once you have it in the pyrex glass or in a bowl or whatever you can actually dip apples in it or whatever you want to do you can use this caramel sauce whatever this is the easy way to ingredient caramel candy like i said i'll be showing you guys how to do it from scratch in about two weeks all right guys so i just showed you how to make some two ingredient caramel so you can use this as candy you can use it as sauce however you want to do it is totally up to you if you use the molds like i showed you in the video of course you're going to be making candy but like if you want to you can just make it put it in some kind of container dip apples in it or do it however you want to do it right here i do want to let you guys know that currently i do have a rig giveaway you guys know that i am sponsored by magicalbutter.com but i also do have other sponsors another one of my great

welcome back to my channel today we are going to make coffee bombs i'm sure you've heard of hot chocolate bombs these are the same concept except made with coffee so what you need to make them is a silicone mold and i'll leave a link on where you can get these molds they make it easy so you can easily pop out the molds and they're very flexible i also need some melting wafers milk chocolate ones these ones are my favorite and there's a couple ways you can make coffee bombs you can either put your favorite creamer inside the coffee bomb and just pour it or put it into your coffee already and just kind of mix it and have like a chocolatey uh flavor creamer um inside your coffee or you can add the instant coffee and the creamer into the bomb itself into the mold and then you just add some hot water and then you can make your coffee that way so let's get started in making these coffee bombs so first you want to melt the chocolate in the microwave do it in 30 second second increments and make sure you stir in between until it's melted this one took about 30 seconds the first time and then 20 seconds the second time but it would depend on your microwave then you want to add the melted chocolate into the molds okay once you've add added the chocolate into the molds you just want to kind of push it up to the sides making sure you get it all the way up to the top on each one and making sure there's no holes in there and you might just have to keep working it until it's completely covered you may even have to add some more chocolate in there and once you get all of them in there like that you want to put it in the freezer for about five to ten minutes and make sure that they're hardened and then you can take them out okay so once they have hardened in the freezer you will just pop them out of the mold and this is what they look like when you pop them out and then what you want to do is you want to fill the insides of the molds with either you can do either just coffee creamer and just put a little bit in there or you can do a packet of the instant coffee and the creamer inside the mold and then we need to put them together okay so to put the two pieces together you want to heat up a plate in the microwave and then what you want to do is you want to just kind of push it back and forth until it melts for a second and then connect it with the other half and then just kind of hold it together until it forms together you can also pipe some melted chocolate around the edges to make sure it's sealed too okay so i've added the crystals the coffee crystals in there already and then i'm now adding in the coffee creamer it depends on how much coffee creamer you want to add in there and you can fill it up to the top if you want or you can just add little if you want and then now we just need to connect them okay so i have sealed the two pieces together as you can see and then if you want to seal it even more you can pipe some melted chocolate and you can also make it more decorative and melt some chocolate and put it over top and decorate it however you want [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "0svgbDiqrXU": "whoo what's up it's me again it's Saturday just want the dog oh just had to pry his mouth open to get something that he was eating that was just like you know you shouldn't be doing this but you're doing it anyway dog

time if someone in your family didn't make them then you usually knew of a friend or a co-worker who made them if you were like me you immediately thought too much trouble I thought the same thing until a friend gave me a recipe that required nothing more than a few ingredients a bowl and a microwave intrigue grab a cup of hot cocoa it's time to microwave some magic in mrs. kringles kitchen lining 8 by 8 pan with parchment paper if it's rolling up on you just use some corn syrup under the corners to secure it spray the sides with cooking spray so the caramels release easily for you and set the pan aside in a large microwave safe bowl add the 1/2 cup of sugar 1/2 cup of brown sugar a quarter cup of melted butter I used brown butter for this recipe so scrape all the brown butter bits into the bulb [Music] add the 1/2 cup of light corn syrup and finally the 1/2 cup of sweetened condensed milk mix the ingredients together to break everything up microwave the mixture for 2 minutes carefully remove the bowl with a potholder is it will be bubbling and hot and give the ingredients a stir before returning it to the microwave microwave it again for another 2 minutes again carefully remove the bowl and stir before returning it to the microwave for the third and final time for 2 minutes carefully remove the bowl from the microwave oven if you want a harder caramel add one teaspoon of vanilla and give it one final stir omit the vanilla if you like your caramels a little softer and stir until smooth carefully scrape the crumble into your 8x8 pan with a spatula it will set quickly if you'd like to make these sea salt caramels sprinkle 1 TSP of flaked sea salt onto the top of the caramels after transferring to the dish and cover it with plastic wrap let it sit for about 20 minutes until it's set using a kitchen knife give it a quick spray of cooking spray and begin scouring the curls if you're impatient like I am you can also spray a food scraper and it covers more surface area as you score score out about 12 to 14 caramels time to cut your wax paper fold a sheet in half and cut it on the line fold that sheet into thirds and cut those you're going to have to guesstimate on the size when it's time to remove the caramels I like to use the food scraper to help me get them out they'll still be pliable so mold them into the shape that's a little prettier if they look a little wonky place them in the middle of the wax paper roll them up and twist the ends to secure them these caramels are a quick way to make some old fashioned goodies and half the time and no candy thermometer needed so if you've ever been intimidated by a caramel recipe give this one a try because they're soft they will mold to the shape of whatever they're served on so a nice plate or a flat candy dish would help them keep their shape if you liked this recipe give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe for more easy dishes delivered straight to you from mrs. crinkles

divided 1 teaspoon vanilla a quarter teaspoon sea salt plus more for sprinkling in the pot of your instant pot or in a stock pot for use on the stovetop choose a larger pot it will bubble up in later steps combine the sugar coconut nectar in a pinch or about a quarter teaspoon of sea salt and whisk until all the sugar is wet from the coconut nectar while you do this you're going to want to make sure all the sugar in the coconut nectar stays right in the bottom of the pot and isn't sticking to the sides after whisking remove the whisk and clip on a candy thermometer so the bulb is in the sugar mixture but not touching the bottom of the pot and turn the instant pot to saute medium alternatively heat the pan on the stovetop over medium heat heat until just before the hard crack stage hard crack is at 295 at sea level do not stir it all during this time if you'd like more information on candy temperatures and candy making be sure to check out my link gourmet candy making without corn syrup as the sugar mixture heats use a small saucepan to heat the cream and one tablespoon of butter over medium-low heat stirring occasionally heat until it starts to boil and then turn the heat off as soon as the sugar mixture reaches just below 295 degrees or hard crack stage remove from heat place it on a trivet or a hot pan and slowly pour in the cream vanilla mixture be careful there will be lots of steam and the mixture will increase in volume stir for a couple seconds to mix the cream into the sugar mixture and return to medium heat cook again without stirring until the caramel mixture reaches 260 degrees fahrenheit hard ball stage do not stir during this cooking process as the caramel mixture cooks again line a loaf pan or eight by eight pan with parchment paper and grease with coconut oil or spray with cooking spray alternatively a silicone pan can be used without the need to line or spray once caramel reaches 260 degrees the hard ball stage add the remaining two tablespoons of butter without stirring and pour into a prepared pan do not scrape the edge of the pan only pour off what comes out on its own place the pan with the caramel on the cooling rack and allow to cool until it comes to room temperature cover and transfer to the fridge after the caramel is set four to eight hours later sprinkle with the remaining sea salt flakes and pop out of the mold by lifting the parchment paper or inverting the silicone pan use a knife that you have run under hot water to heat up and cut into one inch squares wrap in wax paper cellophane or parchment paper squares individually to keep the caramel from sticking together caramel can also be served in small parchment paper mini muffin cups store wrapped caramels in an airtight container in the fridge for

but if you're going to celebrate celebrate with the good stuff don't go with the cheap knock-off versions", "xODB38-AxHQ": "hello a game and welcome to Dubai for father I remember this candy it was a fan favorite of you know of our childhood if something that wasn't always readily available because you have to know where to go to get it and that was the beauty about it because once you found the place to get it oh you were just frequently looking for a change from the moms bags and purses please don't seem to do that just so away she says she's gonna buy the tin Tomatoes wherever it is they weigh seotc oh yes my legs feet then announce the presence not now come and so into Gaza  man why do you hate me CJ I remember nobody now is that you Matty kind of parlayed that that up before podium in the Queen's I've got a quick Ubaldo but I buy flag yellow the butler look over there so awkward yeah I mean she's got a little miracle worker you might have read about cheek when it's now cold yes I'll call me I forgot my door now come I could have a little smoke I know thank you again if you're joining me for the part two of this so of course I did show you how to make the normal conventional toffee or caramel candy may I say now today I'm going to show you how to make this beautiful moist and soft version absolutely you need to watch to the end to find out exactly what I do my secret ingredients as per the previous video is knees and lemon or lime but I prefer to use lemon for those coastline the strong going away now if you're getting your lemon and ensure that is on wax and is organic because you want the best you know and the best way to get the juice out of your lemon is to massage it and then when you cut it in half it's so easy when you just put a little bit of pressure and the juice just comes out beautifully anyway that start so as per the previous video I did melt my coconut oil you can use your butter but I prefer coconut oil because that's a flavor that I'm infusing into this mixture now so that I'm adding my condensed milk you can get your tin condensed milk and from this supermarkets they readily available or you can pick one up online absolutely now I'm going to maintain and medium to low heat because I'm gonna evenly cook this we're looking for that texture we're looking for it to just be so so I've been doing this for about 10 minutes it does take a lot of stirring and as I've always mentioned or I've mentioned in my previous video so you've gotta be patient with it because if you want something done sley and perfectly you've got to the time to do it you know all the shuttle shuttle thing you end up through the shuttle you end up with a shuttle flavor and I don't do shabu-shabu flavor it has to be infused it has to be Jeff I said when you taste it it's wrong as there's this is indeed arrived but five babe or nine Han now of course when you do add the coconut and oil it allows you to mix it too nicely without uh sticking to the bottom and even if it does or you just just constantly stand it comes off just nicely so once that's done I'm now adding two tablespoons of my lemon juice so all I've done is increase the amount of lemon juice that I'm adding you can add this at the beginning or you can add it just now and I'm adding it just now and you can see it's browning and it's just perfect the beauty about this is once you actually get it to the stage it becomes softer you know so you're just cooking it a bit further to ensure that moisture escapes as well and that lemon sharpness also goes away and the caramel flavor overpowers it which is the most important part so I think now my caramel is ready now what you need to do is grease some foil and where the coconut oil or butter if that's what you use in so that I'm going to be transferring this beauty into that so I've prepared one here already as you can see and all I'm gonna do is transfer my caramel mixture now into it and you can see how nice and runny it is you know look at that beauty is you exactly and Wiles is actually hot whoo I'm going to do as many place it's so I'm gonna scrape everything off because of course in my kitchen there is no waste absolutely look it comes off so nicely absolutely because it's nice and soft so gives it a lot of time for you to manipulate it into any shape that you do prefer so our love Danny so I'm just add a little bit of the coconut oil to the back of my spatula and just to allow me to shape it just this way you can do whatever way it is but this is easy and what I'm going to do is allow this to rest and so that affirms that because this is nice and soft now so you can go about your thing but it takes about 30 minutes for it to just firm up nicely and that is exactly what I'm talking about so after 30 min as I can see it's firmed up just so and now I'm going to transfer it to greased surface as well so yet again I'm using my coconut oil you can use your butter to grease it and I'm turning that over and look it's still soft and nice now of course you do need your sharp knife when it comes to those because of course you want to cut it through and it's nice but then again you know if it has that rustic shape who cares you've gone for the hassle of making that beautiful soft caramel nobody's gonna arrest you you know look how nice yeah very gentle to the teeth absolutely mm-hmm and the flavor I mean you can be creative if you want to include some vanilla extract it's good you notice how to mention the essence because that's another chemical it's best to use of another extract if you doing so you can also add some coffee if you choose but I do like those caramel with a hint of coconut in there and you've got that lemon thing going through so now it's time for you to shape it and you can see it's still nice and soft absolutely and yeah just ensuring that I just cut into my preferred shape yet again as I said in my previous video you can be creative with it but with this I'm just leaving it this way because I'll be using some greaseproof paper to wrap this because of course it's soft if I leave it in an airtight container while so soft it will stick together so yeah that is my face so yeah look at this I told you there's not any other food or business in Dubai for fun but even what can imagine in new debt this is an immediate issue okay so can you imagine purpose put nicely freshly baked tea bread mm-hmm and you see how it's nice and soft here they use smear this caramel in through it's nice so that's not what of you can wire it definitely not a healthy thing but yeah equally fun thing to do so I have got my grease proof paper that I've actually into little squares which would allow me to wrap it into little candies and I said this is a great way to gift this present to anybody and you know your kids who definitely would love to wrap this absolutely you can get the greaseproof paper online in most supermarkets as well or any specialist baking shop definitely and that's it that is the chewy caramel candy mmm num - capital are you mm-hmm in an alcohol I can do / fat they all got a buddy in to do by far but now I'm doing my catch s I can take some pictures and everything is a strategically placed as I always do I mean [Music] however the Droid was F said please don't hesitate to share this with your family and friends most definitely and try

and in today's video i want to share with you how to make delicious homemade caramels it is so much simpler than you may think and they would make it delicious gifts to enjoy with your family or to share with others this christmas season first you'll need to gather your ingredients unsalted butter granulated sugar light corn syrup heavy cream salt and vanilla extract begin by tracing the bottom of a small baking dish onto parchment paper cut it out and use this as a liner to easily remove the caramels later on on medium-low heat add your butter sugar and salt a tip for getting sticky corn syrup out of your metal measuring cup is you can run it under hot water first then add half of the heavy cream one cup and reserve the other cup for later give it all a good stir and continue to heat on that medium low setting so that it doesn't burn after a few minutes it will come to a simmer and then you don't need to stir anymore now for this recipe you will need a candy or meat thermometer which may seem like kind of an intimidating kitchen tool but it's really not it's very simple to use you may even have it in your kitchen already it can also be found at big box retailers like target or walmart in store or of course you can find it on amazon that's where i picked up mine it was less than ten dollars and i'll link it down below clip the thermometer onto the edge of your pot so that the end is floating in the liquid and not touching the bottom at this point i lowered my heat because i was nervous about it potentially burning but as soon as the temperature reaches 235 degrees you can add in the second cup of heavy cream and stir it all very gently because you don't want it to splash up the sides and then you don't stir again until the very end the cream will lower your temperature so you can gradually increase the heat a little at a time until you reach your final temperature of 245 degrees this process of waiting not stirring and slowly raising the heat took me about 20 minutes so be patient and know that all stoves can vary as soon as you hit that 245 degrees remove the pan from the heat and shut off the burner then add in the final two teaspoons of vanilla extract and gently stir to combine then immediately pour the whole caramel mixture into your prepared dish and let it cool at room temperature for a few hours when your caramels are fully cool use a buttered pizza cutter or just a sharp knife to cut the pieces whether you call them caramel or caramel these came out perfect and were so so delicious [Music] to easily wrap them up i ordered individual wax papers off of amazon and i twisted them into adorable old-fashioned candy shapes [Music] i did learn after some practice that the squares were easier to shape if i rolled the long sections onto their cut side before cutting into individual pieces these would be even more incredible drizzled with chocolate or you could make salted caramels by adding a little flaked sea salt this recipe made over 100 individual candies which are perfect to enjoy or gift thank you so much for being here today if you are excited about the christmas season be sure to give this video a thumbs up and if you are new stick around and subscribe i have plenty more christmas content coming your way and i will see you there take care guys [Music] bye", "1bHeHNscJAI": "my recipe for sea salt caramels is creamy and the caramels have just the right amount of chew so I'm going to start these caramels with a cup and a half of sugar I'll put that in my pots for a little richness in color in flavor I add a quarter cup of dark brown sugar I pack that into my measuring cup to get the right consistency in a caramel it takes a combination of ingredients a combination of sugars but also of cream a cup of evaporated milk and I'll pour that into my pot and I'll add to that half a cup of whipping cream and for a bit of flavor I'm going to add the scraped seeds of half a vanilla bean if you want to use vanilla extract in place of the vanilla bean that you would add at the very end right when you take your caramel off the heat but because I'm adding the seeds I want to work that vanilla flavor in and it takes the heat to really extract the flavor from the seeds I have a square 8-inch pan that I've greased and lined with parchment paper so just like the lollipops the tools aren't complicated I've got my thermometer on hand to measure the temperature the entire time I cook the caramel mixture it'll be on high heat and because I've added the evaporated milk in the cream you constantly want to be stirring it and this will bubble up and steam a fair bit so just keep that in mind you want to pick a long-handled whisk and a long-handled spoon or spatula all right oh this is the point when your mixture really bubbles up it's come to a full boil so now is the time to add my corn syrup and switch to a spatula this is two thirds of a cup of white corn syrup and I don't add it with the initial sugar because then it would actually cook too far and you'd end up with a caramel that sticks in your teeth this will only take a second to return to a full boil and when you see those bubbles it may be tempting to turn down the heat but you want to keep on high but you'll constantly stir just to make sure that caramel is not sticking at the bottom the temperature I'm looking for as I Durer and the mixture bubbles away is 242 so that's also known as the softball stage well and you think of the texture of a creamy caramel it is kind of soft and then it melts away into nothingness I love that transformation of sugar to caramel as you cook it and it can take about eight minutes the smell changes the way it's bubbling changes and then you'll see towards the end the color changes there we are 242 I'll take this off the heat and I'll add my 1 tablespoon of butter and when you're making candy if the recipe calls for salt it's always added at the very end because that little addition of salt can actually impact the texture of your caramel and prevent it from being really really creamy and smooth there we go now that it's stopped boiling I can pour it into my prepared pan it looks like caramel sauce just now but it will set up because we know we hit that soft ball stage of 242 in my final Edition before it sets up is a nice even sprinkling of flaked sea salt right on top the sea salt that you sprinkle on top won't dissolve into the caramel and it adds such a satisfying crunch but it also serves to balance the sweetness of the caramel itself you want to give your caramel a long time to set it may look like it's set but I find it takes at least four hours so I set it aside on the counter to cool completely and when it's time to slice it I actually pop it in the fridge for about 90 minutes for it to cool down a little bit you don't want to store caramels in the refrigerator the sugar will actually melt and you'll end up with just a puddle of caramel so it doesn't look any different after spending just 90 minutes in the fridge and then you get that sense of creaminess go a little sauce away your parchment and then slice away really get a sense of that consistency the caramels hold together but they are still soft and pliable you want to store your caramels at room temperature and I like to store them in a single layer if they have other caramels stacked on top of each other well they will eventually flatten because part of a delicious caramel is that they are just that right amount of soft", "1CDrdASJ7sQ": "- Hi, friends, I'm Jill\nwith TheCarefreeKitchen.com, and I'm going to show\nyou today how to make the most amazing homemade caramel. The ingredients for these are very simple, however, the key to creating\nthis rich, amazing caramel is in the cooking process. Follow along and I will show you how to make these easy homemade caramels. (cheerful music) Before we get started, be\nsure to like, subscribe and follow me on social media, and I will show you all kinds\nof easy and delicious recipes your family will love. Okay, so, to get started\nwith this homemade caramel, the first thing I'm going to do, and this is an important\nstep and I'll tell you why, is this recipe calls\nfor one cup of butter, but before we add that to the pot, I'm going to unwrap my butter a little bit and then use this to\ncover my casserole dish. And the reason why you\nwanna coat this with butter and not non-stick cooking spray is because that is the first taste you're going to get in your mouth. And of course, butter is so much better than non-stick cooking spray. So we're just going to cover this, cover all the cracks and\ncrevices here, the bottom, and then also up on the side, and we're going to make sure that it is covered on\nall sides really well so that nothing sticks. Alright, after we have that done, we are going to unwrap\nthis other cube of butter, and we're going to add one\ncube of butter over to our pot. And the pot that I'm\nusing is a non-stick pot, and this is also really important. You can make it in just a regular pot, but I swear this is so much easier, so be sure you have a nice,\nbig non-stick pot to use. Okay, and then once your\nbutter is just about melted, you're going to pour in your sugars. And I had a friend who shared a variation of this recipe with me a long time ago, and we lovingly refer to it as\nthe Cuppa Cuppa Cuppa recipe because it's a cup of five things, but there's a few other\nvariations that I've made, but it's a cup of butter, white sugar, brown sugar, Karo syrup,\nand sweet condensed milk. So the next part is the white sugar. And you're just going\nto mix this up as you go so that nothing burns on the bottom. This is on medium heat right now. And then we have the cup of Karo syrup, just the light Karo syrup works great. And then we have our\nsweetened condensed milk. Measured, there we go. And then I like to add about\na half a teaspoon of salt, and that just helps cut\nthe sweetness a little bit. Also, be sure with this recipe that you just constantly stir it, and I like to stir it in a pattern that goes vertical lines this way, and then cross it this way, and then go around. And I just do that constantly\nwhile this is stirring, and actually, after it comes up to a boil, it only takes eight or nine minutes for it to come up to temperature, and I'll show you how to do that. Okay, so this is what it should look like before it starts boiling after\nyou have mixed everything in. It's nice, smooth,\ncreamy caramely-looking. Okay, so one other thing\nthat you wanna be sure that you have prepared before\nyour caramel is boiling is I have a bowl here with\nsome cold water in it, and I'm gonna show you how\nto do a soft ball testing, and then also you could\nuse a candy thermometer. And I just got this at my grocery store, and I think it was, like, $6. So if you're gonna be making some caramel, this is a great tool to invest in. You can see here it has\nall the temperatures here and the little thermometer just goes up, and actually, there's a fun\nlittle cheat sheet here, and we are going to get\nthis to soft ball stage, so hard ball is 260 and soft ball is 240, so that's the temperature that\nwe wanna get our caramel to. Alright, just stirring,\nstirring, stirring. My caramel is actually boiling now and I'm just constantly\ndoing this pattern in my pan so that it does not stick, and this is called a rapid boil, so a rapid boil is when there's\nbubbles on top of bubbles. If it was just boiling,\nit would have, like, a singular bubble come up\nfrom the bottom of the pan, but this is a rapid boil, and it needs to be in the rapid boil for six to eight minutes, depending on how high your heat is. I like to cook it a little bit lower to make sure I don't scorch this. Anyway, this is what your\ncaramel should look like. Okay, now I'm going to\nput my candy thermometer, alright, 200 degrees. Okay, while we're cooking here, I'm gonna show you how\nto do a soft ball test. So I'm gonna use a spoon, I'm gonna take a little bit of it out, and then I'll put it over\nhere in my cold water. See if I can do this and keep\nstirring at the same time. Alright, so this is what it looks like, and I should be able to put this into, they call it soft ball stage because in cold water it cools off, and you should be able\nto put it into a ball. So this is almost soft ball stage. This actually would be perfect right here for, like, caramel popcorn, because it wouldn't be too hard, it would be soft enough to chew. Alright, you don't need to\nget new water every time, just put it over. The best job is to have a\nkid who likes to taste test, and that's the perfect\nthing to taste test. Okay, I'm still stirring, going horizontal and then vertical to\nkeep it from scorching and then going around. And it's only been about six minutes, so I think we are probably getting close. Just gonna put this in here. This caramel is also really awesome to drizzle over pretzels, with maybe a little bit of white chocolate or milk chocolate, or it's the perfect caramel\nto eat out of a pan, you can pour it into a nine\nby 13 like we're doing today, cut it up, you could dip it\nin chocolate if you want, you could sprinkle a little\nbit of sea salt on it. It is a really pretty and\nactually a really easy recipe. The hardest part is just the stirring, the constant stirring, but it's only for two\nminutes, so it's not too bad. Alright, so far we are at 205 degrees, so we just got about\n50 more degrees to go. Okay, I'm gonna try\nanother soft ball test. Going to get a little bit\nof it, put it in my bowl. See, it's really close,\nbut not quite there. So you can use the soft ball test, or you can use a candy thermometer. I'm just showing you both along the way so that you can have a really successful\ncaramel making experience. Alright, I'm gonna try and show you. We are just touching that\nline for soft ball stage, so I'm going to take it off the heat, and then I will show you with\nthe cold water method also. Alright. So, as you can see, it\nkeeps its shape there, so this is perfect. You don't want it too hard that\nit's gonna break your teeth or pull a filling out, but you also want it hard enough that it's gonna keep its shape. So there we go, soft ball stage. Okay, and before we put it in the pan, I'm going to pour in about a\nteaspoon of vanilla flavoring, and we don't wanna add\nthis until the very end, or else it will lose its flavor. Alright, now into our pan. (cheerful music) Okay, so now I have my caramel in my pan. We're just going to let this sit just right here on the counter for about 45 minutes to an hour, or until I can cut it easily. Mmm, it smells so delicious. Check out that beautiful\ncaramel, it's so pretty. Okay, so I'm gonna go\nahead and cut this caramel, it looks so amazing and the\ntexture looks just about right, so let's try it out and see how it works. Okay, here are my homemade caramels, and the way I like to serve it, I like to graze a plate,\nagain, with butter and then set the caramels on there. Again, you can actually use some salt, this is some San\nFrancisco French Sea Salt. I like to get a little crumble\nsalt or the flake salt, you can order that on\nAmazon, or I found this, it's a little bit more of,\nlike, a crumble texture, and I found it at Albertsons, so you can just put a\nlittle bit in your hand and then add it right to\nthe top of your caramels, and it is so pretty. This is a fun dessert to serve at a party or around the Christmas time. It's a perfect gift to give\nyour friends or your coworkers.

am needy and today we are going to make caramel candies this candies are soft chewy and perfectly melt away in your mouth caramels are one of the easiest candies you can make at home who probably already have the ingredients in your pantry to make these candies before we begin I want to request you all if you are new to this channel then please do subscribe to my channel and let's get started like oil the parchment paper and place into the pan now take a saucepan and add 1 tablespoon of water into it then add around 1 cup of granulated sugar now keep the flame on a medium and let all the sugar melt you can see now our sugar is melted completely so now we will add around 1/4 cup of corn syrup stir until the mixture forms a thick and grainy paste at first you will see small bubbles around the edge of the pan which will eventually move inward now cover with a lid for one minute this adds moisture to the pan so any sugar that may have was stuck to the sides of the pan melts and falls back into the boiling sugar around 250 degree Fahrenheit the sugar syrup will turn transparent and boil rapidly now if you have candy thermometer then now you can move on to next step when the temperature is 275 degree you can proceed to the next step anytime after the serie bridges 250 degree Fahrenheit to 300 Fahrenheit now if you don't have thermometer then just take few drops in a cup of water and you will be able to make hard balls out of it now moving on the next stage add 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream while whisking gently slowly pour the cream into the sugar syrup sugar syrup will develop and triple in size so I will recommend you to use a bigger pan to make this recipe by adding the cream the temperature will draw now continue cooking for another 5 to 10 minutes until the caramel reaches a temperature of 250 degree Fahrenheit [Music] now add 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract or essence they also add 1/4 cup of butter [Music] stir occasionally the mixture will start off as a soft buttery yellow and eventually darken to reddish-brown caramel turn off the flame when caramel reaches between 250 degree fahrenheit to 260 degree Fahrenheit not more than that at this stage immediately pour the caramels into the mold do not scrap the bottom as it has some burned caramel and we don't want it tap the pan against the counter a few times to help air bubbles work their way out I'll let the caramel cool down at least for two hours at the room temperature if you wish you can sprinkle some salt on top of it [Music] and the caramel have set lift them out of the pan by the parchment paper cut the caramels into candies with a very sharp knife if the caramel stick to your knife spray your knife with cooking spray [Music] look at the texture of this candies it's so soft and chewy [Music] now if you want to wrap your candies then cut the square or parchment paper or little longer than your caramels and wrap each caramel in parchment paper and twist the ends close if you liked this video then please do subscribe to my channel and also share with your families and friends thank you for watching and I will see you soon with the next recipe [Music]", "LusongcjrRk": "[Music] hi friends this is a busy Baker I'm Maria I am here with my niece gene Olson Frusciante from beauty in the stamper she if you haven't checked out her channel you guys are missing out so much she's got a champagne taste on a beer budget wine a beer budget but when you look at her stuff you're talking Macy's and I'm gonna say Gimbels I'm not that old Macy's okay really cute cute craps we're gonna shoot on and do something else later but first I want to congratulate Jeanne on what I think you have like nine thousand subscribers now is that about right yeah twelve twenty six thousand clothes yeah nobody likes a show-off Jeanne no absolutely you don't get to that kind of record without being fantastic so I am so proud of you I am so proud of her so here we're gonna do we're gonna make some um I'm sorry let me just go ahead and apologize now because once you start making this one you're going to want to live off of it and to your family is going to constantly be requesting it if you had my caramels you'll know that's what we're making today so I'm gonna make a batch and geney's better make a batch and um I'm gonna just break down and tell her how to do it and see how well she does okay yeah alright so we're gonna start off with um I'm gonna lower the lower the camera and if you want to let you know that we are in today's studio audience we do have we do have a couple of let me let me try to say a couple of beauties hi girls okay so anything that they say justjust don't listen to all right so let's rock first thing we're going to do is we're going to heat some butter and when you're when you're making this you do not want to chintz up the ingredients if you like me at all please don't ever use margarine use butter use crane use the good stuff your your end result will thank you so we're gonna be up you got the fire going on it medium-high we've got the butter in there melting it's already melting yeah that's alright and we're going to put it all together so put in the sugar and then you've got two types of corn syrup all right you got the dark and the light that all goes in there and I'd like to say that this is a fat-free and sugar-free but why would I bother lying to you it's just sugary treat but you know it's Christmas time yeah if you eat it with your left hand there's no calories how's that alright the last thing we're gonna add while not the last thing but the next thing we're going to add is a heavy cream so this is all going in together this is all just gonna hang out dance and have a good old time in the meantime while this is getting going I've got a separate pot in the back here of just heavy cream and I'm gonna get that to a boil okay we're putting the cream in here yep are we stirring it at all oh yeah we're gonna we're gonna stir and once it once it comes time to rock we're gonna stir really get that cream going wait did I just hear somebody ask why are we heating that second quart of cream while I'll tell you in the meantime I'm going to continue stirring this but the reason we're doing that second pot of cream is because I'm going to add it to this mixture but this mixture is going to get hot it is going to bubble and you don't want kids around when you're making this because it can really mess them up but if you put anything cold into the caramel as it's starting to bubble and boil and get angry and it's going to look like it's gonna get angry but you're better than the caramel so if you put something cold in it it's gonna crack it's gonna get brittle II and you don't want that so you want your you're gonna incorporate the second batch of cream slowly into the bigger pot you're boiling that so that they're at about an even temperature okay so that they they can get along and and play nicely so let's continue and I really want to just keep keep the camera here because I want you to see the magic and it's just constantly stirring in the meantime I'm keeping an eye on the cream in the back you want to make sure that your pot is on top of the heat there you go all right so I'm going to just put this um get right back because I'll keep showing you as as we go along okay I'm not gonna use that a wooden spoon is going to be your best thing because it's a long-handled wooden spoon and a heavy pot jeans um Gene's plot is that's my caramel pot I use that all the time so I'm gonna give her the best ingredient best tools so that when we finished this this uh cook off she can't complain that I cheated her on it fighting champ that's what it is that's what it is so it does me no good if you if you can't make this right so let's do that so we're gonna continue you can see the thick the butter is still pretty solid the cream is not doing anything - well I'll see that that pot I'm telling you I love like those those heavy pots so let me see hurry up your butters your butter your your cream is is boiling now you don't want it to boil up you just want it to get about there and put it really low because you want it to keep it hot so I lowered her temperature way down mine is still thinking about waking up so oh my gosh I'm gonna have to buy this pot you know where I got that part I got that pot at a garage sale burritos believe me you gotta love people who could be inventive and and cheap at the same time I think we've got that covered [Laughter] inventive yeah sure tomato tomahto I guess I have no problem you see alright so I'll check back with you just as soon as we get this thing boiling and we'll we'll carry on okay so I want to show you the difference with differences between the two pots Jeannie's pot is going doggone good it's it's talking and doing all sorts of stuff it's already boiling all right it's boiling good mine is is still not sure if it wants to play with me but so what's the different I mean I know there's a difference in the pots but what kind of pot is this as opposed to that's it that's a heavy stainless steel pot okay so um and it's funny because I've got these beautiful pots and pans set that without my daughter gave me and I love it but I've never made my my caramels in it because I know how good that works now let's look at how that thing is going it's going really good so lower it just a little bit and turn up that back cream just a little bit because we still want that back cream hot we want it hot all right yeah the the studio audience back there they just they just don't rules were given before they entered the studio and they don't listen that's cuz we're gonna make them sign a contract there's nothing to lose sign a contract just say okay or mark an axe that used to work oh okay Wow my butt is melted that's alright and I much rather I much rather you have this than be discouraged by this I'm not discouraged this baby is starting to say hey you know what all you guys are talking about this stuff I want to play see that's beautiful that's beautiful I'm gonna lower the heat on that because I need it to stay I need it to stay hot so I'm gonna ask you I am stirring this because I'm afraid it's gonna boil up and over is it something that needs to be constantly constantly stirred it needs to be constantly stirred when you are making caramels you do need a constant stirring and will be here for about 20 minutes I might be here for an hour and a half but yeah it's about 20 minutes from from this point on now see this um see this meal see this cream that's boiling pretty good I'm gonna turn it completely off so it'll stay there all right Jamie is it okay this is a really gettin big it's alright that's alright we're good you're good I'm so scared it's going to uh like you can burn me with a hot glue gun but I did not want to be burned by hot sugar yes that is no joke man they're a completely different kind of burn and a glue gun yeah that goes off quickly even if it blisters but this this is this is not something you want to mess with so one time I was testing out a creme brulee torch and so I thought it would be nice to test it on a little with all the sugar and then I instantly touched it to see how hot it was and I left myself a burn for a few weeks I think everybody has a stupid burn story I mean I don't now I'll admit to but hey what's that right there nothing see Who am I hurt oh okay I'm going to show you the consistency of both of these caramels because they are at completely different temperatures which is really kind of cool alright so mine is very thin you see that very watery gene lift yours up it's still very thin but it is it is it's gonna stake in for a while and then and then it's gonna get a little bit thicker and then when it reaches the point where we want to start slowing it down it's gonna get pretty thick it's gonna coat the back of your spoon really well you'll see a huge difference so let me check back with you when we get this thing boiling you know what Jeannie here's what you can do you can go ahead and add your hot milk okay now when you do this gene I want you to really really drizzle it in now put it towards this towards the center there you go so that if it drips backwards there it still goes in slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow keep stirring slow slow slow perfect keep going do you see how slowly she's adding it it has to go in really slowly so that it doesn't break and crack this recipe is one of the creamiest chuyia Scaramella it's buttery it's absolutely decadent you will you will it'll knock your socks off no then you can't play and you know what's funny this this little pot is gonna weigh a ton now isn't it yes it really could tell you when you have to when you have to control it all right now you're gonna see that it's getting higher and it's getting more vicious no worries it's fine when the milk is in and it's set it's gonna really knock its socks off its going to drop down its gonna chill out and then it's going to start to thicken up okay so mine is about ready for that oh oh that popped however yes you play right no it was just a drop it's not it's not a big deal so you want to make sure to stir it really slowly and you want to go from the back zigzag all the way to the front to keep it from burning and then hook it around to the sides to keep it from sticking all right so I'm gonna add my cream and I'm going over the I don't I'm not familiar with these pans I'm going over the pan so that it all falls into the pot and the really the neat thing about this my favorite part is when it's all done and you put in the vanilla at the very end otherwise you'll burn the vanilla all right this baby is yeah mine is going pretty good all right so this is gonna ha I know I'm telling you these cuts are a huge difference all right now Jean you have a candy thermometer over there uh-huh I want you to stick that into the back oh okay so there's a there's a little clip on the back that'll go right on to your your plus plus it has a um a little lip on the bottom of it so that it won't actually touch the touch the bottom of the pot otherwise you'll get a wrong reading all right so it's gonna very quickly go up to about 200 and then it's gonna stop there for a bit you see it oh yeah okay hold on because I do want you see that can you see that there mister mama - right there it's gonna go it'll stay at 220 for probably about ten minutes and you want to get it to the soft ball stage where am I at where's my finger which is right about there but right oh right here yes just below that okay gene how you old no good you didn't know this is gonna be a workout huh no you did not tell me this part no well actually when you workout so much like this then you get you eat more kernels that's my story how lost you think I keep my girly figure I said that to an older older gentleman friend of mine once and and I don't know what when I was serving him he goes oh no that's just that's just too much and he was well you couldn't eat this much how cute um and I go well of course that good how else do you keep do you think I keep my girly figure he goes I'm not touching that one he's not stupid all right so let me show you I love I love that we did them so differently in different pants because they're they're a huge difference what's your temperature gene I'm still at 220 yep yeah we'll see look at about 10 minutes it's probably barely gonna be going up but continue stirring this thing so it doesn't stick all right well check in back all right that that molten gold is just beautiful look how thick it is lift your spoon up gene Oh see see how thick that is I mean such a huge difference from one that started you can even see the thickness dripping down ah that's good stuff now you want to make sure to scrape the sides really well good job and when and it's gonna get thicker still so just make sure to scrape the sides and and keep it all kind of mixed and blended really well all right look at that Boyle that is a beautiful Boyle it's thick its rich drizzle some some caramel and let me see hope you see how thick that got yep it coats the spoon so do that again and coat the back of the spoon so we could see it okay so you're gonna get a thousand little bubbles and then they're gonna disappear you know someone had said oh you ought to have a um what did you say a wine and caramel party I'm going you know I can do I cannot do the two together I will need to have wine or I will work and do Carmo but there's no way the two are gonna happen god only knows what will come up after I have a glass or two or three or nine okay so I'm looking at this and I want to just eat it right now yeah that'll burn it um well I know that oh oh but what it since it's not at that softball stage could I just like put it in a jar and use it later first okay okay can I just say what the frosting this girl just totally read my mind because I didn't mean to say something about this and I forgot so here we go that's why we worked well together okay so you're gonna take this for for a soft caramel you want it to adjust below just about 240 degrees okay if you stop at 200 okay maybe it a bit or two above that but if you stop at 200 you have just made some of the most amazing caramel sauce as a matter of fact that's uh I made that just the other day and I jarred them I put them in little jars and those are gonna be perfect Christmas presents and I'll put them with an apple two apples will put an apple a red apple and a great will Apple with a small jar of the caramel sauce and those are great little gifts so yeah stopping it at at 200 will give you a great caramel sauce you can you can melt it over a poured over ice cream you can now this is a little bit thicker but but I liked it like that because I wanted it for it for apples but if you want to take this put it just like this and I'll boil a pot of hot boiling water because you know cold boiling water just won't work put it in a pot of boiling water and it'll fit it up and then you can you can pour it over ice cream or with cookies or drink it put in an IV just you know yeah in there it's in there and then it'll get you so that's beautiful it must be close but but don't push this one this one let it you're gonna want to take it on and you're gonna think oh no no no it's going it's going too much it's gonna burn leave it alone I'm gonna show you hers and then I'm gonna I'm gonna show you that looks so good I'm so excited for her oh oh my gosh my arm feels like it just worked out like I think I just lifted 120 pounds 10 times at least we will pump you up I already know I'm a dork I don't know who's surprised by this I'm getting there you are getting I think I'm there now okay here's the reason I put that parchment paper next to you is because this is where you're going to very carefully gene let me have the handle on this side okay that looks beautiful so you're gonna very carefully you can help in - mine is so drastically than mine oh I want to drink that what a difference right so take this and dollop just a little bit onto your parchment paper cup and just let it let it hang there well no no okay these are you know I'm all about quality control I don't know what the heck you find - control of that alright so she's done she is ready to rock and roll but here's the really cool part now I'm gonna take this okay ah stupid that's alright so now you're gonna take when you add the vanilla it's going to get so mad at you that's it okay all right awesome sorry about that okay um I had lightly sprayed a square 8x8 baking dish Thank You Jean Carol Merrill and parchment paper to fit and hang over the sides okay now you're gonna pour that genie just pour it right on in do not scrape the bottom just pour pour pour pour pour no mercy on that baby now very gently scrape the sides but not the bottom not the bottom very gently okay see that that different colors right there mm-hmm that's going to caramelize so stop clean the bottom of that pot the bottom or the part that's dripping oh okay that's it you're done you're done okay now scrape that whole thing gene on to that other piece of parchment paper scrape the whole bottom okay okay check this out so Jean finished hers and in a fraction of the time then it took for my other pot to finish so I transferred my mixture into this and now it's starting to come alive and say well where have you been ding dong Wow alright so there you go now jeans those oh how is it Jean so here those those duh lips that you put aside this is the one case they're warm they're soft here because it's chewy and I'm sorry oh man that is so buttery oh you want more so that back TVs was that taste was just a teaser just enough to get you mad okay well mine finally decided to play right once I put it in the right go figure right now it's good it's beautiful it's thick it's creamy see that that's good that's a good-looking caramel now I'm gonna add the unfamiliar and then it's gonna just start to roar just be careful and that's it that's it the fire is off and you always want to add the vanilla after you've removed it from the heat I'm going to pour this into alright and I'm not going to scrape the pan I'll show you how I'm gonna do it I'm gonna pour it in okay and I am very gently going to just take this top part off the bottom part is so much hotter it will crystallize and it will it will crunch and you don't want that in a soft caramel so I'm gonna take this put it on to portrait paper because there's no way I'm gonna let this sucker go to rest or to waste so that will go that will Harden and is yours okay so this is the one that Jean did and it's it's good it's still soft but you can see just a little bit of crackle in it I don't want any crackle on on my caramel I want it creamy so here's what I'm gonna do to mine since we made since we made two batches don't mess with me baby I'm not here to play around alright I'm going to add some sea salt some pink Himalayan sea salt didn't that sound fancy did we ever talk about salts I don't know if I ever made a video on salt oh my goodness well I will because it's so it's so interesting but the in in a nutshell the different portions of the globe have different minerals and such in the oceans and so you to get a different flavored salt not so much that you know oh no this is pink Himalayan when I really wanted Gregg Himalayan yeah it's not like that but sea salt on top of this just a crackle now I'm doing it when it's still wet so that it doesn't fall off okay so it's gonna sit it's gonna harden and then you've got a salted caramel candy oh I'm sorry alright so let me it was her I'm telling you right now it was she makes me do things okay so if you okay I can't reach the camera so if you can just come over and look okay hold on a minute okay you see how she is she didn't you just stood there laughing you're crooked go this way okay so this is the this is the caramel it's hot man I can feel that heat and it's got the salt on it oh yeah so this needs to sit overnight let it cure both of them are going and through the magic of wiggle television oh shut up all right you're going to loosen it up because you sprayed with the vegetable oil earlier after this sticky part it will just pop off I'll just pop out you won't you got a worm on it but now it will and this is perfect for no well it is but I want alright so we're gonna measure out okay this is an 8x8 pan so sorry I promise you I really do know what I'm doing alright I'm just gonna cut this into 1-inch strips boy mm mm okay so I'm just gonna measure out one inch strips and it's really it's really interesting how this is when you cut it it's kind of fun to watch it because it it comes to life much like frosting so you've got this baby all right so this is what you're gonna do this is the bar that you're gonna be working with you're gonna keep doing that and you after a while the lines will melt right into each other so you kind of want to get these things cut and then put aside and if you put it next to the other one it'll it'll get right back to where it was it'll find its friend and then want to hang out all right so let me just finish this up Jean you want to finish that well I um watch trusting me with a knife so when I was young I used to sit in front and like pretend I knew how to cook and bake and pretend I was Julia Child and that there was a television camera on on me when I did all this genie a child or not the UM blank diverse in show all right so because these things now here's the funny thing if you leave this here in about an hour so it's gonna start to relax and they're gonna spread out that's all right the portions that I make I always like to make um I'm sorry let me I'm sure you don't want to UM I assure you you won't my chest talking to you so the portions that I make are there's caramels all over my home but I would much rather make smaller portions and let them have five or six then serve large portions and have any of it go to waste none has ever gone to waste but I really you know I'd rather you take 20 then throw away half so what I like to do is I cut them in just real small small almost like tootsie roll sizes okay just a small tipsy world size just throw it oh my gosh okay what just happened on this end of the camera and the wheelchair can throw about as good as I don't know Tom Brady she throws her might it lands right there I've seen her throat and it lands backwards I'm just saying so when when she tells you to throw it I got scared okay so this is the caramel piece isn't that perfect it's a perfect little size and so good so you cut it this size you're wrapping in a piece of wax paper and that's it so let me let me just show you I got to figure out a way to do this better we need to invest in a drone okay so I'm literally just going to slice a few at a time making sure that they stay separate because right away they'll start to wanna cling back to each other you just wrap them right like that if you form them I I wrap them just like this they look a little wonky but by the time they sit get wrapped and sit again in the and this is when you um you can sit in front of the TV and get your kids around and play games and talk and have fun and it really is a fun way to just bring in bring in the Christmas cheer kind of thing I'm gonna do one side say I've done it all the ways I do it all the way through well I'm doing it all the way through would be wrapping it unwrapping it and eating it the finished product is great yeah if something to that huh answer roll these little the right way you have to roll them the right way perfect perfect perfect give me a thumbs up you guys I've never done this before well you did it now a girl and you did it with great success so we've got the salted caramel we've got the regular caramel you can also because I only like to cause trouble take these caramels and dip them in chocolate yeah I'm just saying I'm just saying it happens like that so knock your socks off my friend this is my Christmas caramel I hope you had a good time watching it I have so much fun making it with this wacko and those my studio audience oh I'm gonna have to talk to the security guard to do a better job in checking in there all right my friends until next time happy baking ah that was fun don't forget to Like and subscribe", "Vr_1Mr9U9Qg": "[Music] hello toxin chocolate sown in between chocolates a phone or video review this time have a new KitKat don't be so limited edition but so kick out with with well I'm adding with a taste of caramel cappuccino I mean wow this I mean you'd be hard not to like the sound of this I think you'd be harder and hard person to not understand this that's a I mean it sounds amazing I mean there's a three different ones I've just reviewed them with taste of coconut it's double trouble once a comment not review this one yet of course this one there this one now yes oh wow well I mean caramel cappuccino I'm a fan of both of these flavors in chocolate obviously I know coffee can be a bit divisive but for me definitely fun of this so I think you I think you just looks amazing I mean they're just weird the coconut one and it did look just like it does on the wrapper then damn I like the rapper's I like the way it represents as if he wasn't in the wrapper there I mean it works really well I think I'm really happy yeah really happy with it yes I would Scott punch translation the bottom as well they're just this more than realize I think this is so very caramel cappuccinos well say it's French have no idea it might be who knows I was using boy but now I think this is a not a UK bar because it's probably the primary languages of Polish and French on it and and it does have sort of sticker on the back on the nutrition information it's just shining there which is common typical for when it's not a UK bar because they want that as a translator I have the standard measurements or whatever put in place so what's the M what's the well you already have the we know we have like a sort of very sec stop for ones of a better term a description of these bars because it's a well it still isn't English on the fun things but basically we there isn't a chance of having one so what we do have is the official ones whose gots a crunchy wafer covered with milk chocolate 39 percent and white chocolate 30.6% with cappuccino and caramel flavor so they've won the year the competent one was milk and white chocolate swab all the percentages were different changing often only by a small numbers the milk top unique one was 31% first 1.1 it's 39 this time one oh sorry sorry yeah yeah the milk chocolate yeah 31.1 as opposed to 39 in this one and the white chocolate was 38.4 and the white shopping this one is thirty point two six so yeah that's a bit odd isn't it they've mixed about there so it's interesting by the way we've done that in a way but I guess it's to make it this one looks a bit darker basically you know which I guess is widely button II really because this one's meant to look a bit more like coffee well it's coconuts obviously a lighter color I want to make you look slightly different obviously caramel is dark as well no very very happy about this he looks great sirs per hundred grams in 500 25 calories twenty seven point seven grams of fats 15.5 a Twitter satirist so when it's basic exactly the same as the is the the coconut one mmm yeah so per basis hundred twelve ground bass there's a fifth pretty much a fifth added on it's got per serving which is two sticks yeah 490 hundred eighteen calories sorry hundred eighteen calories yeah so basically it's bird this is for the whole bar so you had pretty much a fifth back onto this so you're adding will flee their attempt so not fear 4/10 yeah so basically I'd write it so it's about five hundred and seventy thousand eighty calories for the whole thing roughly thirty grams of fats and roughly seventeen which a satirist so I love saturated fat proportional you know to me it's a real looks amazing have a break a murky cats on the side so it's all in English it's not even noticed I don't think it's wasn't officially a UK last call English in it yeah there's actually a British English aims text on the back I don't think yeah everything there is mm-hmm yeah so well yeah I can't see it anyway these like bits highlighting of white there's a bolded rather and and none of it looks to be in English six is Spanish yeah sugar and things you know and this is just Portuguese I think and polish yeah stuff like that German yeah I know English so yeah as to say the other thing I'm not necessary for is it's a whole bar as well it's not split in two you know when it's not secondly why it's not split into two so normally cats yeah you know we're partition over into two or four usually two so yes so in the UK probably released as a 14 for December we've got the ice cream and a round apparently side ice creams but we who knows he has been around he's raining and it's to reminisce weather outside and literally has come around 8 o'clock at night I don't live in a war zone by the way anything like that but the ice cream man does come around about 8 o'clock now and it's pitch black in the winter and it's raining and I'll leave you to make your own decisions about that but yes butter chocolate mmm yeah so yeah yeah it's gotten us let's go come on the meaning ghost looks I think the roughly looks very nice I think has a real good look of a real look of quality really even though Balmain well not me no he's still being a KitKat I think I like the gold on it you know yeah let's say normally yes finger loss between a foot while saying there's normally a kick ass coming like a two to stick set or maybe four sometimes but in a pack of say two eight or ten two thing inversions those two sticks to your fingers so they're normally this we have strange that the author was one block really so know it would come individually into two individually wrapped bars so eight of them eight two fingered bars yeah so this one obviously is it's five I think two fingered I was tense it's time thing is basically going one yes I think I don't really smell rocky caddies but you've probably must you know but it's basically a thing of chocolate or easily - as I say maybe for in some instances and so wafer comes with milk chocolate generally in the way for might have chocolate partition in there and this one is obviously flavored with a cappuccino caramel and it's got milk and white chocolate as well to make up marbled effect so it's 19 centimeters of thinking length let's just do one thing all the same size so hopefully basically yeah about 19 centimeters maybe 18 point oh what was a 19 I think cuz it's not quite even mmm yeah and I think it loses about three point two centimeters so what will they find out a minute let's give an open thanks I believe this okay one I think I was censored hopefully I'm so if I'm not soon yeah let's give it an open I think it's no party she will not split it down the middle totally full inside as well I guess that's one thing we don't notice promise about the same you know hear me or disease tcats keeping advice in the UK to Wow [Applause] so really strong deaf he'd say cappuccino smell definitely a coffee the you know typical coffee chocolate smell it's really nice I mean the coconut one out of lovely smart I mean well yeah yeah well boy I was about to say sorry is that the see the foil inside showing your surface usually come we've actually liked info wrapping you know and you could split them you could run your finger down the middle split between the two fingers and they're split in half and it would snap in half from the forward break you don't really that's one thing you're missing with it so obviously does have the funnel flapper so yeah point does cost more to do that it's a nice thing you do I mean he's still doing the UK these stops are things for a while and but they do do it again now so it's quite nice and that's the two thing advice yes it's fifteen point eight so you've lost three point two centimeters Wow smells gorgeous a little bit oh wow wow look at that quite tell if it's on the full camera there I'm sorry about this but ya say that looks tell us really nice doesn't it it's got Tim you see it's a 10/10 fingers they're not partitioned what there's a line down the middle the only partition but it's not really partition that way it's a nice small small indent partition there you can see I'm marbling effect was very beautiful and and you can see as well it's got too soft it says kick ass twice one on each half just say hashtag my break or anything like that sometimes they do in the UK stocky cap looks amazing I mean he looks absolutely beautiful and I think it looks exactly if not better than it does on this sort of sneak preview you've got under from a rapper see that there I mean yeah that's really really oh that's a pretty means a bit dark on this one I think but I think he'd say it's accurate not I mean that's really impressive yeah so yeah in hand it's not quite as looks roughly the same I think when she's the like shine on it like it is here I think it looks a bit dark a bit more darker on the other rapper but in hand it looks pretty much the same and pretty much mean yeah bit darker you don't know it's not hard to know Todd well yeah bit darker well I'm a enough I think that's perfect I think that's really good I think she's just as you'd expect I'm really impressed I'm really impressed I I yeah well he looks be looks though he just looked beautiful see the Packers well that's all it's all dark milk chocolate on the back is marbled on the top that's amazing yeah horrible I don't want to Snuppy really but well let's make it a whiff I think it's the same you what we the same as you nine centimeters wide pretty much and maybe now I put one almost book and this one centimeters tall yeah well speaks interest for most measuring peak to the bottom but one sense to me yeah people one centimeter right let's get a snap for its nuts well so that's of a side they can see a perfect look over wafer there looks like biscuits actually doesn't name but yeah interesting it's not snuffing where I'm wanting it to snuff yeah and there we go you can see the sides come off on one of them nervous you got like a they should do a longer side yeah so cappuccino and caramel flavor I believe that's just type of double check crunchy way for cup milk chocolate and white chocolate so fit absent and want milk chocolate 30.6% of the wife's with a cappuccino and caramel flavor right well I think it looks amazing with other tasting some yes excited let's give it Motz live one rights yeah I'm excited say sisters is the cappuccino and caramel flavored KitKat so it's giving again it smells goods as I say you know I think I suppose more coffee flavored there's probably a caramel hint to the taste but to the smell but hmm yeah let's give me hmm hmm I don't think hmm the flavor combination doesn't quite work as well with this one mmm it's nice mm-hmm the top is good yummy taste white or milk chocolates just obviously blended together and you taste nice I see I really like the chocolate hmm I think the flavors here they'll be confused I think only a cappuccino I'm getting a bit it's more like caramel latte I think it's nice it's nice I just don't think it's quite one thing I love it's not really caramel the cappuccino it's not really I don't know I love the point of the wafer hmm hmm me would say there's a coffee flavor there but I mean the poem got is the term it's just is too sweet when the caramel doesn't shouldn't really be there I think let me just say Carol cappuccino but what does that really mean when you think about it you know now I'm thinking on this is probably what it is you know something that's not just very sweet it's not really a cappuccino just like a liquid that has coffee taste that's been doused with lots of sugar and you know I guess it's not too bad if it's a warm drinking you know Starbucks or something you know when you think oh you know and you kind of evil works as a coffee because you've got those heat of it and this that's innumerable ways this is a wafer chocolate called way for biscuit mmm that really doesn't taste like a coffee that's all you know you've had the flavor to it and yeah because it isn't a coffee you know see right on the flavor and then the flip minor flavors just lost you're going sweet things you know you're not really guessing that coffee taste I don't think hmm they're your source of our but not really enough hmm hmm you Karen Gainey but he's just too sweet this one I think I think that caramel flavor just doesn't help him I think without that you would have got more of an intense chocolate taste stuffing go sorry coffee taste and which is what you're after I think it didn't need the caramel to be added on because you got the sweetness of the chocolate you know you've got that sweet taste anyway I think the caramel is just making it too sweet which is just meaning you're not really getting a coffee a cappuccino coffee flavor let's face it cappuccino coffee here means you know it's coffee really but they just made it nice I'm better with cappuccino and I guess because he loves them the way the marbling look as well as bit more copper - no way yeah it sounds so mean of course once you've had a bit of aces you start to win very harder to to really tell the flavors of Papa no struggling - you know the smell as well he's kind of possibly more caramel than coffee it's hard to say you know I guess he's probably caramel cappuccinos smell really yeah there's a move I can do it that hmm maybe three maybe maybe maybe it does smell or taste rather than smell caramel cappuccinos so maybe the problem really is with with a caramel cappuccino in itself and if you did have one it would just be too sweet but I think but I'm glad but I thought thinking about it I'm not buying that because I think the thing with a with a real caramel cappuccino caramel coffee caramel anything what don't come to you know caramel coffee misses it would be a liquid and it'd be warm and it would be something you're drinking you know so those things are more like coffee than the kick is without these flavors so when you're adding those flavors to this you're not getting something that really symbolizes a caramel cappuccino you know you might you know maybe account cappuccino is too sweet and the caramel taste over overrides the the cappuccino taste but even then it still might work in all in there drink that is a coffee but in this bisque I just don't think it works yeah still nice I mean it's just kind of like an aftertaste or when you start so you and it's about ready to be swallowed he just tastes a bit too sweetener that's the white chocolate or not always just the caramel taste coming through but mm-hmm these still nice is still different it's just not quite the homerun so to speak of the year if they've won so far we've have felt really nailed it you probably look dead well thank you mmm goofy now for maybe a four out of five thing hmm would you still look good mark I think you're still nice it's still different and still looks great I see it might give me a three and a half I might give it a four we'll see what it comes to and actually do the captions and things after that time to think about it more but I think mm-hmm yeah disappointing nothing but doesn't say I think I don't they I'll go over it again I've ever explained it quite well it's quite complicated thing to explain but I just don't think why hits the mark and I think it might do and I think it mainly doesn't because it's not a drink you know and the flavors just don't you haven't got enough to carry it as a flavor combination when he said when it's a biscuit chocolate biscuit or chocolate sweet or chocolate like this when it's a drink I think you know you can forgive certain things I've still manages to work because of the other sensations and the fact it's a liquid it's warm things like this or this one I think those two flavors together just don't work and they just they just just combat each other and I don't think it's I don't think works well enough really really could also be they could also be this sort of the they quote the amount of milk and white chocolates not quite the same as in this the coconut one as well maybe about sort of different fat so hard to say mmm not sure I'm not sure on that one and we still taste nice to chocolate to be honest with you I think still tastes good so I think it's more the flavors I just don't think they work well together so I think yeah yeah and it doesn't taste like a carrot just tastes too sweet mmm smells great though you know I'll tell me yes I think I'm probably gonna possibly go to three and a half but yeah we'll see we'll see my if I might I might give it the benefit now and give it a four cuz well you have our components and the quality of the packaging this and the other book mm-hmm but as it stands for half out of five I think okay yeah is why we do the review I've got this one coming up next I've also reviewed the and the coconut one taste of coconut I'm gonna do the double chocolate one let's not taste of double chocolate this one's just double chocolate I'm gonna do on that so not tasted out yet potentially the best one double chocolate is always here - well my hits of miss book because sometimes give you too much expectations so we'll see but yeah yeah good luck gosh I want to subscribe a lot of videos as well leave the comments offering and more your favorite is up the three of them and yeah I'll seen this time take everyone see you later patreon as well bye for now [Music]", "W55jA0VmPZo": "it's time to cook with susan beck merry christmas it's the weekend after thanksgiving and at our house it's time to get started on the holiday baking we love to make lots of many good treats like peanut clusters and almond bark pretzels and cashew crunch and peanut blossom cookies my daughter and i began yesterday instead of black friday shopping on these goodies and today i'm going to show you how to make caramels this was a special treat growing up in my family there was never a christmas where we skipped this one of my sisters even continues this tradition with my mom of making them every year now i've put a couple twists on this that i'll show you as we go through it but first let's look at the ingredients you will need a heavy pot with a lid two cups of sugar two cups of corn syrup two sticks of butter and a half a teaspoon of cream of tartar will be the first ingredients into the pan then we will be adding two cans of sweetened condensed milk half a cup of flour and here's one of my secret ingredients that i have added to the recipe after watching some alton brown cooking shows on salt and sugar and the need for them to go together that will be four tablespoons of soy sauce we'll be pouring this onto a parchment lined cookie sheet and sprinkling it with kosher salt because again we'd like a little salt to it i like to sort store it in tins so i've got some ready to go step one is to put in our first four ingredients we've got two sticks of margin two cups of corn syrup which would be this entire 16 ounce bottle into there while that's draining out two cups of granulated sugar and a half a teaspoon of cream of tartar these ingredients are going to go into this pan on some like medium high heat to start with here as my goal is to get that sugar to dissolve we want to get this to a boil we need the butter to melt and all those sugar crystals to disappear now i've just been stirring this every once in a while making sure that my sugar is not stuck on the bottom and that everything is melting together that cream of tartar that was put in here is to help with the elimination of crystallization of our corn syrup so that might be an ingredient that's a little different than some recipes that was not in the original recipe that i grew up making now this is just about to a small simmer and my butter is almost melted i am going to do something next that my mom probably would cringe at if she knew i was going to do this but after watching this salty sweet presentation by alton brown on the food network i learned a few things and another one of those was that we really can put the lid on this and leave it boil so i am going to put the lid on and leave it for five minutes without looking that was stressed in the tv show so five minutes on my timer and i will begin now note that i did turn my heat down to medium low we are one minute in to this five minute process three minutes in and not much to look at since we're not supposed to peek under that lid four minutes in don't do it i know it's tempting don't peek oh our timer has gone off let's have a look we get to peek now look at this we have a nice pale yellow caramel going on at this point we're going to add in our thermometer let's stop this beeping here we're going to put in a candy thermometer and on here i want to get somewhere between 240 and 248 degrees and after that five minutes of boiling with the lid on we were already pretty close to where we wanted to be i'm gonna turn it off right now all right let's take out that candy thermometer and then we are going to add into this our sweetened condensed milk our flour and our soy sauce this half cup flour is going to be mixed into one of the cans of sweetened condensed milk just like when making any kind of roux you know a white sauce for gravy or for scalloped potatoes or something that flour when added to something hot has a tendency to clump but if i mix it in with the sweetened condensed milk it will not have that problem all right into the caramel mixture it goes and then we will add in our other can of sweetened condensed milk plus those four tablespoons of soy sauce that soy sauce is a great way to give a little saltiness because soy sauce really is pretty much just salt all right four tablespoons one two three and four that might seem like a lot but you know you will not say it's too salty okay i want to switch from this rubber spatula back to my wooden spoon i'm going to get my heat going back again here because i need to bring this all back to that 240 temperature again everything is mixed together there's starting to be a color change where these are becoming more of a golden color rather than that pale yellow that we had we're going to put our thermometer back in and see what we have for a temperature again remember we are looking to get to that softball stage of 240 degrees we have a little ways to go here so we will stir now and then i'm to the point where i really need to be stirring i'm a little worried about burning i think i'm getting a little burning here caramels are one of those touchy ones probably one of the more challenging things that i will make a video about we are not yet to our soft oil stage though we are only at about 190 degrees on the thermometer my canned thermometer says 240 degrees so we are going to pour these onto our already lined parchment paper jelly roll pan now i am not going to scrape the sides of this because i fear that i have a little bit of burnt on caramel on the side and i do not want that mixed into my caramels all right it rolls out quite well and fills all the space i'm gonna let that sit for a little bit and then i will add a little kosher salt i'm going to let it sit for just a little bit so the salt doesn't completely sink in but i also need to put it on while it's still sticky oh yes and one last tip pound your tray a little bit to be sure you don't have any air pockets inside now cleanup can be a little frightening but it really doesn't need to be i didn't want to scrape the sides off well because i thought maybe i had a little burning going on there so i just filled this with water and i'm just simmering some water in this because that sugar will just dissolve again so don't be frightened of oh man the cleanup is going to be crazy i'm never going to get that off just remember hot water and sugar they'll take care of each other five minutes have gone by since i poured these into the pan i am going to now scatter on top some of this kosher salt because that salt mixed with that sweet caramel you'll be amazed what your taste buds think the caramels have been sitting for about two hours and i am ready now to cut and wrap them so the reason for this parchment paper is because check out how easy it is oh i might have a little stickiness on the end to lift them out i am going to use a pizza cutter to cut these into little rectangles and if i was trying to do that on a jelly roll pan i wouldn't be able to cut into the corners very well if i used a open cookie sheet well my caramel might have run off the side so this is a great way to do it line your sheet with parchment paper and use a pizza cutter so i'm going to cut little one inch squares out of my caramel oh and this is cutting so nicely let's get close i'm going to simply turn that around to make it easier to slice in the other direction and i believe i have 70 caramels here to wrap while the caramels were cooling i was cutting little rectangles of parchment paper mine are about five inches by four inches in size i simply just cut off the strip and since this is 15 inches wide i just estimate about 5 inches for each of my squares then i take a caramel let's see my cutter there they're kind of sticking back together a little bit and i place it in the center of my parchment paper and i just roll around it and twist the ends this is the point in the project where the whole family gets involved you know the cooking it's kind of hard for more than one or two people to be involved in that especially with all the boiling and watching your colors and watching for burning and you know even making a video with it was a little bit challenging for me because i was trying to do two things at once but this point in my family when we were growing up everyone had to come to the table and help i mentioned earlier in the video that i really like to store these if i can get the lid off i'll work on that one later store these in little christmas tins and these are an excellent gift as well all right we better give it a taste before we wrap up and i call the family to come and help with this so i'm just going to cut off a piece off of that one and i'm going to look for that salty taste ooey gooey and you know these are unbelievably sweet caramel just is but i just love that salt that kicks in every once in a while with a little bite so give these a try get yourself a candy thermometer and enjoy this holiday treat", "TS6JQkjMDsY": "this video is specially made for manzan media and isaac adventure thanks for your recommendation and thanks for your support and watching check out monza media if you want to level up on your youtube channel as well as any social media graphics if you want to escape the everyday life check out izog adventure as he chronicles his adventures of van life while traveling through europe if you have a sweet tooth like me then you probably love caramels i love chewy caramel specifically for the lovely texture as well as the great flavors stick around to the end of this video as i show you how to make the perfect chewy caramel i always enjoy making these caramels because they are buttery and rich with perfect texture they are delectable they melt in your mouth and it always smells amazing in the house when you cook caramels my neighbors always know when i'm making this caramel as the aromas waft down the street combine the cream sugar honey corn syrup and salt in the pan stir the ingredients in the pan to combine and cook over medium heat until the caramel reaches 115 degrees celsius this should take approximately 20 to 25 minutes for the ingredients i'm using a flavorful honey from the apiary at my family farm i'm also using a homemade vanilla extract using the best ingredients will always yield the best results i enjoy using this caramel with other confectionery recipes it's perfect if you want to make your own twix bar as well add it with nuts and you can make great nut caramel clusters occasionally stir the sides in the bottom of the caramel pan keep the sides of the pan clean preventing any sugar crystals from forming any sugar crystals on the side of the pan can interfere with the structure of your chewy caramel next add the butter and continue to cook until the temperature reaches 122 degrees celsius use a good quality butter that is at room temperature i like to use a good french butter in this case as the flavors are fantastic and it's a higher fat content and fat is good just like anything good enjoy in moderation once the butter is added the temperature of the caramel will drop continue cooking until the temperature reaches its desired stage i like to test the set of the caramel by placing a small sample of the caramel in a bowl of cold water remove the caramel from the water to test the set if the caramel is soft but just retains its shape that is a good sign that the caramel is going to be a lovely chewy consistency add the vanilla and give the pan a good swirl be careful when adding vanilla to a hot pan as the vanilla may boil and spit in contact with a hot caramel by adding the vanilla at the end of the caramel cooking stage we are retaining the beautiful aromas of this floral vanilla instead of pouring the finished caramel into a lined container i'm preparing my work surface for forming and cooling the caramel i placed a sheet of parchment paper onto my work surface and i'm using four aluminum caramel rods to form a rectangle shape of approximately 10 by 14 inches of course if you don't have caramel rods you can also use a baking tray lined with paper pour the caramel and allow to set it will take a few hours so leave the caramel undisturbed to properly set before cutting into it once the caramel is cooled it is time to cut i'm using a small offset palette knife to loosen the caramel rods because of the butter in the caramel the rods will release easily slide the caramel onto the cutting board and remove the caramel rods use a lightly oiled knife to cut your caramels i am using an accordion cutter to mark and cut the caramels into my desired widths accordion cutters come with rotary wheels they usually come in sets of five to six wheels per unit as the name implies the accordion cutter will expand so you can control the width of your cutting i've left a link in the description for this as well as other tools that i use when cutting the caramel you can also chill the caramel briefly by briefly chilling the caramel i will have a cleaner cut line to wrap the caramels use pieces of waxed paper you can purchase confectionery wax paper to do this job place a piece of caramel onto the center of the wax paper next wrap the caramel in the paper to twist the paper locate the space between the caramel and the edge of the paper now twist the paper to wrap this will prevent the paper from ripping while wrapping to enhance this chewy caramel sprinkle sea salt onto the surface of the caramel you can also dip the pieces of caramel in chocolate to make chocolate covered caramels this is a lovely chewy caramel one of my favorite characteristics of a good chewy caramel is seeing the pull look at the caramel pleasantly stretch as i pull it this is a fantastic caramel do you have a favorite confection and always wondered how it's made let me know in the comments in the meantime if you are interested in learning more about confections watch this playlist youtube also recommends this video", "03rqHGcOGnY": "hey you guys welcome to my channel today I'm going to show you how to make these delicious chewy caramel candies from scratch using really simple ingredients this is an old-fashioned recipe that I know you're really going to love and they're way better than the ones you buy in a store it's a pretty easy recipe but there are a couple of steps involved so let's get started in a small saucepan measuring two cups of 35% cream now if you take your empty cream cartons and heat them gently for a few seconds on each side like this the rest of the cream will come out now heat this to a lukewarm and set it aside now in a medium saucepan measure out two cups of sugar and one cup of corn syrup don't forget to oil that measuring cup first though now over medium heat stir this constantly until all the sugar dissolves and the mixture comes to a boil but once it starts boiling stop stirring it this is when you're going to want to clip on a candy thermometer and you're going to want to cook the mixture to 250 degrees Fahrenheit or firm ball stage now if you don't have a candy thermometer just take a little bit of the mixture and drop it into some really cold water if it forms a firm ball like this it's done that'll take about five minutes now you're going to want to start slowly adding that lukewarm cream bit by bit so the mixture never stops boiling don't worry if it boils like crazy at first just keep adding it until all the cream is gone and then you have to let it cook until it reaches 250 degrees again this could take up to 30 minutes or even longer and even though the candy thermometer is reliable the cold water test is the best way to be sure you're there now you'll want to start adding in half a cup of cubed butter the same way you add it in the cream slowly bit by bit so the mixture never stops oiling like this keep doing that until all the butters used up and then let it cook for another two minutes or so or until it reaches firm ball stage again remember to check with that cold water test if you don't have a candy thermometer then you can take it off the heat remove the candy thermometer and now you'll want to stir in one teaspoon of vanilla extract if you were using unsalted butter now you'll want to add in one teaspoon of salt I was using salted butter so I'm not going to bother now generously oil an 8 or 9 inch square pan and pour your caramel mixture into it scrape out as much of it as you can and now you have to let this sit for a few hours to set up then it's going to look like this now you can cut your caramels and as many squares as you want I cut mine into 64 if you cook the caramel to a proper firm ball stage your candies are going to have just the right texture now you're going to have to individually wrap each candy or they're going to stick together when you store them you can just use wax paper or you can use fancy gold wrappers like this so there you have it I hope you try this recipe soon and don't forget to subscribe to my channel for more awesome recipes and painting fun have a good day guys bye you", "dyOamhREn2k": "haleh bye so today I'm gonna show you how to make my glossy and delicious caramel I did post a picture of this on my Instagram on my facebook a few weeks ago and none of you guys wanted to know why it's so clear so shiny and just different from other caramels and that's because I don't use any heavy cream or butter for my caramel caramel guys is in fact just sugar that's how I make mine with just sugar and a little bit of water you won't need a thermometer to make this is going to be so easy you will however need to follow a few key and important steps easy one but you do need to follow those it's going to be still delicious guys so let's get started [Music] [Music] so the first thing you want to do is get yourself a tall and deep saucepan it's a lot safer to make caramel with one of these that way when your caramel will splash because it will happen it will go on the sides of your pin you want to do this on your back burner and if you're under the age of 18 do not make this unless there's an adult with you caramel can be extremely dangerous you're going to add your sugar and the water and keep your flame on low the proportions I'm using will be listed in the description box however I want to give you guys some interesting facts so caramel is basically nothing more than just caramelized sugar and this starts to happen when the water has completely evaporated so the amount of water you add can actually vary we're just waiting for the water to evaporate obviously the more water you add the longer it will take for your sugar to caramelize now do not stir this or what's going to happen is your sugar will crystallize and you'll have to throw this away as I said your flame should be on low until your sugar has completely dissolved if you want you can gently swirl the pan if any sugar should go on the sides of your pan take a wet brush and just brush them back down into your mixture so once the sugar has dissolved put your flame on medium high if your sugar has still not dissolved completely do not put the flame on high just yet so let it dissolve and then you can put it on high this will start to bubble and after 10 minutes or so your sugar will become a slight yellow color and from there it will become a deep amber color turn off your stove immediately or this will burn within seconds at this point many people like to add cream and butter I add warm water guys that's all I add that's how you're going to get a pure caramel flavor and that's also how you're going to get that glossy translucent and you know beautiful clear caramel be careful when you add your water because everything will bubble over but that's why we use you know deep pan and you're also going to add some salt do not skip the salt salted-caramel guys is the best caramel ever you're going to strain this into a heatproof safe Bowl i didn't strain mine but you do want to strain it now this is quite runny but you're going to put this for at least four hours in the fridge and it will thicken now I do want to take a moment and say this if this is one of your first times making caramel do not be discouraged if your sugar should crystallize or even burn if you're not careful thankfully caramel is very affordable it's just sugar as you just saw so practice makes perfect and I will write more in the description box anyway your caramel will become this beautiful thick shiny liquid gold basically this is heavenly guys it is so good the flavor is that of pure caramel nothing will mask that pure caramel flavor this is great on ice cream drizzled over cakes pies anything you want guys so yeah that's how you make my delicious and beautiful caramel I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please give it a big thumbs up for me and please subscribe I publish a new video every Friday I really hope you guys to learn something new it's always fun to learn something new especially what it's making related please my opinion so yeah if you do make this caramel or any of my desserts please send your pictures in I love seeing them you can send them to me an Instagram Twitter Facebook wherever you ang blogs I love repost in your pictures on my Instagram thank you so much for watching and eunuch [Music]", "YDwiitXMT-U": "[Music] you", "tavYaqfI3qg": "hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm today we're going to make caramels and this is what they look like you can either cut them into squares or you can cut them into the long rectangles and wrap them in now wax paper really nice for a gift and these ones are soft and kind of chewy and so creamy smooth wonderful so when you make candy have everything out all your ingredients everything all ready because you don't want to be stopping along the way the first thing we need to do is prepare our pan you will need an 8-inch square pan and I like to line it with a piece of foil and then lightly butter your foil and have a little bit of overlap with your foil because that way we can easily lift it out and makes it so much easier to cut our caramels so that's that and then for our ingredients you will need one and a half teaspoons of pure vanilla extract one and a half teaspoons of salt I like to use either kosher salt or you could use a sea salt and 1 tablespoon 13 grams of butter now put that aside because once we make our caramel then we will be folding that in so for our greens you'll first have a heavy duty pot a pretty big one a medium medium large because this does tend to foam up and you don't want it which I've had boiling over you don't want that so use a good sized pot in the first ingredient we need is one and a half cups which is 360 milliliters of heavy cream or heavy whipping cream and that's cream with a somewhere between a 35 and a 40 percent butterfat content and then we will also need 1 cup 200 grams of granulated white sugar two thirds of a cup that's 140 grams of firmly packed light brown sugar and then we will also need a third of a cup 80 milliliters of light corn syrup and I find it best to just spray either spray your measuring cup with one those nonstick sprays or lightly butter it before you measure out your corn syrup and then that way really kind of just flows right over your cup you can do that with honey or molasses or anything like that good thing to do so now what we're going to do is just put this over medium heat and you want to stir it constantly because we want to make sure that all that sugar dissolves so keep stirring it and either use a heatproof spatula or a wooden spoon and then we're just going to bring it just up to a boil okay so as you can see we've now come up to a boil so now adjust your heat you don't want like a really hard boil you just want a nice steady boil stop stirring now I don't like to stir my and my caramel as it's cooking because I find if you even if you use a wooden spoon there is that chance that you can start to get some sugar crystallization so what I do is I just find every once in a while I just swirl my pan like so because you don't want it to scorch and that's another reason why you don't want the heat your boiled too hard because you don't want it to burn so now what we're going to do is we're going to bring this up just boil it until it reaches 250 degrees Fahrenheit which is 121 degrees Celsius now that will give us a fairly firm caramel that's kind of soft and chewy it holds its shape not it tends to with time spread out so if you like a really hard caramel you can take that up a few more degrees so what we're going to do you need a candy thermometer for this at least I find that's the easiest way you can either have one like this or now there's the digital ones and another thing what we want to do because we're not going to stir this is we want to brush periodically if there's any sugar crystals that have formed on the sides of your saucepan just have a little bowl of warm water and a pastry brush and then just take and wash down the sides as you need to so that's all I'm going to do everyone so I'll check it if I have to brush down the sides gently swirl your pan a bit and continue to cook it until and if you're using any type of candy thermometer do not have the bottom touch the bottom of your saucepan have it up a little bit and it's nice these handy little Clips makes it easy so this probably will take about 15 minutes somewhere in that 15 20 minutes and just watch it carefully okay so once it reaches 250 immediately take it off the heat I'm going to remove my vomiter there and then what we're going to do is put in our vanilla salt and our butter now will foam up a bit and just give it a really good stir be very careful that's hot and extend make sure that butters all melted in and then we're just going to pour it into our pan okay and put your pan on a wire rack and just a good stir to even it out and then just leave it undisturbed until it's nice and firm it really depends on how warm your room is I find at least about two hours so now our caramel is now nice and firm so a couple things uh I found that when I was cooking the caramel it took about 25 minutes and also once you pour your caramel into your pan you will find your pot is pretty dirty and that caramel really sticks so just fill it with some water and put it on the stove and bring it up just to a boil and then turned off and let it sit and that will soften that caramel is so much easier to clean so now once you your caramel has become firm just peel back the foil and then you cut it you can either use like a piece of cutter or just a knife whichever and like I said you could cut it into squares but either way and this big is small I mean really you can do whatever you want here I tend to like to do it into the long little pieces and I usually do half and then half again I find that's a nice size and then you can kind of it's very pliable at this point so you can kind of it gets a little your edges or not you can just straighten them out and then I've just taken and cut wax paper and then I just put my caramel there in the center and then just I find this way it does keep it when you wrap each caramel in wax paper it keeps it a lot fresher a lot longer and depending on the humidity in your room you know it can cause your caramel become grainy which we don't want so wrapping them individually I find is the best way to keep them fresh so really I mean how cool does that look I mean great gift and it's really it's not that expensive to make or that difficult once you get the hang of it and I find actually especially because I live in a humid climate I like to store my caramels in the refrigerator I find it slows that because otherwise I find after often it my caramel after quite a few days will turn grainy because of the humidity so what I do is I do this wrap them individually then I put it in a ziploc pay ziplock bag and then try to get the air out of it and then store it in the fridge I mean several weeks they'll last that way it really is a great gift or just I mean kids love it I like it oh that's very nice ight nice and soft chewy a little bit of bite rub very creamy probably just wonderful so enjoy and until next time I'm Stephanie Gosk of joy baking calm", "eQJt0otbNhs": "hi my name's Joey papa I'm a coffee consultant and today we're gonna learn how to make an English toffee cappuccino the most important thing to remember when making a cappuccino is the amount of foam that you create when you're steaming your milk the only difference between a cappuccino and a latte is the amount of foam lattes have very smooth but little foam on top of the beverage while cappuccinos have a lot of foam on top so today to get started we're gonna take our Porta filter from our espresso machine we're gonna fill it with some finely ground coffee you can buy a pre ground at your grocery store just make sure you get an espresso roast just to ensure that it's dark enough for an espresso shot so you're gonna fill up your portafilter you're gonna tamp that down basically just press it down and twist you're gonna place that in your espresso machine brew your shot of espresso while you're brewing your shot of espresso you can prep your milk make sure you use cold milk straight out of the refrigerator and the less fat that's in the milk the more it's gonna foam up so if you're gonna use nonfat milk you're gonna get a lot of foam and your to be able to make a really good cappuccino if you use whole milk it'll be a little more difficult to get the foam that you're wanting to make the cappuccino but you choose the milk you want and then you go ahead and steam it while the shot is being poured just keep your eye on that make sure that it it stays a good brown color once it starts turning white you're gonna turn that off and now we're gonna steam our milk basically make sure your steam wand is on you're gonna insert your wand and what you're gonna want to do to make a lot of foam for a cappuccino is you're gonna want to scratch the surface of the milk once you're done steaming your milk you take your shot of espresso out from the espresso machine and as you notice here we have a lot of foam on top let the steamed milk sit for about 30 seconds the longer it sits the foam on top will get more and more firm which will be easier to work with all right so we're gonna take our shot of espresso you're gonna add one tablespoon of toffee English toffee syrup to your espresso then you're gonna take your steamed milk scoop the foam off the top get as much foam in there as possible and once you got all the foam often you could fill the rest of your glass up with the steamed milk underneath and there you have it my name is Joey Papa I'm a coffee consultant and that's how to make an English toffee cappuccino at home", "R9Vkl_AkZ7w": "hey everyone its Camille them can I am Carmela is one of my favorite things to eat and make during fall there's caramel apples and regular caramel but if you've ever made homemade caramel you know that it's a really time-consuming and you have to sit there and stir it and it makes your arm all tired and you also have to watch and make sure that the sugar doesn't burn to the bottom but my mom and I started making this other caramel a couple years ago and giving out to our neighbors and it is so awesome because it only takes about five minutes to make in the microwave so today I'm going to be teaching you how to make this caramel and a couple variations of it I'm going to be making the plain caramel some cinnamon caramel and some black licorice caramel don't worry if you don't like black licorice you'll have to try this out because I usually don't like black licorice but I think that this caramel is really good but before we start the video make sure to LIKE and subscribe and comment down below letting me know if you're gonna try out any of these caramels for yourself and let's get onto the video [Music] the things you will need are a half a cup of butter a half a cup of brown sugar 1/2 a cup of sweetened condensed milk 1/2 a cup of white sugar a half a cup of corn syrup and a teaspoon of vanilla first we're gonna have to melt the half a cup of butter and then pour it into a microwave-safe bowl then add the white sugar the brown sugar the sweetened condensed milk and the corn syrup then you're just going to stir that until it's a mix thoroughly [Music] once it's all mixed you're going to put it in the microwave for two minutes and 15 seconds once that's done you're gonna take it out of the microwave and stir until it's smooth again [Music] then you're gonna put it back in the microwave for another two minutes and 15 seconds while it's cooking it's always good to prepare your pan that you're going to pour it in when it's done so I'm just taking an 8x8 glass pin and greasing it with a stick of butter making sure to get the whole bottom and the sides so that the caramel doesn't stick to it once the caramel has been in the microwave for another two minutes and 15 seconds you're gonna take it back out of the microwave and stir it until it's smooth now you're gonna put it back in the microwave one last time for two minutes once that's done you're gonna take it out of the microwave and stir it a little bit and then add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla and mix that until combined [Music] with your greased baking pan you're going to pour the caramel in and put it in the fridge for at least two hours [Music] so while the regular Carmel is setting up I'm going to teach you how to make some cinnamon caramel this is also super easy all you have to do is adding the exact same ingredients that you added for the regular caramel and microwave it three times twice for two minutes and 15 seconds and then once for two minutes and then at the very end you're going to add it in your vanilla just like you did on the other caramel the two things that we're going to do different for the cinnamon caramel is add cinnamon oil so I'm adding a half a teaspoon of cinnamon oil into my caramel and mixing that up then we're gonna also add some red food coloring to give it a nice cinnamon color once s all mixed up and it's the color that you want it to be you're going to pour it into another greased baking dish and put it in the fridge for at least two hours [Music] for the third caramel I'm going to be teaching you how to make a black licorice caramel and don't worry like I said before if you don't like black licorice you have to try this because I think it's super delicious but what you're gonna do is the exact same thing that you did with the other two caramels adding all the ingredients and then microwaving it three times and this time I'm adding anise oil I'm adding 1/2 a teaspoon of anise oil and mixing that into my caramel I'm also going to be adding in some black food coloring to give it a nice black licorice color [Music] when it's all mixed up pour it into another greased baking dish and put it in the fridge for at least two hours I think this black liquorice caramel is perfect for Halloween because of its black color it's the perfect blend of spooky and delicious here are all three of the caramel flavors after they've been in the fridge for two hours and now I'm setting them out so that they can soften up a little bit so that they're not too hard to cut after they have softened up a little bit I'm taking a metal spatula and cutting them into individual pieces I was able to cut each pan of caramel into about 50 squares I'm also going to be wrapping them in some candy paper I've seen this sold at craft stores and grocery stores the candy papers make it really easy to store or to give as a gift [Music] thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed watching you make all of these car moles if you try this out let me know in the comments below which one was your favorite and also check out my social media which will be linked in the description below and I'll see you in my next video bye [Music]", "ihHytr6MTro": "[Music] hello and welcome back to CND HQ and welcome back to another master class I hope you've been enjoying the master classes so far there is a playlist now full of them including the cookie decorating master class and how to make perfect macarons so make sure you have a look at those and if you haven't subscribed already or if you new to my channel then please do subscribe and make sure you click on the notification bell so you don't miss any of my uploads now I get asked by you guys a lot why I make certain caramels for certain recipes and other caramels for other recipes and it can be a bit of a minefield if you're not quite sure what to do so this masterclass I'm going to show you three different techniques and how you can use those different caramels the first one is going to be for a wet caramel which is perfect for filling things and drizzling and drips and flavoring buttercream the second one is a dry caramel and I'm going to use that to make a kind of chewy caramel which is really good to put in your tray bakes and the last one is gonna be a hard caramel which is perfect for like nut Brittles and seed brittles and just cause sugar shots and you can use those on your cupcakes to decorate them or you can just eat it as it is now before we get started it is mega important to go through some safety stuff guys because sugar gets incredibly hot when you bring it to caramel temperature you definitely don't want to be getting any of this on your skin so when you're making caramel make sure you've got everything that you need ready so that you don't have to like panic about make sure you've got a nice clear worktop so you're not looking for space to put your hot pan down and make sure that when you're stirring or swilling your saucepan it isn't jumping out of it because if you get this on your skin not only will it burn you very deeply it was dry and stick it'll be very difficult to get off it's not a very nice thing to be poked by so make sure you are very very careful now a little bit about preparation so as I said before it's very sensible to get all your ingredients ready to go not only for safety reasons but also because the speed at which you need to do things at the end once your caramels reach the point you need it to be at can be a little bit panicked so if you're measuring things or the answer of quite sure where stuff is then you're gonna be really messing things up so measure all your ingredients out first so that it's ready and you're not freaking out so I'm going to start by making the wet caramel and I have a heavy-based saucepan try and find a heavy-based saucepan to use rather than like a cheap thin one because it will distribute the heat much more evenly and make sure your caramel and your sugar melts more evenly so I've got a nice big pan as well because this is going to bubble up especially the wet caramel once you put the cream in it tends to kind of bubble up and if your thoughts' pans too small that has a tendency to overflow you definitely don't want that so I'm gonna start by putting my vanilla into my cream so that that is ready to go so I have 245 milliliters of double cream or heavy cream and I'm going to add a teaspoon of good quality vanilla extract so put that to one side close by to the action where the actions going to happen and next you want to put your sugar into your saucepan I've got 220 grams of caster sugar and then you want to add 120 milliliters of water and give it a little swirl around just to make sure that it's all evenly sort of dispersed and then you want to put that on to a medium heat to start with so it'll take a little while to get bubbling but once it does you definitely do not want to stir this stirring can cause it to crystallize if that does happen to you what you'll see is the sugar kind of clumping up and solidifying and it will stay white and you'll be like what on earth is going on a little it'll look like a saucepan full of sugar cubes don't panic at this stage just keep it on a medium to low heat and it will eventually melt down and become caramel again so don't worry you also might find that you get a little bit of spotting and crystallization around the edge of the pan and if you do find that you can just use a damp pastry brush just to wipe them away [Music] my sugar waters been bubbling away nicely and it's starting to go a lovely amber color which is perfect we're not using a thermometer for this because we can juice just do this by eye and once it hits that lovely amber color you want to take your pan off the heat and start stirring in your cream and vanilla mixture so to stop your mixture from seizing at start by putting a little bit of the cream mixture in and stirring that in before you add any more it's kind of like your temper in the caramel bit and then when you're satisfied that it's not going to be too hot you can pour the rest of the cream and mix it in really well and once you've stirred it all in you might want to pour it into a nice big heat proof Bowl just to help it cool down a little bit otherwise it's gonna stay for hot for a really long time in the pan now whatever you do don't put your caramel hot into the fridge to cool it down because that's going to bring the temperature of the fridge right up which is going to make other food in your fridge be in the danger zone so I'd recommend leaving this at room temperature to cool down then putting it into the fridge so that you can use it for anything you like here at CND we use it to fill some of our cupcakes and we use it to drizzle on our delicious salted caramel cake next up I'm going to show you how to make dry caramel and this is just caramel that's made without water like we did before and I'm going to use it to make a kind of chewy caramel which is perfect to fill chocolates with or to filtrate bakes with because it's it doesn't ooze like they were wet caramel that we just made so for this you're going to need three hundred grams of caster sugar 100 grams of cold unsalted butter and 200 milliliters of double cream to which you need to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract now for this recipe eventually we're going to need to get it to 118 degrees C so I'm going to be using a sugar thermometer sugar thermometers come in all kinds of different shapes and sizes and this is a really basic one which I find is perfect but there are electronic ones and probe ones that you can get just get something because it's very difficult to estimate 118 degrees so he just by eye and so I'm going to start by putting my sugar into my pan and then start that on a medium heat [Music] now dry caramel doesn't have quite the same tendency to crystallize as wet caramel does so it can take a little bit of stirring and I would recommend using a wooden spoon just to draw the outside edges into the middle so that it caramelizes more evenly [Music] so we're aiming for a nice golden amber color like we did with the wet caramel earlier and we're not using the thermometer particularly right now because we're going to do that by eye but I always put my thermometer in at the very beginning because you definitely don't want to put a cold thermometer into very hot sugar it might damage the thermometer and once they hits a nice of golden amber color take your pan off the heat and start stirring carefully in your cream and vanilla mixture and once you've stirred in all your cream you can then put in your butter and stir that in really well as well and once you've mixed that all in you want to put that back onto a medium heat and this is where you need to use your thermometer because we're going to get this over a medium heat up to 118 degrees C any less than that and it's not going to be chewy enough any more than that and it's going to be too hard and once it's back on the heat you want to keep stirring it gently so that the oils don't separate from the cream right that's 118 degrees so I would recommend putting this into a bowl as well just to help it cool down a bit [Music] whatever you're using this for I would also recommend that you use it while it's still quite warm otherwise it can see that become quite difficult to work with and I actually use this in my caramel corn flake brownie recipe a few weeks back so make sure you check that out and here at Robinson doilies we put it in pretty much all of our trade box because it is so delicious including our very famous delicious Snickers brownie lastly I'm going to show you how to make a hard caramel and this is perfect for Brittles and sugar shards and you can use those things to decorate cupcakes with or you can just eat them as they are and we're gonna make some pecan nut brittle which is absolutely delicious you're going to need 225 grams of caster sugar 60 milliliters of water 15 grams of butter and 60 grams of lightly toasted pecan nuts now just like before I recommend getting things ready so that you don't panic at the end so I'm going to be using a Silpat youth you don't have one of these you can use a lightly greased baking tray and we're going to use that to pour our brittle on at the end and I would also recommend using a rubber spatula which is lightly greased because you're going to use that at the end to spread out your brittle and you don't a stick and you can make brittle with any kind of nuts or seeds and if you're making it with seeds though I would say don't bother toasting them beforehand because they're so small this caramel will kind of toast them so now onto the caramel so put your sugar and your water into a pan give that a little swirl around just to make sure that all the water is distributed evenly and then put that on to a medium heat so to make this brittle we're obviously using a wet caramel to start with so the same rules apply as before you don't want to stir it you just want to give it a swirl every now and then just to make sure that it heats evenly so it's gonna take about five or ten minutes and it's going to bubble away and what we're looking for is a really rich amber color almost dark actually and once it hits that color you can go in with your butter and give it a really good stir with a spoon and then when that's all distributed you can put your nuts in and stir them really well as well and once all your nuts are completely coated in caramel you want to pull that onto your Silpat or your greased baking tray and just make sure you don't pile it all up in the middle try and spread it out as you go so you don't have too much work to do and now goodness sake don't try and eat this yet because it's mega mega hot it's going to take about 10 or 50 minutes to cool down completely until it's slappable so that is brittle done and dusted and I want you to experiment with your nuts because this is really really good with peanuts Astacio nuts really good with seeds try it with pumpkin seeds or sesame seeds it's yummy and this is also just one of 50 recipes in my cake book which if you haven't got yet you should head over to cupcake German comm to get yourself one hmm super boxing gum a lot of people ask me how do you clean your pants after making caramel well it's really really simple you want to get your pan with your caramel and all the utensils and I can't don't you care about it same time you want to get your pan with all your caramel and put all your utensils in it including your thermometer fill it with water and then bring it to the boil and let it bubble away for a few minutes and that will get all the caramel off or if you've got caramel or melted sugar on your workshop that's quite difficult to clean but if you put a damp cloth on top and leave it for half an hour it will come off really easily so there you have it three different types of caramel that you can use for a variety of different recipes I hope you enjoyed that masterclass if you have any questions relating to caramel then please do pop them in the comments box below and I'll do my best to answer them and if you've got any ideas for master classes that you would like to see next then please also put them in the comments box below and I will try and get around to them as well I'll be back this Sunday for another baked Ilan classic recipe and don't forget it's going to be a bundt cake so it's gonna be really really tasty I've put all the ingredients and the shopping list to that in my Instagram feed a couple of days ago so make sure you go and check that out at cupcakes Remer I'll see you there at 11 a.m. bye", "Pwwtx93U5q0": "so it tested a lot of sweets at grommet and it's what's really fun very few of them actually make the cut but sweet jewels caramels did the first day we had a little box of samples I think there were at least 20 of them and it was gone in a matter of hours so caramel has become really popular we know that fleur de sel caramel is President Obama's favorite candy but this duels in Hope take it to another level you have Sicilian orange you have this salted pecan and dark chocolate which they call the queen of turtles Bananas Foster I mean that these are really different on top of the classics so the founders our sisters actually jules premium and hope clocker grew up in a very culinary oriented family we grew up with a fondness for Carlos because our on rosey sent us a lovely box every year at Christmastime this became a tradition we make our caramel z' for our kids and then when our kids moved away they would want to share the memories with their friends and business association so then we started making cards for a lot more people and then before you knew it we decided to start a business we have sourced ingredients from all around the world their salts come from France the beer comes from an award-winning ailed right out of Minneapolis they had to search far and wide to find a chocolate that would mix well with the caramel and they found that one in Switzerland so Jolson hope have thought of everything even the packaging these make very special gifts and when you open them up you can see inside that these are handcrafted so we got in a half pound of tests initially and then after we devoured that we got in a full pound which is a mixed sampler I tell the truth Wendy none of us cut to eat it because when do you medially put a sign up please do not eat I learned from the first box that I couldn't trust anybody here", "jL5TcBeHRSw": "one cup of sugar 1/2 a cup of brown sugar one cup of half-and-half 1/2 a cup of light corn syrup 1/2 a cup or one stick of butter pinch of salt and then you need a candy thermometer and we're going to cook these ingredients to 250 degrees stir your ingredients together over a medium heat when you see the bubbles it starts to slow down this is when it's starting to reach this softball stage and this is about 240 degrees if you don't have a thermometer you can always do the cold water test or you drop a little bit into a bowl cold water and then you test it with your finger test it with your finger to see how it feels there's a teaspoon of vanilla wine an 8 by 8 pan with some parchment paper and spray it with some nonstick spray and pour your caramel onto the parchment paper into the pan ok wait about an hour to for it to cool you could put it in the fridge if you'd like and then cut it into squares thanks for watching", "r-Twcat-SIU": "[Music] today we're excited to use the pizza Cucina and down below you can see the fire and nicely going and it's heating up our work surface on top so what are we going to prepare today some salted caramel and for that we'll need sugar corn syrup butter we will need some vanilla and the salt cream and then of course we will need a pot for the milk and over here a candy thermometer you know we have some parchment paper in this pan and I'm just rubbing it with a little bit of oil and this is where the caramel is going to go [Music] homo ice the sugar a bit we're gonna allow the sugar and corn syrup to start caramelizing a bit and in the meantime we'll put the cream into another pot to heat up and here is the cream into the cream we'll add just a little bit of butter already to the butter and milk and cream we will add vanilla we will also add just a little bit of salt already [Music] we're going to remove it from the heat source and at this point we're gradually going to add the butter into it and keep stirring [Music] oh look at this color add the last few pieces of butter and also another sprinkle of salt just because this is unsalted butter and now we're gonna bring it back and heat it up once again at this point we're gonna put the candy thermometer right in here and it needs to get to about 250 degrees let me just finish melting the butter first I might even have to tilt the pan just a little bit to get a good reading right now we're at 153 look at this beautiful rich color we're 195 degrees keep watching it very closely keep stirring so you can get a more accurate reading because the gauge is a little bit further into that caramel so we're at two twenty three twenty-four right now and this recipe reminds me so much of a treat that my mom used to make for us when we're a little I think it was a lot more simple I'm gonna have to ask her for her recipe it was with milk and sugar and butter [Music] we have reached the right temperature and now we can remove it from the stove we're gonna pour it right in here move the caramel around so it's evenly distributed on the pan and then we'll allow it to rest for two hours oh wow look at this this is gorgeous I almost forgot a very important ingredient look at there the salt is kind of like a flaky salt and we're gonna sprinkle that on the very top and that's why it's gonna be soft at all caramel has rested for about two hours we're gonna transfer over here and with the help of this ruler we're going to cut it into equal pieces [Music] Portia's [Music] same thing on the other side I can with our ruler Google set it right here once again and [Music] and we'll do that until all of it is support here we go we're gonna make these beautiful little squares again right here [Music] just set him right here on this piece of marble some of whom kind of got glued together and there the doll play some ball on here I'm curious as to how they will taste [Music] look at this this gooey caramel mmm oh my gosh so good so we could totally serve them like this or we have some wax paper here we could stack two of them on top of each other and wrap them up into a little package and then just twist the ends like this and we could give them as gifts maybe 15 of these in a package laughs like a candy then just like so once again is nice and soft and going and the sweet caramel combined with the salt is just amazing hmm Bon Appetit Oh [Music]", "4lXu1ySwxRs": "today I present you an adaptation of one of my mum's most amazing recipes now mums version used to take way too long to make you required a candy thermometer and endless boiling it was just way too complicated this is a quick and simplified version and I hope you enjoy it it's time to make some caramel fudge on the one pot chef [Music] caramel fudge this really brings back a lot of childhood memories my mum used to make this maybe once or twice a year and it was always a treat it was the most amazing sweet deadly bad for your teeth thing you won't ever eat in your entire life so very occasional treat I highly recommend you don't make this on a regular basis basically to begin with we've got a cake tin just a normal square cake tin and I've greased it and lined it with some baking paper this will make it about a thousand times easier to get it out of the tin because if you don't put the paper on there you won't be able to lift the budget it will be very difficult to cut up so grease and line your tin let's go to make some fudge in a saucepan over medium heat I have 150 grams of butter and to that I'm going to add 500 grams of brown sugar now I know a lot of you're going to be thinking my god that's excessive and it is but the fact is we're making caramel fudge we're not making sense so get over next we're putting in some vanilla I'm putting in about a teaspoon or so half a cup or 125 milliliters of milk doesn't matter what kind of milk you use I'm using skim milk but you could use full cream milk whatever and a 400 gram can of sweetened condensed milk and stir to combine we're just going to stir it gently over this medium heat until all the butter has melted into the mixture and you just need to gently stir it until the sugar has completely melted now you'll know the sugar has melted because it won't feel gritty as you stir it it's kind of difficult to describe but you'll know once it's done butter and sugar has completely melted now what we're going to do is we're going to set the timer for 15 minutes and you need to continuously stir this for 15 minutes because if you stop stirring you can stick to the bottom and burn now just before we move on I just wanted to mention as I forgot to mention it earlier you really need to use a heavy-based saucepan for this something with a thick base if you use a thin base sauce button this can very quickly burn because the heat isn't evenly distributed so make sure you've got your heavy based saucepan ready and let's keep stirring this is just about ready to come off the stove it's thickened slightly and as you can see the color has lightened quite a bit so this is ready to come off the stove so let's go it's off the stove what we're going to do is continue to beat this with the wooden spoon for a further 10 minutes this will help to bring the temperature down it will put a bit of air into it and the fudge will start to thicken 10 minutes later as you can see this has thickened up quite considerably so let's transfer this into our waiting pan our fudge is ready to go into the fridge now put it into the fridge for at least 6 hours because it will take a while for it to set up for about three hours it will seem like it's set on top but it will still be sitting underneath so make sure it's in there for at least 6 hours then you'll be able to slice it up here is some of our completed caramel fudge and I cannot wait to have a taste oh my god ridiculously sweet a beautiful caramel butter flavor and that hint of vanilla ah this is divine and it tastes virtually identical to my mother's original recipe so I'm happy with that well I hope you've enjoyed this recipe check out my other videos at one-pot chef show calm and until next time see you later [Music]", "voQMPKZ7EdA": "oh hi let's talk car mouse the candy kind the chewy melt-in-your-mouth deeply sweet and insanely addictive kind these make some of the best gifts ever since making caramel requires your undivided attention once you begin you should never walk away prepare all your tools and equipment in advance including a cake pan lined with oiled parchment and tools you will need for the ingredients get the best salted butter you can find like Irish butter cut into cubes and add fleur de sel next scrape vanilla bean then heat up heavy cream with vanilla seeds and the pod cover and let them infuse to make caramel you have two options one with sugar and water and the second one with sugar only which is called Camela sake with this method you can't go wrong cook one third or half of the sugar first when it begins to melt stir with a spatula or whisk every so often until it turns into amber color on medium-high heat repeat this step with remaining sugar and continue cooking until the caramel turns into deep amber color and shows no more lumps reduce the heat the candy thermometer should read now 345 degrees Fahrenheit 175 degrees Celsius and begin to smoke but you don't want to wait too much longer now turn off burner and prove in your heart heavy cream turn heat back on and cook mixture until thermometer reads 250 degrees Fahrenheit 120 Celsius then turn off the heat and add butter and flow the cell it looks and it smells incredible keep in mind that if your sugar is cooked right to begin with you will get many complex compounds that contribute to a richer flavor pour the caramel out into the oiled parchment-lined pan allow it to sit undisturbed for at least 2 hours overnight is best look that is exactly what you are cut caramel block into candies using a very sharp knife this recipe by the way yields 64 bonbon about 10 grams each I met squares but if you want to cut them into rectangles that is totally up to you for the look and to be served on a platter you can sprinkle some Felder cell on top otherwise wrap each caramel in wax paper without salt I hope guys you have enjoyed this salted caramel episode to get the full recipe go to Bruno's kitchen that net please subscribe like me on Facebook and follow me on Twitter Instagram and

and chewy they keep your mouth and your brain completely occupied and endorphins just flow spreading pleasure left and right but that isn't enough nope we want more pleasure so what do we do we add chocolate of course so now you have chocolate caramels so chocolaty and sweet and chewy and your mouth and your brain are screaming with delight but even that is not enough what next you ask what else can we add to this divine concoction the answer is if you can believe it salt yes as a LT salt who in heaven's name thought of that well am I going to surprise it by saying French no I didn't think so yes at some point French chefs started experimenting with salt and it turned out rather well the salted caramels quickly became popular although those were sold only in high-end pastry shops and were rather expensive not surprisingly heavily salted butter caramel are also traditional Street in Brittany but it wasn't until 1990s that this trend became global for example PR MEK the Parisian pastry chef known for his experimentation invented a salted caramel macaron that inspired a small cult among American food professionals in the late 1990s but chocolate was not to be left behind so a new trend salted chocolate was born mr. Hermes wrinkled chocolate with fleur de sel a flaky salt hand harvested from the marshes of Brittany and that was a big hit in 1998 the San Francisco chocolate maker Michael Eric UT was selling his own fleur de sel caramels covered in chocolate things started to happen by year 2000 phase two at top New York restaurants like Gramercy Tavern and Lacerte had fallen completely in love with the way an extra hit of salt can enhance something sweet they topped chocolate caramel tarts and molten chocolate cakes with crunchy bits of expensive salt and folded it into ice cream after that salted caramel made its way into high-end food magazines and specialty food shows a little bit later it showed up on the menus of chain restaurants like Cheesecake Factory after that in the mainstream women's magazine and finally it was completely integrated in the American mass market now if something is so popular it has to be fabulous right right so the only thing left to do is learn how to make those yummy delights and that's where I come in however before we immerse ourselves in pure pleasure I have a warning that you must take very seriously melted sugar is extremely dangerous so first you

wash down the sugar crystals from the sides of the pan I'm gonna remove the lid add glucose and continue cooking until the syrup caramelizes my sugar syrup has nice amber color and I've removed the pan from the stop I'm gonna carefully add cream that I've heated in the microwave now I'm gonna add butter and stir until incorporated I've put my mixture back on the stove and now I'm gonna insert a probe of my digital candy thermometer inside and continue cooking my caramel reached 121 degrees centigrade which is 250 degrees Fahrenheit I've removed the pan from the stove and now I will add chopped dark chocolate and stir until the mixture becomes uniform I'm gonna pour the hot mixture into a prepared baking pan immediately and shake the malt to distribute the caramel evenly I will leave it to cool at room temperature for a couple of hours or overnight I've placed the cool caramel slab onto a cutting board and now I'm gonna sprinkle some smoked salt flakes on the top then I will cut

sweetness is happiness see in my next video bye [Music] you", "VEmIN6f8Mi0": "[Music] and here we have it awesome promise I'm going to teach you how to make my soft caramel for Christmas that's right soft caramels for Christmas but anyway it's a really easy recipe but there's one trick of the trade with caramels or anything when you're making candy and you're doing hard and soft ball stage of candies is that you need to boil water and you need to find out at what temperature that your water boils at your altitude and then you need to take that boiling water point and you need to add or subtract your altitude of where that water boiled from the normal boiling point of water alright and I'll put that number right here so you can you okay so what we're gonna start with here is once you've figured out your altitude and how to add and subtract for your candy thermometer to reach softball stage all right that's gonna be somewhere between the 220 mark and all the way up to the 240 mark okay it's gonna be in there somewhere for me it runs right around the 235 mark and make sure that your candy thermometer make sure that you've got some distance here between your finger and the hot plate here on the bottom that can give you a different reading closer to here we want to make sure that you're in the actual you know product that's bubbling up and up this part right here and you want to make sure that it covers this little mercury area but you do not want it touching the hot plate so don't ever you know switch your thermometer actually on the hot plate service and this right here is where you adjust it you clip it on and then you just bring this glass part up and down right here okay now I've got room you know I've got a pre clip on and I've got it here so that I can see it at my angle all right now let's start with the ingredients we need a one and a half cups of butter so that's two and a half sticks of unsalted that's unsalted butter now here some people use regular sugar I actually use a pot of brown sugar and it is one box or two in a you know it's a one-pound box or two and a quarter cups two and a quarter cups of packed brown sugar quarter teaspoon of salt and here we have one and a half cups that's one and a half cups of light Kairo syrup that's corn syrup and then here we have one 14 ounce can of the sweetened condensed milk it's not carnation evaporated milk but it is carnation sweetened condensed milk it's the sweet milk okay alright get that opened up here and ready I'm also going to need my vanilla extract and that's my homemade vanilla axe direct I'll only be needing a teaspoon of it but if you're using the store-bought invitation or store-bought extract then you'll want to use one and a half teaspoons okay that's one and a half teaspoons of vanilla extract but this is my homemade stuff okay it's it's potent it's been sitting there for two years it's pretty potent all right so let's go ahead and let's put this together and here we have a pan on a towel here so we don't crack our dish because this is going to come out of here very hot and here I've lined my mind by 13 inch pan this is actually a little smaller than a 9 by 13 inch pan but I did line it I like mine a little thicker when I cut them and in here I've lined it with some freezer paper and I've sprayed it with a little bit of butter Crisco spray you can use butter or what-have-you on this that's fine most people say you know get it pretty greasy so this pills off every time I make caramels I end up pilling paper off of them so it's just a matter of working this quickly all right and and I throw a mine in the refrigerator for about 15 to 25 minutes makes it much easier to cut all right so I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to cut my little square it's a wax paper you want to cut them about 4 inch squares that will get each one of them wrapped up so you can twist them like a tootsie roll and then and we'll be right back what we're gonna do here is we're just gonna put in I like to cut mine up in two tablespoons here no reason to bring this to room temperature you don't have to you can even leave a little bit of this out just like this let it soften up or get it on your hands and you can just like this right here and get this all over your your parchment paper so I'm gonna save just a little bit us out for just a minute get it on my parchment paper it's a matter of fact I might just do it or that right there okay so I used a little bit of that to better the pan as well I don't want brown leather in here yet so we're gonna go in carefully i don't watch myself doing this so i'm gonna drop it in from up here drop it just right down just like that right there there we go keep that low from the heat for a minute if you have to we go we'll be great all right we're gonna go ahead and add our 1 pound of brown sugar that's 1 pound of brown sugar which is about 2 and a quarter cups of packed sugar and it's going to raise our thermometer so just a second before I get this stirred and blended some great colouring to it doesn't it look at that I wish you had smell-o-vision right now I own you got the Cairo syrup on here yet Oh so we're gonna add a quarter of a teaspoon of salt that's a quarter of a teaspoon of salt when that in now that's nice and melted and the sugars have had a chance to melt inside that butter got some great colouring to it already with that brown sugar and now we're gonna go ahead and add one and a half cups of Cairo that's one and a half cups of corn syrup it's just Cairo brand corn syrup and you want to get it all out of here okay get it all out once you learn how to make car moles or any type of candy like this and you can put sea salt crushed sea salt on this you can dip these in chocolate and then add a little crushed sea salt on top of the chocolate you can add peanuts to this and then chocolate and then you got something similar to that like a payday well if not the chocolate I guess you can just put the peanuts in it you can have something like a payday you know you can use this to make Turtles for Christmas candy there's a lot of things that you can do with this and I have enough corn syrup left to make me a pecan pie ooh don't you just love to come pies oh we got a letter from cliff and Mary thank you that's River rambling no and they let us know that they got their prize in the mail already I was just so tickled about that several people have written me and so they've gotten their prizes some of you haven't heard from yet and I'm hoping that you did get your things I'm so hoping that you did go ahead and put my candy thermometer on here is on the side just like that right there way down just like that I'll go ahead I'm going to add my sweetened condensed milk there we go sure we're getting it all out of there it's just there we go and this is what makes them nice and creamy I'm just coming up on that be sure and use a at all cited pan for this and a heavy iron cloud bottom type pan this way now what you want to do is you want to keep an eye on this candy thermometer it's very important that you do and you want to add the vanilla last after it reaches its 2:35 a soft soft stage you're going to take a little bit of ice water instead of the side in the freezer a minute to check our softball stage there trust me when it starts to climb it will coin it'll kind of hang around the 230 for a minute I don't know why it does that but it does it depends on the colouring you want to this has got some great colouring to it now the harder the higher temperature you get on this the harder the caramels will be I like my caramel sauce pet some children away at this stage this is very hot puffin very hot popping yeah I'm not progressing a whole lot we're still at about 225 sorry I don't mean to make the sounds that I'm making on the pan itself but you really can't help it using that plastic spoon doesn't help me keep an eye okay I'm just now reaching 225 I can fill the stretch in the sugar right now I'm really feeling it now I'm going to show you how to test this I give it a little stir here oops you reach down in here I'm just gonna grab just a little bit here I'm gonna put it in some cold water and we're going to test it let it sit there for just a minute let me gather it up okay it's not really I mean it's almost there it is really really close but it's breaking apart a little bit too much so we're gonna try that again you're not progressing but you can see that you are it's really starting to get foamy here it's really popping so you don't put your face up over the top of this you can really get burned now try your hand at making some candies and some caramels you can do this you really can sit again no children no pets in the kitchen this is just too dangerous and it's just too hot these are be in a controlled environment when you're doing it splashing this on the tip of that make sure I get a good accurate reading there we go and see what it says now ooh we are almost there they're burning again on the bottom I like that know why this pan is burning it that's that piece it's still in there from earlier get it out of there get out of it got it okay let's check it don't look there go ahead and give it a stir and then let's go ahead and take another little bit here let's plop it in here let it sit for just a second we're about one degree away from the soft ball stage let's get it in here and let's see how it's doing look at that we are so close we are so close look at that one degree the two degrees right now away from softball stage getting a lot harder look at that seeing more stringy and it's not pouring through the opening of my slot anymore I'll show this to you here's this piece here okay that right there is nice and soft that's perfect we're just gonna take them pour it in look through here now I'm gonna knock all the air bubbles out what you can do now at this point is give it a few tasks and go in the refrigerator now if you've got a glass shelf in your refrigerator or and there are things that shouldn't really warm up be sure and put a cloth on the glass before you set this in the refrigerator okay and we'll be right back mix them in real quick before the court sets see I gotta figure it out and then when I put chocolate on these Oh My heavens sink down in there nicely a couple taps level that out we'll be right back and I like to give it a try look at that stuff I stretched to it now remember this is still warm [Music] creamy buttery Oh Lord absolutely simple there we go all right I've just cut a whole bunch of these three inch by three inch to three inch by four inch squares I note that it they're a little bit longer this way when you tie them up that seems to work a little better for me so three by three and a half to three by four inch squares of waxed paper okay wax paper something your kids can do they'll have fun with it all right so the issue with this is I left it in the refrigerator too long when you do that you can get the paper stuck on it and it's just not wanting to peel off all and my suggestion on this would be to write now I just I don't know I'm happening to actually literally cut this bottom edge off with the paper off and then slicing it up I mean there are a nice soft caramel they're a beautiful nice soft caramel and I will open one in a minute and then what I'm doing now is I'm just placing a caramel right here and slide the waxed piece of rock paper roll not like this and then we're just gonna give it a twist opposite directions just like that they look great they're nice and soft we got to watching a movie and I had a migraine so I fell asleep Elise oppa I mean I've been going like this all day and so they stayed in the refrigerator too long but they are a nice soft they're a nice soft caramel and they have a great flavor to it it's got some great colouring to it it's it's a nice soft car now you'll want to store these caramels in a tin or like a plastic container like a like a glob Ziploc type container that's fine and you can take and dip these in chocolate you could sprinkle a little bit of sea salt on that chocolate semi-sweet chocolate and milk chocolate great with this okay great with this and my husband loves it with the pecans in it so that worked out great so we're just going to continue to wrap it roll twist in the same direction as your fold yeah right there just twist in the same direction as your fold and sit it down on your plate hope you can hear that it's really get an ice storm going right now and again see if my fold is there so I'm twisting with the fold that direction and then I'm just cutting off a little bit of that extra and they taste

caramels. They're seriously the most delicious thing ever. Don't forget to subscribe so you don't miss any of our other holiday goodies and let's get started. If you've attempted to make caramel I'm sure you've heard some of these before. You have to use a candy thermometer, or I never use a candy thermometer, or never make it when it's raining, or never make it when it's going to rain, or this recipe is foolproof, or this recipe is foolproof. There's a ton of information out there and it can be a little kind of scary. Personally, I use a candy thermometer. I also go by color and touch and I do the plop and I feel it and I'm going to show you all of that, but a candy thermometer is a great way to start and it's a good guide. The thing is the candy thermometer says soft ball that you're trying to achieve for caramel is at 240 degrees, but guess what? That's not 240 degrees everywhere. That's 240 degrees at sea level. Now I have brought this up before and I will bring it up again. You need to adjust your candy thermometer temperatures based on your elevation. So, I live really high up and I have to adjust by 21 degrees. So, instead of of trying to go to 235, 240 range I'm actually going to the 215 to 220 range. That's a crazy difference. If I went all the way to 240, I would have rock hard candy. Nobody wants rock-hard caramels, unless you're going for toffee and that's a totally different recipe. It's super simple to figure out what you need to adjust your candy thermometer by. All you have to do is boil some water stick the thermometer in there and then take note when the water comes to a rolling boil. Now water boils at sea level at 212 degrees, so if yours boils below that or above that, now you know your adjustment temperature whether you need to minus or add temperature to whatever candy recipe you're making. First thing we're going to do is add some butter and now some brown sugar, a lot of brown sugar and some salt and turn it on. We're going to melt that until all of the granulated sugar and salt is dissolved. Once the butter is all melted, we're going to add our corn syrup, and then finally some sweetened condensed milk, woo. Ooey gooey goodness. Look at that beautiful boil and bubbling away. As you can see on the thermometer we are getting close to the 220s, so I'm going to get out a little cup full of ice water to do our first test. So, to do the test, what you want to do is take some of your caramel and pour it in some ice water. Now if it immediately dissolves, you know it's not ready yet. If it stays kind of thick, you can go in there and grab it and see if you can squish it. This is still super runny, so it's not quite ready yet. All right it is nice and solid and we're ready to pour it. So, first thing take it off the heat and now we want to add our vanilla and I bought a bunch of these water bottle ice trays and I actually use them for caramel. So, give it a quick nonstick spray. I just pour the caramel right into the mold and then I use my dough scraper to spread it out and then obviously scrape off any extra so that I'm left with these nice long tubes. Now we're going to let them set. You spray your mold really good and then you stick them in the freezer for about 10 minutes. They'll actually pop out really nicely. I cut them into thirds and then I take some wax paper that I cut into little squares like three inches or four inches and I roll them up twist the ends. Then you have a great neighbor gift. The recipe makes a ton. It's perfect to give out as gift this time of year. This is one of those things I have that kids all help me roll them up and then they each take a small handful to their teachers or to our neighbors. It's delicious. It's fun, and I don't know why I don't make it more often. Anyway, my favorite part, open it up and look at this gooeyness. Now, some people prefer their caramels a little bit harder and that's totally okay. The tips about the temperature and testing it are the same either way. Some caramels just tend to set a little bit harder. In the comments down below, let me know what your favorite holiday goodie is.

for this recipe I am so sorry but this is non-negotiable let me walk you through it step by step the first thing we need is a heavy-duty pan turn it on what about medium-high we're going to add 3/4 a cup of granulated sugar need 2 tablespoons of light corn syrup Lake refers to the color not the calories the reason we are using corn syrup is because it prevents crystallization in a caramel you really want every drop so use your finger then we need 2 tablespoons of water ok I don't like to stir my caramel whatsoever I think it increases the chances for crystallization on the edges of the pan so just give it a little shake and let it do its thing resist the urge to stir it the sugar is starting to dissolve I'm going to clip on my candy thermometer use one of these easy ones that just slides on the edge can while this comes up to 290 degrees Farenheit we're going to warm our heavy cream and butter and salt in the microwave you need 1/2 a cup of cream and 2 tablespoons of butter but you want to cut the 2 tablespoons into about 8 different pieces really about 150 right now so while that comes up to temperature you want to heat up your cream and your butter ok my cream and butter are completely melted I'm going to add about 1/4 teaspoon of salt okay we are at 290 and the caramel is just starting to turn golden brown I'm going to turn the heat down and then I'm going to slowly stream in our warm heavy cream and butter and salt this is gonna drop the temperature really drastically but we want to bring it back up to 240 degrees Fahrenheit careful it's gonna bubble up at this point it's safe to give it a little bit of a stir watching the thermometer drop all the way down we're going to bring it back up to 240 starsky's made in a bread loaf pan one of my tricks for lining a pan with parchment paper is to flip it over over it and then pull the corners almost like you're wrapping a present and then it just slides in a lot easier I'm gonna turn the heat off and then we're gonna add in 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla extract give it a quick little stir to incorporate remove your candy thermometer very carefully and pour it into your prepared and resist the urge to lick the spoon or scrape the bottom of the bowl let it set for about an hour until it firms up if it's a really humid day you might need to stick this in the fridge for about 20 minutes to make it firm up just cutting some little squares of parchment paper to trap our caramel since you know they're set when you can press on them and they're nice and firm cut them perfect I like a little salt with my caramel [Music] [Music] so chewy so soft and I love the crunch of the fleur de sel on top you guys are gonna love these make them for your friends make them for your family members for a little gift for the holidays [Music]", "XSL9xZbTvd8": "today I'm going to be making something we're really really yummy I'm going to be making caramel filled chocolates and what I have here I have some chocolate I have a little silicone mold and I also have a piping bag this is a wilton disposable bag and that has my homemade caramel in there so really really simple ingredients here so let's get on with the recipe all right the first thing I'm going to do I'm going to microwave my chocolate and I'm going to microwave it of course on defrost yes I heard you say that defrost never never microwave your chocolate on the regular high mode ok so always defrost so I'm going to go do that now I'll zap that and I'll be back alright I have microwaved my nice chocolate and it is ready to go I use the defrost mode and now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to get the chocolate into our actual molds because I want to start building up a little shelf so that's our first step so I've got a little bit of parchment paper underneath because chocolate comes off very very easily off of the parchment paper so I'm just going to get some of this in here there we go okay I'm probably going to zap a little bit more chocolate we don't need all of this in here because we're actually going to just build up the sides and then we're going to let all of this stuff drip out so let me just move this around there we go and so what I'm doing here is I'm just taking my spoon and pulling it up just like that against the sides so you want to go around to each one and just go around and lift the chocolate up okay just so that it touches all the sides that's good just like that okay all right and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to lift it up and I'm going to let the chocolate come back out this is why I have the parchment paper here because I can just put this parchment paper into the fridge and all of this chocolate will just harden right up within a couple of minutes and boom bada bing it just comes right off so I'm just going to take my spatula and just clear off the mold there's no you know easy way to do this just like that so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to continue letting this drip okay just want to give it a little shake shake rattle and roll to get most of it out just like that I'm going to clean it off so there we go just like that so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to pop this into the fridge for about ten minutes just for it to chill down a little bit I'm going to chill this up I'm going to clean this up again and then we're going to start all over again alright the chocolate is nicely chilled right now and what I did notice is that my first coating did quite a nice coating in here and it's pretty thick anyway so I'm not going to do a second coating so we're going to go right into the next step we're going to start filling these with our caramel alright so I have my homemade caramel in here this is a wilton disposable bag and I'm just going to cut off the tip I'm going to make a very small little you know slice on the end just so that we don't have too much coming out at a time and then we're going to fill all of our little cavities alright we just cut off the end this just makes it really really easy to get it in there because without doing this and do it trying to do this with you know a spoon it's not going to come out very well so just get it in just like that you just give a little squeeze you know try to put you know enough in there that somebody's going to actually know that there's caramel in there let's just get a little squeeze just like that and then we're going to be covering this with chocolate so you can see if you take your time you don't make a mess I did make a mess on that first one there but just like that that's good and this is homemade caramel really really good I'll put a link to this caramel recipe at the end of this video so it will be clickable I always put a link for mobile users so if you're on a smartphone and you can't click the actual link on the video there's always a link that's in the description so just like Donnelly a little more there doesn't that look great a little squeeze okay and there we go look at that beautiful all right I've heated up my chocolate again and now we're just going to get that right on the top here okay and this time I really don't want to make too much of a mess so I'm just going to get a little bit on here just enough so that it kind of settles in on top of the caramel and closes the cavity that's what we're looking for so just eyeball it just like that so I'll just whip through the rest of these I'll come back in a second there we go okay okay and then I'm just going to take my hand and just kind of knock it down like that and you can see right away it makes a nice seal if you tap it enough you know there you're eventually gonna there we go if you want to make sure that you have a really really professional look then what you're going to do is you're just going to after doing all of that you can just take your spatula and just go right over just like this okay and you can see how nice that is now there we go just like that so if you want you can also just take it and just drizzle it right over the whole thing and then just scrape it right off it doesn't really matter if you're not worried about doing that you can just do each one individually just give it a few taps and then pop it in the fridge so there we go so we're going to go let these chill and then we'll come back later all right my little mold has really really chilled down and let's see if we can get all of these out without breaking them so I'm just going to give them a little pull just help them out we'll see let me give a little push from the bottom and there we go there's number one there's number two three there's number four there we go we're lucky so far you want to go really really gently with these there we go another one look at that few of them have cracked on the bottom they could have been a little bit thicker there we go and there we go perfect so they're all out all right and here are our lovely little caramel chocolates YUM I did get a couple it cracked I'll be honest the chocolate on the bottom of this could have been a little bit thicker but no caramel was leaking out which is good and there we go so what I'll do is I'm going to clean up and then I'll just show you those on a nice little plate all cleaned up alright I just zoomed in on one of them I just want to show you what they actually look like inside so let's just give a little cut and see what it looks like and there you go you can see all the nice caramel in there a nice thin shell and there we go nice thin chocolate shell and we've got our beautiful homemade caramel in the middle look at that YUM so that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you next time you", "xpR-xQzFGnE": "hey hey hey welcome back to my channel today i'm bringing to you the soft chewy caramel candies this is one of my all-time favorites it's so easy to make and the kids are going to love this without wasting time let's just get to it so first of all you are going to be needing some milk i've got here my pink milk this is evaporated milk there's no fresh milk now i'll get a frying pan and come in with some butter i'm using about 30 grams of butter and we are doing this on low fire [Music] after the butter has melted i'll come in with about 200 grams of sugar i'll keep on mixing those on low fire for about 2 minutes afterwards i'll pour in my milk here i'll be using about 200 ml [Music] so we're going to keep on mixing this on low fire we will do this till it thickens up you have to have your eye on those always or earl's is going to burn [Music] as you can see is thickening up very well [Music] [Music] [Music] so it's very thick now and i love the consistency so i'm just going to put off the fire and let it cool down just a little bit i'll get an aluminium container and pour my caramel mixture into it i'll let this cool down some more and as it cools down it's going to harden up a little bit so here it's been about three to four hours as you can see it's all hardened up now i'm going to get it out of the aluminium foil with the help of a knife i'll cut it into smaller pieces and guys i must say you can't get your hands off this they are chewy and so so delicious i hope you are really going to give this a try if you do let me know how it comes out for you if you want you can send me some pictures so i hope you've subscribed if you've not please don't forget to hit the subscribe button don't forget to share this with family and friends and don't forget to leave me that big fat thumbs up until next time i am going to see you with another nice and interesting one bye bye", "0g0ADhTBSz8": "hi I'm Margie again from Marjorie's candies and today we're going to make the caramels and I just want to point out that this vanilla was 2 teaspoons of vanilla is at the end not in with the rest of the stuff ok so what we're going to do okay nobody an average burner is which so I'm going to take 1 cup of cream this I'm sorry this is half and half and this is a half a cup of butter I was trying to put my cream and butters in first before the sugars come on oh look that was packed really nicely that's 3/4 cup chopped up each of the front dark sugar and then the brown sugar and the white sugar and when you combine your sugar into the creams try not to get the sugar up on the side of the container and then this is corn syrup that this is a 3/4 cup measure it's a little weird you it's odd it looks too big it's a 3/4 cup you don't really see that okay so now you gently stir it until it comes to a boil this is a one quart pot for this recipe and it boiled all the way up to the top and then it started to go back down again so this pot is not too big for this recipe I was a little concerned but I'm showing you that this is fine usually I make a very big pot big soup pot of caramel so that's why I wasn't even sure myself but this is great one quart pot now what I've done is I put my thermometer my candy thermometer in and you always want to make sure the bulb is underneath the candy and it should go up to 240 and then you're going you're going to start stirring about 2:30 and watching it real carefully because the caramel may have a tendency to stick a little bit but it's going to go to 240 first and then it will go up to 248 and it'll be done and then you wait a couple of minutes with and I'll show you that this has gotten up to 230 and it's coming up to 240 you can see it'll start to get dark on the bottom while it's cooking see one spirit you don't want to ever scrape the sides after you give it a school captain okay just I don't go down and scrape the side I just clean off the very top okay well the caramel has reached its 248 and so I'm going to let it sit for a moment then I'm going to add two teaspoons of vanilla I'm gonna wait for moments like maybe a minute I'm doing this just so it doesn't get too much hotter I'm going to try to pull it down a little bit sometimes I even pour it into another pot because you really don't want it to get any hotter than 248 and this is a very thick base so it could do that on the bottom you can't add it now this is Michael is still videotaping them be very careful you might want to wear a mix for sometimes if your pot is larger if you're cooking more if it's powder so that's it and I have over here and half I thought maybe I'd get some caramel okay so have an apple I have to stick I don't say wash the Apple I took out the little the little stem I'm just going to push that into the Apple and I have some pecan us and roasted pecans here then after I dip the Apple I'm just gonna set it down in there okay because then if there's any kind of caramel that um you know falls down it'll pick up the it'll pick up the nuts okay so I'm just going to still pretty hot so it's going to be thinner than if I waited a moment but I'm just going to give it a turn is pretty hot I couldn't waited a little bit longer because some of that will drip that's why I turned it off right-side up and put this I only have one Apple in the house I'm only gonna do one so we'll set that here and so if any of the caramel does drip down it'll pick up all the little pick up the nuts and in a moment what I'll do is I'll save that Apple will put some chocolate on it later okay but for right now I'm going to pour the caramel into a serenity plastic lined container and I have this spatula that can handle heat no I'm going to scrape the bottom of this pot but I'm not going to scrape the sides okay if you want to scrape the sides scrape it onto something else onto a little plate and you can eat it later but if you really mix it in with your caramel here it might crystallize okay sometimes I'll do that like right now I go like this and I'll put some a little plate here I can do that later if I want but if I combine that with my caramel now in the big pot it might be personalized okay so now you don't like that thing again so I'll show you do the same thing I always do you to bring this term and wrap up to say how fat you want your caramels to be it's pretty good much bigger than you kind of touch it to the camera itself I mean to the saran wrap and that's it now if you leave that overnight by tomorrow morning they'll be all cool and they will look like magic of YouTube it will look like that okay okay so you just yeah and then you just cut them any size you want okay there you go there's caramels and if you like you can get a toothpick and you can dip them this is just this is I called this very simple simple dipping huh it's not the kind of you know whatever but you can do is to sort of touch the bottom a little bit then it won't make a little skirt on the bottom I can show you how to dip another way - okay you can dip in a way where you just okay and then you give it a few little taps okay and then you flip it over and you kind of give it a little design on the top mm-hmm but it's also very easy to do it like this and people can just pick them up with the toothpick okay so let's see if this Apple is a little bit cooler now we can maybe decorate it a little bit yeah actually it is so we can actually just some you can either dip the whole thing in there or you can kind of just go like that and make it look kind of pretty I had some white shock that that would be pretty too put a little in there and then you put it back down right here and pick up a few more okay so you could do a dark chocolate and white chocolate just do that okay so thank you very much for joining us and I'll see you again very soon", "GbCf4gARRbI": "How to Make Creamy Caramels Hey good afternoon, have I got a treat for you today. I decided to do another candy recipe since my first one was so popular and it is going to be Valentine's Day soon. And I'll tell you what, I tested this recipe on the same group\npeople that had tested the gummy candy and the gummies made it until the end of the day this stuff was gone in five or ten minutes it was just gone. So today I will show\nyou how to make creamy caramels for the hardware you are going to need a few things. You will need, at minimum a 3 quart sauce pan preferably three and a half or four if you've got it and the reason for this is that working with hot sugar, if you respect it's\nfine but you always have to take care of this stuff. You can't walk away from it and it can burn quite badly so it's really\nimportant that you not have any small kids or pets running around and you're gonna commit to watching this for the whole time okay because I'll show at one point, it is possible for it to boil over and you don't want to have that happen. You will also need a candy thermometer.  you might notice I have a new one here the one I always used broke during the testing of this recipe oh well but I guess everything changes and this is actually a much better one than I had so I do you know the price range on these runs from usually six or seven dollars for a cheap one which is what I had, to twenty to twenty-five dollars for a really good one which is what I have now. so maybe I'll be making even more candy who knows? anyways you're going\nto need a wooden spoon, you're going to need an 8x8 inch tin foil cake pan and the reason I do insist that you use this instead of a heavier one is that you want this to cool off fairly quick. you will need two strips of parchment paper that are cut about the same width as the pan. Now, I'll show you how\nto set this up and you want to do this as the first step because once you're focussed on the hot sugar, if you're a little stressed out or whatever you don't want to have it already\nto pour, then \"ah geez! I didn't get the pan ready!\" so we'll do that first so lay one strip across about even visually. Press it down into the bottom of the pan give it a rough fold and another rough fold on the side. do the same thing on the other side then what you do is lay the other one on top in the same way and that's just ready to go for the hot sugar when we get there always clip your thermometer to the pot before you start. this one is safe to put down to the\nbottom still I'm gonna leave it up because this\nis going to boil up really high it could go as high as that okay which\nis one of the reasons why I said you really gotta keep an eye on this stuff get your thermometer ready before you put in the ingredients which\nare 2 cups (500ml) 35% whipping cream 1 cup (250ml) white sugar 1 cup (250ml) packed golden brown sugar 2 teaspoons (10ml) sea salt so combine both sugars and the salt, there's the second teaspoon break it down break down the brown sugar a bit, mix it up a little bit add the heavy cream I make sure I give this a good stir before I turn the heat on. because that way if there's any chunks if you have to it's good to get a nice one with a clip on it that if you do have to rotate it to get at chunks of sugar in the bottom you can do that so once you have that all mixed up put it on around medium heat and start stirring you are going to be with this for the whole time until it comes to a boil, and even at that point I would not walk too far away from this I've got the thermometer up high enough that you can see that I can slide the spoon under it. that clip I wish was a little nicer but should it should last....we'll find out here's a little tip I'll share with you when I'm making candy, I don't get so close that I'll burn myself what I do is make sure that I get close enough to the candy\nthat I can listen to it what I mean by that is while you're stirring this if you're doing a good job, after a bit all you're going to hear is the sound of \nthe wooden spoon on the bottom of the pan so if you've got a quiet background\nyou're listening carefully and you missed anything you can actually\nhear to crystals, the sugar crystals on the bottom of the pan and it is important you get\nall that picked up and dissolved before it comes to a boil because you are going to be way too busy after that I'll give you a bit of a closeup here, it's just about ready to come to a boil you can tell because it's starting to form bubbles on the sides of the pan that stay there even when I'm stirring so at this point, become very attentive, do not walk away from this for any reason as soon as it hits full boil I'll take the spoon out because you're not going to stir this at all when it's reaching its cooking\ntemperature. I got this stirred up to the last second take the spoon out now Take a quick read. It's at 210F. The final temperature is 245 Fahrenheit or 118 degrees centigrade Cook to 245F or 118C At this point, once it hits full boil, turn it right down to low immediately because it will continue to rise in the pan this looks fairly under control but one pointer though if you think for any reason that this\nmay boil over if your pan is too small or if the heat is too high just move it off the heat until the level of the candy drops in the\npan because you do not want this boiling over and hitting the burner. now that it looks like it's not going to boil over I am going to nudge up the heat slightly\nso it will cook a little quicker and you can see how fast it goes up when\nyou turn up the heat just a touch see how fast that response. now the good\npart about this is that the danger point is only at the\nbeginning because once it hits the level it's\ngonna stay out as the moisture in the cream evaporates the mass of the candy will\nonly fall so as long as you got it under\ncontrol when you're starting,  you are fine I am going to turn this down again right to low and take it off the heat.  as you can\nsee it's getting a little too close for comfort that's okay that's safe to put back now it's around from 210 215 fahrenheit ALWAYS lean over and read the temperature at eye-level, NOT standing up or it won't be accurate and this can seem pretty boring right\nnow by as the moisture evaporates there's you'll reach point where the the\ntemperature will shoot up pretty quick so it is important you still keep an eye\non this stuff alright so the temperature has finally reached 220, it's quite slow at the beginning and\nyou do have to watch it because I was fiddling with the temperature,  kept\ngoing up and down but now that it's reached this temperature it's pretty stable as you can see in the\nappearance of the candy is changing as the temperature rises it's at 230 Fahrenheit now and you can see that the appearance of the surface has changed and actually it's really funny and that's\nwhy I knew that my candy thermometer was broken because it told me it had reached 250 and I looked\nat the top of the candy and I was like no that's not 250 okay and it turns out I ended up making\ncaramel sauce but hey I'll save that for another recipe\nokay. it's at 240 Fahrenheit and again the appearance\nthe candy has changed, it will go very fast right now so you have to keep an eagle eye on this stuff it has just hit 245 and when I said it goes fast, this\nis less than a minute and a half for it to go the last five degrees. So what I do now is turn off the heat immediately, remove the thermometer I just poured the caramel in the pan, sorry I thought the Record button was on but it's as simple as this, pour it straight into the middle of the prepared pan\nwith the paper now you'll notice the bottom is starting to set up already you'll also notice there's a couple of drops of fat from the cream that is on the top of the caramel. It's\ntempting to stir this or mix it in. Do NOT do this the caramel will not set correctly and yes, this will resorb into the mass over the next couple\nhours The caramels have been setting up for over an hour.... about an hour and a half now. As you'll notice there is still a little bit of grease on top so what I do \nsirs so but agrees on top so what are to get rid of this before I cut them is get a brown paper lunch bag lay that on top and let it sit there for a minute this is as if you had fish and chips the brown paper picks up the grease\nreally nicely and does not stick to the candy after you've dabbed those off, pick up the whole pan get a cutting board turn it over and peel the paper off there you go it's a lot easier to do this when they're not completely hard and you get to have a little taste that came out just nice, thank you if you don't wrap them as I discovered the first time,  I cut these all up really nicely put them in a plastic bag and when I got to my destination they had all formed into one big mass which did not stop\nanybody from eating them by the way but it's a lot nicer if you just do them like this so cut off a strip,  they're still really\nreally soft and you don't have to worry about the cutting board jiggling on this tear off a strip of parchment paper cut off pieces of paper and by the way you want to get these out of\nthe house as soon as you can once you start eating them you may not stop you'll notice a couple have already disappeared, my bad just fold the paper over you don't have to get real fancy. What you're doing is just making sure they don't stick together and I'll just use the empty pan to hold the finished ones in it's not actually necessary to oil the knife if you just kinda rock it while you cut\nthrough it they will separate quite nicely. so I nearly\ngot these finished cutting up I'll get these wrapped up and get these out of the house well, probably tomorrow a couple more might vanish overnight I'm\nnot sure,  anyways so there's my creamy caramels thank you so\nmuch for watching my recipe and I do hope you try them and like\nthem as much as I do", "WPqeEMcZUDs": "thanks for watching the Tennessee white-trash kitchen on today's episode we're going to show you how to make killer Karma's and with this recipe you can swap regular butter for cannabutter and have you some trippy Karma's here are all the ingredients that you're going to need to make the killer Carlos first off you're going to need 8 ounces of butter which is a cup 1 14 ounce can of sweetened condensed milk 1 cup of light corn syrup 2 and 1/2 cups of brown sugar a tablespoon of rum extract and a tablespoon of vanilla extract here are all the utensils that you're going to need to make the Carlos going to need a pot a whisk a spatula a tablespoon a two cup measuring cup 13 by 9 dish the candy thermometer is the most important utensil out of all of these making candy requires precise temperatures for example the caramel that we're going to make today it's temperature is 250 degrees you go below that then you're going to have runny karmis and they're not going to meet that good and if you kill above then they're going to be really hard really chewy almost like a sugar net and if any of you have experienced the sugar daddy they're pretty brutal and I've even pulled some teeth out as a kid chewing on the sugar daddy so again like I said most important utensil here is the candy thermometer if you don't have one go get one they're not expensive might be four bucks at a retail store yourself anyway again the candy thermometer is a Mustang okay one thing I like doing here is getting everything pre measured out that way I'll have it sitting right there and it'll make it a whole so here I've got two cups of brown sugar packed and I'm gonna still need another half cup so anyway that's what I was going to show in this little portion is that you need to pack your brown sugar it's two and a half cups of packed brown sugar and I'm just packing them down getting the last half a cup or you pack it down it might be in between three quarters to the whole cup down go ahead kind of break this up see so now got a brown sugar set now next since we know we have to measure out a cup I'm gonna go ahead and do the cup of white for example we are there knows the next thing you know buck said sweetened condensed milk and it's branded I normally buy I noticed in the grocery store that they had chocolate like wow you know that might be interesting it might taste different might taste better find out and see so jump in here that's why I always measure out the 14 ounce in so it makes it easier yeah special rap out between the same special yeah all the lives okay so here we go you're gonna go ahead and cut the butter in there I'm gonna turn the burner on here up to medium-high heat and of course let the butter melt so the butters melted I'll be back here okay once your butter is melted which pretty close to kind of keeps tearing it here makes what you want to do and we get this out of the way here dump your sugar in get your sugar in there you just kind of stir it up a little bit so I got a few pieces back there but I'm not gonna worry too much about it now and what you want to do here it's kind of stir it get it all incorporated into the butter but what you'll do is you will let it what the sugar melts get it to a melting stage that's that's when you go to the next step it'll start bubbling here a little bit getting boiled up and then dump our there's nothing get the sugar dissolved and still it'll take a couple minutes here there you'll see bubbles start coming up it's see now the sugar is pretty much resolved the key thing about caramel is you don't don't want to let it set very long you want to continuously scare it so this is ready for the mixture here very curious to see how this chocolate city condensed milk turns out hope is it in a waste well at this point that off to the side now is when you want to get your thumb on your candy thermometer put in take it stick it all the way down and then to the bottom and then what you want to do is bring it up about halfway so like I said this is where it's constantly stir Oh sometimes I think I should have a bigger pot for this but I'm gonna worry about it too much right now then making it with this pot yeah it's been quite a few times I've made it it's constantly stirring it sometimes I'll move my thermometer around just to try to you know make sure I get everything down in there but it's a constant start basically so this would probably be anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes is what this is gonna take so I'm gonna go ahead and turn this off and then pick back up when it gets closer to the temperature Stern stones turn all around the pot as I was reminding of the hard spots in the car where it is really good burn that's the biggest thing it's burnt caramel yeah one thing about like said you know getting everything set in place here I think the French call it nice in place lies in place something not enough this is the white trash kitchen by the way case you forgot no all those fancy French terms but anyway I think you know it means something about putting everything having it right there in place but when you're cooking and it does it makes it a lot easier you're not trying to fumble with things you really don't want to do that when cooking candies anytime whether it be caramel or hard candy or anything like that because it goes up to precise temperatures what you got to have it out and if you don't you can screw it up I'm screwed up caramel screwed up hard candies different things like that I've screwed up quite a bit this is one thing nothing pretty used to making it's an excellent can of caramels with cannabutter but I don't eat that somebody else I never does also you need to watch the stuff when it splatters out it'll burn you that's not good these caramels some people they say 248 degrees Fahrenheit is what you want to take it to to me they're just too soft 248 always run it up to 250 I've always where I've had my best luck with them they're not too soft not too hard hold their shape when you cut them not just kind of bobbing up after the fact almost there almost I'm saying it mistakes I think it's almost there sometimes you can kind of smell it too and you're cooking it you can kind of smell when it's the change I guess start to get in there I don't know it just to me it has a different smell to it once it gets up to that 250 degree mark and we are there turn that off and take a run extract I said a tablespoon of that just dump it right in there it'll kind of flare up here this is a homemade vanilla that my mom gave me no longer with us but has basically that out whoops yeah I'll see how it'll kind of kind of foam up like I said you just want to kind of stir it around here get make sure you get all that flavor and mixed in all over okay I kind of work a little quick on this over there get our Specter go ahead and dump it here and I've already sprayed 13 by 9 pin don't scrape your left at the bottom you see there it's kind of kind of got some dark spots that is gonna be hard and be real hard you see we're over here don't want to scrape any of that that's you see how it's darker there that will be harder it would be hard spots but reason why that happens is because I didn't move my thermometer away or around so it I don't know it helps if I had a different band or a pocket rather but you know she I'm not a professional so anyway while that is like that before it gets a thick skin on it here's what I like to do it's off we're gonna and I like sprinkle in solid all over not love salted caramel my wife don't care for it too much but she's not here right now so I'm gonna be taking this to then get together later on there you go salted caramel here are a few sample pieces of the pea caramel as you can see they're firm holding together go ahead and flip this up bring it closer to the camera here you can see I mean it's holds its shape pretty nice good solid caramel there now take a bite here and as you can see good and cheery not too soft not too hard just right well I hope you enjoy this recipe if you have any questions is post it down below and I'll try to respond as quick as possible again thanks for watching and hope y'all enjoyed it", "JovvxKt07mI": "welcome to eat at Joe's today we're making a caramel sauce a traditional caramel sauce has only two ingredients sugar and cream with a high fat content you hear cream called different things heavy cream double cream the important thing is you want to cream with a butter fat content of 35 percent or more the most important element in understanding how to make caramel is understanding how sugar caramelizes so let's quickly learn about caramelizing sugar there is no lessen as cheap and as important as this take a quarter cup of sugar and two tablespoons of water the water should completely cover the sugar when you see a thin even layer of wet sugar you're ready to fire it up set your flame to the highest possible heat and then just watch it start to boil you can swirl it at this stage to combine the water and the sugar together but now that it's combined you do not want to stir it again as the sugar mixture boils the water evaporates away as the water evaporates away the mixture becomes hotter the bubbles begin to get slower as the temperature begins to reach 350 degrees the color will start to change you will begin to see smoke rising from the sugar as it begins to burn at this point the sugar has gone too far and is no longer fit for consumption I'm gonna go clean this pot out but I'll be right back the only thing that makes cooking a caramel sauce more difficult than what we just did is adding the cream at the proper time the same ratio applies we want half as much water as we have sugar we're gonna take a half a cup of sugar with a quarter cup of water once it looks right we turn on the heat in the beginning it looks pretty much like boiling water a lot of people say to avoid getting any liquid on the sides of the pan as it will crystallize but that's really not a problem when it comes to making caramel sauce as you can see no matter what you do the boiling sugar water is gonna get up onto the sides of your pot our bubbles are just starting to slow down and we're starting to see just a little bit of color you want to start paying close attention at this point because just like we saw last time depending on what kind of pot you have you're going to see either your center or your edges Brown faster than the other this is actually a key to making caramel sauce the way that I do because it allows you to have a very sweet along with that heavier more bitter caramelized element we can see the bubbles are starting to slow down at this point you want to pay careful attention to what's going on inside that pot just like we saw the first time carmelization tends to be uneven in most pans so you're gonna get dark caramelization on one part and light carmelization on another part this is excellent and key to making a good sweet and complex caramel sauce we can see the outside edge becoming an amber color while the center maintains white the center is white because it's still a lower temperature than the outside Brown edge as soon as you can smell smoke throw in your cream and that was a half a cup of cream you want the same amount of cream as you have sugar give it a stir and incorporate it but be ready it'll probably flare up keep stirring to incorporate as the heat boils off the water from the cream you'll notice that the mixture takes on a different consistency once those bubbles have completely boiled back down just like this your caramel sauce is ready to go and pour that caramel sauce into your jar be careful and don't forget to scrape all the excess this jar is going to get extremely hot extremely fast so use a rubber glove and put a lid on it this is important because it's still evaporating we want to contain all of that moisture inside our jar most caramel sauce at the grocery store contains corn syrup and food coloring a lot of traditional caramel recipes tell you to include butter one of the problems with using butter is that it's already separated too much from any other content the benefit of using cream is that your butter fat is emulsified inside a mixture of protein and water that makes up that cream butter is 80 percent butterfat and it's already pretty much separated away from all the other contents that means that when your caramel cools you're left with a layer of butter fat right on top that's not what you want by using heavy cream and then sealing the jar right at the end you trap any remaining moisture inside that caramel as the sugar cools it goes from a liquid state to a solid as it does that it traps all of those particles of fat and moisture and protein from the cream and that's what creates our caramel sauce let the jar rest on your counter until it's cool to the touch then put it into the fridge once it's completely cooled you're ready to use it this caramel sauce is stable at room temperature and good right out of the fridge so you don't have to warm it up and worry about melting your ice cream you thanks for watching this episode to be to Jose it's always great to have you in my kitchen I hope I see you again soon I can't believe I spilled the the cream I never do that

how to make some chocolate caramels first you'll need some aluminium rulers which you can get at a hardware store such as Home Depot form a square with 13 inch sides use a Silpat or baking sheet as your base next you can use any type of weights to hold down the rulers you can use cups or books or whatever you find on hand heat heavy cream until it boils and then cover it to keep it warm at glucose syrup to a saucepan you can use corn syrup as a substitute add granulated sugar I added it dry but it's probably better to soak the sugar in a little bit of water before you add it to the glucose heat the sugar over medium heat until it turns into an amber color you can shake the pan to aid the caramelization once the sugar caramelizes act butter stir it in a little to help slow down the cooking process immediately add the heavy cream that we heated earlier and stir it slowly so it doesn't boil over after it's well mixed add some chopped chocolate turn down the heat a little while you mix it mix it thoroughly and let it boil to 110 degrees Celsius use a candy thermometer to check the temperature once it reaches temperature pour your mixture into your aluminum frame let it sit for a few hours until it cools to room temperature use a heavy knife to separate the frame cut it to whatever size you want you can use wax paper or cellophane as your candy wrapper you can twist the corners like this but I found it easier to just press down on the corners which you'll see in a second roll the candy over itself into a cylinder shape keep them in the refrigerator when you're done but let them file for a few minutes before you eat them thanks again for watching hope you enjoyed the video you", "CiyOMjrGv3M": "hello everyone and welcome to time for cooking this is our first video and you thought we'd do something sweet so here we have caramel candies these are so simple to make with only three routines and they're very chewy and delicious let's go before you start cooking you're going to need to prepare your pan get a loaf pan and some wax paper and cover the pan with the paper I find that if you take the edges of the wax paper it will help it stay in place next spray some canola or olive oil on the wax paper make sure to spread a lot so it won't stick to the caramel now let's get our ingredients you're going to need one cup of sugar half a cup of heavy cream and five to five and a half tablespoons of butter you can add more or less depending on how sweet or buttery you want your caramel to be finally it's time for some cooking we're going to start off by putting the sugar in a pot keep your temperature on low to medium heat and watch the sugar carefully also make sure you have a big pot because when you add the butter and cream later you don't want it boiling over the edge when you see a clear color around the edges fold the melted sugar on top so all of the sugar gets heated evenly and it doesn't burn continue to do this until all your sugar is melted if there are any lumps in the sugar after you stir press on the sugar clumps with a spoon to break them up then keep stirring until the sugar is a dark amber color then take your butter and add that into the pot keep stirring until the caramel looks well mixed after the butter is well mixed it's time to turn off the heat add the cream gradually while stirring and be careful because the caramel will be boiling high return the heat to low again and continue stirring after about 20 to 25 minutes your caramel should have a similar consistency to this pour the mixture into the greased pan you prepared very earlier and turn off the heat of course cover with saran wrap and place in the freezer for about 20 to 30 minutes or until it's hard once the caramel has cooled take it out of the pin and be sure to get a follow the wax paper place it on a cutting board and get either a peach cutter or knife to cut the pieces we like cutting our caramel in 1-inch squares but this is up to you once finished you can place them in a container or even fill mason jar with them this can serve as a cute way to store your candy or even give them to a friend for their birthday Valentine's Day or any nice occasion we hope you enjoyed this tutorial be sure to like comment and subscribe to our Channel we'll see you next video when it's time for cooking", "xNJ_SSyZIrg": "hi everybody this is mrs. brand but and today I'm going to show you how I make my channel camera today we have used super Silver Haze pho it is fully decarboxylated and for the amount were using just about one gram maybe just a little bit over so what I start off with is melting my butter and cream in the microwave for about one to two minutes I do like to add a little bit of vanilla for flavor and then also I'm gonna add my corn syrup water and sugar in a pen when I'm pouring in my sugar I'm really careful because I don't want to get it around the edges because that's when it burns and then it crystallizes you don't want that now the water will help with that Lee a little bit later once I've poured in the sugar I make sure all the sugar gets wet you don't have to play around with it too much now while I wait for that I just wanted to tell you we used a deep quartz nail to mount the shatter and this I will pour into the butter mixture and once it comes out of the microwave that way it will dilute the really nice so here we go it's nicely stirred up nice consistent consistency mm-hmm in the meantime my sugar is boiling I put the lid on it and because of the water that's what helps the sugar come off the edges if I did get anything on there now that I'm going to bring to a boil to both 320 degrees Fahrenheit once it reaches that I add half my butter mixture now I'm going to pour it in slowly just so it doesn't splatter too much and it doesn't over boil if you're using a smaller pen make sure I stir it really nice and then I'm going to add the rest of it and of course just making sure it gets nice nicely mixed together get everything out of there give it one little final stir and index this mixture I like to like to go up to 240 degrees Fahrenheit now if you would like firmer caramels you can go a little bit higher to 45 but not too much because you don't want it to be too firm each boiling takes about five to ten minutes so be please be patient so here it reached to 40 so I take it off the stove and I pour it into my loaf pan that's lined with parchment paper it's a really nice smooth consistency no crystals and you let that sit for about 20 to 30 minutes wait for it to firm up and I hope you enjoy thank you for your time", "tN3si6gd_QE": "hey guys it's TJ from Susy sweet shop today I'm gonna be making one of my ultimate vices when it comes to candy and it's chewy caramels and the way we're going to be doing it is a little non-traditional we're actually going to make them in the microwave that's right you can make caramels in the microwave and they will rival any gourmet caramels that you might ever try so what you're going to need to make this recipe is just five simple ingredients we have some melted butter condensed milk corn syrup brown sugar and vanilla the vanilla is optional you can put any flavor in that you'd like to make them whatever flavor family you'd like I'm just gonna do some vanilla ones today so first as I said I already have the butter melted if you're taking it straight from your fridge you're just gonna pop it in the microwave probably for the 45 to 60 seconds just so that was completely melted when you're starting okay and to that we're going to add all of our other ingredients except the flavoring so in goes my condensed milk one tip I'll give you guys whenever you're using something sticky like condensed milk corn syrup molasses anything like that use some vegetable spray and spray the measuring cup that you're using before you put your sticky stuff in and it comes out way easier than if you don't and then you waste a lot less of it as well lastly is our brown sugar so we're just going to mix all these ingredients together so make sure you're using a microwave safe Bowl because it's gonna be going in the microwave you're not gonna believe how simple this process is and how delicious the end result is you wouldn't believe that it was made in microwave okay so he's gonna make sure that you don't have any lumps and your brown sugar all right looks pretty good so now we're gonna pop it in the microwave on HIGH for about six minutes so I'm just gonna do that and I'll meet you back here in a sec okay guys it's been six minutes now in the microwave on HIGH now we're gonna give it a quick test give it a little stir around each end to lift it and we're going to do what we call an ice bath so all they did was take some really cold water in a little dish and set it in the freezer while we were making everything and we're going to test for the softball stage so what got me is rigged a dress a little bit in our container here what we're looking for is this should come into a little ball and be able to roll it kind of like play-doh is what you're looking for to know if it's done so it's still a little too soft where I want it to be I want it to be more of it kind of holds its shape when I roll it so that means we have to microwave it a little longer so I gotta put it back in the microwave for another 1 minute on high and I'll meet you right back here okay so I just put it in the microwave for another minute we're gonna do the exact same thing we did last time and test it in the water bath I also should have mentioned that while you were prepping your ingredients and doing your microwave time you should prep your water baths before that so that they're nice and chilled by the time you're ready to test your ingredients you're gonna do the same thing again just take some drip it into your water bath I usually like to get a couple ready so that it's not just the same cloudy one over another and so it's getting closer to where I want it to be but it's still not quite and what do you need to realize when you're working with the microwave every microwave is different to the amount of time and how powerful it is is gonna be different on every appliance that you use so that's why I'm recommending these times because they're more on the minimum side so that you don't burn your caramel or you know overdo it right from the get-go because you can always add more but you certainly can't take it away once you come too far ok so again we're almost there so I'm gonna put it in for one more minute and then hopefully we should be done all right so it's been another minute in the microwave and once again we're just gonna do the exact same step that we did I should also warn you too that the longer you're microwaving it obviously the hotter it's going to be and this stuff will really burn so I advise being super super careful when you're moving it and maybe even put some oven mitts on if you're tend to be a little clumsy or just for some extra precaution so you'll see it's actually come together in a nice little ball it's firmer than the other than it was before okay so at this point now that we have it to the stage that we want it to be is wherever we'll add our flavoring I'm using vanilla today you could do Mims you could put some almond whatever it is that you any kind of mints that you like any kind of caramels you like the flavor of feel free to do that could add some sea salt in here as well or you could wait till you're done and sprinkle some sea salt on top Jeffrey preference and picnics in and now we're going to put it into our pan as I've already told you I love silicon it's great for sticky projects like this if you don't have a silicone pan then I would suggest that you spray your pan very well and then line it with some parchment paper and actually spray the parchment as well to keep it from sticking all right so I'm just going to spread it in a bit just to get it to fill okay and if you were wanting to make these sea salt caramels this is the point where you're gonna sprinkle on your sea salt while it's still wet but I'm going to leave these ones playing and now it's time to let them firm up so this is going to take probably at least thirty minutes are probably more at least like closer to an hour put it in your fridge and let it get nice and firm before you try to take it all right so my caramels are all chilled they were in the fridge probably for close to an hour and now it's time to eat them them I'm just gonna do that onto a piece of parchment paper so that it doesn't stick to my surface again why I love silicone so much comes right out with no problem at all so it's up to you which type of the pan you want to use you could use a smaller one so that you have thicker crown mount this is just the silicone that I have it's a nine by nine so it doesn't make them very thick but but you can cut the Cardinals whatever size you'd like just take your knife and start cutting them into pieces so you can do whatever shapes that you want to I'm just gonna do one strip here just so you can see it just around I always like to try to make them even so I cut each of these in just you can do them into little rectangles and wrap them up individually in parchment paper or wax paper if you want to store them that way if you're not going to wrap them individually you can just lay them flat inside of a Tupperware type container but if you are going to stack them make sure you put some parchment or wax paper in between because they will of course stick to each other so as you can see here this is a nice chewy kind of my absolute favorite so you could also if you didn't want to add flavors earlier you could also take these and dip them into some melted chocolate to make them chocolate-covered caramels or you could just take some melted chocolate and kind of drizzle it over the top just to give it a little taste of caramel I started a little taste the chocolate it's really up to you it's kind of a blank canvas at this point but this is your base recipe and it is super good just don't my favorite so that's it for today guys hope you like this recipe if you did give it a thumbs up if you haven't already subscribed to my channel hit that button down below but you'll never miss a new video and I'll be back again soon with a new recipe until then have a sweet day divide again [Music] you [Music]", "wytMNPehVDI": "Hey and a huge welcome to Steve's kitchen. The other day I went looking for caramel toffees in the shops The lovely soft flavorsome caramels and\nthere were none there they were either coated in chocolate or they had a real\nartificial flavor and they are so simple to make at home\nI'm going to show you now how to make them and a couple of tips as well to get the\nbest that you can out of your caramels  Now when you're making caramels or toffees of any sort get a nice thick bottomed saucepan because it\ndistributes the heat nicely if you don't there's a good chance your\ngoing to burn your caramel so the ingredients for caramel are very\nsimple. I've got a cup and a half of a nice thick cream at least 35 percent fat in\nthis cream now you may have had a caramel in the\npast and thought that is absolutely delicious and it's usually because they\nuse different combinations of sugars and creams really good quality cream can\nchange the taste of your caramels immensely  and using a balance of different types\nof richness of sugar can also make a great difference so\nexperiment next we're going to add a cup or 200\ngrams of granulated sugar and then I've got 2/3 of a cup 130 grams of a compacted soft brown sugar, I'm also adding one third of a cup of Glucose that's a corn glucose into there as well and then using a\nspoon I'm just going to stir that through now we take this over to our stove top\nstart to bring this up to the boil so I have my pan now on the stove top and\nI'm mixing all those sugars and creams together I want to bring this up to a nice\nsimmering Boil now one thing as you start to bring this\nup to a boil I just want to take a brush and a little\nwarm water and I'm going to brush any sugar crystals that have formed on\nthe side to the pan and let them drop back down into the\nsyrup if I don't those little sugar crystals will burn and for the moment while we bringing\nthat up to a simmer we can still keep stirring but we might need to keep\nwashing down those sugar crystals from the side of the pan so once our sugars and cream come up to a simmer I'm going to take the spoon out I don't want a spoon in there anymore so I brought my sugar and cream up to a nice rolling simmer now and we're not going to stir it we're just going to let that come\nup to about 120 degree Celsius that's 250\nfahrenheit and that is a firm Ball that's what we\nwant for this lovely caramel toffee now whilst our caramel is\ncoming up to temperature I've just got a 9-inch baking tin here I'm just going to take a little\nbit of butter and grease the inside of this tin so\nyou've got your butter inside the tin like that I've also got a square of wax paper or baking paper and I'm just going to push that in there now because we need somewhere to pour the caramel into you could use foil but I think wax paper works a lot better\nand then that will be ready to pour our caramel into\nonce it's come to temperature okay my caramel has come up to temperature now, just going to pop it onto a wooden board here I've taken it off the heat obviously, I'm going\nto take the thermometer out there now and just put that somewhere safe, you can smell that beautiful caramel see it bubbling there what I want to do is just pop a\ntablespoon of butter and I'm using a salted butter so I don't\nneed to add a little salt if you don't use salted butter add about\nhalf a teaspoon of salt in there we're just going to mix that through this is\njust going to add a nice glaze to our caramel and will you look at that now I'm going to pour that into are prepared\ntin level that over the pan and we need to leave that now for a good\nhour or so to let that cool down completely now as for cleaning our pan I've got a\nkettle of boiling hot water just going to pour that in there now pop it\non the stove bring it up to a warm and that will clean off the thermometer\nand any spoons that we've used now the whole house smells of caramel\nand they came out great have a look at this look we can lift this out of the tray\never so easily like that because of the wax paper it\npeels off so simply  I don't know if you can see that side on now if you wanted your caramels to be thicker than this use a slight smaller pan I really like it this thick. Now I've got a knife here and I'm just going to trim a piece off you'll\nsee how easy this caramel cuts through just going to trim a little bit off the\nedge here and that is my strip look at that how soft that bends that is a beautiful soft caramel. Now I've cut\na little bit off the end here just to show you guys what it tastes like now here goes. Now I\ndon't put any vanilla or anything in here because I think caramel should\nstand alone it should taste beautiful let's give this a try that is true caramel don't put any flavors in\nit try as it is this is so good I'm going to make\nsomething with this in the next couple of days so stay tuned look out please share the love on this\none. I'll put some pictures up of this finished caramel here for you to look at\nnow be good I'll see you in the next video\ntake care It's a little while since I've made caramel\nthat is tasting absolutely delicious, I could eat\nthat all as it is. Now I'm going to leave some links here to some other videos and I'd love to\nhear your comment please this caramel for yourself make it at\nhome enjoy it be good see you next time", "IcFVxh2_HaU": "I like chocolate as much as the next person but when it comes to my sweet tooth I'm a sucker for caramel now I used to be satisfied with any caramel that came my way but I have to admit I've become a little bit of a caramel snob and cellophane wrapped candies that have the texture of sugar flavored plastic just don't do it for me anymore I'd rather invest a little time and a few kitchen staples to make salted caramels my own the thing to remember about working with caramel is that you can never turn your back on it you can stand and watch sugar steer a bubble for what seems like hours without even the slightest color change but if you walk away to answer the phone your caramel will burn before you have the cell to your ear it knows trust me on this start by cutting one vanilla bean in half lengthwise and use the tip of a paring knife to scrape out the seeds you'll need to infuse one cup of heavy cream and five tablespoons of unsalted butter with the vanilla bean seeds and a teaspoon of salt this mixture adds richness and flavor to the caramel but it also helps keep the caramel soft and chewy bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat and then turn off the burner and let the flavors meld for at least 10 minutes if you feel like taking care of some chores or washing your hair before you start your caramel that's no problem just let the cream mixture steep a while longer the longer it sits the more vanilla flavor it'll develop since caramel is sticky by Nature it's a good idea to use a pan lined with parchment I'm using an 8 inch square baking pan I also spray the parchment with vegetable oil spray for added insurance so it doesn't get sticky I suggest that you prepare the pan ahead of time because you're sure won't have time to prepare it when you're holding a pan full of foaming hot caramel I also recommend you use a large high-sided saucepan to make the caramel you might think a smaller vessel would work but the caramel is going to foam up when you add the cream mixture and you really don't want a sweet version of Mount Vesuvius erupting all over your stovetop combine 1/4 cup of light corn syrup 1/4 cup of water and 1 and 1/3 cups of sugar in the saucepan since one of the dangers in making caramel is crystallization I like to pour the sugar into the middle of the pan to prevent any granules from getting stuck on the pan sides now heat the mixture up over medium-high heat until the sugar dissolves but don't stir it do this until the syrup has a faint golden color and registers 300 degrees this will take about seven to nine minutes then lower the heat to medium-low and gently swirl the pan periodically as you continue to cook the mixture for another two to three minutes the lower heat here will give you more control and help guard against burning wait for the color to change to Amber and then when the mixture reaches 350 degrees it's done you can also watch the bubbles early on they're very separate and boil vigorously but over time they'll become smaller and more delicate almost foamy carefully remove your saucepan full of very hot caramel from the heat carefully stir in the cream mixture watch it foam and then breathe a sigh of relief that you listened to me and went with the high-sided saucepan now return the pan to the heat and cook the caramel until it reaches 248 degrees now that the cream has been added it's not only safe but it's also imperative to stir the caramel so that it doesn't burn this step should only take about five minutes so you really won't be stirring for very long remember the temperature of that caramel when you're tempted to stick your finger in to taste this gorgeous looking mixture you just made also keep it in mind when you're pouring the caramel into the prepared pan because take it from me caramel burns are no fun once it's in the pan smooth the surface of the caramel and let it cool for ten minutes then add the best part flaky fleur de sel half a teaspoon sprinkled on the surface really gives great flavor and crunch to the caramels and if you're slightly more daring and of course you are then I suggest you try substituting smoked sea salt now comes the hard part waiting for the caramels to cool and set to make sure the caramels cut into nice clean squares let the pan cool to room temperature for an hour and and pop it in the fridge for another hour when it's finally cool lift the sling to remove the caramel square from the pan and then peel the parchment away use a sharp knife to cut the caramel into three quarter inch squares pretty much the perfect size since the caramels tend to stick together it's really best to wrap them individually in pieces of waxed paper but keep in mind that the caramels will get pretty soft if you leave them at room temperature so it's really best to store them in the refrigerator and that's it homemade salted caramels you can find this recipe and over 100 other recipes in the America's Test Kitchen DIY cookbook

baking pan lined and we're throwing in our yellow cake make sure tap it a little bit hey my bites tap it a little bit to get those air bubbles out next we work on the chocolate cake same stuff just

let that cake absorb that delicious sauce then the middle of the cake is gonna be some whipped cream and then top it with the other layer same thing poke a bunch of holes in it drizzle that sauce or

already washed and scrubbed these apples and I'm going to use skewers here as my sticks you can use chopsticks if you want you can use popsicle sticks really whatever kind of stick will go into the center of an apple and just try and get it down through the center of said apples like that and then I have some boiling water here that I have used to test my candy thermometer because I'm going to be making the caramel from scratch and to help the caramel sit or set or stick stick on the apples you want to dip your apples in this boiling water for maybe 5 10 seconds or so and this removes all the wax that is on the apples just go ahead and dip them in there for 5 seconds or so and then dry them off and that gets all the wax off like that now that the apples are dipped and are off to the side I've got some wax paper here on my cutting board if you have parchment paper you can use that whatever you use you want to liberally butter with a lot of butter if you think you have enough butter on there put some more and this will prevent the caramel from sticking to this and you just want to make sure that this is liberally coated with butter all right now let's get working on the caramel for the caramel I'm going to add my brown sugar into a heavy-bottomed saucepan you want the heaviest pan you can possibly find that you have available to you I'm going to add in my corn syrup and I'm just doing a half a recipe here for demonstration purposes I will put the full recipe down below process is the same corn syrup in there and my butter and finally my sweetened condensed milk and I'm just going to bring this up to a boil over medium-high heat and once your butter is melted all the way go ahead and put in a candy thermometer and make sure that the bottom of the candy thermometer does not touch the pan that will give you a false reading and I'm going to turn the heat down to just above medium here and be sure to keep stirring this you do not want this to burn and every once in a while scrape down the side that's why I'm starting this with a silicon spatula scraping down the sides will prevent your caramel from becoming grainy so I'm going to bring this up to a boil and I'll be back this is nearly at a boil and I'm continuing to stir this and scraping down the sides moving the thermometer out of the way so I can get back behind there and underneath it and you want to bring this up to the recipe says 248 degrees I find that to be a little hard for caramel apples so I'm going to bring it up to 245 degrees and just keep stirring this even walking away for five seconds is enough for it to burn so you definitely do not want to burn it so I'm going to keep on cooking this until we are at 245 degrees looks like right now we're just approaching 210 so we got a little bit ways to go all right this right here is right about 245 degrees so that's what it looks like when it's done again just keep stirring because you do not want this to burn I'm going to take this off heat and over here I'm going to let this sit for just a few minutes before I add my vanilla now I'm going to add my vanilla like that throw this in and now it is time to dip our apples now you want to get your apples dipped before this has a chance to cool too much so I'm just going to roll the Apple in like that let most of that caramel come off like that and I'm going to roll these in crushed peanuts chopped peanuts if you don't want to do peanuts you don't have to I just kind of like the way they look so and taste so I'm going to dip them like that and set this off on your buttered wax paper now let me get the rest of them finished and for the rest of the caramel that you don't use for dipping your apples sorry about pumpkin bumping you there I just sprayed some nonstick spray there on this granite slab and I'm just going to pour this caramel right out like that and just let this cool slice it up wrap it in wax paper if you so choose and there's some thermal candy for you so that's how you make caramel from scratch and candy apples caramel apples sorry hope you enjoy thanks for watching you", "ghWeCAw2YT8": "today I'm going to be making a really simple and easy caramel sauce and here are the ingredients that we need 1 cup of regular white sugar 1/2 a cup of heavy whipping cream and that's 35% cream I'm using 1/3 of a cup of butter and I'm using salted butter in this recipe and a little bit of water and I'm going to be using 4 tablespoons of water so those are the ingredients so let's get started so let me go through what I've set up I have my little hot plate here which is just that element just like you would see on your stove I've got my pot and what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my 4 tablespoons of water and just get that right in there and I'm going to take all of the sugar and just get that right in there just like that ok and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to gently heat this and I want to get this up to a very slow simmer and I want to actually caramelize the sugar that's in there now why did I put the water in well the water is just going to help get everything together and dissolve properly you could do this without adding water but it takes a lot longer and you could actually burn things so by adding that water in it just it acts as a little buffer between the the actual direct heat and it just incorporates everything really well so I'm going to just get this this my little hot plate here gets very hot very quickly so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to leave it there both there and I'm just going to let this go and I'm just going to let that slowly slowly very gently come up to come up to temperature so what I'm going to do is I'll pause the film for now I'll wait a couple of minutes and once it starts doing what it needs to do then I'll come back alright so I've come back and right now we can see that the sugar is really getting dissolved and I've got myself a nice wooden spoon here now you can use a whisk but I don't want you to actually whisk what you want to do is just let this go on its own so don't actually get in there with a whisk and really mix this you don't want to mix this you know you can take your whisk and just slowly move it around if you really feel the need to or what you can do is take your pawn your take your your pot rather and just go like this just move it around a little bit just like that okay we'll just let that go and what I want to do at this point you can see how quickly this is going when I paused the film before that was only about maybe a minute and you can see how quickly this goes now depending on the color of your caramel you want to really watch this because once you get it too dark then you can't go back so I'm just going to carefully watch this I don't know if the camera can pick it up but there is a slight slight little tint of caramel going on there you can see even this thing is very very powerful so I'm just going to I'm actually going to turn this thing right off for a second so now I've got it right off I'm just going to watch this you can actually see a cup change in color now so when I get it to the the actual color that I want what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the butter and I'm going to put the butter in there and the butter is going to add to add a really really rich creamy texture to our caramel but what it also will do is it will stop the cooking process because the butter is cold I'm using butter that's cold I should actually put that in the description that the butter that I'm using is cold that will drop the temperature of the the sugar so I'm just going to watch this see at this point now it's slowed its slowed right down so I'm just going to get it up to number one again and I'll just let it go a little bit longer all right so what I'm going to do is I'll just pause the tape for about maybe 30 seconds or so and I'll come back alright so this is about a minute later I said 30 seconds but I let it go for about a minute and you can see now I'm not well hopefully you can see that it's really starting to get that caramel color and this is really where you want to build up your flavor profile because if you don't let this portion go at this this step if you don't let this go long enough you're not really going to get that true caramel flavor you really need you know the the sugar to really caramelize and now you can really see that coming up coming together I had also turned on my heat I'm actually going to turn that down now I've got it right off now and now right now I'm really starting to pick up just for the first few seconds right now I can smell the caramel there we go and that's good perfect you can see that's changing color very quickly now so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to take all of my butter and just get that in there okay now I've got my heat off now you can take that right off the heat just like that get that in there and then what I'm going to do now is I'm going to take our heavy whipping cream and I'm just going to get that in there as well and at this point you can stir stir stir so I'll get my wooden spoon in there and you may have to introduce heat depending on your stove but I don't need to there's a lot of heat going on here still you can still see it that it's very very hot even with the addition of the cold butter and the cold cream so at this point I'm just going to gently mix this if you don't have a wooden spoon you can use a regular spoon you can use a fork you can you know whisk if you have one you can really see that beautiful caramel color coming together now oh well that smells so good now if you're wondering yes you could add a little bit of vanilla so you don't want to add too much in because you don't want it tasting too much like vanilla so maybe a half a teaspoon of vanilla if you really like vanilla then you can put in a whole teaspoon you could have added it to your cream before you added it and mix that together first doesn't really matter and there we go mm-hmm Oh smells so good I hope the camera can pick up the nice color that is beautiful I actually know some people once it's actually harden they might actually take a spoon and maybe sneak a little spoonful from time to time not going to mention any names yes I'm talking about myself but at this point I'm just going to add a little bit more heat into this so just let it come up just to a little simmer and then I'm going to turn it off and then we're finished could you stop it right now yes you could because as this cools down it is going to thicken quite a bit I just want to give it a little bit of heat just so that I know everything is you know nicely combined a little bit of heat really helps do that just brings it together then those final stages there you can see the bubbles are starting there we go just breathe a little bit of life into all the you know ingredients just to kind of give them that last little spark just before we let it cool down I just look doesn't that look great at that point I'm turning it off and that is it and now what we'll do is we'll just let this cool and then you can pour it into a jar and store it in the fridge so I'll come back a little later on when this is cooled down so what I'm going to do is I'm going to remove from the heat I'm actually going to go put it on like real stove which is off and I'm just going to let this cool down and I'll show you the final product a little later on alright my caramel sauce has cooled down considerably and I just wanted to show you how amazing this looks I wish you could smell this it is just amazing stuff look at this the next time you go to the grocery store check out how much a bottle of caramel sauce costs and look what we made it for practically nothing compared to what you pay for it in the store and this is homemade all-natural and look at that amazing so let's just get some of this caramel right into my little serving dish oh I wish you could smell this it just smells amazing so that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed it if you did please give me a thumbs up this is my homemade caramel sauce that's it for this video so I'll see you next time you", "RIaToZrrBuU": "let's start with sponge toffee it's so much fun to make and don't you just love eating it an important tip when you're making toffee is get all your ingredients organized and ready because once you start cooking that sugar you can't focus on anything else but that sugar I'm gonna pour a tablespoon and a half of honey into a cup and then just put that by the stove because I need to add that halfway through the cooking process now to really get that spongy effect you need to add baking soda so I'm getting that ready to 5 teaspoons it really does take a lot but this makes a big recipe there we go and something I've discovered that really helps to froth up the baking soda is adding a little cream of tartar I mix in half a teaspoon I just stir it into the baking soda here and because cream of tartar is an acidity as soon as it hits the liquid sugar when I pull it off the stove boom it immediately starts foaming up it just guarantees you get a perfect even frothiness all the way through that sponge toffee as you're stirring it so I have that ready and now it's time to measure the ingredients into the pot I like to start with a cup of water with the water at the bottom of the pot I know the sugar won't melt evenly okay toffee is toffee it's candy so it takes a lot of sugar three and a half cups there we go and to get the right set inconsistency in the sponge toffee you also need corn syrup I use golden corn syrup that way you get a nice color in your sponge toffee and it's a full cup and a half it's the little simple tips that count when it comes to making a good sponge toffee now this is an easy tip don't do anything you don't want to stir your mixture here just take it over to the heat and put it on high the reason you don't stir it is that the sugar could crystallize I'll boil the sugar without stirring until it reaches about 280 for fahrenheits and I use my candy thermometer to make sure I hit that temperature all right here it is I've hit 284 which is the point where I add the honey it's amazing how the small measurement really imparts a beautiful honey flavor and now to bring it to the perfect temperature I cook it up to 300 so I just let it go don't need to stir any more and it doesn't take long I'm almost there now 300 all right now very carefully take it off the heat you can work over your stovetop if you wish but I'll just set this here on a trivet I have my pan already sets it's a 9 by 13 pan greased and I've lined it with parchment with the parchment coming up the sides this grows that much it'll actually grow over the pan now this is where I have to work quickly I'm going to sift in the baking soda and cream of tartar over the top and then stirring very quickly with a wooden spoon because it doesn't conduct the heat get that baking soda in there so it's well blended you want to stop stirring after a point [Music] and now I get it right into my pan this is the best part about making sponge toffee look at that and you'll see that over the next 15 minutes it grows up and up and as it starts cooling you will find it sinks in the middle but don't worry it won't collapse now I'm gonna set this aside and because that sugar was so hot 300 degrees it takes at least two hours to cool down completely and once it's cooled tada there it is the great thing about sponge toffee is in an airtight container it can keep for weeks so you can make a big batch and have it on hand it looks like it's going to be heavy but really it's amazing how light it is and sturdy but you can hear it's kind of hollow and then just take something like the end of a rolling pin and you just crack away at it break those pieces to reveal that sponge toffee Center mmm the little crumbs are the best bits to eat in my mind but the big bits I break into pieces I love seeing the Airy bubbles in there mmm [Music]", "cHhHNPomqRc": "welcome to hearty home

stunning cakes unique cookies decadent chocolates and desserts and even dazzling savory dishes it's all about making life suites so this is what I did for the caramels I poured heavy cream into a pot with the seeds from a whole vanilla bean I added some corn syrup and brought it to a boil then I turned it down to simmer the next step was to get the sugar into a separate pot cranking up the heat so it would melt I gave it a few swirls to mix the sugar through and to get an even color when it was a beautiful caramel I added some salted butter a pinch of sea salt and swirled it again then I added some whole milk to the pot of cream and strained it into the caramel being super careful as blending these two causes a lot of bubbling I cut the caramel to 260 degrees I poured it into a well oiled dish lined with parchment paper and popped it into the fridge for two hours when it had cooled I turned the caramel onto a clean cutting board and peeled off the parchment paper I then sprinkled the top with more sea salt cut the caramel into squares and twisted them in candy wrappers the girls have made me a big batch for my sampling did you taste one oh yes I loved it oh well I know I love them

before adding our 1 and 1/4 teaspoons of vanilla alright our caramel has been in a pot for about in half an hour now and I'm looking keeping keeping my eye on the thermometer as the temperature keeps climbing and the caramel will be done when it reaches 250 degrees our caramel reached 250 degrees so I took it off the heat and I'm gonna go ahead and have our one and a quarter teaspoon of vanilla oh no looks like it's sizzling a little bit I'm sure that's a normal thing [Music] now that the vanilla is mixed in we're going to go ahead and add our caramel to the greased pan [Music] all right our caramel is now cooling in the pan and once it sets completely we're gonna go ahead and cut it and then wrap it with lots of paper all right the caramels are cutting out as you can see here's one of

clean to ensure the sugar crystals melt without crystallizing if you want you can add a little bit of water to evenly distribute the sugar crystals and while you're at it a little bit of lemon juice the lemon juice will prevent crystallization keep the sugar on high heat and don't touch the pot until it begins to take color for three-quarters of a cup of sugar it will take about eight minutes for color to appear at the edges gently swirl the pot to evenly distribute the color and remember when it starts to turn color pay close attention because everything from this point happens very quickly you're looking for to turn a dark amber color or if you're using a candy thermometer you want it to reach 348 degrees if you don't have a candy thermometer one of the best ways to tell if it's ready is to use your nose when you can smell a sweet slightly bitter smell remove the sugar from the heat and immediately stir in your heavy cream with a long-handled wooden spoon don't use a metal spoon because it conducts heat and the sugar is extremely hot and get ready because it'll bubble up like crazy if you're using butter stir it in until it's fully incorporated and that's it you've got smooth

lose the medicinal quality in your cannabis so I keep my canvas or I keep mine between 250 to 300 degrees because it does still need to get warm enough to turn into candy so all we're doing now is just warming this up I'm not gonna boil it I'm not going to do anything like that again say buddy again oh the key temperature is between 250 degrees and 300 degrees and that is Fahrenheit I'm not sure would be different so this one I'm just gonna kind of bring to a boil that way all of the ingredients will come together right now you can still see it's melting together the only time thing I changed this time going around was I put my vanilla in upfront as I'm heating it to start boiling off some of the water that's in the vanilla tour as I normally put it in very last and I don't heat any longer it's a reason for this change is I'm trying to find out if the particular type of vanilla but had too much has too much water in it and is causing the caramels to be a little softer and I want the thicker consistency so I'm gonna start boiling off some of the vanilla water as well infused cannabis infused caramel right now this mixture is at 167 degrees and move it over to a warm warming burner and just put it a little bit on low let it warm up while I work on the next step oh you made it yeah hey hon how you doin sweetie so now I'm going to combine my granulated sugar 3 cups of granulated sugar 1/2 a cup of infused light corn syrup so this is Northern Lights infused like corn syrup so this has infused butter and infused corn syrup so this would be a good dose of medicine yumminess I'm going to add my rock salt a teaspoon and a half a cup of water and I'm just gonna mix this up on the eat to get it good and clear and yumminess so let's see if I get you over here so the minute I get all of this done very very well mixed in good to where all of the sugar is melted then I'll leave it alone with the temperature and let it go to about 290 so this will be about 290 degrees and then I'm not gonna swan snout that this is all cleaned up I'm gonna clean the sides down really good if you get a lot of sugar on the sides you're gonna want to take one of your brushes your basting brush fills with water and wet it down and get all that sugar off the side of your pan so it doesn't crystallize on top of your caramel if it does that it will leave the edges of your caramel flaky and odd you just don't want that crystallization there you want it to be nice and smooth and clear all the way through now I am going to keep an eye on the temperature gates which is here I have my thermometer set to 250 degrees right now because I want to know when I get to 250 that's when I really need to start monitoring this pot so occasionally I'm going to come over here to our butter mixture which is on the warming burner and I'm just gonna give it a nice little mix make sure everything stays mixed in and you don't get that step film or the skin of the butter and cream on the top of your mixture so cuz this is gonna be a really warm warming it's a very soft forming you'll never see this come to a boil or anything else this is just gonna try to maintain the temperature or maybe a little less until we're ready to move to the next step with it but I also don't want that crusting film up there because that'll also caused crystallization in your caramels and it'll look funny you just don't want it now the reason why I'm using two totally different sized pots here this one is a smaller one to where this one is more of a 10 quart pot is because when I add the butter cream mixture into this pot what's gonna happen is this mixture is going to double and triple in size so if you don't have it in a large enough container it will overflow so I'm just keeping an eye on this this is good and this here is sitting right now at about 226 degrees completely mixed in really good so I have no longer gonna mix this at all and you will see as the temperature goes up on this you will now start to notice that it's going to boil a little there's gonna be a very large rolling boil there don't be too concerned it eat I have not had it burn to my cut so it's not at a high enough temperature to burn your pot okay so the next temperature I'm waiting for it to come up at this point is right around 250 degrees the color should change to a very transparent Parmalee color which is starting to do my timer will go off and about 8 9 degrees to let me know that I'm getting closer to 250 degrees and to make sure to monitor it and what and then I'm going to allow this pot to continue boiling untouched until we get to 320 degrees and basically this is going to boil up all the water and everything else in there at or out of the car most to harden so while I was doing this and setting this up I cleaned up my workspace over here and started with the molds that we'll be using today once the caramel is done I will be putting the caramel in bottles and then adding them to the molds got it love my little eep-eep n this one I got from little Amsterdam in Surprise Arizona a really great deal the owner made it for me I don't have their information in front of me but you guys can look them up online it's a little Amsterdam in Surprise Arizona they do a mail order and stuff like that as well you can always call them and they'll send you they'll do Oh online stuff to you for you which is kinda neat so even if there's a custom built they also make their own baked uses I personally don't beep so I don't personally know that much about it but I know that they make their own juice if you do so one thing you will notice when you're doing the carlo's and when you're working with the light corn syrup and with the infusion on this is it your temperature gauge towards the beginning of the 250 degrees is gonna bounce a little up and down that's normal the reason for this is because you're getting through pockets of water and boiling that pocket of water off that's what causes the caramel to have its shape and texture so yeah that's that's why you'll see a range in your thermometer so now the caramel or this mixture is at 268 degrees I have the timer set at 320 degrees because that will be when we start our next process of adding in the cream butter mixture into this one and boiling it so when again yeah it's crazy it goes against everything I want to do I want to stir this candy so bad but you don't need to it's not there's one usually keeping a good eye on it you'll see how it clears up the bubbles get thicker the pockets in there it's a thicker clearer creamier solution so and if it wasn't you would do your candy the same way so let's say that my caramel I didn't want to do infused caramel I would just use regular light corn syrup instead of infused corn syrup and follow the regular directions you'll be doing the same thing you don't have to stir it constant there you don't have to stir it this way as long as you're keeping a good eye on it you should not burn it I'm watching this to make sure that I don't get burn spots because of water pockets and then I'm gonna add this Hanning and mix it up and then put it into the molds so the mixture is now at 290 or 300 degrees you will notice that the temperature will go up much quicker with less water in it as your water starts to evaporate out it will get higher and you want to be very very specific not to allow this mixture to go over 325 degrees it will burn at that point plus it will render your THC in your caramel a nonworking of non non psychoactive so we're getting there so when you'll notice that it's darkening slightly slightly as well as the bubbles are still rising higher and higher as it the temperature goes up it is darkening but it's not it's so clear that is a very very good thing clear is good so we are at 220 degrees at this point i'ma go ahead and shut the [ __ ] and slide this over okay at this point what I'm gonna do is I'm going to bring my wooden spatula and my cream mixture that I've been keeping warm I'm gonna pour it into this mixture where it's gonna bubble up robust oh it smells so we all marry now Wow so now I'm gonna mix this up again really good and you'll see how now that I'm mixing it again it's boiling way up there I get it very good and very mixed start moving it back to the heat now I'm going to next because then I'm not going to touch it again once it's really good and mixed I'm gonna let it boil this is where I need a second person to hold the camera I need like somebody that lives close to me that wants to learn some of this stuff to intern or something now I want to set this back up to 250 degrees I want to boil this back together till I get about 250 degrees without stirring again this is going to go up over 250 degrees a bit as long as I don't reach 325 looks pretty safe the reason why is because the first part of the mixture was pretty hot so I can get the excess water out of here for firmness the longer you cook it in this position in the warmer you get it the thicker and the more shapee your your caramel be that's it there will be a harder texture otherwise they're gonna be more you can stop at this point drain it off and this would end up like a really good caramel sauce for your ice cream this is perfect for that but because we want to actually make caramels that you can eat that we can wrap up in parchment paper and each I want this to cook a bit longer so I get a harder substance but I don't want it so hard that I can't chew on it without hurting my teeth because as a cancer patient and the chemo patient my teeth are destroyed from Big Pharma and and the sickness and everything else so I have to try to find foods that are softer when I try to eat otherwise even like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich will break my teeth and that this cook we are fully mixed it is down to 232 degrees I'm gonna go ahead and let this boil up to 250 degrees while I'm doing that I'm gonna come over here and start setting my molds and my bottles these bottles I'm gonna use to help create the caramel in there they can have beautiful cream you'll see it it's a real creamy thick it's a full boil oh it smells amazing mmm it smells so yummy yeah I don't really need to start it right now I'm just kind of looking at the consistency so that we have because I want to thicker candy right now another way of checking is if you take a little bit of the caramel off the spoon here I'll show you if you take a cup with a little bit of cold water in the bottom you take your carrot caramel and you drop a little bit into the cup of cold water that'll help show you how soft or hard your caramel is so it still it is it's moldable but it's still fairly soft so I want to keep cooking it for a little while I am gonna make some suckers I have root beer and watermelon suckers that I'm gonna make oh yeah it tastes good so that's one way to kind of tell that consistency is still very very soft that's why I'm continuing to let it cook oh don't kill me I'm sorry I know this is probably teasing but it isn't really good I feel bad I don't want to tease anybody but yeah I recommend I highly recommend even if you don't I'd use this recipe for infused caramel make it sometime with without it all it is amazing caramel I'm go ahead and start removing this it's off the heat and let it go ahead and start pulling on sorry guys that's what we're looking like on the inside of here this particular recipe makes 2 pounds of caramel the recipe is posted on my website at www.norcalhypno.com okay so I just made with this and a filling from the club reasonings for silicon Club is I'm gonna take caramel and I'm gonna put it in this bottle I'm gonna take the problem and use it to fill up the trays however in doing this the bottle is gonna get very very hot with the silicone gloves I won't burn my fingers however they only have one size leave a little hand so hold your bottle with whatever whether it's a oven mitt you're so cool you got it going on you know very well thank you yeah you know I'm really enjoy doing some of this stuff it's so much fun so now I'm going to take my metal scooper and my bottle and waste as little as possible so I think we are going to use a funnel not today this is gonna go down here for a moment we are gonna be fun because I make a mess everything I do I am the cookie at the messy cook so now basically I'm just gonna do all of this over the pot so I don't waste any of my cannabis or Eddie my caramel you know it's a party foul if you waste the cannabis and I am NOT one to bring the foul on the party so this is what I was talking about when you have the thinner caramel you can actually just take it store it in a bottle like this that has a squeeze cap for it like this put it in your refrigerator warm it up in a pot of boiling water whatever you want to use it and you can use it as caramel for your coffee you can use it for caramel for ice cream you can use it for just about anything I've used this in my teas I've also taken this with a little bit of peanut butter the sauce caramel sauce and I put it on toast and they've given that to my husband when he's crashing because he's an insulin dependent diabetic it's a lot of sugar but it really helped get him back up when he's crashing so looks like this bottle should just about do it so as you see I just pretty much fill the bottle right up the bottles are silicone bottles I actually got these at Home Depot in the barbecue section but I've seen them at other places I wouldn't get the ones at Walmart or whatever because those are not silicone and those do tend to melt so be careful with those bottles that you get because you don't want to melt that bottle when you put your caramel in it so that's why make sure that you get it at you know some place that that's what it's looking for is a medical place or a appropriate place for your cannabis now with this what I do kind of funny every laughs at me is I take mine I take my silicone tray so when I'm working with this as you can see the caramel is going to drip down into my big silicone tray so I'm not losing cannabis on my countertop so that way I can move to my next bottle okay you've got to work with this while it's still warm or you have to put it back on the oven and warm it back up so that's why I recommend doing something like that with this the reason why I do the tray is because once these are filled the rest of the carrot or the caramel that I pressed I will let stand in the silicone tray just for the extra caramel I use my cookbook to prop so you see as it starts to cool it's going to take longer and longer to get through the bottle so I'm gonna have to probably put this on my warmer burner while this is doing that and keep this caramel warm so that way it will be able to go through my tub thank you and anybody smoking what you're smoking I love making yummies it's so much fun I just I like the experimentation and I'd like to see what the cannabis looks like wouldn't when it does in the transformation because it does change colors and it does do some funny stuff sometimes so I love doing this the science part of me of my brain yeah you can you can see the little specks of cannabis throughout all the car moans it's dripping down it's really pretty it's like I'm a flake in it come shiny it's pretty see if I can get it closer to the screen so you can see what it looks like think it fix my consistency for a woman that is infused caramel I can't put it in the Bible so I put it over there so I can't eat it later I'm cheating I'm just warming up this caramel again so now that the caramel is pilot's still really warm now that the caramel is in one of these bottles I can either start putting them through the mold or warming them up a little bit more however necessary but because I have a silicone glove it helps me be able to handle the containers without burning my hands yummy yummy yummy so while this is going I am going to put this back on this here I'm gonna go ahead and let this warm for a little while and I'm gonna start working with the first mold that way I don't have to heat my caramel up again so my first mold I have already are all of my molds I have already cammed because if you don't hand them you're not getting them out very well I am using silicone molds to make it easier to get them in and out and these ones are gonna be a little bunny butts which brings me to the only Easter joke I can even come close to remembering so I did miss the bloody buts they have little cotton tails or really really cute right there so the joke is how come bunnies don't make noise with when they're having Nucky because they have cotton balls mmm cute I thought it was funny so that's basically it now I'm going to start filling my squares just like this and I'm going to go all the way through the two trays once that's done then I'm going to go ahead and fill the silicon square with a tray of caramel and put them in the refrigerator but my battery's gonna die so I'm gonna say goodbye great team you guys today have a great day yeah love you talk to you soon bye [Applause]", "tl5HOTpinz8": "my mom taught me the family caramel recipe over the holidays and what was making those caramels I sent him out to the owner of the company I worked over the summer and he couldn't believe that I made is speaking lianas neither could I cuz I'm not like the best cook but I practiced a lot and I made them on my own and he was stunned that I made these caramels and I'm just like you made you so yeah he's like no way now make these in and then he was telling me that the CEO of the company kept coming into his office to take them and I was like wow people really like these things I really do believe that these caramels are delicious and my family's caramel so it's like might as well show you something that I find delicious with everyone else that may like it as well it's a good product you know I think that for me from a personal level I don't want to produce anything I don't think its quality we take the the ingredients and we melt them down and then you have to get them to a certain temperature so we do this process called cold water testing so it's an old candy making technique that my mom Tommy because a lot of candy thermometers can't tell the actual temperature so once we cook it down then we start pouring it into cold water and then you can see by the consistency of the caramel how close it is to being done and then after we get it to the right consistency and we pour it in two different pans that they're going to set in and it sets for 24 hours the next day we cut it up and then we roll them in package them gotten overwhelmingly positive feedback in terms of the quality of our caramel itself so that's what I gotta get my drive and my passion for just seen your customers response to eating your product and consuming your product and how it positively impacts their lives i think that's what's the most gratifying part of entrepreneurship in general is making a direct impact on the lives of others so i think just creating a quality product that customers enjoy is what really drives both of us we don't have a ton of preservatives inner core most and so so the shelf life is not Islam but I think that that makes them really unique as well it's it's a really high quality product use like a Malaysian sea salt we use pure vanilla extract a lot of the times when you go to when you go to a store you can only get like chocolate-covered caramel or yummy chocolate or not some caramel and this is just karma somebody else can you know they like caramels but they're so used to having a hardcore mole you know that's especially with the older demographic and maybe they have like dental appliances or something like that it could rip them out so this is a soft caramel it's really delicious and why not share that you know I think that's a motivation for me is a sweet treat for people i think that's a lot of fun and and then the whole process itself is it's a lot of work but it's a lot of fun to think what we envisioned for the future is really to to find ways to make our production process a lot more efficient right now we're cooking three to four batches at a time and if you really want to grow this company we've had a lot of demand from like local retailers and customers themselves so i think we need to find a way to make the process more efficient so that we can scale up and meet the demands of our of our customer base most people that I've that have tasted these have said they've never had a coma like it so for me that it kind of makes me feel good like our original mission to share product that's good with community and we're getting that you know and that's that's fun we were sampling just door-to-door in her neighborhood and this little girl came up and she sampling is like wow this is really good and her mom bought two boxes and she was saying that her daughter just a week before I'd say all her allowance money to buy a box of caramels from another company and and the little girl and the mom both were saying that these combos were so much better so like seeing that little girl get excited about just a little you know like a little piece of candy and it makes you happy you know it feels like you're doing something good you", "dmFGGXRKRac": "[Music] and delight edibles thank you for joining me my name is Liz and today we are gonna be making chewy buttery caramels now this is a great recipe because it rme the recipe calls for one cup of butter so it's wonderful because you can use different amounts of cannabis cannabis butter depending on how strong you want to make it so for myself today I'm going to be using 1/4 cup um however you can go half a cup three quarters of a cup of can about this canna by no cannabutter and and then you just use regular butter to make up the difference so as I said today I'm gonna be doing a quarter cup of can of butter will do 3/4 a cup of regular butter and it's a really simple recipe and I'm looking forward to showing it to you as well as I'm going to show you how you can make turtles so you can just have the caramel pieces or you can turn them around you can make some turtles for for yourself or for the holiday season alright so we're just gonna get started and thanks for joining is a heavy a medium heavy saucepan and what it means by a heavy is it's got the heavy bottom this allows for even heat distribution to make sure that your candy cooks properly and evenly a rubber spatula or wooden spoon and a tray what I did is I just made a tray from a wooden frame and lined it with parchment paper obviously you can use any kind of baking tray line it with parchment paper a little trick that I do is to make sure to get it to fit in properly as I make a little slit into the corners and that way they can do it you just they're able to tuck in nicely you just tuck the corners in and that way it sits nice and flat and you'll also need a candy thermometer and so I'm gonna get into the ingredients and we're gonna start cooking you're gonna need 1/2 a cup of brown sugar packed 1/2 a cup of white sugar now I've used I said 1/4 cup of my can of butter and three coins three quarters of a cup of regular butter make sure get it all in there don't want to waste any and you're gonna need a one can of condensed sweetened milk not the regular milk not the regular evaporated milk it has to be the sweetened condensed milk you plop that in there and one cup of light corn syrup now you should be able to use the regular corn syrup I've never actually tried it with it I prefer the light corn syrup mainly for taste I don't really like the molasses taste in regular corn syrup but in this recipe I can't really see what difference is gonna make other than making it a bit darker as I said I haven't tried it so I'm not sure so you want it to start to mix all the ingredients mixed together here now is very important was doing this recipe is once you start cooking is that you never stop stirring you can't stop stirring for even just a minute or reduced even a couple of seconds because it will start to burn and you'll start to see little brown flecks appearing in it so you said the whole time you've got a stir so you're gonna be doing about a half hour of stirring time you're gonna turn your heat onto a medium and a medium or medium low and you're going to continue stirring until the bitter end so we're gonna be cooking this to a 234 to 240 so 234 is gonna give you a nice chewy but a very softer caramel the 240 is gonna give you that that chewy but really stiffer caramel so depending on what texture that you particularly like is the temperatures are gonna go to I'm gonna be cooking it to 237 because I wanted a little bit firmer than that really soft but I don't want that really really firm almost break yourteeth firm caramel so 237 is what I'm gonna be cooking it to and you're just gonna continue to stir clean off the sides of your pot and yeah enjoy put some tunes on and dance away so continue stirring until everything is nice and melted and there's no more lumps and everything is nice and smooth and at that point you can add your candy thermometer and then I said you're gonna cook it to between 230 to 34 to 240 and don't ever stop stirring so we've been cooking now for about 10-12 minutes and you're gonna see these candy the caramel is starting to darken up getting more caramel looking and it's also getting thicker you may not be able to see it but trust me by my arm it is getting a lot thicker and we're almost a temperature and so as I said continue stirring until you get to do your desired temperature alright so we're just coming up onto the 234 so at this point if you want that softer chewy caramel you would pull it at this point submerge the bottom of the pot in cold water that's what I've got sitting beside me there and to stop the cooking process right away otherwise so the heat will continue to rise for another moment a minute or two making it a little bit firmer than maybe what you'd like so if you want to stop the cooking process right away somewhere at the bottom of the pot in some cold water alright so my temperature now is 237 I am going to pull out the candy thermometer and submerge the bottom of the pot into cold water beside me to stop the cooking process so as I said you just want to stop put it in the cold water to stop the cooking cooking process and then you're going to immediately pour it into your pan that you've set up with your parchment paper earlier all right so for this I'm pouring half of my mixture into my pan there so that I can make caramel pieces and then I'm gonna be poor than the rest into a funnel so that we can make the pecan clusters or Turtles whatever you like to call them and I'll show you how to put those together now we're gonna put our turtle together so just get a whole pecan break it in half and that's gonna be the main body part and you take the other half break a piece in half and that's gonna be the front legs and then get another half break the break it in half and that's going to be the back legs and then you're just gonna take your caramel with the funnel and you're gonna plop some caramel right on top in the middle and you're gonna do that for for all of them or if you don't want to make the little turtle shape which I wouldn't really bother with because by the time he gets a caramel in the chocolate you don't really see that it's a turtle so I just make some pecan clusters and top it off with caramel and then we are going to coat them up with chocolate once the caramel sets so it's gonna take about 20 minutes half hour for the caramel to firm up enough so that we can coat them with the chocolate so at about the 10 minute mark while they're still warm what I like to do is to form them into into more of a ball because they flatten out when they're warm and you poured the caramel they're kind of flat so what I like to do is kind of push them together so that it creates more of a I'll be it more of a shape that you want more of a cluster instead of it just being flat so I've gone ahead and I've already melted out my chocolate I've got that ready I like to use the candy melts they're really simple to use and there I just call them pretty much idiot-proof you melt them you dip them they dry it's great so you just take your cluster and you dip it into your chocolate and use a fork to be able to get off the excess chocolate so you just want to tap it remove any of the excess chocolate and then you're gonna place it on to the wire rack and I'll let it dry and what you want to do is to put a piece of parchment paper underneath your drying rack to catch any of the excess chocolate that drips off so it's not dripping on to your counters [Music] [Music] I've taking my um Turtles out of the refrigerator after 20 minutes if they're a little bit stuck to the tray don't worry just use a flat knife there to pry them off or if you just let them cool warm up a little bit they'll come right off and there you've got it PK clusters or Turtles your friends and family are sure to love these for the holidays they make a great gift idea sark caramel now is completely cooled is about two hours and we're just gonna remove it from the parchment paper so just take it out of the pan and remove all your parchment paper from it comes away really easily and just remove any little tiny pieces that may be remaining now I had a little wet spot for some reason in my mold so I'm just gonna cut that out and what I like to use for cutting is I like to use a pizza cutter you can use you can use either scissors or a butcher knife is really handy as well now usually I use a ruler but I couldn't find it today so I'm just gonna eyeball it for us here it's not gonna be very accurate but it's gonna give you the idea and I'm using a piece of parchment here just to be able to hold on to the caramel while I'm cutting it cuz otherwise it's slippery and I don't want my handprints all in it so you just press down and firmly roll the blade through [Music] once you have them all cut up into pieces you can wrap them up in parchment paper or wax my backs paper I prefer wax paper I don't have any today so I'm using parchment paper as you can see it's not the easiest to work with but the caramels not going to stick to it so I kind of wrap it like a little present just tuck the ends in and if you want you could add attack a little piece of tape on but as I said if you use wax paper it's great it just wraps up really nicely [Music] [Music] [Music]", "zhkwX0yS_0M": "hello today I'll show you how to make condensed milk toffee which is one of my favorite candies elmo's why it could be very addicting so let get started father oil into the pan or simply melt the butter and then add the condensed milk stirring continuously using a nonstick pan will make the tax easier and also prevent burning and wastage as the milk starts to thicken add the flavor and keep on stirring you'll notice that the milk is changing in color and becoming more solid keep up mixing until the color changes to a light brown toffee color then leave to cool a bit and mold into circles and I can place my on a wax paper press it down to give its shape and then leave to cool the beat before cutting into squares or rectangles

But it does so be really really careful to chop in this so it may end up being eaten Pop the caramel sea salt fudge in a pan and add a tiny bit of salt. It's just a little bit So then all we need to do is add a hundred millimetres or half a cup of Double cream or in America called heavy cream in case you're wondering how much Fudge this is in cups It's about a cup and a quarter I think But you're better off to open a packet and just put it all in So to make the caramel sauce that goes in the bottom the Fudge Affogato we just need to heat those two up gently because it's cream and fudge This caramel sauce goes really really well on any kind of dessert in fact you can pour it straight over the clotted cream Recipe I've done as well They'll be linked for that at the end of the video Just keep an eye on it when you boil it because obviously it's fudge, sugar in there and double cream or heavy cream So that's a really quick video on how to make yourself a delicious caramel, sauce if you enjoyed this one please subscribe Please share it let everyone know how easy and simple it is. Thank you That's what you call a dessert", "uP2lSvzlh2c": "okay hey guys today we are going to be making homemade caramel the ingredients we will need are 2 3 cup of packed brown sugar 1 cup of white sugar 1 3 cup of corn syrup make sure you butter the cup that you're putting in so the corn syrup slides out easier one and a half cups of heavy cream one and a half teaspoons of salt one and a half tablespoons of vanilla and a tablespoon of butter okay um you're gonna want a big sturdy pan so it doesn't boil over a wooden spoon and a candy thermometer or a meat thermometer and you're going to want to put the temperature of the stove on low or medium low so you want to stir it and incorporate all the ingredients together and the butter will melt as we go and um and if there's any crystallization on this side um later in the process you want you will want a pastry brush to brush to lightly brush the edges um yeah so i need to wait for this you need to keep stirring it constantly when you're making caramel it is a very slow process but it is quick to burn so you need to keep it on low or medium low and you need to stir it constantly so it doesn't so it's all incorporated and it needs to get to 250 degrees and we'll show you what it looks like when it gets to that point so we'll see when it gets to that point okay um so it has been a little while and so this is what it looks like right now very it has gotten thicker um there's a little bit of steam coming up up rising so it is getting and there's a few bubbles in it so um yeah we'll see when i get okay okay so it has been a little bit and it is starting to bubble um so this is what it looks like it's almost one to the temperature that we needed to be so yeah we'll see you when it's actually at that point okay so it's now ready at 250 degrees um it's now ready to pour into the pan you should always have a parent do this make sure you turn off the stove and so my mom will pour it in here and go and if it is too soft for your liking you can always put it in the oven to melt and and harden again so yeah we'll see you when we when it's time to cut it off and yeah and you should let it cool for at least two hours at room temperature okay so now that it has hardened we transferred it onto a cutting board and we are going to cut a piece you're going to cut it about you can cut them as big as you want i am going to cut this one little piece and show you if you know you guys should have a parent i hope you cut this if it is too hard i think i got it okay okay okay so this is my piece of caramel i'm going to cut some parchment paper so we are going to take i cut my piece of caramel so we are going to take a piece of parchment paper and make sure it's big so because it takes up a lot of room you're going to set your caramel right in the center fold it over so you're going to touch the [Music] and neighbors", "u-rmXhz1bag": "Howdy folks, sorry that was a little bit over\nexcited welcome to my virgin kitchen i've been asked to show you how to make caramels\nso this is how you make caramels in the microwave. They look amazing right and the cool thing\nabout this recipe is it's really easy, but on the flip side it's a little dangerous,\nit gets a bit dangerous during one step, you'll see in a bit. If you wanna have a go at making this hit\npause on the video now and write the ingredients all down, scribble them down like that and\nthis is how you do it. Grab yourself a microwave safe bowl and add\nin your white caster sugar, brown sugar, condensed milk, golden syrup, melted butter & a little\npinch of salt. Give it a good old mix together with a whisk,\nwooden spoon, spatula, your utensil of choice basically. We're gonna use a microwave ok for eight minutes\non two minute blasts so that's 4 times, my microwave is 800 watt so if you've got a slightly\nweaker microwave than that it's gonna take you around about ten minutes but similarly\nif you've got a 1000 watt microwave take it to about 5 or 6 minutes then taking it out\nand whisking it together. When you're mixing it together be careful\nbecause it's hot and this was the dangerous step that I was talking about towards the\nend as you take it out check this out it's like a bubbling, roaring inferno and you don't\nwant that on your arms so be brave like a soldier of caramel a warrior of caramel the\nalmighty Jesus of caramel?! Sorry about that I was getting a bit excited\nthere must be all the sugar i've add but anyhow with your caramel all done you want to pour\nit into a silicone tray ideally because it's going to be nice and flexible and easier to\nget out later on if you haven't got a silicone one just use a tin and line it with some baking\nparchment that's fine and what you want to do is just leave it to cool down naturally\nfor a good Hour on it's own just let it sit there. Once that has cooled down you want to plonk\nthat in the fridge for a good 5 Hours ideally overnight to be honest and then once it's\nready you wanna rip back that silicone cover on it cut into chunks with a knife then whack\nit on a plate just like we're seeing here that is looking good they're so good so yummy\nso chewy. This is just a very basic version you could\ndo, but what you could do is before you add that to the tray you could put some crushed\nnuts on the bottom, get the caramel on top, then sit the melted chocolate on there oh\nmy goodness that'd be good, or just give it a darn good extra sprinkling of salt for some\nsalted caramel!

and welcome to randy makes candy where i help you make tasty treats that people love to eat as i said today i'm making salted caramels this is at the request of a long time friend of mine so thanks for the suggestion rick if there's something you'd like to see me make please let me know in the comments section after the recipe i'm going to talk a little bit about the science that explains why heat plus sugar equals awesome and i'm going to share my attempt at the absolute easiest caramel making method i've ever seen spoiler alert it didn't work speaking of sharing if you like what's happening here in the candy kitchen please like subscribe and share let's start with some caramel trivia i'm sure you're familiar with milton snavely hershey founder of the hershey chocolate company that's not where he got his start though at the age of 14 he was apprenticed to a confectioner to learn the candy making trade 12 years later he'd learned enough to strike out on his own and formed the lancaster caramel company a decade or so later a trip to the world's colombian exposition in chicago sparked an interest in chocolate he sold the caramel company for a million dollars a lot back then created his own formula for milk chocolate and began construction on what was to become the world's largest chocolate manufacturing company so when you hear the name hershey you should think of caramel as well as chocolate okay let's make this happen first what do you need to create this don't worry about writing it down the ingredients and amounts are listed below you can also find this information at randymakescandy.com i've based today's recipe on one that was discovered a few years ago by renee eisenblacher of lancaster pennsylvania she claims to have found a handwritten recipe for caramels in the old garage behind her home the recipe was in an envelope labeled msh shuttleworth caramel and is believed by some that msh stands for milton snavely hershey huh see there was talk of doing a forensic handwriting comparison of the recipe to some documents known to have been written by hershey to see if he was actually the author this really sparked my interest because forensic handwriting comparison was my bread and butter for about 25 years but i can't find anything to indicate if that ever occurred if ms eisenblocker and the hershey company want to send me some documents i'll see what i can do no charge the only differences between what i'll call the msh recipe and the one we're doing today is that i'm adding a little water which helps the sugar dissolve more evenly and reduces the chance of burning and the msh recipe calls for one tablespoon of fresh gum and no one seems to know exactly what that is if i were to guess i'd say it's gum arabic which is a thickener and emulsifier used a lot in the food and drink industry it's also used in the paint shoe polish and cigarette paper industries regardless it ain't going in my caramels sorry milt anyway let's get moving on the caramel recipe that may or may not have come from mr hershey ingredient-wise you'll need one tablespoon of vanilla paste or extract i'm using the paste today vanilla paste has the same vanilla flavor as a good extract but it's a little sweeter due to some added sugar plus it has little vanilla bean flecks which can kind of give the final product an upscale look paste is a bit of a misnomer though as it's more of a viscous liquid by the way viscous liquid is my next band name you'll also need 72 grams or five tablespoons of butter one teaspoon of salt to go in the caramels and another half teaspoon of salt as a topping 85 grams or a quarter cup of light corn syrup 60 grams or one quarter cup of water 292 grams or one and a third cups of sugar and 240 grams or one cup of heavy cream you'll also need a large saucepan a bowl an eight by eight baking pan lined with greased parchment paper a wooden or silicone spoon or a spatula and a candy thermometer you can see the thermometer i use in my toffee video it's not a bad idea to have a bowl of ice water standing by just in case you get a bit of this molten mixture on you i've never done it but then i consider a molten caramel scar the candy kitchen equivalent of a dueling scar okay let's make some candy cut the butter into a few pieces then combine that with the vanilla one teaspoon of salt and the heavy cream in a microwave safe bowl heat it in the microwave for a minute or so until the butter has melted and then set it aside place the corn syrup water and sugar in the saucepan and stir it just enough to get the sugar mixed in heat it over medium heat until the sugars come to a boil then cover with a lid for about a minute the steam causes any sugar that may have stuck to the sides of the pan to melt and fall back into the boiling sugar this helps prevent crystallization remove the lid and attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pan cook for another 5 to 10 minutes until it reaches a temperature of 320 degrees fahrenheit you should see a nice amber color the moment the sugar reaches 320 degrees fahrenheit remove it from the heat slowly and carefully pour in the cream mixture while stirring it's going to bubble like mad this is the part where you either congratulate yourself for choosing a large pan or curse yourself for choosing poorly adding the cream mixture will cause the temperature of your caramel to drop put the pan back on the heat and continue cooking for another five to ten minutes until the caramel reaches a temperature of 240 degrees fahrenheit this is the softball stage and will create a soft caramel if you want slightly harder caramels bring the temperature closer to 245 degrees fahrenheit which is the firm ball stage as soon as the caramel reaches your desired temperature pour it into your pan it doesn't matter how smart you are you may have graduated from cambridge or the school of hard knocks regardless when you see how good this looks you are going to want to taste it the heavenly concoction on that spoon is going to be calling out to you taste me taste me resist the temptation otherwise you're going to spend the next half hour with your tongue in that bowl of ice water let your candy rest on the counter for 20 to 30 minutes then scatter the salt over it i'm using fleur to sell here because i like the way it looks but you can use whatever you have on hand then let the caramel cool on the counter for an hour then place it in the fridge for an hour or you can do like i did and just let it sit on the counter overnight when it's cool cut it into whatever size pieces you want it'll be easier to cut if it's cool like refrigerator cools so if it starts to get too soft stick it back in the fridge for a bit when it's cut wrap the pieces up i'm using some cellophane that i had in the pantry but waxed paper will work just as well [Applause] okay let's try one remember how i said these were soft caramels that's very soft caramel here we go [Applause] um sweet creamy caramel-y i mean just amazing silky smooth mouth feel that's just excuse me it's just delicious that is just fabulously good caramel and i'm not even a huge caramel guy that is really good okay put your thinking caps on because it's about to get sciency in here actually i'm going to keep this simple because chemistry is definitely not my strong suit besides scientists have been doing research on caramelization since the late 1700s and even they don't fully understand it so what chance do i have anyway what we call table sugar or granulated sugar is more properly called sucrose it's made up of two simple sugars glucose and fructose the application of heat breaks the chemical bond that holds those two simple sugars together it isn't until that bond is broken that melting occurs this is followed by a condensation step in which the individual sugars lose water as steam and react with each other as this process continues a bunch of volatile chemicals is released which produces the complex combination of flavors we know as caramel please indulge me for a moment while i read off a few of them there's diacetyl which is mainly responsible for the buttery or butterscotch flavor side note if you use brown sugar instead of white sugar you get butterscotch maybe we'll do that someday esters and lactones are produced which have a sweet rum-like flavor along with furan's which are a bit nutty and maltol which gives it a toasty flavor in addition to that free radicals are produced which is part of what makes caramel sticky who knew that the simple caramel was in actuality more complex than warren buffett's tax return finally i saw something recently that i had to try it was a recipe i hate to even call it a recipe that promised great caramel flavor without all the equipment and the melting and the stirring the instructions were to heat your oven to 300 degrees fahrenheit put a few sugar cubes on a baking pan and leave them in the oven for three and a half hours and that's it the idea is that the lower temperature with the longer cook time breaks down the sucrose but never gets to the melting stage it goes straight to caramelization so i tried it and about an hour later everything had melted thinking about it it made sense because 300 degrees fahrenheit is the hard crack stage as we learned in the toffee video so i tried it again at 250 which is the hardball stage after three hours they were still almost pure white after a few more tries i ended up at 265 degrees over the course of my experiment i discovered that the cube seemed to be heating unevenly so i flipped them and rotated the pan numerous times throughout the three hour cook time even with that i had some cubes melting and some hardly toasted and the caramel taste was barely noticeable it mostly just tasted like a sugar cube i fail so you don't have to if you figure out a way to make this work please let me know i was thinking that an insulated pan or even a silpat might have helped them to bake more evenly so you might start there if you enjoyed our time together please like share and subscribe click the bell if you'd like to be notified when new videos come out i'd love to hear about your results if you try this recipe the caramel not the sugar cube oh that too as well as suggestions for what you'd like to see in future videos fun fact the words caramel and caramel are not interchangeable caramel is a noun that refers to the candy or its color caramel or carmel is a proper noun either the name of a person or a place and now you know i hope you'll join me next time [Music] thanks for the suggestion rick work if there's something you'd like to see me make why can't i do this vanilla paste has the same vanilla flavor as a good extract but it's a little sweeter deuce to juiced ingredient wise you'll need one tablespoon of vanilla paste is a bit of a misnomer though as it's more of it 60 grams or one quarter quarter quarter an eight by eight paint baking ban a picking ban anyway what we call table sugar or granny green green gang form remove the lid and attach a kit remove the lid now just stop anyway let's get moving on the caramel recipe that may or may not have come from mr hershey mr hershey we were doing so well", "gJMEAWMmKoU": "hey chef Kendra here and today we're making caramel Turtles which is caramel with pecans mixed with the chocolate coating we have brown sugar corn syrup and whites your Grande a very clean and dry saucepan we have our pecans chopped and in small pieces we also have cream butter and vanilla we're going to turn the heat on the medium and whisk our fish together when everything is combined when I let it go to 250 degrees on a candy thermometer then we're going to whisk in the pecans and the vanilla after that we're going to whisk in the cream and the butter and we're going to let that go on till reach a temperature of 238 degrees take it off the heat drop in about 2 teaspoons of mixture on a greased baking sheet or a Silpat now we're going to use a product called almond bark but you can find in your baking aisle right near the chocolate chips and whatnots I'm going to use about 8 ounces I'm a bar contains no almonds it's just a more stable mini a warm metal your room temperature chocolate blend we're going to toss them in the microwave for a minute stir then in 30-second intervals until it's melted then we're going to give it a last good robust stir now we're going to dip our cool caramel bits into the almond bark and let the excess chocolate drip off we're going to place them on a rack with something to catch the extra chocolate underneath here I have a baking pan with a Silpat on top and then a cooling rack on top of that they're going to wait about 15 minutes until the chocolate has solidified and then we're going to eat hey guys what's your favorite kind of candy leave a comment below and let me know share like and subscribe oh and why not sign up for my newsletter for exclusive content and giveaways the link is below okay that's about it chef Kendra is out peace you", "5qhY7mhw30g": "We're Adam and Joanne from inspiredtaste.net and welcome to our kitchen.  We're making our chocolate covered caramels.  Before making our salted caramels... we always make sure we have our equipment\nready and all ingredients measured out... here is a loaf pain, we are going to lightly oil it... then we are going to cut a piece of parchment paper... lightly oil that... and then insert that inside the loaf pan... which makes our lives a lot easier when we want to unmold the caramels when we are done. Next for the ingredients, we need to measure a half cup... of heavy whipping cream. Then grab one stick of butter which is also about a half cup... and cut that into eight... equally sized pieces. Add that to a bowl... then add the cream... and place it into the microwave... and cook for about a minute until the\nbutter has melted and the cream is hot... set that aside... and measure out a quarter cup of light corn syrup... and one cup of granulated white sugar. Now grab a small saucepan... add three tablespoons of water to the saucepan... then grab the corn syrup that you just measured out and add that to the saucepan. Next for the sugar... add it, but try your best not to splatter the sugar up the sides of the pan. Then just use a spoon or spatula... to stir the sugar into the water and corn syrup.  Heat to medium... then bring to a boil. Now once it is at a boil we want to make sure there isn't... any sugar crystals stuck to the side of the pan... since this can cause something called crystallization which can make your caramels grainy... and really ruin the texture. To help with this, just cover with the lid for about one minute. Remove the lid and attach a candy thermometer.  You will want to cook the sugar until it reaches 320 degrees F. At this temperature the sugar will take on a light amber color... now we are ready to add the butter and cream mixture from before... add it in small batches then use the candy thermometer to stir it into the sugar mixture.  As you do this the caramel will bubble violently... so you really want to do this slowly and\ncarefully so nothing bubbles over.  Now place the candy thermometer... back on the side of the pan... and cook the caramel to 240 degrees F... this will create a soft caramel. If you want harder caramels... cook to about 245 degrees F.  Now pour the caramel into your prepared loaf pan... and let it sit for about fifteen to twenty minutes.  While you wait it's best to clean your pot and candy thermometer... fill the pot with water, place the candy thermometer into the water... and bring the water to a boil... this will melt away all of the caramel... making cleanup really easy. After about three and a half... to four hours... you'll find that the caramel has set... and we can cut it. We like to cut into one-inch squares... but it's up to you. Next for the chocolate, you need one pound of chocolate. You can use milk, dark... or even white chocolate for this... We like to use semi-sweet. Give it a chop and add to a microwave safe bowl... along with two tablespoons of butter... but reserve about a third cup...  of the chocolate... to add later.  Add the bowl to the microwave and heat for about forty-five seconds.  After forty-five seconds give it a stir. The chocolate won't be melted yet... so you will have to put it back in for another forty-five seconds or so.  Again stir... and continue to do this until the\nchocolate has melted. Now grab the third cup of chocolate from earlier and stir that in. Stir until it is melted and shiny. Now we can coat the caramels... add the caramels one-by-one into the chocolate... then use two forks to pick them up out of the chocolate.  Then place them onto either wax paper or a cooling rack... then top with salt... and set them aside to harden and cool. Enjoy!", "_0SShNhItek": "welcome again to the Kiwi kitchen today I'm going to show you I'm gonna be doing two different things here two different recipes even though they're not recipes they're mainly methods of making butterscotch and making caramel now caramel usually just involves granulated sugar and a little bit of water and you can really adjust the ratio and everyone's got a different ratio some people make caramel just with granulated sugar wait for it to brown and for it to become a liquid form and some people use water I use water so I use two parts granulated sugar to one part water so I'm going to be showing you how to do caramel a simple easy caramel and it's so that you can create kind of crystal caramel pieces for the top of cakes to garnish or even as a sauce if you're looking more for a sauce though I would recommend a butterscotch recipe which involves milk or usually heavy cream but in our case we're gonna be doing a butterscotch with milk and it usually involves an egg yolk for added richness using brown sugar for that deeper molasses flavor so we're gonna be doing both recipes for you today and we're right at the stove here so for the butterscotch you're gonna want a heavy saucepan like one with a heavy bottom preferably because you don't want it to burn I'm figured instead of doing both at once to make things more confusing we're gonna do one at a time so we're gonna start off by doing the butterscotch so it's very easy to do very simple to make what you're gonna want to do is get a saucepan take your brown sugar and again all the recipes are available at bake your way dot-com so take a look at the website and you'll see all the information so you're gonna take your brown sugar and then I've got some butter here and I did add a little bit of shortening because I ran out of butter but I you should definitely use butter if you have it available I'm just gonna grab a spatula there we go I'm gonna add in my egg yolk and about 1 to 2 teaspoons of lemon juice and that will offset the sweetness of with the sugar and the butter and everything it'll come it'll kind of cut back on the richness a bit add a little bit of a pinch of salt so we want that sweet and salty so then we're gonna put this over medium heat and my burner might start ticking it does that a lot and we're just gonna let this get this a bit of a head start before we add in the milk and you want to be swatching this carefully because it can burn very quickly but basically we just want to make sure everything is fully incorporated and then we have all the butter melted and that the sugar dissolves with it in terms of beat the difference and as you can see it's already happening but it's becoming a lot more runny which is exactly what we're looking for this is our base for it we are gonna add in a bit of cornstarch because we're making this without whipping cream whipping cream is kind of what gives you that texture the thickness we have to use a bit of cornstarch to add to that thickness we want from it and you can see already as soon as cornstarch is added into a hot liquid it immediately starts working and immediately thickens up so now that that's done we are going to go ahead and add our milk and like like I've mentioned before the amount of the fat content of the milk is up to you the richness obviously will differ if you want richer you add a bit more if you want it richer you just add a little bit more add like a whole milk or a cream and as I mentioned it does start ticking away so we're gonna let this go for a bit it's gonna take about three to four minutes and after that I will show you the next step mixture has really come really is bubbling this is exactly what we're looking for and we're gonna continue cooking this for a few minutes for it to thicken and you're looking for if you take like a wooden spoon and I can show you take a wooden spoon if you stir it it should it should be quite like it's getting thick as you can see with as it's bubbling that cornstarch is activating and what we're looking for eventually is the butterscotch will remain on a wooden wooden spoon and if you put your finger through it it won't it won't it won't be Merck it'll just mark so I'll show you what I mean in a few minutes so you just want to keep stirring because you want to avoid any burning that might occur absolutely smells delicious and this is a I mean both caramel and butterscotch the very versatile they can be used to garnish or they can be used as a sauce like this is a great for a sauce or even a base for a cake recipe which I can make if you are interested so as you can see it's still bubbling it's probably going to take another three or four minutes you're just going to want to continuously stir until it really thickens and then as soon as it reaches that stage I will show you what it's supposed to look like when it's done and then we will put it away in a container there we go and what you're gonna want to do is cover it and put it in the fridge it will thicken even further you know just as a side note just to caution because we did use an egg yolk it's very important to make sure that there are no lumps so if you feel like you've gotten some lumps you can put it through a sieve and that will make sure that you get any if the if any of the egg yolk curdled that will get it right out there because you don't want that in there sauce so I'm just gonna clean this up and then we will go ahead and start the the caramel best I took a little bit of the butterscotch and I'm going to take a test and tell you what I think that's really nice it's got a very sweet flavor so if you have a big sweet tooth this is really up your alley it does also have a very buttery flavor so it's an absolute perfect way to top like ice cream even a Greek yogurt I think that'd be great if you you know one ice cream something a bit lighter Greek yogurt would work great for that or even as just a topping for a cake great option I hope you give that a try so now we're gonna move on to the caramel and that's the one that's a little bit more you got to be very careful because making caramel is very tedious because you need to watch carefully you're gonna need as I mentioned before the ratio can differ a little bit it's usually with caramel you you you need granulated sugar and water in my case I'm using two parts sugar to one part water and so what I'm gonna do is I have a skillet here and you'll need a skillet try to get the the sugar sprint evenly distributed on the bottom and we're gonna add our water just like a little bit over the top and shake it so that all the all the sugar is moisturized now very important so we're gonna turn on our heat a medium times my burner just doesn't want to turn on okay so here we go very important do not stir it do not touch it but you will shake it at times caramel is very tedious because if it's not worked correctly the sugar and can crystallize and become firm as a rock and you'll be stuck for hours under hot water trying to clean it the other thing too is that caramel can cease quickly basically meaning as soon as you make it if you immediately put it on something cold it will seize up you know firm up and that doesn't work so the key is to make sure you watch it carefully as soon as it becomes runny immediately pour it over whatever it is you're making because if you don't it will harden so I'm just doing a little bit as an example and I can already see the water started to boil now or just sizzle not boil yet what you're going to want to do is just keep watching it because eventually what's gonna happen is it's going to turn brown and I'm going to show you that and it'll take another three or four minutes at least and as soon as it starts to brown you want to keep watching it and keep it on medium heat until it reaches an Amber cup amber caramel color so you can see it's really the heat is really picking up you can give it a few shakes every now and then but we really do not want we don't want the sugar to crystallize that's very important so I'm gonna let this go and I'm going to show you as soon as it starts turning brown turned on my hand because see here the brown color is starting to turn I hope you can see this but you can see here working working the caramel is developing we can see that color change we're on the right track we want to keep watching this until it turns into an amber color and that's take a look at that beautiful color receipt it's immediately turned to a brown color we have our caramel it's outside incredible co2 just granulated sugar and water it's just delicious flavor and this is gonna happen very quickly you can see just just now how much change there's the reason it's very smoky is there's bound to be a few specks of sugar that come up on the ends which causes it to be very smoky and we're almost done we're not quite there yet but we're really close look how dark this corner is we're getting there I've got a piece of parchment paper here on a cookie sheet which I am immediately going to place this caramel because we are just about done just a few more seconds oh yeah here we go this is our amber color this is our signal so I'm immediately going to pour it over onto a piece of parchment paper because as I mentioned before it's going to cease very very very quickly so I'm going to give this a couple shakes don't want it took it is extremely hot I should have mentioned that before as just making sure it didn't go out of the parchment paper be very careful as soon as caramel gets that gets in this way it's extremely hot so be assured a very good proper care make sure that when you spread your caramel appear if you're letting it set to put it on a piece of parchment paper otherwise you will not be able to get it off so we've got our caramel here you can see it I put it on for maybe a little bit too long that's the thing about caramel that's why I usually decided if I want to make something with the caramel typically I use lepra fern butterscotch because it's easier to make and it's not as tedious here you can see for the most part it's said a lot if I lift this sheet it won't do much now you can let it just set the room temperature or put it in the fridge I'm just going to put it aside for now and I'll show you what it looks like later on you", "kIVKLKDbBMg": "so the story behind us is when my husband and I were on our honeymoon in Europe we tried these amazing fresh European caramels and they were so delicious that we brought some back as a souvenir and of course I gave a big to Alicia as well it turns out that Felicia's boyfriend Steve at candy is a caramel and so he tried it he tried to just save one each day to eat but eventually the bag dwindled and so we got the idea of trying to recreate them after hundreds of batches later we finally arrived at what we see today we just thought of what our favorite flavors are of course the bacon is a classic favorite for us and then sriracha almond my favorite spicy sauce is sriracha and then we just thought root beer float would be really fun and then we rolled it into like some Sujatha and so it became this lemon root beer float so it was just a whole lot of fun with us being in the kitchen and just working out things that we already enjoy all of our caramels are handcrafted in small batches so every piece of caramel is made with lots of care and what makes them really unique actually is that they're although there are candy they're not overly sweet they really just melt in your mouth and they don't stick to your teeth which is the best thing about it", "ZU9l4gv0wGE": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]", "Fdw-cA3pBnI": "hey guys look that I'm Christopher pang and you're watching kitchen in on today's episode we are going to be making bourbon sea salt caramels from scratch what a great way to start off your holiday season in some alcoholic candy why not here are a few ingredients that you'll need for this recipe sugar butter bourbon light corn syrup kosher salt flaked sea salt sweetened condensed milk on medium low heat we're gonna add our sugar our light corn syrup and our water we want to bring all this up to a boil and stirring occasionally until all the sugar dissolves while our solution comes to a boil we're gonna cut our cold butter into small cubes and then we're gonna add it into that caramel to stop it from getting a darker color and achieve the deep amber that we want so this is a deep amber color we want so what we want to do now is to take the pot off the stove to slow down the cooking process and by adding our sweetened condensed milk and cold butter that will also assist in stopping and halting the process and all you want to do is so now we want to let it reach 240 degrees on medium-low heat which is also known as a softball stage and it looks like we are now at our softball stage so now we can turn off our heat take that pot off you want to grab a lined baking sheet with parchment paper if you don't have that you can use what I'm doing is a silicon brownie pan and you want to take that hot sugar and please be careful yes I did say it is hot at 240 degrees you don't want to burn yourself you want to just pour that out into the pan or your mat until it's nice and even and just kind of let it cool down it's just slightly before touching okay so finishing all this off I've got some amazing flakes sea salt just sprinkle away and now is the part that's going to socket we've got to wait for these little babies to cool down before I can cut into them wrap them up in my bed so we'll come back in a little bit let these cool down for a few hours and then Oh Oh the only tricky part about Cairo there's a cleanup all right so the camel is going to have to pick it up and cannot work with it so I'm going to cut them up into little bite-sized pieces to wrap them individually and put them into an airtight container you can kind of store these for about two weeks is that a whole bunch pretty sure they're not going to last few days so we are gonna want to flip these out of the mold onto our cutting board I'll just be very careful the caramel is kind of soft and flimsy so we'll just knock them out and flip it back around just make life a little bit easier on ourselves and it smells amazing guys so what we want to do is just cut these into even pieces so I'll start mine in half and I'll just work with one piece at a time all you want to do is grab a piece of parchment or wax paper placing your caramel in the center rolling it up almost like a little gift and feeling it from both sides and there you have it our bourbon sea salt caramels alright now that all my channels are sealed in an airtight container I can keep these up to two weeks like I said before hopefully they'll make it to my party so I hope you guys enjoyed my video if you liked it please give a big thumbs up also please hit subscribe here somewhere down here don't my other social medias the pictures recipes and stuff like that will be in the down below hopefully I'll see you guys soon but the end you've got barbecue sauce caramel I hope you guys enjoyed it bye remember cooking is always fun with others", "oKGUbYFrqD4": "these homemade caramels are specially made by carolyn hazelwood you better grab them before they're gone", "pVhiJz481TM": "everybody it's Chris and Chelsea from TV I love the dance yeah well I wanted to do something new and this intro I like it do the dance one more time the recipe we're gonna be doing today our cannabis infused caramel candies the tools and ingredients you're going to need to make these cannabis infused caramels are a 13 by 9 pan with parchment paper a pretty decently sized saucepan 2 and 1/4 cup brown sugar a pinch of salt I am going to be using pink Himalayan salt you can use pink salt or white soul whatever you prefer one cub light corn syrup 14 ounces of sweet condensed milk extract and all right so for the first thing in this you need to melt your 1 cup can of butter over medium heat that's important so the first thing that we're going to be doing is adding the brown sugar this is the 2 and 1/4 cup brown sugar we're going to all of this in here and we are also going to be adding the salt we were going to mix all of this together really well we need the consistency to be as smooth as possible okay so this is the can of butter or the brown sugar in this salt this is the consistency that we are looking for the next thing we're going to be doing is adding 1 cup light corn syrup and we are going to stir and get this all mixed together really well and the temperature should still be on medium heat next we are going to be adding the 14 ounces of the sweetened condensed milk we didn't mix this all together so this is going to cook between 12 to 15 minutes if you want it to be more of a harder caramel candy cook it for 15 minutes I'm looking for something that's more like chewy caramel candies so I'm gonna cook this for 12 minutes and start your timer after you get the condensed milk in this has been cooking for 12 minutes we are going to stir it just a little bit more now we are going to remove it from heat and add an hour tablespoon of vanilla make sure you get your vanilla mixed in really well and again if you want it to be more of a harder caramel consistency leave it on for 15 minutes instead of 12 and now we are going to transfer it to our baking sheet with our parchment paper I've never seen karma like this canvas and you you don't have to use the parchment paper it just makes cleanup so much easier so I'd recommend it but if you don't have it it's end of the world so this is we're going to let this sit cool for a while then we're going to cut it up into little caramel candy right", "YiQFYurJWsI": "hello in Bougainville ERISA's kitchen next in the candy lineup we have chewy caramel for caramels if you prefer these sweet delicious candies have been a Valentine's Day staple since time immemorial and while they don't take great skill to put together they do take great patience you can see the ingredients for these caramels is very simple we need 1 cup of butter that's two sticks two cups of light cream or you could use half-and-half one cup of light corn syrup and 16 ounces by weight of light brown sugar after this heats through we'll be adding in 1 teaspoon of vanilla and we're also going to need to prepare a nine by nine inch baking pan this is nonstick aluminum foil and I've got the nonstick side the mat side up to make these caramels we combine everything in the pan minus the vanilla all right this is on over medium-high heat we're just going to stir all this together until all of the butter melts and all of the sugar is dissolved okay once this mixture starts boiling we're going to need to clip a candy thermometer to the side we're going to eventually have to cook this until it reaches 248 degrees well that process is going to take about an hour and that's where the patience comes in i'm using a 6 quart saucepan to cook this in and you saw that sugar does boil up quite a ways if you've used a saucepan that's too small and your sugar starts to boil over just leave it turn the burner off and leave it that's over 212 degrees and it's going to be sticky and it's going to burn for a long time so just allow that mass to cool down and then you can go ahead and clean it up this needs to be stirred frequently you can't just walk away from it alright we've reached from ball stage so we're going to turn off the temperature turn off the heat and mix in our vanilla alright let's get this in the pan okay we need to let this set up completely and completely cool that can take close to five hours you okay cut all right let's give these caramels a taste now I know that these are going to be very sticky and I'm not going to be able to say anything they're delicious and they're very chewy", "uLDn-g3VnSA": "okay I'm making cr\u00e8me caramel two cups of sugar I'm doing this because I have half a half it's just the dates just going by so i have to use to happen half and that's what you use almost outdated stuff a cup of brown sugar packed two sticks of butter or a cup of butter put the paper in there cup here okay now we need a two of two cups two cups of half-and-half make some pudding with the rest of that this afternoon and one cup of Cairo concert use a silicone spatula because this is going to get hot it's got to get to die 245 degrees so you're going to bring it to a boil which takes a little while and then you turn it down you cook it while it's boiling until it's about for about 25 minutes until a little drop is dropped into the surface think it's hard we'll do that in a minute a vanilla flavoring at the very end okay so here we go turn it on clean up my mess while it's heating okay so we're gonna get this cooking up here stir it a little bit occasionally until it starts boiling your two cups of sugar 1 cup of brown sugar 1 cup of butter 2 cups of half-and-half and a cup of light corn syrup full up the starting to boil I'm gonna turn mine down about four just keep it boiling and whale it gets up to a different it'll turn different colors and as we do it would be about 25 minutes to stand here and stir this stuff takes forever it is now boiling you can see it's boiling and it'll be a rolling boil it's the color tan right now and it'll keep oil and I keep stirring occasionally and then it will turn a darker darker amber color and then I'll start taking a little bit out and testing it on the counter to see if it forms a softball still boiling spend 15 minutes it is turning a little darker but not quite yet it's still too thin it's got to turn a little darker and get a little thicker spend a long time by about 20 minutes already it's turning a darker brown but not quite yet so I can take some of this drop it in there if it becomes a hard ball in there in that little right here it's not it's still soft it's getting thicker but it's not a that's not hard yet sticking together so it's not ready so you can see how dark it's getting now and how much thicker it's getting now yeah darker thicker much thicker I tend me gotta keep stirring it so it doesn't burn on the bottom but if I take a little bit of this right now and drop it like on my stove and then we'll see if it's hard if it's hard then it's or work or I can make it pliable like putty then it's ready I'm taking it off now see the color and see how it's cooked right down and look how thick it is and I have a little bit i drop it in here it will form a soft ball in the ice because it cools it off and there's the softball I'm going to add a teaspoon of vanilla now and pour into my pan do not get this touch your skin it will burn your skin right off Nats cream caramel", "BHLiDka81AY": "[Music] all right grace a pan really really well with butter you want it grease well because when you pour the caramel and uh oh ok ok ok don't listen all right so you want to get between 240 and 242 degrees exactly if it's less than that it'll be too soft if it's more than that Oh be hard maybe it would have been a good idea to use a bigger pot but you will have to boil constantly or else you'll burn the sugar and or boil it over it's a really slow boiling process you'll get to like 200 and then it just creeps up to 240 but you'll notice it starts to turn tan as it's boiling so apparently snapchatting while you're trying to make our moles or make anything for that matter Dark Matter comes that is burning ok so as you get closer to it being done it's gonna condense so it's not going to be as high as you don't have to worry about it boiling as much and then you just watch that temperature you have to get it exactly too funny so a few things make sure the bottom of the thermometer is not touching the bottom of the pan or else it'll mess up the temperature reading and this is what its gonna look like right before you're done ok I hit my chem picture so I'm just gonna take it off the heat add about a tablespoon of pure vanilla screw daughter don't be tempted and try to lick the spoon right away because you will burn the crap out of your mouth not that I know this from experience or anything we're going to take the caramel and we're going to put them in the paper and then we're gonna wrap it up and tie it just like that [Music]", "ENPCQA8wiFk": "hey good morning everybody this morning I'm going to show you how to make fudgy caramels okay now if you already know how to make caramels I'm starting right at the poor here here are the ingredients they're slightly different from the first batch and if you don't know how to make caramels you should watch my first video and the link is up here now how this recipe came about is while I was experimenting on the first creamy caramel recipe I made a couple of changes in one mistake and it was the result that led to this recipe so the first change was i reduced the amount of salt which I think led to an instability chemically in the candy and second of all there was a little bit of oil on the top so I decided I'll stir that in and one stir led to another in the next scene you know I saw streets forming and there was the fudge okay so how much fudge you want in the caramels depends on how you how much you stir it and I will show you that when I pour in and yes I'll record the poor this time because i missed it in the first one so the cut hot caramel has hit 245 Fahrenheit 818 centigrade and this is what it looks like coming out so this is what I started doing you can see a bit of oil on the top so I was stirring it up now the first time I got a lot of fudge in the caramel and I really did like it so if you're going to do that you try to be even and try to get the corners I'll give you a good close up here so you can see the when a caramel starts to get thicker when you're playing with it and starting to stick on the bottom yeah you can see it's starting to set up here and when you can see streaks on the top of the caramel the fudge will set pretty quick okay so what you do is just get spoon out of the pan and just wait this is about a minute or so later and when you can see the printouts streaking on the top and the difference is in color that means it will definitely come out fudgy so it's been a couple hours caramel is definitely sent okay so I cut that open and cut off a piece to test it and I'll just cut this as well so you can see that the majority to this has turned to fudge there are still some streaks of caramel through it I did stir it up quite a bit now like I said at the beginning if you stir it up a lot you'll get nearly pure fudge and if you only stir it till you got a couple of streets you'll get mainly caramel and just some fudge so you do have some control over this recipe okay like if you look at the edges here it's still pretty chewy there okay well there is my fudgy caramel recipe thanks for watching and hope see you again", "7gIsssZ5Uwo": "hi I'm Caroline and welcome to cooking with Caroline in a large heavy pot put two cups of heavy cream you're going to use a medium high heat and a candy thermometer add 1 cup of corn syrup one-half cup of apple juice two cups of white sugar one stick or eight tablespoons of butter Smosh that around again on medium-high heat and for some reason I forgot to film adding in one cup of dark brown sugar you should do that add 1 cup of dark brown sugar the temperature will rise quickly you want to bring it to 244 degrees it will rise it will plateau and then we'll start rising again the whole thing takes about four to five minutes as you can see this is a 230 degrees and it's gotten much much thicker the instant it turns to 244 bring it off the heat and place it on your counter like hey I have here on a hot pad because it's extremely hot then you're going to add in 1 teaspoon of salt and I'm just going to take that thermometer out of the way then one-and-a-half teaspoons of cinnamon one-half teaspoon of nutmeg one-half teaspoon of ginger using a wooden spoon just mix it and incorporate all of that then I'm going to place that into a unprepared silicon 8 by 8 brownie pan like I said it's unprepared I haven't had to do anything to it just dump your caramel into it careful it's very hot very heavy if you're using a metal pan you will want to butter and put a piece of parchment paper in the pan so you can get the caramel out at the end then you just need to let this sit on the counter and I moved it onto the stem in part of the counter so it was a little bit cooler for about six hours after that as you can see with the silicone it just simply pops right out you just pull the two sides away flip it over and it just falls right out then you're going to use a nice heavy knife into between eight and ten strips it's very thick so go carefully and make sure that you know where your fingers are so push and um then you give it a little wiggle in it it punched pops right off the cut edge is a little bit sticky but the other edges are not then cut each of the strips into 16 bite-sized pieces and you're going to want to put them so that they're not touching each other and then cut up some small pieces of parchment paper to wrap them each in as you can see i left them touching each other and they kind of stuck to each other but they're fairly easy to pull apart and they're very stall they're not super soft but they are still soft at this point to as you about to see I can squeeze it into the shape that I want so it fits better on to my parchment paper and then you just roll it up and push the two ends and there you have a whole hours and hours of fun because you're going to get a whole bunch of pieces of candy and now a taste test our yummy yummy apple pie caramels cinnamon nutmeg ease Apple II yumminess", "FdCn7vx2zDw": "okay I'm making some candy today it's absolutely delicious I'm going to be making candy with cashews cream caramel topped with milk chocolate so first of all I'm gonna get my caramels going because they take forever to make so the first thing is I'm gonna put a half a stick of butter in a pan half a stick of butter okay half a stick of butter that looks like a half a stick of butter okay uh see I'm actually measuring today well close to measuring heavy cream a cup of heavy cream please I'm just trying to uh make sure these uh I made them the other day and they came out so good and I can't remember what I did so I'm gonna try to do it today and hopefully hopefully it'll get close to what I did the other day okay a half a cup of white cream that's a couple light cream yes I know this is a cup but I'm just I only did a half of one of that half a cup of brown sugar brown sugar now this kind of been old brown sugar so it's kind of hard so I gotta get it soft a little bit most people throw it out when it's like this but there's nothing wrong with it the only thing is is that it's gotten uh dry so it's kind of chopped okay huh okay half a cup of brown sugar okay well I'm gonna approximate this but it's a half a cup of brown sugar so okay topping brown sugar you squeeze it together if it's gonna be packed brown sugar half a cup of brown sugar it's about a half a cup of brown sugar she's got a mess okay [Applause] yeah I make a big good half cup okay next is uh wrote this down okay a half a cup of uh you know this Tupperware is like 40 years old and it finally broke well 40 years ago they guaranteed they had replace them I don't know feel replace it I mean no Tupperware still in business anyway okay so we're gonna put in here we're gonna use up a half a cup of sugar okay half a cup of sugar 1/2 a cup of sugar regular sugar and now okay look it's a mess mess mess don't waste that okay okay okay now I'll put some corn syrup corn syrup that looks pretty good looks about hopefully that's gonna work okay corn syrup a quarter of a cup of corn syrup yes here's a quarter of a cup but I don't want to make a mess so I'm just gonna do it this way a quarter of a cup that's a quarter of a cup okay I'm gonna bring it over here to the stove put in the stove put it on high until it comes to the boiling and then we're gonna turn it down we'll stir it until it starts to boil okay this is just starting to boil so I'm going to turn down to low and I'm gonna just let it sit there do its thing cuz it's got to get up to 250 degrees or something around there so when I drop a little bit in the iced water it turns into a soft soft little ball in the meantime I'm taking my little pan here now I use this because it's easier otherwise I put a parchment paper down and put the pecans and whatever on that because cashews cashews now I'm using cashews or unsalted cashews wowthat's is going to town in it Wow okay I'll be fine ah now I just got these at BJ's warehouse lovely great store I think these are like $17 for two and a half pounds of a whole unsalted cashews amazing price that's to note that you can get and they're delicious so what I'm gonna do is first of all I'm gonna spray this pan so nothing sticks there's nothing worse than having candy stuck do I need to take this at under that's a Teflon coated pan but I'm gonna I'm gonna spray it lightly she's slightly lightly way up there very lightly very lightly [Music] okay so don't leave it unattended and not stirring it I can't use this burner now because it's a sugar and that will burn into my stovetop okay after that disaster I'm gonna stir it up every so often just so it won't go over the sides again because it just boiled over and it took me forever to just clean myself and I asked so now it's all cleaned again nice clean stove again supplier and thank goodness I don't think it it ate into the glass but sugar when it gets on your stove will eat right into your glass and Bruce told me just tell me he says we're not getting another stove top okay so we're not getting him the stove top anyway so I got it I'm low now and if I see it boiling over I will stir it down so now I'm going to be putting a cashew if I sprayed this a little bit I'll put it in cashews in each one of these how many caches I don't know you want a good chunk of candy maybe three four cashews cover the five of the caches next thing up a cashews all righty gee I got the big got the big ones I'll put some of the little ones with the big ones little pieces it's like the cashew siaka keine somebody else get all pieces instead of nice whole cashews oops it's not the pieces that I put some real cashews in there some of the people Bruce eat I guess he leaves just a little bit up he doesn't like the little bits of pieces in the bottom of the cashews so he leaves them I don't know does that look peanuts - peanuts look pretty good that's pretty good come on enough with cashews so they taste really good okay I came up with this idea because my daughter is allergic to pecans and so most the time these are made with pecans I've never seen them a with cashews so here we are we're all set now make sure everybody got enough cashews and once the caramel is done we'll pour the caramel on top there and then we're going to put some of this delicious from Trader Joe's milk chocolate this whole bar is a seventeen point six ounce and I think it's $5.99 at Trader Joe's it's the most delicious milk chocolate so now here we're gonna this isn't even come back up to uh boiling yet so once it boils and we're just gonna stir it occasionally and uh not now that it's kind of cooking like that you don't stir very much you don't want to stir it very much because the cashews are there and the chocolate pieces I got 20 24 23 1 2 4 6 x 4 24 pieces of chocolate cut out out of the bar and when I put the caramel in there then I'll put that thing on there and I'll put them all on the oven on just warm so the chocolate will melt so now it's just a matter of waiting for this to what now it's you stir on the edge that's it stir on the edge once across the bottom and see how thick it's getting it's getting thick not thick enough yep but see it's just the ups getting a little thicker I'm gonna turn my heat off so I don't burn the bottom of the pan with a heat coming up and down and this will just keep it keep it going here a little bit more and here's the latest one and that is a soft ball stage yes that is soft ball stage this one wasn't quite but there's the two softballs there there [Music] now okay you want to keep it right on that heat just to keep it going and I'm going to spoon out now into each pocket here mm ah maybe one more one more known hard nah me yet come on no no no perfect okay hot hot don't touch me don't touch me girls okay okay don't eat it either too hot okay don't eat it don't put your fingers to it I know the natural tendency is to just to taste it lick your fingers whatever don't do it don't do it see I got a little extra piece right yeah okay now while they're still hot like that and they are hot don't think they're not hot so bad dated we're gonna try to put them all equal now you stick your finger chocolate on the top of our do I want the whole chocolate yeah whole chocolate on the top of each one yes these are candy set will last you a day it's like a whole candy bar okay I put the candies in the oven for six minutes at 150 just to get the chocolate soft and now I want to do I'm gonna take it because it doesn't like that doesn't look very pretty like that now I'll just just make a swirl on the top of them just so it doesn't look like there's a chunk of chocolate sitting on the top of it it's easier this way in the oven then to melt the chocolate and coat them yourself cuz now you can actually just coat him yourself by smashing them around the little tops there we go alrighty now I will cool those and they will be I think I'll put them in the refrigerator probably what a freezer down beef even closer and Queen clean immediately and make it quicker so I can eat one okay they've been in the freezer for a while and now I'm taking them out and trying to get them out of this pan now the thing is is it's tough to get them out of this pan so you can either push if you don't use this pan and you use silicone containers be a lot easier or if you put everything on a cookie and a piece of the paper they're parchment paper otherwise you're gonna put them in here like this and you pop them out they pop out then I'm putting them in a little individual snack bags already ate one Bruce Tony ate one that's why they're put in here and then put them and then snap it out there's the there it is beautiful put them in the refrigerator or yeah cuz it's hot right now so I'm gonna put them the refrigerator that's it", "rLcoy3mwxiw": "alright the caramel is just about done here probably another five minutes or so but it'll be done soon natal it's very thick its condensed quite a bit it's much more lava like if you can read that it's about it's almost at 2:30 I still have about 12 degrees more to go again I'm trying to get to that softball mark which is 240 degrees because remember my thermometer is 4 degrees on the cold side which means that it's 4 degrees hotter than it's reading so I'm gonna actually stop recording as I found that the last 10 degrees can go pretty fast especially when it starts getting the last 5 degrees so I'm gonna stop recording and I'll tell you what I'll do in the meantime I pre measured my vanilla right there it's about a about a teaspoon of vanilla and when this hits the correct temperature that I want I will take it off the heat move it over here and I will mix in the vanilla with that spatula and then I will dump it into here and you got to dump it pretty quick you don't want the caramel to cool and then dump it on top again as the caramel we'll have two different consistencies so try and dump it all in one go if you can I like to dump any extra caramel it's usually two tablespoons worth for me I like to dump any extra icing paper you can have letting out or something and you can eat that pretty quickly so alright so that's what I'm gonna do so the next time you see the caramel it will be in here okay so the caramels are all wiped out of here once the thermometer hit the correct temperature I poured it in and scooped it out with the spatula again I did mix a teaspoon of vanilla in right before I poured it in and as I was saying that's the extra caramel that I'll get to snack on while this is cooling so this will cool pretty fast and if I want to cool it faster I can stick it in the freezer or outside if it's winter out but this is probably 3/4 of an inch thick and this will cool I'll let this cool overnight you can let it cool about two hours in a cooler location and it will it should harden up and be fine to eat I believe it was have to test it but this makes going to 244 degrees makes a pretty good consistency for caramel it's not to super gooey chewy and it has a little bit of a bite which I really like so here is the finished batch of caramel cooling and we are gonna try to make or we will make that'll be our finished product right there all wrapped up and ready to go these are chocolate dipped with salt and those are just caramels wrapped up so I'll go over that tomorrow and I do that but this is the final step for now okay so the caramel has cooled overnight and I have just taken it out of this came out very easily remember this was buttered and it had parchment paper underneath the caramel it lifted right out and I flipped it over and this is what it looks like you can see it's about 3/4 inch thick and it is it will press under my finger it is not so hard will it where it won't budge but it will it will budge under the weight of my finger when I press on it so it's a good it's a good consistency it won't the caramel won't sink on you when you're cutting it it cuts pretty easily so now I'm just gonna cut the caramel into pieces and then I will start wrapping or dip them in chocolate so I'm cutting the Carnales I just wanted to show you this seems to work pretty well cut little strips of caramels off the end and I kind of outlined it with my knife see if I can zoom in here I'll line it with my knife to make it as straight as possible and then I do a few of them and then I cut them into rows and columns and they come out pretty nice and I do actually like to have a little bit of variation in size these end ones are pretty small these ones are like medium these ones a little larger and that's just because different people like different amounts of good and chewiness in their mouth not everyone likes a huge job of chewing this so yeah experiment with the size that that fits you best cutting different shapes this is my little helper here not quite sure what he's up to alright so a lot of my caramels are cut up I'd say about two thirds so you can see how many caramels this actually makes see compared to my hands I mean these aren't small caramels by any means now what I'm gonna do I could just wrap them up from here but I'm actually gonna add chocolate to them so I've got a double boiler going here just a pot with a bowl on top and I've got these dark melting waivers from Ghirardelli for candy making and dipping and I'm actually the flavors really good on these the wafers themselves that kind of look kind of like this they taste really good but yeah they work really well wait till you know mix it up wait till it's nice and runny chocolate and then dip them in there with a fork so I'll tell you or I'll show you how to do that in a minute alright folks my chocolate is all melted it's very runny and this is the consistency you want I'm trying to stir it around so you can see it's just it's it's pretty liquidy I recommend the melting wafers because it already has oil or some type of hard oil mixed mixed into it and what I mean by hard boil is when it's at room temperature it's a solid if you just tried chocolate chips by themselves I found that they're pretty stiff and it it makes a very very chocolaty caramel so if you like that go for it but I actually like the chocolate coating to be a little bit thinner I think you could probably remedy it with regular chocolate chips if you just add some shortening don't add butter because butter has water in it and it will seize your chocolate so I ran into that problem once all right so I'll show you how I do this I already got a couple few dip there and I've got my little salt dish there ready for pinching salt on top so drop my caramel in I just kind of roll it around with my fork until it's coated on all the edges I like to try and get the top of my caramel on the bottom side of my fork and then I just tap it and let all that excess chocolate come off I'm gonna bring it over here and I'm going to flip it over and just kind of let it fall off the fork which it will do eventually and the less slided you have you can see it a little bit right down at the bottom there it's lit a little bit this one's a better example that way to make a better looking caramel you don't want that so be cautious of that and I like to put wax paper on a pan because the caramels will slide around so be careful with that if you just have it on wax paper on the countertop if you're just gonna leave them there that's fine but okay now I'm gonna add a pinch of salt to the tops of these and you do have to do it you know after every 4 or 5 caramels otherwise the chocolate will dry up actually this one may have already dried but yeah I just do it to what you think looks good and kind of copy the candy shops you may have seen these at so there you have it chocolate-covered caramels with salt on top you can use flakes salt like a sea salt I couldn't find that out was that target and all they have is a coarse kosher salt which looks like this so of course kosher salt kosher salt tastes wonderful and these little caramels are really delicious all right I'll do a bunch more and then I'll video again so these caramels are all finished here and they are drying they already have the salt on there like you saw me do earlier and one batch makes quite a bit of caramel so this is just a little bit of the batch here while this is like two-thirds of the batch here and then if we go over here I wanted some regular caramels too so I cut these up a little bit larger and I'm wrapping them so you can see here it's like a little professional candy I'll show you how to wrap them here well I'm not sure if I'll be able to wrap them but anyway good squares if you can see I use wax paper and I cut a bunch of them out in the beginning and they're like I don't know like 3 by 3 or 4 by 4 squares so you just wrap them up and then when you twist the ends make sure that the ends go either both forward or both backward and that way when you pull on both the ends the caramel will twist out alright I hope you've enjoyed making caramel with me today and until next time you", "I0xAz9K3gMQ": "hello I'm here at the chromosome doily shop in Soho and one of my favorite flavors in the world is caramel I can pretty much eat caramel in any form at all like hard candy caramels and liquid caramel sauce and spung sugar but I think my favorite way to eat caramel is chewy salted caramels and lucky for you guys I've got a brilliant recipe which I'm about to share with you now let's go so we're making caramels it's really important to have everything ready because we're getting into really hot temperatures and very specific temperatures as well and so you don't really faffing around halfway through trying to measure stuff out when you're just at the right temperature and because you're going to ruin your caramel so the first thing we do is get on gradients measured so I have three hundred and sixty grams of double cream a teaspoon of vanilla extract a teaspoon of sea salt flakes three hundred and sixty grams of golden syrup 420 grams of caster sugar and 120 grams of chopped unsalted butter and once you have all your ingredients ready then it's time to prepare the tin now I'm using a six and a half by ten and a half inch tin just about an inch high and you need to line this with foil and it's really important to get the for the right way up if you put it the shiny side up then all your caramels going to stick to it and this happened to me recently you have to pick it off and it takes absolutely ages so don't do that put it with the dull side up and make sure you press it in really really well and once all your foil is really snug in your tin you then need to grease it really lightly using a kind of flavorless oil like vegetable oil or ground nut oil something similar to that it's important to make sure you cover all the sides in the bottom but be careful not to use too much oil because you don't want it to be swimming and oil when you put it out so just so you know I've put the butter in the fridge so there's nice and cold for when we use it now we're going to get on with heating the cream I'm going to heat the cream to almost boiling point and the reason for this is we're going to add it to a really really hot caramel so if it's a bit warm it helps with the bubbling I mean it's always going to bubble because you're adding like sort of slightly cooler stuff to really really hot stuff but this just helps it not kind of explode out the pan so I'm just going to pull that straight into my saucepan and add my vanilla and then 3/4 of my teaspoon of salt and that goes on a medium to high heat to almost boiling point all right that's this I'm just gonna pop a lid on to that and put it to one side for later and now I'm going to bring in my big saucepan now I'm making quite a lot of caramel today you can make less obviously all you need to do is maybe half the recipe so just divide all the ingredients in half you might need a smaller tin or otherwise you're going to have quite flat caramel but I'm making quite a bit and I've got this nice big saucepan and I've got my sugar or candy thermometer already in place and I'm going to put my golden syrup in first and then on top of that I'm going to put my sugar and I'm just going to turn the heat on to medium to high now obviously it's really really important that you don't go off and pop out to the shop or walk the dog or anything like that don't stray too far from your saucepan because it's really important to get it to 155 degrees C and no hotter and obviously you don't want to be out of the room in the Louvre or whatever answering the door when that happens because it's game over for your caramel it's going to take about 8 to 10 minutes to get to where it needs to be which is 155 degrees C and you can give it a stir every now and then with your heatproof spatula or wooden spoon make sure it's a nice long handled wooden spoon or spatula because this does create quite a lot of steam at one point and you don't wanna have your hands stuck in there when it happens okay it's there so I'm just going to turn the heat off and slowly pour my cream in stirring at the same time you see how steamy it is I'm just blowing out of the way so it doesn't go all over my hands so keep stirring until all the bubbles have subsided and then it needs to go back on the heat and you need to get that back up to 127 degrees C so this takes about 8 to 10 minutes as well so just like before don't go anywhere don't go too far don't start putting rollers in your hair or doing your nails really important that you stay close to this to make sure it gets to the right temperature and while it's doing that I've just taken my butter out the fridge that I've got that to hand when I need it right it's there so I'm turning the heat off and I've got my butter ready to go and I'm just gonna plop that in and give it a really good stir it's bubbling quite ferociously so I'm just stirring and stirring and stirring and I want to keep doing that to all the bubbles have stopped and once it's all smooth you just pour that into your prepared tin and let it level itself out now it's got a few air bubbles it's quite hot so be careful but you see to give it a little bang on the surface just to bring all the bubbles to the surface and while it's still wet I'm just going to get the last quarter of a teaspoon of sea salt and just sprinkle it over the top and then just leave that to cool completely that's going to take about an hour or maybe even more than that my caramel is completely cool to the touch no wok at all so now it's time to reveal it and chop it up so I'm just going to turn it upside down onto a sheet of greaseproof paper so doesn't stick to the surface and once you've got your tin off just really gently pull off the foil and if you've done it the right way around it should be fairly easy if there's any bit sort of stuck and a little bit difficult to remove just use a knife to kind of push down on the caramel and pull this foil off so now I'm left with this beautiful slab of delicious looking caramel obviously that's rather large piece for my mouth I could give it a go but probably it wouldn't work so I'm going to chop this into bite-sized pieces and I also have already cut some greaseproof paper into little squares so that I can wrap them up all neat and tidy and I can give them to people or just keep me in a cupboard for myself so make sure you're using a really really sharp knife and I'm using this guy it's I've also oiled it a little bit and I'm not chomping down I'm kind of drawing the point of the knife along otherwise it really sticks to it and once you've cut it into strips you then need to cut it into little bite-sized pieces and then getting your little squares of greaseproof paper just wrap those up and twist the end now the best bit about making caramel is obviously the eating part which does take a while because everything's no hot for such a long time it goes oh we are me mm-hmm oh yeah it's perfectly chewy just enough sticking to my teeth hmm I really hope you made this for me and bring them to me all the time bye thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this video I've certainly enjoyed it because it means now I have a mountain of caramels to eat breakfast lunch and dinner the next week and I'll be back next week with another recipe where these guys are the heroes so don't forget to tune in and if you do make anything from my channel then please take a picture and hashtag using the words cupcake Gemma see you soon bye", "I7DMjTojmqM": "So today we're making chocolate turtles and\nwe're starting with three simple ingredients. I have melted chocolate. I have a homemade caramel, which is basically\njust sugar, water, corn syrup, and a little bit of heavy cream and salt, and pecans, which\nare kind of the main part of the chocolate turtle. So what I'm going to do is start by just doing\na nice cluster of pecans on pieces of parchment paper. Or you can work on a sil pad if you have a\nnice non-stick baking mat. That's great too. But just nice clusters of pecans. And this is going to make it really easy. If I were to add my pecans into my caramel\nwhat could happen is, it could get too cold too fast, so this is a good way of making\nsure and get nice even clusters without having to worry about my caramel. And just with my spoon I'm going to take a\nlittle bit of caramel and just drizzle right over my pecans. And that caramel is going to kind of act as\nglue. Make nice little candies. Just a little caramel drizzle right over. Now I think they're called turtles because\nthey're supposed to look like turtles. If you use the halved pecans, the big whole\nones you can make turtle leg shapes coming out the side with caramel in the middle and\nthose are really cute. But all I'm going to do for these are, I'm\ngoing to let the caramel set up and get nice and hard. And in the meantime I'm going to take a little\nbit of chocolate, so my melted chocolate here, and just right over the top. A nice spoonful of chocolate. You don't want to put too much. We're really keeping it nice and tight. And to finish it off, if you so desire, I\nhave a little bit of flaked sea salt. Just a little sprinkling of salt right on\nthe top so they'll get a nice kick. So I finished up my turtles and I have a little\nsea salt on the top. I'm just going to either let them sit at room\ntemperature until they harden up. The caramel should be nice and firm, chocolate\nshould be set, not sticky to the touch. And then they're ready to go. If you're really impatient, pop one in the\nfreezer and in about two minutes you have perfectly homemade candies. That's how you make chocolate turtles.", "u4P8xwS3IAg": "caramel is a really versatile building block for dozens of different desserts making your own Cromwell's a really simple process but there are a few pitfalls to watch out for one is the kernelization of the sugar which can cause the mixture to solidify and the second is either under cooking or over cooking your caramel in this video I'll show you how to make a basic caramel that's perfectly cooked as well as how to transform it into a delicious and easy caramel sauce now for my setup I have a pastry brush with some water and a 2 quart saucepan for the caramel I'm going to start with 1 cup of sugar a quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of lemon juice this is going to help prevent the caramel from crystallizing and seizing up as it cooks so the first thing I'm do is just use my pastry brush and just wipe down the sides of the pan getting any little sugar crystals that are on the side of the pan you want to wash those down ok that looks good and I'm going to place this over medium-high heat and bring it up to a boil now you don't want to stir your caramel as it cooks that can cause crystallization so you just want to occasionally swirl the pan just like this now this method is called a wet caramel because we're adding the water there's also a method called a dry caramel where you don't add any water it cooks a little bit faster but you run the risk of scorching your sugar so the water is going to help to prevent that so basically we're just letting that water cook off and then the sugar is going to start to caramelize ok so now that my mixtures come to a boil I'm going to let it continue cooking until it starts to get a little color and I'll go back in there with my wet pastry brush and just continue to wash down the sides every now and then and again you don't want to stir but you can give the pan a little swirl okay so it's just starting to change color a little bit around the edges and in a few spots so at this point you just want to give the pan a little swirl to start to even out the color and this is the time when you really want to watch your caramel because if you step away it can go from undercooked to burnt really quickly so just keep an eye on it and keep swirling the pan now you can test your caramel by playing a little drop on a white plate so I'll show you what it looks like at this point so this as you can see is really light this is going to have very little of that bittersweet caramel flavor that we're looking for just a few seconds later and it's a little bit darker this is a light caramel again we don't really use caramel at this stage it's not going to have the complexity that we're looking for the darker caramel goes the more complexity it's going to have now we have a medium amber this is what you'll use for caramel sauce or a lot of different recipes that we have on our website and watch closely and pay attention because in just a few seconds we're going to have a dark amber and here we have a dark amber now this is what you would use for creme caramel or anywhere where you want a really assertive strong caramel flavor now when you're at the point you want you want to remove your pan from the heat and you want to use your caramel right away because it hardens up rather quickly one of the easiest things to do with your batch of caramel is to make a caramel sauce so I've got a new batch that I've started and it's at the medium amber stage so at this point I'm going to pull it off the heat and add 3/4 of cup of heavy cream now you want to stand back because it will splatter a little bit in caramel is very hot and I'm going to put it back on the heat and you can stir it at this point with the wooden spoon and you'll notice that some of it starts to seize up but as it melts it'll get nice and smooth now to finish the caramel I'm going to add two tablespoons of butter I'm just going to add it slowly I've cut it up into small pieces and I'll add just a few at a time and then stir it in to melt beautiful once the butter is all melted the last thing to add is a teaspoon of vanilla extract mmm this smells like heaven this is perfect for drizzling over ice cream over fruit or basically in any kind of chocolate dessert", "Y-bQec5kZ7g": "it's all about lots of butter lots of cream really caramelized sugar and a pretty good hit of cecil welcome to helly mae salt caramels and everybody has that little dream in their heart like oh I've liked it up in a restaurant or food business but what what was really the thing that made the difference for me was getting me to take the lead that was my husband saying you want to do this you make these carnivals people are crazy about them they hide them from their co-workers they freak out when you bring them to the office you should give it a try my name is Ellen day neck and I own helly mae is salt caramels the thing that I love in a caramel is for it to be really dark and really intense he'll amazed as a brand is all about intensity of flavor big flavors that knock you back and kind of leave you reeling a little bit because my name is Ellen is what we call me Ellie May but when I was thinking about what to call the cattle business I wanted this sense of kind of a little bit old-fashioned but also a little bit more modern and if you put an h in front and we have helly mae assault camels I don't know it just feels a little bit more like me we are in lakewood colorado in my commercial kitchen which i sometimes call the heli maze factory caramels are pretty labor-intensive because there are a small batch product because they're handcrafted it's just me at the stove making caramel the foundation of heli maze and the majority of the caramels that people buy is the classic salt flavor it's a very traditional butter caramel much darker and more intense than most caramels finished with a crunchy flaky sea salt making helena is salt caramel starts with cane sugar pure water a little bit of corn syrup and crystallization I turn on the stove fire the heat up to caramelize the sugar at the same time measure out the unsalted butter heavy cream put that over gentle low heat to bring it up to a warm temperature one of the things that's a little bit different about these caramels from other ones is that they have a lot more butter and a lot more cream so they're very creamy and soft and fresh when you bite into them it's important that you have the best butter in the best cream possible so I use unsalted butter hormone-free really high quality and then for the cream I use hormone-free cream and it's not even just heavy cream it's what's called manufacturing cream so it has an even higher fat content than most heavy cream so now that it's been meeting for about 20 minutes on the stove the thickness of this sugar and corn syrup and water mixture is much thicker because a lot of the water has bubbled off so it's much more viscous the first period of time is really all about losing the water now we're going to see the sugar actually start to caramelize you can see it's getting just a little bit yellow and the bubbles are getting really big and slow okay we're there so I'm going to turn off the heat and now I'm gonna pour all of the melted butter and the melted cream in that's going to bubble up pretty dramatically I just poured in a bunch of butter creams I want to make sure that it's really well distributed throughout here I don't want a little pockets of butter in the caramel when I used to be in consulting no one ever said hey can I come over and watch you sell consulting services on the phone but now that I'm in the food business they all want to come over and hang out hey can I come watch you what make caramels sure because it's interesting everybody can relate to food it's this very tangible tactile thing that is also kind of emotional and you know it's not like I'm making preserved fish caramel smell pretty good when they're cooking the other I've added the butter and the cream I'm not so concerned about the color because I can rely on temperature as my indicator for when they're ready so I'm going to take the temperature of this mixture periodically and I'm aiming for about 235 240 degrees that's going to give me a caramel that soft but still holds its shape and is a nice cohesive candy once you put the candy you pour the hot bubbling caramel into silicone molds leave them to cool for about six hours depending again on the temperature of the room because I make my caramel with so much butter fat there's so much butter and so much cream they're very soft they have this crystal and sea salt from Cypress sprinkled on top when you bite into them you get a nice textural contrast between the crunch of the salt and then the creaminess of the caramel and the salt has this little bit of a saline sweetness almost about it which interacts really nicely with the deep dark caramel flavor of the Carnales themselves you fight through the crunch of the salt and then there's the creamy caramel these caramels are molded and then wrapped by hand and packaged by hand in boxes so how amazed salt caramels year round has three varieties classic salt coffee and cardamom I also do seasonal varieties in the fall Apple at Christmastime candy cane and in the spring jasmine tea when you bite into a homemade caramel and you may get notes of chocolate and coffee and frisky that's just because the caramel is so dark and the sugar has been caramelized so much so if you looked at my history you would not say oh this is a food person I went to college and studied political science i worked as a demographer i went to business school I was a consultant but all throughout I've always liked food I've always liked I brought people together I was never a particularly good cook and about 15 years ago I decided to learn to cook and that kind of started me along the path that ended up with Holly maze now when people ask me about you know what is it in your background that really made you think i'm going to start this caramel business my answer is nothing what it took was my husband saying to me in the car you know us all those caramels it just it net it seriously it would have never occurred to me if he had not pointed that out you", "kfMSAqzqFJk": "hi guys so today we are making caramel brownies I like these better than normal brownies because they have an extra sweetness the ingredients are 8 ounces of chocolate 3/4 of a cup of unsalted butter 2 and a half cups of sugar 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract for lunch eggs 1 cup of flour and 1 teaspoon of salt I'll also need some caramel if you choose to add it at the end over powder blending water you're going to need a bowl to melt the chocolate and butter stir until combined take the bowl off the heat and add in the sugar in a separate bowl crack the eggs add the vanilla and then stir into the bowl next add in the flour and salt you'll need a rectangular pan and you are going to watch butter or spray a nonstick spray the pan so that's the brownie will not stick if you want to add the caramel and this is the time to do it so I took the caramel and I put it in a bag and squeezed it out so that it can be spread out easily preheat to 347 degrees and cook for 25 to 30 with it when the brownies are done cooking faked out the oven and let it cool all you need to do now is cut the brownies into small pieces and enjoy better cup Oh where's the sugar we installed it", "oVsVMBy_p1g": "chocolate caramel and coffee can you honestly think of a better combination now to start off with we're going to need some coffee now there's two ways you can do this you can use instant coffee and you only need about a tablespoons worth and you can just choose that as a powder form that's fine or you can forget my route and if you have fresh brewed coffee that you can make at home that's always preferable that comes down to personal taste and what equipment that you have so instant coffee is perfectly fine but if you have an espresso machine Wahb then make up the shot of espresso [Music] [Music] okay next I've got a pot on the stove on a medium to high heat so to that I'm going to add in one cup of thickens cream or whipping cream or double cream and then to that our table spoon or a shot of espresso and a quarter teaspoon of vanilla extract and we're just going to keep on stirring this until it comes up to the boil now we don't want to boil it away but we want it to start bubbling so as soon as it gets to that bubbling stage when it's just starting to boil that's when we take a straight off the heat okay so as you can see it is just starting to boil away now so take it straight off the heat okay so while it's still hot we're going to add four ounces or about a hundred ten grams of chopped up chocolate or chocolate chips and we're just going to stir that through until the chocolate is completely melted so we're basically making it can - now look at that as nicely mixed and tell you what it smells delicious - so have a nice smooth chocolate okay next I've got a pot on the stove on a medium to high heat so I'm going to start off by adding one cup of sugar followed by about three-quarters of a cup of glucose syrup it's also called corn syrup to make it easier to pour I've had it in the microwave for about 20 seconds followed by a quarter cup of water next we're going to stir it into the sugar is completely dissolved and everything's nice and combined and then we've got to bring it up to a high heat until it starts to boil okay so it's nice and clear everything is dissolved in it's starting to boil now just with a pastry brush just brush around the outside just put some water it'll just stop any crystals from forming around the pot and now we're going to continue to cook the sugar until it comes up to a nice amber color and it starts to slightly smoke and you'll also notice the bubbles have slowed down dramatically too [Music] okay so as you can see stomach up to that amber color that means we take it straight off the heat you can also tell the bubbles of slowed as well now we're just going to let it sit off the heat until we get to the desired level of caramelization the lighter color will give you a sweeter carrot ball while a darker color will give you a more of a bitter caramel at this point it honestly just comes down to personal taste now once you're happy with your caramelization we're going to pour in our chocolate mixture then just give it a quick mix to combine now placed it back onto a high heat then we're going to continue to cook this up until it gets to 248 degrees Fahrenheit or about a hundred and thirty degrees Celsius no I don't want to use a candy thermometer you know they're very cheap you can also buy a normal thermometer as long as it gets to the right temperature now once so they're on temperature we're going to work quickly we're going to add about three tablespoons of butter then give it a very good mix until the butter is completely dissolved in our mixture and as soon as the butters dissolved take it straight off the heat now finally off the heat we're going to add in a quarter teaspoon of salt and just give it a very good mix through and this will really help enhance those lovely coffee chocolate and caramel flavors [Music] at last I've got a baking pan here lined with a baking paper or parchment paper so to simply pour in our caramel mixture [Music] now once of the pan just simply place it into the fridge for about two to three hours to completely set okay so I'll chokolate espresso caramel has completely set as you can see says just a simple matter of just pulling it out over our baking tray and simply just cut it up to our desired shapes and it cuts surprisingly easily it's not overly sticky which is good [Music] and surprisingly you can smell the caramel straightaway the Karen will mix it with the coffee I seriously cannot wait to try one of these [Music] and would you look at that it just looks like one big block of chocolate but let's see what they like oh that is really good the coffee and caramel is a perfect combination now it's not an overly hard caramel which is good so it's not toffee it's still soft but very very chewy so honestly it's turned out perfect now especially when you mixes my two favorite ingredients caramel and coffee it really is a perfect combination so as you could see it was very simple to make they can make it thicker than this if you like I don't think you want to go much thinner at the moment it kind of looks like yeah an after-dinner mint type size which is perfect so it's good to share with the family it's good to share it a party it's good to have after a coffee it's good to have during a coffee all is just a general treat during the day or on the afternoon after a long day but no matter when you have it either way it's going to taste simply delicious [Music] you [Music]", "xlfkPFBW36o": "hey Pennsylvania patience it's me again medical Mary let's melt down some butterscotch we're gonna try to make some hard candies with our SL and let's open some of these I put 20 in here we have 1/2 gram let's melt them down I highly suggest using a rubber spatula we're trying to stir this mixture because it's gonna get stuck on everything else even though I swear when you cook with these I will never lick the spatula because it tastes like rubber okay it's a weird taste to it so well melting these down you just kind of want to keep stirring it so we don't burn it we're get it stuck to the bottom it will start to melt if you want it to go a little quicker you can smash them up first but I kind of want to see how long it took just to melt when I need the Jolly Ranchers on here we had them crushed up and I had them on low forever they just it turn into this weird like you dumb mixture ooh so I'm trying them from full and I'm gonna go a little bit higher I have it [Music] when these all get melted we're just gonna add straight our so to it and I think a little butter but I don't know that I would add anything else so if you still want that candy to get part again and here we start adding all this sticky stuff I'm not sure that it would solidify and starting to clump together keep stirring the hardest part is judging like how many you're gonna make I put in 20 hard candies I'm going to use half a gram or so it's so hard to dos when we just need peanut butter cookies doesn't that look like peanut butter I think it was a good idea that we didn't start on low started around four but I don't even think it's been ten minutes and it's almost ready for the RSO and butter ah broke this dang injector maybe this will work [Music] ding-ding-ding we have a winner [Music] [Music] oh yeah there's a piece of plastic but I don't want to waste all this I'm gonna pour it in here everything's ready to go it gets cold fast and you want to pour it back [Music] [Music] you were there you were there I know you're incorporated with the mixture damn it give any court ring for top number two [Music] [Music] so like to see which is a little lip on it [Music] so far we have a nice little mixture [Music] [Music] we had a butter double chocolate [Music]", "0Jr2oFHc2tw": "I like to welcome you to the American homesteaders project kitchen here we're going to be making caramel today there's very few ingredients used first we have pure cane sugar and it is important to use king sugar kaeru corn syrup this is heavy whipping cream and you want to use a good heavy cream you can use milk that it will be more premium much better if you use a heavy cream a little bit of salt and this is kosher salt it doesn't have any iodine or anything we're also going to be adding a few ingredients for flavor such as vanilla and then we're going to roast some peacock and of course one of the most important ingredients at almost anything that you eat is butter okay here we have the pecans we're getting ready to roast them we're going to put them in with the caramels and we're going to roast those at 300 degrees for about 10 minutes in about five minutes you want to stir them up a little bit but the best way to tell when they're ready to take out you'll just begin to smell the oils from the nuts come out it does totally change the flavor and texture so I think it's an important step that you don't leave out and then after we've cooled them will chop them up before we mix them in that's one of the last things to go into the carbonyls you you this is actually one cup of butter and one cup of heavy cream we're going to put these in the microwave to melt them and bring them up to temperature a little bit and then we'll whip it together but if you just use sugar it will recrystallize even though you melt and melt it down when you add the corn syrup because it's a different type of sugar it will basically make like a barrier between the crystals and at each other and then they can't reform crystals you don't want greeny sugary caramel the only other ingredient that goes in while we're cooking it's salt and I put in about a tablespoon of that it's kind of just in the palm of your hand then when we're done the last thing we add to it is pure vanilla and I put about a tablespoon of pure vanilla in but you don't want to put that in too early or all the flavor will cook away okay we're going to start out at a medium low temperature now the corn syrup that's pretty thick if you've ever worked with it before so what I did is popped it in the microwave for about 30 seconds to loosen it up now I'm not a master candy maker I'm just some guy that's making candy today but one of the things that I am aware of in that you need to be aware of is again the crystals forming back in the sugar so one of the things you want to be careful I was try to keep the sugar in the syrup and off of the sides as much as possible and don't allow sugar crystals to reform so I'm putting the sugar into the corn syrup in Turpan we have our mixture of sugars which was the corn syrup the King sugar and we also added three table or six tablespoons of water now we have basically what you would call a simple syrup it's a rather heavy simple syrup but this we're going to allow to the heat up and come to a boil and when it comes to a boil we'll put the top on it for one minute to allow the sugar on the sides to melt down but we're just going to slowly incorporate all these things together and also I don't know if you had noticed or not but we have a heavy cast-iron skillet here that's because I have a thin pot and you want to keep as much distance basically away from the direct flame and the sugar to keep it from burning so I don't have a heavy-bottomed pot so I've used this cast iron skillet it it moves the heat across very well and keeps a nice even heat under the that cooking what about 15 minutes into the profs here process here the sugar mixture has begun to boil I'm going to put the lid on the pot for about one minute as you can see in here I think there's some crystals that have formed on the sides we're going to put the top on here and let those heat up and come down off the sides okay as you can see now we've had the lid on for a little over a minute the sugar mixture has actually kind of changed it's now pretty much liquid that's boiling the sugar that was on the side has all melt down and there's no crystals now the next thing we're going to do is we're going to add the butter and the cream in case you forgot about that we have it over here we're going to mix that all into this sugar mixture now you want to be kind of careful as you mix this in because you can't foam up and be like Bob so I'm going to just slowly pour it in seems to be ok so now I'm just going to pour it straight in and I'll mix it in and then we're going to let it go for a little bit so we have all the major ingredients in here the only thing that we have left to add is the vanilla and we put that in actually as we take it off the heat the nuts i have in a prepared tray or container pan will show you that in a few minutes so now all there is to do is to bring it up to temperature and we'll see what temperature is now we're going for about 2 47 48 and we do have to watch the temperature pretty close because with sugars and candies the you go from what's called a softball too hard crack in a fairly close range and we don't want to get to the heartburn chest over 65 minutes here since we started the process of melting the sugars we're 239 degrees Fahrenheit note that the mixture has changed from clear to a medium dark amber at this point will continue to become a little bit more Brown as we near the 246 247 degree stopping point we're at 247 we're going to pull at 248 on the dot 248 take the heat off now we're going to add the vanilla you just slowly stir in vanilla and it will react to it we picked that because I had an alcohol to this sugar mixture string it down a little bit can't where you pour it out we will sit here and cuddle these combos if they're turn out exactly right and I believe they have at room temperature they will just be barely melting as you can see the nuts start to come up through and permeate the caramel okay this is actually day two we let this sit in the refrigerator overnight after the cool down and covered it and I'm going to cut it today and then roll it into two candies so we're going to start out i'm just going to use a knife today i've used piece of Cutters in the past this seems to be working pretty well with a consistent this is a very very stick candy though so it does work a lot better when the caramel has cooled all the way and actually sat I'm going to work with this pretty quick just going to basically show you how it wrap it in wax paper and then I store it in a like an airtight you know frigerator or freezer bag storage bag to the refrigerator and it stays good for well as long as I've ever had it now I'm a pretty big piece of candy they're probably than what I bought you don't get carried away on your size because they're actually very rich I like to rule them get them somewhat around and even though this is cold legs don't work with it and one of the things i found out i'm just taking playing wax paper here i'm going to roll this up I've done this when they're warmer and it's not that the wax paper sticks but the wax paper gets down into little poles of the candy and then that sticks they don't come far very well so right there you have it there's a candy right there and I'm going to do the rest of the candies that way and it seems to some of these ends and pieces actually get eaten along the way mmm that's some good stuff just melts in your mouth that's perfect so we pretty much completed our project on Carmel making on a difficulty scale I'd say it's probably a five and a scale of zero to ten the main thing is watching your temperatures don't get in a big hurry and use good whole ingredients don't skip and use margarine use cane sugar and a good corn syrup and then also what we did we roasted pecans but you can use pistachios you could use a plane they're very good without anything and a lot of people use like a a kosher salt or sea salt is a sprinkle for syrup salt caramel so do it enjoy it experiment make mistakes and just have a great time with it you", "N_qhnebS0Dc": "welcome to spiced candies as I'm starting this video series I've chosen to make simple fast and easy candies for YouTube Watchers that may want to try and make those my wife has requested a batch of coffee candies today so we'll be making a simple fast coffee candy recipe as usual we'll start with 70 grams of white granular sugar 2.2 grams of dehydrated freeze-dried coffee and 1/8 or one lines cup of corn syrup I've chosen the Jacobs freeze-dried instant coffee you may choose any favorite coffee of your own but remember that you need to change the amount of coffee in your candy the Jacobs is quite strong and cries only 2.2 grams of coffee other types of coffee may require higher amounts up to 7 grams depending on how weak the coffee is or how strong you want the candy to be if in the future there will be a demand I will show you how to make it cream coffee candies which are a lot more fun in my opinion we will first start making the candy by pouring the sugar Cora syrup and an equal amount of water compared to the corn syrup force and give it a nice mix I'm using the smallest burner lacks power allow the candy to heat up since this is a hard candy we will need to reach the temperature of 150 degrees Celsius or 300 feet as usual we'll need to make sure that everything is ready before we pour our candy which means we need the parchment paper and a cutting tool as the candy mix begins to boil at around 100 degrees Celsius you can see the grandeur of sugar at the bottom still not completely dissolved now that we reached the right temperature 150 degrees Celsius also known as a hard crack temperature we can add the coffee I'm shutting off the flame source and adding the coffee and a person will not want to mix we can see not dissolve into the hot sugar but it will happen to paint thorough mixing I'm using a long-handled stool it's been actually and this helps prevent getting any burns once your coffee mix has become homogeneous we can pour we'll just give it one last quick sphere and we'll just pour it onto the parchment paper I can now cut the candy marking fault lines that allow us to break the candies later on and just mark these nice squares the candy is a little bit too hot you can see these lines merge I'll just move it on my sheet my fake marble surface to allow to cool let's try again and I think they'll stay this time let's see yes we're getting nice and clear lines so it's a good time to stop and let the candy cool now that the candies have cooled we can cut those always adhere a little bit to the parchment paper you're just it's too hot to touch but I can handle it and I prefer to do it in there a bit taut as well so they won't soak up moisture from the air just gotta be careful little sharp shards it's just like glass and it does thing now you do it slowly you won't get hurt you hurry up as I do now well it's things from time to time okay so our candies already I can pour those into the container I'll just get rid of those pesky triangles a special method of getting rid of those mm nice coffee there we go about your puffy

Jillian for patch calm and welcome back to my kitchen today I'll be showing you how to make salted caramel I've been using this a lot to drizzle on my ice cream and is absolutely delicious so let's start with the ingredients the ingredients this time are going to be really really simple we'll start with one fourth cup of water 1 cup of heavy cream half a stick of unsalted butter 1 cup of sugar and then 1 teaspoon of sea salt and this sea salt I'm using today is from a gift from my good friend Kelly her daughter recently came back from Italy and brought this unrefined to see salt with her so we'll be using that I'm over at the stove with all of my ingredients so first I'll add my cup of sugar to a heavy bottom pan and it's very important that you use a heavy bottom pan so everything cooks very evenly otherwise you'll get some caramel that's burnt and some that's undercooked so I added the sugar and I'm just going to add the quarter cup of water to that and what I'm going to do is I'm just going to stir this once to make sure the water is combined with the sugar and it's even now I'm going to let that sit on medium heat until it starts to boil and the important thing with salted caramel is to not touch it even when it comes to a boil you don't want to stir it you don't want to disturb the ingredients you just want to let it boil this is what it should look like after it's been cooking for three minutes on medium heat at five minutes the mixture is starting to really come to a boil and you can see that it's starting to turn tan in color and what we're looking for is for a deep amber color and that will be achieved and another two minutes it's been about five more minutes and as you can see the mixture is now a deep amber color so we'll take it off the stove and we'll add the rest of our ingredients we'll start with the butter and let that melt in and this is the time you can mix it around so mix around the butter and let it melt into the mixture and then pour the cream in and this is going to harden up the mixture quite a bit don't be alarmed that's really normal just kind of mix it until all the hardness disappears might be a little bit difficult but it will all mix together perfectly and take the caramel consistency I've stirred the mixture until it looks like this pretty liquidy if you are having a problem with the sugar kind of solidifying just put it over the heat and continue to stir it and if you are patient enough it will end up melting back into a liquid so now it's time to add the sea salt so I just dump it in stir that in and now it's time to pour into a glass baking pan and make sure the glass baking pan is somewhat cold so that it can kind of solidify and sit for let it sit for about an hour and after the hour it's time to enjoy it it's my favorite part of the video and that's time to taste it mmm perfect complement to vanilla ice cream it's sweet and salty and absolutely delicious I've been making this so much lately I dip apple slices in it i drizzled on brownies I just basically put it wherever I possibly can you can also jar it put it in a cute little mason jar wrap a bow around it and serve it to your friends as gifts thanks to my friend Milo help me out with a video today we'll see you next time", "31yF43fAPoE": "hey good morning everybody today I'm going to show you how to make maple toffee I did have a request for maitland e and I thought about and I figured a toffee would be a good way to go and this is a very simple recipe I will give you the ingredients in a minute but I can just tell it to you it's that simple it's a copy of maple syrup and heavy cream for 35% whipping cream half a cup each of white sugar and light brown sugar and 1 teaspoon of salt regular table salt and curcuit with a candy thermometer 250 let it set score it you're done okay so for the people that don't want to watch the rest you can go now but for the people that haven't made candy at all and you want to see the rest here we go for this you will need some specialized utensils I'm either with a spoon in the pot not really well need a candy thermometer unless you're an experienced candy maker you cannot make this visually and if you could you wouldn't be watching this anyways so you will also need a square cake pan I like the tin foil you can use other kinds the reason I like this one is the heat transfer it comes out fairly rapidly and you will need some parchment paper and of course some measuring spoons in a comment okay so here's the list of ingredients I'm using a 3 quart saucepan for this I would recommend this as the minimum size if you've got bigger that's great make sure it does have a heavy bottom for Canada making use of 10 pan it's going to burn so just measure everything into there once everything's in there get your wooden spoon and gently stir everything up with the brown sugar you should ideally try to avoid chunks in it I think I've gotten a couple and you want to mosh them down before you turn the heat on if there's any like solidified dark dark brown chunks it got wet somehow just pick those out don't want that in your candy because any preformed sugar crystals may cause it to crystallize you will see a lot of candy recipes that will tell you to brush down the sides of the pan with a pastry brush and water personally I really don't care about that for the simple reason that when this cooks it will boil up higher than where I stirred it on the side of the pan and provided I'm pretty quick about it and don't let it dry out it really doesn't crystallize in my experience and make sure you've got everything worked through before you turn the heat on because once you do you will not be stirring this at all turn the heat on to medium you don't want to turn this to lie because if the flames come up the side you can burn the stuff on the side of the pan for now and get your pan prepared in the meantime this is up keep that part for the sheets like I do use this method if not I just measure it in the pan and cut it off from the wall so what I do is I take my sheet measure it and hop clear in the bottom and see how far across it goes just put your finger down there and fold it over and just market okay take that out and hold it at the top where you mark it pull straight down okay and you need to get scissors like this parent it's now quite a little bit it doesn't matter obviously if it tears it off get another piece of thread again this should be good so get run it out and let's not well-behaved don't hog the other side the other sharp increase there we go and just separate it like that put one piece down here hold it all turns around the other piece turns in the same thing why still have to be mounted what's important is that you've got enough in there enough overhang but you can't just pull it out when it's going off you're gonna pour it half way through you can't wait to it's completely cool to score it and the scribes not necessary you know you can just let this dry and then take it and then walk it with you know the bottom of a cleaver something will shatter into nice bite-sized pieces I noticed that I didn't have a pan completely centered and if you notice on the side there I'll zoom in in fact there's a potentially burnt spot not to worry I got my pastry brush in a bit of water and this is a case where I will get rid of that because you don't want a burnt taste in there that little bit won't affect it if you would let it cook all the way at mate on while you're on it if this if you do want to clean up the rest of the pan with the water to avoid crystallization this is how you do it and I will turn this down a bit because when this gets going full-tilt it can boil over I have lost the clip to my candy thermometer but oddly enough it's quite well trained and it just stays where I put it there's not nice and I just turned this down because it started to take off on me and I'll just nudge it up a bit so you can see what I was talking about I've turned up the heat just a notch on the gas and you'll see how quickly that comes up which is why you never do this in a small ok now I'm gonna turn this down right away and hopefully it'll come down if it doesn't I'm gonna grab it and just take the thermometer and pull it off the heat if you've got electric you may have to do this a couple of times to find your exact setting that works for you that it cooks fast enough without boiling over as the moisture boils off you can usually nudge it up a little bit through the cooking process because the less fluid in there the less bubbles this is looking pretty stable right now so I'm just going to move the camera so I can get a good reading at eye level and right now it is out 210 degrees Fahrenheit and I will have to turn this down well because you can see it's going for the goal there and if you've ever had hot candy boil over it's a huge mess to clean up and even get burned very badly so this is where I have to put in my safety warning that when you're gonna make candy like this always make sure that you do not have small children or pets running around in the room just for safety so it's at 212 right now or 100 degrees centigrade which is the boiling point of water and you can see it's subsided quite a bit so I'm gonna try to turn it up a bit to speed up the process okay it's looking fairly stable here so I'm just gonna turn the camera off for a bit and do keep an eye on it never walk away from hot syrup it's a safety issue because for whatever reason if it over boils you've got to be there to get the pan off the stove right away so here's to 20 it did take about 12 minutes to reach this point it'll be a shot every 10 degrees or so this is 2:30 and this actually only took four minutes to reach this temperature so that's one thing you should always remember when you're doing candy making in another reason not to walk away from the stove is it the first bit is really slow when you start to get close to your target temperature it goes really really fast and this is a good time actually you should turn down your Heat I'm not worried about over boiling at this point I'm more worried about missing my temperature okay we're at 240 right now and that only took three minutes to go so I'm just gonna watch this like a hawk that's a 249 now so I'm not sure the heat off because it will keep cooking and pull the thermometer out it will do the extra degree while I'm just bringing this over just set down on plate there and you just fix this soon you're not even think of scraping the pan for this okay if you do it will crystallize your candy and you won't get what you want you can leave the trip like this if you want like I said don't scrape it and honestly there's not that much left there's just a coating in the bottom and for cleaning candy just pop this in the sink with some cold water and let it soak it should just come right out so this has only been a couple of minutes here you can see that all the large bubbles are broken out and the other ones will work their way out of the candy on its own and it is tempting to like play with the paper turn it around or something do not do that this can induce crystallization and you will not get a toffee it's been about 20 minutes or so and what you do is you just do a field test so it's warm to the touch but it's not hot that's very important if it's too hot it may still crystallize at this point that's highly unlikely but it's still malleable a bit so just pull it out and get it on your cutting board I'll give it a try to pure Bach okay for now yeah so just score it I use a cleaver because it's nice and heavy you don't want to cut all the way through it yeah unless you can now some people do oil or cleavers for this I don't usually yeah that's working quite nice you know what I think I might just cut it let's just see how this goes yeah this is quite quite nicely so it's gonna make 64 pieces well I'll do this I'll score it first just to show you that and I think it might just be at that magic temperature that I can cut it which i think is better actually because then you don't have to worry about I'm gonna just explode on you and shatter when you try to break it up later okay so that's scored now I'm gonna try to cut a rocking motion works better this true right the other way yeah so I'm just gonna keep going there once you got it in for you can make short work of it and I do like to still cut it on a parchment because it's less chance of damage to the cutting board so it's just like a clip to cut each way now one thing I should mention with this particular toffee it's a little unusual the taste the first day is not that great it actually improves over time if you wait a day to eat this yeah requires a little discipline there but if you do you'll find that the maple flavor really really comes out nicely on the second day so I caught it just in time if you wait too long on the harden up considerably that you can't actually get through them the last few I did have some difficulty this is what the finished product looks like and they're quite nice and glossy and if you leave them overnight they will have the best taste they're a little hard to start off with but they do soften up and do get now nice chewy texture and a really good flavor so this is how I make maple toffee thanks for watching I'll see you again", "yBbGvozFeDg": "welcome back to the 92nd chef I'm here with Olivia and we're making Christmas treats and what we're making

We're making our soft salted caramels recipe.  These salted caramels are soft, chewy and perfectly melt away in your mouth.  Before making our salted caramels... we always make sure we have our equipment ready... and all ingredients measured out. Here's a loaf pan, we are going to lightly oil it... then we're going to cut a piece of parchment paper, lightly oil that... then insert that inside the loaf pan... which makes our lives a lot easier for when we want to unmold the caramels when we're done. Next for the ingredients, we need to measure a half cup of... heavy whipping cream... then grab one stick of butter, which is also a half cup... and cut that into eight... equally sized pieces.  Add that to a bowl... then add the cream... and place it into the microwave... then cook for about a minute... until the butter has melted and the cream is hot... set that aside... then measure out a quarter cup of light corn syrup... and one cup of granulated white sugar... now grab a small saucepan... add three tablespoons of water to the saucepan... grab the corn syrup that you just\nmeasured out and add that to the saucepan. Next for the sugar... add it but try your best not to splatter the sugar up the sides of the pan.  Then use a spoon... or spatula... to stir the sugar... into the water and corn syrup.  Heat to medium and bring to boil. Now once it as a boil you might to make sure there aren't any sugar crystals on the sides of the pan...  since this can cause something called crystallization... which can make your caramels grainy and really ruin the texture... to help with this... cover with a lid for about one minute. Remove the lid and attach a candy thermometer... you will want to cook the sugar until it reaches 320 degrees F.  At this temperature the sugar will take on a light amber color... now we are ready to add the butter and cream mixture from before... add it in small batches... then use the candy thermometer... to stir it into the sugar mixture.  As you do this... the caramel will bubble violently... so you really want to do this slowly and carefully... so nothing bubbles over. Place the candy thermometer back onto the side of the pan... and cook the caramel... until 240 degrees F... this will create a soft caramel... if you want harder caramels... cook to 245 degrees F.  Now pour the caramel... into your prepared loaf pan... and let it sit for about fifteen to twenty minutes... while you wait it's best to clean your\npot and candy thermometer... fill the pot with water, place the candy thermometer into the water... and bring the water to a boil... this will melt away all the caramel... and make clean up really easy. After about twenty minutes you can salt the top of the salted caramels... then let it sit... for three to four hours... until firmed up.  Then your done... unmold the caramel... and cut into whatever shape and size you like.

i have a starbucks copycat recipe for you so starbucks has this new drink it's called the um it's the oat milk brown sugar shaken espresso i wanted to try it so bad you guys honestly i wanted to try it so bad but i'm doing this low carb thing until the end of lent and yesterday i did go to starbucks and once i learned that in a grande which is 16 ounces which is what this cup is um that it works out to like 30 grams of carbs and the sugar was off the charts so i made my husband ordered one so i could just take a sip of it and it's amazing like if you love coffee it's not overly sweet it's super good but i was thinking that maybe there's a way that i can recreate this so i've got a 16 ounce cup with ice now i put the ice in the cup first because that way i know that the ice is going to fit you're going to need some milk now for that recipe they do use oat milk and that's where some of the carbs come from i think there is 16 grams of carbs in the oatly milk but you can use unsweetened almond milk you can use skim milk you can use whatever you want i'm gonna use the unsweetened almond because there's barely any carbs in it you're gonna need a brown sugar substitute this is the swerve sugar replacement and it is brown sugar a little pricey but honestly it's really good this is not the first time i'm using this so and then you're gonna need some cinnamon i brewed three shots of espresso because that's what the starbucks website says it has and then to kind of mimic that syrup um i'm gonna do the cinnamon dolce syrup you don't totally need this syrup you can just survive with the other stuff just add a little bit of extra sugar in so we're gonna add i'm gonna take a shaker and i'm going to add my ice now because i'm using the brown sugar i'm going to add two pumps of the cinnamon dolce syrup if you're not going to use any kind of syrup then just add a little bit of extra brown sugar in okay i'm going to add a half a cup of milk and i have a full cup poured because i'm doing something else and i needed two halves and wasn't going to ruin two mixing cups then we're gonna pour our espresso in i did let that cool just a little bit then i'm going to take a half a teaspoon of the brown sugar substitute and just a little bit of fresh cinnamon even though i have that cinnamon dolce in there again you don't have to do that that's totally up to you you know just do whatever is going to be right for you so you've got the ice you've got the cinnamon dolce syrup which you don't have to use you've got the brown sugar substitute which is by swerve hold on i put the spoon in the package okay amazing as you can see it's all zeros and the flavor that it adds is incredible you've got eight ounces of milk and you've got three shots of espresso so

of healthy dairy-free desserts today I'm going to show you how to make one of my favorite treats it's vegan salted caramel these are ready in under five minutes and they're nut free gluten free and vegan so the first thing you're going to do to make these vegan salted caramels is to pit your medjool dates now this is really easy to do you just open them up and pull the data that's inside we're gonna throw all the ingredients into a high-powered blender now if you don't have a high-flyer blender that is totally fine you just might want to soak your dates a little bit first to make sure they're nice and moist and juicy so I'm pouring the dates next I'm adding tahini which is sesame paste I love tahini it adds a really nice flavor to these salted caramels and it's super high in calcium which is a great added bonus now I'm gonna add some maple syrup this gives it a really nice kind of caramel flavor and I'm from Canada so I love maple syrup and finally just a little bit of vanilla to give it that extra little boost perfect now we're just gonna blend on high until it's super super smooth with our really smooth salted caramel mixture we're gonna put it into a bread pan lined with parchment paper or wax paper finish off before we put these in the freezer we're just gonna gently press them into this bread pan to make our salted caramels now they're pretty gooey but I find with a silicone spatula it doesn't stick which is really great so once you have them relatively smooth you'll see how beautiful and glossy they are the last thing you're going to do is sprinkle them with some coarse sea salt this gives us that delicious salted caramel aspect now these vegan salted caramels are ready to go into the freezer for about two hours to set once the vegan caramels have been in the freezer for about two hours they're ready to cut answer so they're really easy to remove from the bread pan just grab the corners and it'll come right out and then we'll just cut them using a really sharp knife now they are a little sticky but if they're cold enough they should come apart really nicely and I like to make them pretty small because they're quite a decadent treat there then you can just put them on a full plate whenever you've got and serve them at a party or for dessert or just store them in the freezer and sneak them every now and then as a snack now these vegan salted caramels are ready to enjoy you can get the full recipe at Jesse Lane wellness.com and if you like gluten-free dairy-free vegan nut free sugar free desserts then you will love the recipes

how to make is four different ways to make homemade caramel candies I'm going to show you how to make a cotton candy caramel a root beer caramel a red velvet caramel and then of course a traditional caramel with a little bit of sea salt sprinkled on the top I'm also going to be showing you how to make these really cool pinwheel caramels I'm going to show you how to make a vanilla cream to wrap them up into that we roll them up and we slice them up and they're absolutely delicious if you'd like to be notified every time we upload a new video or we do a live video make sure you hit the little alarm bell beside the subscribe button and you will be notified every time we do let's get started on this tutorial to make our traditional caramel candy we're going to be using 2/3 of a cup of dark corn syrup you can substitute light if that's all you have but the dark gives you that color and a different flavouring we're also going to need 1/3 of a cup of pure maple syrup not the artificial stuff or the real deal we need 1/2 a cup of butter you can use salted or unsalted that's up to you there's quite a bit of salt in the recipe so if you want probably use unsalted here we have a fleur de sel which we're going to sprinkle on the top when it's done and fleur de sel is just hand harvested sea salt we're going to need one container of sweetened condensed milk we need 1 teaspoon of molasses I have the fancy molasses in here you could also use cooking molasses you we need 1/2 of a teaspoon of salt again you can play with that amount and we need 1 and a half teaspoons of pure vanilla extract you can use artificial if you prefer and we need 2 cups of brown sugar so I have my brown sugar in a large pot here I'm going to turn my temperature up to medium-low the faster you heat up your caramel the lighter it will be so I want to slow roast it here kind of and I'm pouring in my sweetened condensed milk and just get that using spatch help helpful to get all the stuff out and then I'm going to add in all of the other ingredients I'm going to heat it on keep it on this nice low temperature until I can see that the butter and the sugar has melted and the sugar has dissolved and I'm going to look at the corn syrup go I'm going to heat it on low until that happens and then once that once the butter and the sugar has melted and dissolved I'm going to turn the temperature up slightly to about medium and then I'm going to let it heat for it's usually going to take about 15 minutes maybe longer depending on your temperature and the temperature I'm looking for now is two hundred and forty-five degrees Fahrenheit when I made this recipe for candy apples I kept it much cooler I was at 230 only because I wanted it to coat the apples here I want a chewy candy that stays together in a square so that's why I'm heating it to a higher temperature so I'm going to let it heat and do its work and I'll be back once the caramel has come to temperature you can remove your candy thermometer and I just keep it on silicone while it's cooling down and then the caramel washes off quite easily with just hot water now I'm going to take my caramel and I'm going to pour it into a parchment lined baking dish you want a poor you don't want to scrape caramel pots because the caramel at the bottom and the sides of the pot is a darker color than what's on the UM what's on the top you can still enjoy that caramel just pour it into a separate container to enjoy it as long as if you don't care what your caramel looks like then it's fine just to pour the whole thing in here just let it settle for a couple minutes or a couple seconds sorry I'm just giving it a little tap here because you can see the bubbles all coming up to the surface and then you can take your Fleur to sell while it's still warm and you can sprinkle the fleur de sel on the top you can also do this later on but sometimes if you've overcooked the caramel it might be too hard and the salt might not stick to it so you're going to let this cool completely it's best to do it at room temperature because your fridge fridge a high humidity in it usually and caramel and humidity don't go together very well once the caramel has cooled you can grab the parchment paper on either side and you can lift it out of your pan quite easily and then cut it I'm just using a sharp buttered knife and you can cut it into whatever size pieces you want to and it's absolutely delicious and you can see it's wonderful nice and chewy and melt in your mouth totally absolutely delicious to make the root beer flavored caramel candies what we're going to be using is 2/3 of a cup of corn syrup we've got 1/3 of a cup of pure maple syrup we have half a cup of butter you can use a little bit of of the fleur de sel again if you want to or you can omit it in this recipe we need 1 can of sweetened condensed milk 1 teaspoon of molasses and then my root beer extract you can sometimes find this in grocery stores or you can find it at beer and wine stores they sell it for making homemade root beer you also are going to need between a quarter to a half a teaspoon of salt and two cups of brown sugar so I have my pot here with my brown sugar on top of my heating element turning it up to a medium low and I'm going to add my ingredients in here got the sweetened condensed milk coming in its makes it this is what makes it nice and creamy you can use regular milk too but usually but this one is much better maple syrup there we go and we've got the addition of our corn syrup it likes to come out very dramatically there we go and just clean that off with your spatula like that and want to add in our molasses and they need a little bit of encouragement because they're as slow as molasses uh-oh check your so funny and I've got my butter going in here and my salt and then the best part about this one is the root beer extract so I'm going to be putting in at 8 spoon of the root beer and you know what maybe a little sneaky - for a little bit extra extra flavor in there doesn't hurt that so this is a really wonderful smelling one - it smells absolutely delicious of course if you love root beer and it is makes for a beautiful tasting caramel as well it's kind of a nice combination I wasn't sure at first when I was trying it but it absolutely is delightful so I'm going to heat this up again and I'm going to continue to stir this until the butter is melted and then I'm going to stop stirring it at that point and I won't stir it again I'm just going to leave it here on the element you can see that this one is becoming already a nice darker one from that dark root beer extract so I'm going to be heating it up again till about 240 to 245 degrees Fahrenheit and that's going to give me a nice chewy caramel if you want it to be us harder one then you just have to heat it up a little bit harder I wouldn't go beyond 260 though or you're getting into candy territory so I'm just going to let this heat here and I will be back so once we have the temperature up to 240 which when you're making candies and caramels that is known as the softball stage so if I was to right now drop a little piece of this caramel into a glass of cold water I could pull it out of the cold water and it would stay a soft ball instead of an actual hard ball when we get to hardball state which is much hotter so I want to make sure that you're just pouring this into a parchment lined baking pan this is an 8 by 8 inch pan you can use any size of pen whatever you want to but you do want something with edges so that it contains the caramel while it cools so again I'm going to set this off to the side once it is completely cooled and then I will cut it up for you once the root beer caramel has cooled I pulled it out of the pan sliced it into strips and now I can cut it into small pieces bite side pieces I've got my knife liberally spread with butter you can just wipe that off when you've got the pieces there now you can serve these up just like this if you choose to or you can put them in like wrap them up in little pieces of parchment paper or wrap them up in little pieces of wax paper that works as well so we've changed things up for the red velvet caramel candies I've taken out the molasses and the sea salt I won't use it at all but what we do have left is 2/3 of a cup of the dark corn syrup we have 1/3 of a cup of the pure maple syrup we've got 2 cups of a brown sugar we have a 1 cup of the softened butter 1 container of the sweetened condensed milk a little bit of salt about a quarter of a teaspoon and then for the red velvet here we have red velvet bakery emulsion what emulsion is is basically the same as an extract but instead of being an alcohol-based extract like we would find a vanilla extract emulsions are water-based so we're going to be trying this one out it's got a beautiful color and a wonderful taste so we're following the same procedure that we did for our other caramel candies I've got my sugar here in my bowl going to add in all my ingredients so as I mentioned when I was going over the ingredients I've left out the sea salt just simply because I don't want it in this recipe and but you can put it in if you want to it does look really good so if you want some just for display I would recommend you use the sea salt just to have them look nice but as far as taste goes I just didn't think that the sea salt and the red velvet went very well together but maybe you might think that it does and I'm there also reason that I left the molasses out was because it's going to compete the flavour of the molasses even though it's only a teaspoon of it it does try to compete with the red velvet and I don't want to have that happening I want to have a really nice red velvet taste happening with the caramel and I'm going to and also with the color to the molasses does play a little role with color so I've got my red velvet emulsion here and you can see it's a beautiful it's going to come out a beautiful red here it's really really dark and when it gets mixed in with all the ingredients it will be it's a beautiful red so we're going to tap that in and then I'm going to mix it up again and it's going to come to 245 degrees you can see that red starting to pop through as soon as I start to mix it and we're going to have nice soft caramels for 245 once we've got the caramel up to temperature turn off the temperature underneath your pot now when you're using and or when you're making caramel you and actually any kind of hard candy you definitely want to have a pot that has a nice thick bottom because what that's going to do is help distribute the heat so you're not getting hot spots on your pot and then you're also not it's you're not as likely to burn your caramel if you don't if you have a thicker bottom to pot so I'm going to let this cool and then I'll be able to slice it up so I've got my red velvet caramel candy here out cut into strips and then I've also got these little candy cups here now when your caramel goes into here it will stick if you don't have a parchment lined one so you want to make sure that you have either a parchment kind of candy cup or a foil one or you spray it with a little bit of nonstick spray and then you can just pop your candy your little caramel candy into the little cup and it makes kind of like a cute little decoration for a party or individual favors that you want to give out for whatever occasion so you can even just shape the caramel it's quite soft and then press it into the cup however you want to let's like that now we're making our fourth kind of caramel and this this is the cotton candy flavored caramel candies so we're going to need 2/3 of a cup of the dark corn syrup 1/3 of a cup of pure maple syrup 2 cups of brown sugar 1/2 cup of butter and then for the cotton candy we need a little bit of a sky-blue gel paste we're going to use a dram of the cotton candy candy flavoring I've got 1/4 teaspoon of salt and we need one can of the sweetened condensed milk so I've got my pot here with my brown sugar turning my temperature up to low and what's different about the cotton candy recipe is that I'm going to be adding gel paste and I'm going to be using candy flavoring now candy flavoring is super concentrated and the little bottles that you that are usually red readily available in Canada we have a store called bulk barn which is where you can find candy flavoring I think you can also get them at craft stores baking stores cake decorating stores as well or should be quite popular and you can also find them online everything that I'm using here in the video that is kind of like that specialty kind of idea I'm going to put a link in the description box to where you can find it so you can have it as well now what I did discover when I was doing my research and experimenting with these recipes is that when you're adding the color because the caramel is already such a dark color the color and the caramel don't play nicely together and so I'm finding that with the blue the blue worked out all where I'll write the red worked really well too but the other colors didn't seem to work that well so you can experiment by all means but the other ones I had a little bit of difficulty trying to get a nice color out of them but here I have the cotton candy flavoring so I'm going to pour that in and this is called a dram of the flavoring and it's quite concentrated you could get away with this recipe with using two of these because we because it is competing with that caramel flavor and again I left out the molasses from this recipe just like I did when I was doing the red velvet because I don't want to have that competition from the molasses in the recipe so I'm going to stir this let it mix up let everything dissolve pop the candy thermometer in and then I'm going to heat it up to 240 degrees Fahrenheit so once we've got the cotton candy caramel to temperature I've just turned the temperature off I'm going to remove my candy thermometer here from the edge and again to clean everything up it's actually quite easy all you have to do is pop your pot and your thermometer on like fill it up with water add a little bit of dish soap and it will clean itself mostly you might have to do a little tiny bit of scrubbing but that's pretty much about it so I'm going to let this harden and then slice it up just like the others once the cotton candy caramels have solidified what we're going to do is slice them up with a nice sharp knife and you want to make sure that the knife is butter but you can see it is definitely still sticky and then you can just like form if you've got any of that little extra stuff you can just press it in there with your fingers like that so we're going to do the pinwheels next to make the pinwheels we need to have a filling to wrap the caramel in so I'm going to show you how to make a really cool and simple vanilla cream filling so here I have two and a half cups of icing sugar we're going to need one teaspoon of vanilla extract to mix into that and we're going to need half a cup of shortening and I have a two tablespoons of cold water and I have half a container of unflavored gelatin which is equivalent to about three and a half grams so I'm going to take my cold water and I'm going to pour it into the gelatin and then after I've mixed it together I'm going to pop it into the microwave for about 30 to 45 seconds until I've got the gelatin dissolved and the liquid is relatively clear so I've got my gelatin just letting it cool down now after being in the microwave and I'm going to take the shortening and pop it into my sugar and I'm also going to add in my vanilla flavoring as well and then just taking a hand mixer I'm going to beat it on low speed until everything is combined once the powdered sugar shortening and vanilla is combined we can add the gelatin mixture which is cooled a little bit now and then I'm going to take my mixer and turn it back on to low and I'm going to mix again for about five minutes until everything is incorporated once the mixture is completely together it will be a nice big huge solid ball and what I'm just doing now is I'm just taking out some of it and then flattening it a little bit ahead of time here just to make my job once it gets on to the caramel a little bit easier now I took a piece of caramel and I flattened it out with a fondant rolling pin so it's just like rolling fondant actually and now I'm just covering it in a relatively thin and even lair of the vanilla cream if you want a really fast shortcut instead of making the vanilla cream what you can do is slice marshmallows I would use the like larger ones slice them into thin slices and then lay them out like this all over the top of the caramel and it's kind of like a little bit of a hack and a shortcut if you don't want to put the time into the vanilla cream but it also still gives you that look of the pinwheel once you get it cut open so once you've got it kind of covering most of the areas we're going to trim off the ends anyways of the pinwheel and then I'm going to just start it up here at this corner and I'm just going to roll it like I would if I was like rolling sushi or rolling sugar cookies like this tucking that into there and I'm just rolling and coaxing it up and I'm pressing down at the same time because I want the pinwheel here to be nice and tight so then I'm going to roll that all the way up there like that and then I'm going to take a piece of parchment paper I'm just going to wrap it up in the parchment paper and then cutting it in after it sit in the fridge for a couple minutes does make it a little bit easier you could even pop it in the freezer for like two minutes and it just makes it a little bit easier to cut through the UM the caramel so I'm going to do that once the caramel little pinwheel has had time to firm up you can take it out of the parchment paper and then just taking a sharp buttered knife we can slice into it and then we will see a beautiful pinwheel that is revealed so you can slice them up into bite-size pieces now I'm going to come back with all of the pinwheels done and the slices of caramel and give you my thoughts on each one of them and how they taste it etc so there we go everybody how to make our homemade caramels and our homemade caramel pinwheels now I wanted to tell you a little bit about each one of them now the cotton candy one is it's okay I'm not a huge cotton candy flavor fan but I do love how it combines with the caramel what I am disappointed in though is the color like I explained in the tutorial it is hard to get like those bright colors with the caramel I even tried mixing white gel paste in the caramel but it didn't work at all either so we're pretty much stuck with kind of that muted blue but you know what it's pretty cool to flavor something with cotton candy now the root beer one I absolutely loved the root beer flavor pairs perfectly with the caramel I thought it was absolutely delicious the salt is take-it-or-leave-it some of them I put salt on some of them I didn't but the root beer does definitely come through and it's really delicious the red velvet one dub using that bakery emulsion was something I hadn't used before and it worked out extremely well I really like the color I really like the taste it's got that subtle chocolatey little hint to it so it's kind of like a cool chokolate caramel flavor now the traditional one of course is absolutely delicious with the salt the salt is a necessity as far as I'm concerned with the traditional caramel but my favourite thing completely overall out of all of them is the caramel pinwheel with a little bit of salt on top it the vanilla cream plus the soft caramel and a little bit of that little salt kick is absolutely amazing so I hope you guys liked this tutorial today now I have a whole playlist of my homemade candy recipes I'll put a link in the description box for that make sure you check that out

"1BO6jTBcsxE": "the time of giving so I not get something sweet for this special holiday if you pay attention to what to at this demonstration you can learn the great art of making this wonderful treat which is my fat my family's favorite chewy caramel candy I will show you how to make this trait in a number of ways by first preparation second cooking and third the wrapping now in preparation add in your one cup of butter which i already did ahead of time and this that is already melted I with it I'm going to turn this to about and not the middle or a notch I'm in the middle of low and medium range and then and I put the brown sugar with it which is two and a half cup and make sure that you put this in a medium size pan a wooden spoon and if you have the temperature too high it will burn and your candy will be rude and since this is next one outfit it put in your one cup of my corn syrup along with your sweetened condensed milk and this will be very very sticky through make sure doesn't get your clothes because it could stay for a while and while this is mixing you don't want candy to get tired because it will stick to the pan and at this time you have to get your candy thermometer and meet them order would probably work too but at best you want you would run get it try and get candy thermometer and also now you add a dash of salt which is probably about so much there we go now it really is really important not not because you have to keep on stirring off you know get ruined and now you now for the rest for a lot of time you just want to wait and stay here with the campus tomorrow and one to get to 245 degrees that's when you stop and be sure that you don't pull your candy thermometer hand over here you sure you don't put a thermometer at the bottom or else then it'll just get the it will just get the heat from the stove you swine right right in the middle and while this is still cooking its of course not hot enough it comes to the 100 mark so now just stir for a long time sir candy Reese's 245 degrees add 1 teaspoon of vanilla and stir then quickly pour it onto a cookie sheet with high edges to cool sled this it needs to cool for about two hours on average and after it closed cut it into small squares but before you do wash your hands which I already just did and mine are about two inches by one inch do just like this and put it into a ball this it's going to be very sticky so very important to wash your hands and then have have about that like have a square to have a square box paper three inches by three inches and fold it over once like a bit and you want you want the candy be kind of stick out like this to act escaped to slove this over and then very very gently wrap it around one side going left to one side going right and then I'll do one more time if this is actually very simple and then all into the bowl and then so yes be sure that it has that over the edge so it can stay if it's in if you don't then it's not going to last his mom and also with laughing as long as it as long as it can it lasts just about two weeks and now that we have to have covered the preparation the cooking and the wrapping I have taught you how to make caramel candies and I hope that you now can be able to understand that and master this treat you you", "WXLsFH8wb20": "alright said my said it'll start popping up down here anybody joins us usually hello not just our saying hello knees a fix mirror hey guys how are you doing it's been a while since I've been on here hey there how you doing now recognize that name from before out members my name is Sarah we are in the kitchen on this beautiful on my phone I'm trying to get my camera set up so you guys can see what's going on my name is sarah and this is my so sweet kitchen this is my niece Reagan and she's joining me today she's the one to learn how to make caramels and I made a lot of them less winter like probably had a thousand camels so I've kind of got it down pat now and so to me during the fall when I think a fall I think of apple picking and all things apple and I love love love to make baked with apples and I came across this recipe for an apple cider caramel so i'm going to show you in just a second what I'm doing I'm first of all I thank you for joining the broadcast today know it's a sunday afternoon and probably always being lazy but if you're joining on the replay thank you very much feel free to share the broadcast by swiping up or down and click share you can share it on facebook now so i'm going to show you real quickly how to make apple cider caramel's a lot of people are scared of making candy i knew that i was to begin with um oh the first time i make caramels i think my heart was just like pounds like I don't want to burn them this this particular apple cider caramel recipe is pretty simple because you don't have to melt sugar to begin with what you do is you take four cups of apple cider and you reduce it on the stove so make sure what that looks like this began is four cups of apple cider and I have now reduced it down to i'm looking for a half cup measure of course you just eyeball that it's not quite half cup i'ma turn it back up since you guys are on here but it reduces down from the four cups of liquid into this wonderful flavor pack syrup and we're getting very oh there goes my thermometer so we're getting very close it i will tell you about my thermometer as well this is a fantastic electronic thermometer that i found on amazon and love it because it's pretty hard if you're using this correctly for you to make a mistake if you pay attention to what you're doing I just realize that my temperature is not where it should be anymore so what you do is you set your thermometer to the desired temperature and then when it's within two degrees of where you want to be it starts the beep and then when it hits a temperature you want to remove your candy from the stove one it beeps very quickly okay so now my apple cider caramel is is getting closer and closer to probably pretty close to the half cup mark so just imagine all that flavor and goodness in your apple cider is from four cups is now in a half a cup so it's just it's it's amazing when these caramels are make I promise you if you make them your friends will love you okay so once it gets down to that one half cup measure i have already pre-measured one-third cup of heavy whipping cream and i added eight tablespoons of butter real butter unsalted butter and melted this in the microwave ahead of time so that it's a warm temperature and what I'm going to do where you want you come and hold this so that they can see just okay now what you want to do right there that's good would you could you come to the side if you want to look to see what you want to do when you add the cream it usually is when a bubble up and spatter and it can be a quite an eruptive process so just be very careful because it will burn you badly if you get this on your hand it is that hot okay so I'm going to add the cream butter and I have one cup of white sugar and one half cup of brown sugar so I'm gonna go ahead and start to add this now all right this isn't quite as erupted as a regular can when I say regular and we're talking about my vanilla bean caramels there we go get into this a little bit closer bring the camera in tilt it down right over ok and I'm going to add the sugar this is one half cup of brown sugar there we go and one cup of white sugar so now what we're going to do is I'm gonna break this up and stir it and I'm going to keep an eye on my thermometer until it reaches 252 degrees that is the magic number can we stir this up here has anybody that's watching ever made caramels before talk to me I like when people talk to me and you can also tell me where you're from I would love to hear where you guys are do you have a place to go and pick apples during the fall everybody's quiet that's okay all right now you can see it's just like a nice gooey mess right now then we'll make sure my temperature sit probably about a medium high Oh smells so good if you could only smell how wonderful it is all right make sure all my brown sugar is mushed up now this is going to start to come back to a boil will be a rolling boil it gets pretty crazy in this pot all right now i'll let it just sit there for a minute now when i do my other periscope I'll do that later on the what happened bebeh right there um it is a little bit different approach but I will definitely go of that another time i'm going to show you wow that is coming up to temperature it's at 200 degrees right now we want to get it to 252 and it's very hot that way okay i have an eight-by-eight hand that i have lined with parchment paper parchment paper is one of my best friends and I use it all the time on a big now I have it very evenly put inside the pan in the purpose of this is is that once the caramels have hardened you want to remove them from the pan to cut them this is it's so much easier and cleanup is basically I don't you don't even have to clean the pan I just will make one batch after the other so I already have my pan prepared alright and we're up to 210 degrees also have a scant teaspoon of sea salt I like the fleur de sel sea salt and I when we're done this will go inside of the caramel and then when this caramel starts to harden I will sprinkle some on top of the camera and then because it is apple cider we also have a half teaspoon of cinnamon and I'm using Vietnamese cinnamon that i got from King Arthur Flour I love King Arthur Flour I get a lot of my baking products from them and I just can't say enough about them they're awesome okay I'm gonna go ahead and let you see with the mixture looks like now you can see how bubbly it is you see that there you go and we're at two hundred and thirty-six degrees once the temperature starts to increase it goes pretty quickly so it is very very very very very very very important that you are not being distracted when you get to this point so you are already at 242 we'll put this up because if you go past the point you're past the point of returning your camels are going to be hard rock so once i get to that 252 i'm going to remove them from the heat i'm going to add the salt and then the cinnamon important to the pan and then all we have to do is wait for them to harder which is very hard to do because they're all right we're at 248 see you hear the hear the buzzer just let me know i'm getting very close to my 250 or you can go ahead and hold the camera you want to 250 10 this is the nerve-racking part 2 52 I don't forget to turn your temperature off on the stove and a cinnamon and salt and please please remove your thermostat another service that thermometer one time I did not remove mine and when I went to pour the caramels I burnt myself with 250 degree boiling karrimor it was awful awful awful luckily had my lavender essential oil that I had not had for too long I did a little research on the internet and I put a few drops of lavender neat right out of the bottle 12 my finger and I was amazed it never hurt and it just did absolute trick okay hold it up a little bit higher look down into the bowl you can see how yummy it is and you want to quickly pour this into your pan you're prepared pan we really that the what took the longest was I reduced the decider of course before i started the broadcast so that took a little while but it knows maybe 20 minutes it really depends on how high you're boiling the the apple cider i'm not going to lie like to leave a little in the pan so i can taste it later and the nice glossy Sheen to it let's see if you can see that if you can see see how shiny it is this is it guys that's that's caramel so you're going to let them sit here i do not have the time obviously wait for them to completely cool when probably about 20 minutes or when you see they're starting to harden i like to sprinkle the sea salt on top of them if you're in a hurry you want to expedite the process just pop them in the refrigerator and if your home is very warm you might want to refrigerate them they will keep for up to a month in the refrigerator but believe me they will not last a month at your house and then the you might would take it off that thank you is so hot you can keep it at room temperature for two weeks so I have little wrapping papers that are ordered and I cut them and just like about a 1 inch square individually wrap them they are amazing gifts people love them teachers gifts actually sold them last year and they're fun and they're yummy so you can have a wonderful little taste to fall and every bite so thanks for joining and I'll catch you guys later bye", "AtNPlnpNjxo": "[Music] I'm Jason McCray I'm the founder of McRae's candies here in Boston Massachusetts the machines we use our model K machines built in the early 20th century and they were made in Springfield Massachusetts which i think is really cool they really do one thing extremely well it's the only thing they're designed to do and that's that is they take a rope of caramel about the diameter of a broom handle and they pull it in it cuts it to the perfect size and then wraps it in cellophane about 80 pieces per minute caramel is definitely my favorite candy probably starting in about 2009 I had a lot of free time I was recently laid off you know you're making comfort food what am I gonna do with myself and it was around Halloween and there was a little girl that broke her leg in the neighborhood so of course this is a disaster Halloween is my favorite holiday so I made her like a two-pound box of chocolate-covered things and they were a huge hit I started making candy after Halloween and started giving it to my kids teachers and I couldn't make the caramel fast enough and that's kind of how it how it really started to make caramel you have sort of your base ingredients you have sugar milk cream butter that's kind of the foundation of your recipe we use very high quality ingredients and we cook our caramel over a long period of time to make sure that it has a chance for the sugar to do its magic which takes time but we really do everything the same ingredients you would have at home it's just a bigger batch in the very beginning it started with vanilla and the black lava sea salt and then went to fresh ginger which is one of my favorite flavors and then we started branching off into spirited flavors like single malt scotch which has been very popular so the salted caramels are kind of fun so there's two main different kinds of salt we use one is a salt from New England it's a sun-dried wind dried flake salt so it's very delicate and has a tendency to melt in the caramel and then we also use this really coarse Hawaiian black sea salt which has carbon on the surface of the salt so it's that's where the black comes from and the the sensation you have is the regular Cape Cod sea salt it's more like a balanced Alti caramel and the black lava salted caramel is a vanilla caramel with pops of sea salt though this is my favorite flavor the dark chocolate it's kind of like a half-baked brownie it's like when I make brownies they're really they need like 10 more minutes but I pull them out they're ready to go and that's kind of what this is like only it's gooey and chewy like a caramel but it's really heavy and chocolaty so you've got kind of the wonderful combo [Music]", "-Rzhk-BbgfM": "today we're gonna make some hard English toffee so start out preparing the tray that you're going to pour the toffee into so I'm just using a baking sheet covered in foil but this will be way too big for the amount of toffee I'm gonna make so if you have something smaller that's gonna end up with you know a nice shaped piece of toffee then go for that then we're gonna make the toffee so over a medium flame I'm putting a cup of butter into a saucepan and melting that up when you're making toffee everyone says you should use a wooden spoon I have no idea the science or logic behind it but you know if so many people say it it's probably true so next we're adding in a half a teaspoon of vanilla essence give that a good stir and then add in a sprinkle of salt this is probably about a quarter of a teaspoon and give that a stir as well then once it started to melt down a bit I'm adding a cup of sugar I like to add it a bit at a time stirring as I go so that those sugar kind of gets absorbed into the butter otherwise you kind of just end up with a big mountain in the middle keep stirring it until it starts to gently boil and from that point it takes about five minutes until this is ready and you need to keep stirring it all the time if you stop stirring it it's gonna burn and just be ruined and disgusting after about a minute or two of stirring you should notice that it starts to change color and consistency a bit it should get very creamy and almost foamy so keep at it keep stirring and after another couple of minutes you should notice that it's a bit thicker and it's starting to change color into a golden e Brown kind of color so keep on staring some more and you're looking for the point where it's this really nice toffee fudgy color and it doesn't look separated so it should look really really nice and smooth and delicious looks a bit like peanut butter so as soon as it reaches that point take the pan off the heat and pour it straight out into your baking tray I did not get a shot of pouring it out because I did not want my coffee to burn but don't scrape the bottom of the pan when you pour it out just pour it out and anything that's left in the pan just tips and boiling water in there and all of the leftovers will like melt on their own then leave it until it completely cools down so here is my huge cools down slab of toffee and I'm just breaking it up into chunks if you want to cut it up neater than me into squares or something then if you score the top of the block with a knife then you might be able to snap it into nice squares along those score lines I prefer shattered glass kind of toffee so I hope you like it guys and I will see you next time bye", "N6Qrz7PllMw": "hey folks how would you like to make caramel z' hey like please well stay tuned and you'll find out they're not too hard to make okay first you want a cube the butter and an IRS a few reason two sticks or a cup of butter now cubes in for you yeah that's good enough throw it in so the next step to ever cubing the butter is to put it in the pan and put it on low why not medium low or medium or high well you don't want the butter to separate you want to melt it pretty gently and while your butter is slowly melting over there I lined my 8 by 8 brownie pan with parchment and butter on the inside where there is no parchment you want butter you could do two pieces of paper one going the way you see here and then one also going this way but that's just kind of a waste of paper so I found that if you just add some butter to the sides here in the bottom and the corners on each one each part there that it's fine and the caramel will lift out no problem all right the butter is fully melted and I have my brown sugar or at least about half of it measured out here our recipe calls for two and a quarter cups I've got one and a quarter cup I don't like to have a bunch of cups to wash so I'll just do another one as opposed to having everything pre-measured but I also have my one cup of corn syrup liquid measure measured out there and the can of evaporated milk this is a larger can that a small small pan is 12 ounces again it's all melted so I'll just add my brown sugar now you do want to be careful because we don't want your brown sugar to go up the sides of the wall so as you're adding it just be careful that you don't get the brown sugar everywhere or your caramels will crystallize all right so I'll mix this in and I'll come back when it's all mixed in all right so the brown sugar is incorporated except for the last cup here so I'll do that now and I'll show you how I incorporate that carefully it's really not hard come on there we go again I'm aiming for the middle and I'm gonna take a whisk here and I'm just carefully kind of pressing it into the butter and again I'm I'm trying not to get sugar everywhere by spattering so you want to get this completely incorporated before the next step and I will do that in a minute here all right so the brown sugar is now incorporated at least somewhat into the butter it's it's saturated I should probably say now I have a pastry brush and or whatever you might call this thing and water and I've started just washing down the sides of the pan and this is to make sure that the caramel is not crystallized so I'm just dipping it in water and I'm washing down the sides of the pan and I've kind of found that this step I haven't had caramel crystallize yet but this step is supposedly important so I do it because I don't want to find out what crystallized caramel is like so I do it and then I only do it this once though and then once I've got everything else incorporated I'm all done so I'll finish going around the pan and then I'll add my other ingredients and I'll we'll finish up all right my butter and brown sugar all the sides are washed down in the pan after incorporating that I'm now going to take my corn syrup here and my evaporated milk and I'm gonna add them in so I'll do that now a key note here is that the heat is still on low I have not increased the heat yet so I'm just trying to incorporate the ingredients here and all to get a spatula but I can't because I'm doing this with one end but I'll empty that out with a spatula then I will add that next so let's review I have cubed the butter and put it in a low heated pan by the way this is a 3 quart pot or pan here and it is a thick there's a thickness on the bottom it's it's triply so it's it's got a nice thick cord on there and you don't want to use a nonstick pan because the nonstick coating will deteriorate making caramel caramel is get very hot alright so again I got stainless steel pan cubed butter on low you add the brown sugar carefully to the middle and mix that in and then you add the corn syrup oh oh you want to wash the sides down with water first and then add the corn syrup and the can evaporated milk and now I will whisk this all together and again I'm trying not I'm not going to make a big mess here I'm just kind of lightly whisking trying to just incorporate the ingredients and this will take some time another thing you want to do now as you're doing this the whisking it together is turn your heat up from low I like to do like a medium low or kind of can kind of see what I did there number two so again I'm whisking trying to incorporate everything and it will start to look like a really sugary caramel color not this yellowish liquid as you incorporates so just kind of whisk it together and incorporate over this heat and then I'll get back to you when I'm done with that all right folks the ingredients are all incorporated sometimes it does take a while but you kind of want to incorporate all the ingredients before you start getting the caramel to boil and you can start to see that there are a few bubbles here so it is just starting to get there I'm gonna increase the temperature now I already increased it you saw before to the two but now I'm it in the middle of increasing it here to about a medium high as you can see there so I'm doing medium high you don't want to read on the internet you don't want to shock your caramels so that's why you kind of go through the couple stage process of temperatures but different people say different things at this point what I've been doing is but I've been continually stirring the caramels or and on stirring the caramels that helps the butter not separate from the caramels and it makes for a less greasy caramel some people say to let it just sit by itself I have not done that method yet I probably will not why why fix it if it's not broke I also washed on the sides one more time here I'm probably doing overkill but I don't know I hate to see a caramel batch go bad so again I've got my pan all set here this is gonna begin to boil and then we'll boil the heck out of this thing and it will start to reduce and all the milk will kind of evaporate and be left with all the milk sugars and all the other different kinds of sugar we put in there to make a really tasty caramel there's one more ingredient I haven't added yet and that's vanilla and you add that at the very end so we're gonna get boiling here again I turn the heat up and I'm gonna start stirring and I kind of like to do these little stirs it helps to get the caramel the butters of the butter spots away from the sides of the edges and once you do begin to see if more boiling action go ahead and stick your thermometer in there no it's messy up here but this is my thermometer it's just a Taylor I got it from Target and is it a candy deep throat deep fry thermometer and you want to calibrate it make sure you calibrate it in boiling water before you begin mine happens to be 4 degrees on the cool side so I cook my camels to 244 degrees Fahrenheit I will be cooking this batch to 240 degrees to take care of that 4 degree difference in my thermometer all right I'll update you in a minute here or many minutes once this begins to boil and reduce our caramel is boiling just took about five minutes so I can take my heat and I'm actually turn it turn it down to oops I'm going crazy here turn it down to medium I'm going through a number they're right in the middle and again it is boiling the caramel kind of gets this scummy bubbly layer on the outskirts of your pot there I like to just sorry let me just fix this here whisk that right back in kinda reminds me of like if you boil bones for stock or something this scum that comes from that so we'll call it caramel scum Gordon mix that caramel scum right back in you can see it's pretty boiling pretty ferociously there the reason you want to use a 3 quart pan is because the the milk that you add or the cream or whatever you had to the sugar when it starts boiling like this it expands quite a bit so you can see my pot is pretty full now this won't get any more fall than it is but this is it does expand quite a bit and this is really hot stuff so got to be careful and now I will add my thermometer this would be a lot easier with your hands alright that's sitting there I think pretty solidly so I'll be watching this again my temperature is on medium and this will just continue to boil I'll just continue to stir this caramel scum back in there's a light little with these strokes here again some people will say that this will cause crystallization I've yet to have that happen so I think this works great and the smell is amazing it starts to smell like caramel and it is delicious alright I'll be back with the next step alright the caramel is at about 220 degrees Fahrenheit I notice that from beginning boiling to this temperature it takes a while I think a lot of the liquids have to boil out and will continue to boil up you'll notice that the caramel gets quite a bit thicker than it used to be that reminds me of like lava and it will continue to thicken more like lava as you go I haven't washed down the sides or anything since that second time I really wouldn't worry too much about it I'm probably just being too picky again said about 220 if you see that softball softball there on the thermometer that's what I'm that's what my goal is I've got 20 more degrees to go with the caramels I'll probably take another 20 minutes or possibly a half an hour so just giving you a quick update you keep stirring every I'm not stirring all the time I'm stirring about once every a couple minutes or a minute and it's just a good stir to make sure all the caramel scum is away from the walls and I'll move the thermometer and get all to mix all that in and just keep it together mixed together they'll be fine you", "DENEPPb3c-c": "to make cinnamon and apple cider caramels you will need 700 milliliters of apple cider 115 grams of butter 300 grams of cane sugar

youtube this is everyone days they've seen cool team five six seven eight and where we've just discovered something very amazing and it's chocolate caramel for some reason we were just experimenting and we just made some epic return alright so this is what we made right here it taste is delicious so we got we're going to show you how to make this with sugar water and chocolate so now we'll get into it so you put one cup of sugar let's just hold this up sure for the cause of we us using this a big bag is because oh we don't we actually try not to use all this right here this is very much not in there because we use off of cereal and are so we just put this one more cup of sugar and I should be good put the water now you wait till that goes for a boil because he longed for what we did we slowed it down to about there and we cut the temperature on 250 i believe and then we just keep on stirring waiting to evaporate you might need some more water but we'll see and then we just add some sugar lips I said hit it chocolate it's about the same amount of a couple as dull that's how much we put the water and now you just stir this will become good got that on 250 and then we got to wait so let's use the bubbles I don't know the size of this but it's a good I'll cut it doesn't matter what kind of part you use as long as it's big and you could hold a lot of ingredients we've used different pots for this and it came out good so just wait for it to boil but it up come when we just got to keep on waiting when you see the boil make sure as if you've made some different caramel you're going to see the bubbles after bubbles it's you show is you turn a light texture of golden and then you keep on waiting card up to 340 and then leave it on to this probably want to pull it off pull it down do not panic if you don't see it turned golden remember this is chocolate I'm not going to see gloating around here just cure Brown this so once the texture is smooth you just turn it up to about medium high not too high not too low because of this is probably taking a long time we're just going to cut it off to come around there you mine keep going into it boils for some reason that's not boiling yeah so I patients people yep Troy Derek it took a little time for the chocolate to start boiling cuz yeah you see there we start I blow right there so I see it if you were here you wanna smell just delicious chocolate yeah but you could smell it out home it doesn't matter what kind of chocolate you can use her she anything we have the bottle and it doesn't really matter you could use any type of chocolate floodwater know we have Bosco right here if you have this is acceptable you can even you could even try with anything and if you have strawberry feel like having some strawberries or something you have this reserve and stuff like that so right now it starts to boil as you can see turn our best for like five seconds customer and what we tried something funny where we made a regular caramel and we tried to taste it with our fingers and it still stings he'll run it our fingers about a good ten minutes ago this happen and it still stings deal so after this is cooked I advise you do not put your finger in it and if you're using such parts and you don't know when your parents get home clean it out with some aw with steel wool or burlap I've had if you don't look guns save your life yep trust us we've just cleaned up we had a little bit of us just keep on staring so we stir this for about a good five to fifteen minutes yep and you guys could also use a primer so so when it's done should always don't walk away from the pot because this is very dangerous you might actually catch your stove on fire and then you might have to leave your house and trust me I do not want that to happen we put some soup in here to wash it out water running to get stuck in there once i get stuck it's a whole process to get it out exactly and you when you when i get stuck in there just make sure you put it over a medium pan or put it all the way up jump make sure your friend doesn't get fun but should be like around here temperature get closer look 250 300 350 case you don't see it or we cut it up slightly so guys just waited solely on boiling have something like this to put your chocolate and caramel or anything and don't use any material may stuff like this because it will burn a hole through and they won't pop but it'll make a big popping like oh like you have on pizza this little those little bit a little boy Eric don't find them pizzas you know all right I should be it was like what the hell is this you know we we toss it right there and you see it getting burned it's not fully burnt so we're just going to try we're going to test it out like putting it in a little white cup alright so we're just going to leave that there pick it off though yep and we get a little cup here make sure it's like a clear color like white cuz if you use any other color like a dark color you're not going to exactly see what you're making let's just use it on here goes you know yes Troy a great color is good anything bright really if you got see it settling down like this you guys would just wait see if it's burnt when it settles down it's nothing yo grant trust me you'll know when its breath if it sticks your nose burn but this seems just about right so we're going to take it here and test it into a container all right we put it over to sink would you not want this you see God's we use a lot of brillo pads over here that's what I miss when it burns yep yes put her here put it somewhere safe all right you see the color to the de chocolate be careful when grabbing the sides you might want to use mittens you know this this without Boyle though we're going to pour the Sun you can smell the chocolate smelly just pour it into the container here we do it over the sink because of what happens before it got all over the place while we try to do this now as you can see it's just settling in right now once this happens you put in the fridge for good while let order the freezer it really doesn't matter word of advice do not it still feels warm but not too hot do not put your finger inside yeah you'll see so right now because of our other things that happened to our town though we're going to put it in the freezer right here put it down below leave the top off the feast on the taller we have something to show you guys this is our caramel yeah the caramel you see this all you can see the size is extremely hot so be careful yeah it did not decide to pop it up there and yeah we kind of got burnt as you can see it kind of looks like two chocolate over here yeah do not touch this guy's this will be this is what we did we put our finger in and we felt and we made consequences that we are though didn't go so yep so as you see before we put the caramel in the fries and the fridge and it didn't look like this else this is dark chocolate as we check our original chocolate I will be discovered it with really taste good we're going to one this up tonight we're gonna eat it early you know use that and install so this is reborn days HD cool team five six seven eight and we're out be face", "ebNXY-OGiR8": "hey guys a snack and boil here today I'm going to try tricks I'm pretty sure everybody have heard of tricks the normal tricks like as a chocolate that has like a caramel inside but this time i'm going to try the tricks cappuccino flavor it looks for you alright awesome because i never tried the cappuccino flavor and it's kind of knew I think because I've never seen this kind of flower before so I'm very excited to try this cappuccino flavored tricks now due to limited edition as well so yeah I thought yes we'll see

just melts in your mouth Wow guys if you like coffee and put this is the perfect combination you could ever get em dukes cappuccino awesome try ass man this is awesome anyways thanks for watching select my videos please subscribe", "fHkaIEzeCkg": "today welcome to Todd's kitchen I wanna go make caramel at a can and I've also made caramel on a microwave but since then everyone's been asking me how to do it on the stove and it's actually very simple but I'm going to do it today with a twist so join me today as I make my version of chocolate caramels I have a pot on the stove on a medium heat so it's now we're going to add in our butter now I will list all the ingredients in the description and to that our white sugar then our brown sugar and then our corn syrup now we can't find brown sugar or corn syrup in your country I'll leave a link down below to the videos where I show you how to make your own okay so we're just going to continuously stir this now until all the sugar is dissolved the butter is melted and it starts to come to a slight boil so next I have some milk chocolate here now you can use milk chocolate or dark chocolate it's completely up to you so I'm going to place that into the pot and next we're going to add in 1 can of sweetened condensed milk ok so just turn it down to a medium to low heat so we're going to stir it every same minute or two just make sure it all stays together and that it doesn't burn on the bottom but for this step we're going to use a thermometer now these are very inexpensive I got this off Amazon for about I think is ten to fifteen dollars so they're very cheap and what we wanted to get up to is a firm ball stage so we wanted to get up to about 245 degrees Fahrenheit or 120 degrees Celsius so give this a good stir where you say two to three minutes just so it all stays as nice and combined and you know risk burning the bottom and it should take about thirty minutes okay so as you can see it has now reached firm ball stage so I said it'd take about half an hour texture taken close to 45 minutes but it takes longer than that that's fine it's just one of those recipes we just need a bit of patience if it takes a bit longer it makes no difference whatsoever as long as it gets to the right temperature so now we're going to take this straight off the stove okay next I'm just going to dish you just line the base with some non-stick baking paper they can make it as thick or as thin as you like it's really up to you it makes no difference so it's just a simple matter of pouring a mixture into the dish okay once it's all in there we can let this sit here room temperature for about say six to eight hours and that time it's going to completely set okay so this has been setting for a number of hours now and look at that it's nice in boom it should just pop right up okay so I've cut some up and look at that they're fantastic now this recipe actually made twice this amount so I still got playing ball here but it really is a very simple and easy chocolate caramel to make and also very chewy so trying to get stuck into it too much too soon but let's give one a try what's chewy that's not sticky chewy okay it's a little sticky too yeah but oh my that tastes good that is an incredible infusion of caramel and chocolate all in one caramels always been a weakness of mine and well so is chocolate let's be honest everyone loves chocolate but when you put it both together it really does raise the bar that much more in taste but of course when you put chocolate and caramel together in a nice neat little package like this it tastes simply delish now the best way to store these would be in an airtight container in the fridge but when you are ready to have them just take them out of the fridge and let them warm up to room temperature for about say half an hour you'll just find they're a lot easier to chew but until then thank you for watching this episode of Todd's kitchen as always a list of ingredients are

About a week ago i made caramel in a can and everyone loved it because it was just so simple to make and you can use it on desserts or even in recipes. Today i am going to make a different version but its just as simple. So join me as i make as i make my version of caramel in a microwave. okay so to start off with and this is how simple it is, into a bowl we are going to pour in half a cup of corn syrup or glucose syrup depending on what country you're from Then to that a quart cup of melted butter. All the ingredients are in the description the half a cup of sweetened condensed milk Then a quarter teaspoon of salt just to enhance the flavour Then half a cup of white sugar and half a cup of brown sugar. And yes you do need the brown sugar so i highly recommend that you use it. So using a whisk give that a very good mix around until it is completely combined. So once it is mixed through what we are going to do now is place this into the microwave on high and place it in there for six minutes. But every two minutes take it out and give it a very good stir. Next i have a baking dish here and i have lined the base with some non stick baking paper and left some over hang as it makes it easier to pick it up. So while being extremely careful because this is very very hot, we are going to pour that caramel\nonto the base And make sure you wash the bowl straight away other wise you will have a harder time later on So what we are going to do is let this cool down for a couple of hours then place it in the fridge for a couple of more hours then it will be ready. okay so i have just taken this out of the fridge and its set. So it should just pull straight out. and there we have our lovely block of caramel. So just use a warm\nknife and we are going to start making some slices. And there we have it, some lovely lovely caramel Now this has to be the easiest way i have ever made solid chewy caramel Now my microwave is eleven hundred Watts so if yours is greatly less say six hundred then just add thirty seconds to the time and it should be enough. But enough of that lets see what its like As you can see its and and soft That is defiantly very chewy. Caramel has always been one of my favorites flavours ever. I guess you could say its one of my weaknesses so for someone who loves Carmel i can honestly say this is fantastic, it really really is   but the best part about this caramel is it\ntastes simply delish So if you are a huge caramel fan like myself and like most other people Give this a go because i know you will love it.

haven't tried these yet but anyways I had a pull in here and get me a coffee at McDonald's DePaul's I just got off work and I totally needed tastes delicious okay so I've all seen something spice all caramel from the Dollar General yesterday and I'm like yes I need to try these I know it'll be awesome but all you don't rub pumpkin stock row so I'm going to have a total on here and see what they taste like course they're free route oh yes please worship Him I'm trying to dislike mr. taste we were like what I think it takes hello honestly it's a very large company taste you can taste the sauce part but what this reminds me of is the bucket pumpkin pie an old fashioned something pop but it's not as strong with a very very lot something time these are amazing eyes so these are a dollar a bag at the Dollar General and I've told a couple people I would review these guys are good hmm it reminds me of one of the pumpkin spice latte from Starbucks yes how has that walk go up on top you can taste the creaming as them delicious guys so totally recommend oh and I hope everybody's having a wonderful day and then off here and drink my coffee two more things and I'll probably not later bye

still happy Friday for us though and they will say happy Friday in the UK and that happy Saturday bye YouTube see in a minute take care", "pxGDDVNzq7A": "hi I'm Anthony and I'm going to show you how to make caramel candies and first step is just to get your ingredients ready your first ingredient is sugar 1 cup of white granulated sugar that's seven and a half ounces ingredient number two isn't quite so obvious it's a quarter cup of light corn syrup you're probably asking well why corn syrup let's find out this is sucrose take a fable sugar it's made up of a bunch of carbons and some oxygens and some hydrogen's to fill the clutch and as you probably already know sucrose has a tendency to form crystals and you can heat those crystals up or dissolve them in water and it becomes a liquid but as soon as it dries out or cools down it's going to become a crystal again and if you're making candy with sugar sucrose then that's going to lead to a sort of grainy sandy texture in your candy you don't want that especially in caramels so one method to prevent the crystallization of sucrose once it's in a liquid form is to introduce some sort of acid like lemon juice or cream of tartar what that does is split sucrose down the middle into glucose and fructose which won't crystallize unfortunately since assets tastes a little sour you can bite into a lemon if you want to test that your candy is not going to be a sweet and you probably want your candy to be sweet so another solution to prevent sucrose from crystallizing is to introduce something else that prevents the sucrose molecules from touching each other and actually forming crystals sort of like creating a barrier around the molecules so that they don't form crystals with one enough and that's where the corn syrup comes in and i'll demonstrate let's suppose these three-dimensional blogs are sucrose molecules when you push them together in one space they have this tendency to form a crystal a sugar crystal but you can tear them apart by melting them with heat or dissolving them and add something like say warm syrup then pushing them together the corn syrup interferes with these molecules ability to recrystallize and so you don't get this grainy texture as if you are biting into a sugar cube you get a smoother texture as if this were still a liquid and that's what you want for a caramel and nice thing about corn syrup is that it's mostly glucose anyway so it'll add sweetness to your candy and also be completely flavorless next ingredient is four tablespoons of butter that's half a stick and the fat will serve a similar purpose as the corn syrup the salt will accent the sweetness and this is salted butter so that's alright but if you're using unsalted butter you're going to want to add about a quarter teaspoon of this stuff and your last big ingredient is going to be one cup of heavy cream again that's more fat to prevent recrystallization of the sugar plus the proteins in the cream will react with the sugar and create that dark brown caramel color that is characteristic of caramel plus it's pretty tasty vanilla extract is an optional ingredient but it adds a nice start off with a glass pan about two quarts be the size you want and line it with either parchment paper wax paper or aluminum foil any of those will work but if you use aluminum foil you're probably going to want to grease the aluminum foil once it's in the pan just to guarantee that your candy won't stick to it sometimes I have problems with aluminum foil sometimes I don't so with ingredients on hand grab yourself a fairly large size cooking pot roberson mixing and then start tossing in your ingredients one after the other but the only thing I'd hold off on is the vanilla is if you cook it too long then you'll cook the flavor away and then though what's appointing and adding it at that point so remember save with vanilla to the end and in the corn syrup turn the heat on to about medium so it looks like my butter is about melting so now I'm going to add this to the pot this is a candy thermometer and it's absolutely vital for this process and I'll tell you why so you may or may not have realized it but the cream and butter that you have any mixture have moisture do they have water in them and water changes it stayed at 212 degrees it becomes steam it evaporates so liquid water itself will not get above 212 degrees because it turns with something else at that one but your candy in the mixture is actually going to want to get much hotter the sugar will get way hotter than 212 but the water in it because it has this 212 cap is actually going to cool down the whole mixture so as water evaporates the less water you have the less cooling you have and the less cooling you have the hotter your candy can actually get and it turns out when your candy is about 250 degrees maybe a little bit lower than that then enough water has evaporated and create the perfect proportion between water and sugar to where if you pour it out and let it cool you can cut it up and it'll be they'll be solid pieces that you can hold in your hand but they'll still help in your mouth so I've got my candy thermometer in you want to make sure this little nub the point that actually reads the temperature is not touching the bottom of the pan otherwise you're going to get a reading on the pan and not the liquid that's inside the pan and it's not such a problem with this monitor that had this little foot on the bottom but it's just something below and this just clips to the side here so something to note is that once it gets to this boiling stage and mixing it too much will help those sucrose molecules find each other and reform crystals so you want to minimize mixing but you still want to stir it a little bit just so that your things are even and so the thermometer will get a reading on the average temperature not just the temperature at the side of the pan so check this up now in about 20 minutes into the cooking process and it's almost almost done it's almost reach 250 this is way thicker it's got that dark amber color from the proteins and the cream reacting with the sugar so it's looking a lot more like caramel and it's smelling are more like here I'll too so this is all good sign that things are going according to plan so far just a few more minutes all right we're just about at 250 here I turned off the heat final mix take this bad boy out stove and pour this into the prepared pan I do it pretty quickly that stuff hardens quite fast in the meantime you'll remember the hand we cooked in is now coated with hardened caramel and that's going to be a pain to scrub but this is just sugar and fat and it'll melt with you so if you fill this thing up with water put it back on the stove heat the water up to boiling for a little bit will practically clean itself this caramel now is about half way cool I can tell because it's still soft in the middle but when I lift it up it holds its shape I'm going to pull it out of this pan and use this time to do a little bit of cutting and shaping of course you can cut this just straight I'm going to cut it at an angle though that way I can make some nice diamond shaped pieces all right let's reveal true crush equals glucose fructose sucrose forms crystals if you normally don't want in your cannon because it forms a gritty sandy sort of texture and can prevent that with corn syrup corn syrup plus sucrose will prevent the sucrose from actually forming Chris bunch of sucrose is in its liquid form 204 few degrees is known as the firm ball stage it's perfect for Carla represents the perfect combination between water and sugar very much higher than that you get a really hard candy very much lower than that I think they're soft caramel thoughts I'd never hardens protein or sugar over each horse causes a chemical reaction which gives us the caramel color and new concept candy equals delicious so if you have any tips know any tricks have any questions leave a comment let me know otherwise happy cooking", "cW_atQyE-Ps": "hi this is Kim I'm in the kitchen and today we are going to go into making both a caramel that's how I say it I'm gonna go with that you could also see caramel or caramel but a caramel sauce versus a caramel caramel now what we won't be making is toffee that's different like that real hard crunchy thing not so much but you will get to see the subtle variation when you want to make a caramel sauce versus a caramel stick with me caramel caramel caramel pick your poison there are kind of two versions the first is the kind that you would want to use as a sauce so say you want to have a pourable sauce to serve at the table with a dessert or you want something that you can put into the fridge and reuse over and over again you're gonna make a sauce for that and I go into detail so this is this has been sitting for five hours or so at room temperature this is what the sauce looks like you can see it's milky right this is the consistency it's still horrible it's obviously thicker than you know just cream but it's very portable but makes a delightful sauce and so this is at room temperature okay this is the kind that I more call caramel or caramel rather than a sauce and you can see it's it's clearer right I'll sure one is milkier one is more clear alright we've cooked off a lot more of the cream to make this version and so you can see the consistency of this it's a lot more like jelly right it still will pour a bit but it's much thicker and you can see as I stirred it kind of stays clump together so this has been at room temperature about three hours made them after the first one and so I made some yesterday so you can see what happens so this one is the see if you can guess this one is the more caramel version that's been put in the fridge and then I took it out to be room two so this is room temperature again and you can see it's like it's more like butter like hard more hard it's not hard like it is and you know you can you can scoop it around but it's not a sauce right this is the sauce version and you can see it's creamier now it's still sort of thick a little too thick for a sauce use but you can see it's starting to go this I did the same thing I put it in the fridge overnight and then I took it out to get to room temperature now here's trick I can reheat this one carefully to be back to this I can't reheat this one so if I try to look like one time out of 20 it work but for the most part if i reheat this one even carefully it's going to separate so if you're making this situation you need to use it the day of and just leave it out you know if you if you're using it later you can make it ahead this is perfectly fine right like say you're having a little keto ice cream party and you want this for later you know a dollop of that on it would be lovely you know you might use this to do something like make more like a pecan pie kind of thing or so there are a lot of uses for this but this is a day of situation people okay so this one the sauce can be kept in the fridge I would bring it out if you want to reuse it later for best use used AF it's my honest opinion but bring it out to room temperature but sometimes you'd like to make a lot you want to use it a little at a time starting over um keep it in the fridge take it out let it get back to room temperature put it in a pan on low like as low as you can go you're heating it very slowly and as it just as it heats to a more disturbing consistency take it off the heat because it's that cream and butter together it can separate really easily so you're going real gentle with that you can't put it in the microwave bad things will happen again you might get lucky in one time out of 20 it kind of worked but as far as I can tell really dicey again I thought this was I just think it's really cool how this one is so translucent I mean I guess not completely but it's you know the color is so much less milky obviously because we've cooked off so much more of the cream and it's just a matter of a couple of minutes difference in cooking now what affects the color of your caramel is how long you browned the butter I go on the cautious side if you brown it longer than I do you get a browner caramel but you'll also get more of a burnt butter situation risk and you can often end up with a little little flecks in there which you might love if you like that kind of burnt butter taste go for it but I kind of like it in the safe zone especially when I'm teaching you guys mmm then you get mad if it doesn't work but there you go on how to make either caramel sauce or caramel sauce or caramel or caramel too many pecan pecan I don't know where you live call it what you will okay first we're going to need a flat bottomed sauce pan so it needs some surface area touching the burner it can't be too narrow at the bottom you want it more wide than it is tall and what we're going to do is we are going to put that on a medium heat and then what we're gonna do after that is cube up a stick of butter which is a half a cup and then we're going to allow that to melt and then we are going to let that simmer checking it occasionally by sort of rolling the butter in the pan because the foam on top will sort of obscure it you know check it about them every minute or so and we'll let it come over about five minutes from a yellow color and then it will become sort of a slightly more golden color and then it'll turn more amber we want to make sure it's not burning so you want to make sure you keep an eye on this but once it becomes that nice amber color we're gonna add our sweetener I use brown sugar swerve it enhances the darkness and gives it a caramel E flavor yes it's a little cheat but it works and we're going to stir that in really well now I don't like it very sweet which is strange because caramel is usually very sweet but I like it a more buttery flavor and so I just used two tablespoons if you want it sweeter you can use more everything else will remain the same oh I forgot to say I use salted butter like a nice high-quality salted butter like a clover like a local dairy or you can use a Kerrygold you're gonna want that to be a nice quality butter because you really taste it and then we are going to let that simmer with the sweetener in it until it turns sort of a caramel color right it's gonna get thicker and richer and color again really being careful not to let it burn you can give it a little stir every once in a while to check but once it comes to a thick consistency the color is glossy and it's caramel in color we are going to at that point add the cream and then optional but a lovely addition is maybe six or so drops of a sweet leaf stevia in an English toffee or vanilla and then we are going to let that come to a full simmer like a fairly active simmer you don't want it to boil because then it you know that means like big bubbles are coming up and it's gonna boil over but it's it's not a low simmer it's it's pretty pretty significant simmer and we're just gonna keep that on the simmer until it starts to darken and thicken and as you notice it's getting darker and thicker and you see the bubbles are a little bigger because it's getting more concentrated at about the five or six minute mark you want to check on it and see does it seem like the consistency basically of a sauce you know am I seeing am i seeing a thickness or richness in that sauce that wasn't there before as some of the liquid has boiled out so give it a stir to check and if you think so pop a spoon in it and look at the back of that spoon it should have a nice coat it shouldn't be spotty and if that seems to be happening at that point which again is usually around the five or six maybe seven maybe eight you know somewhat how much heat you've been using because there can be some variation there we'll we'll change that up a bit but once you feel like yeah we're pretty much there remembering as it cools to room temperature will thickens slightly more remove it from the heat put it on another burner that's not been hot and let it cool for about thirty minutes and then what you should see is something like this a nice thick yet pourable sauce consistency that's sort of a warm cream golden color and you can check it again with a spoon and it should be pretty thick on the back of that spoon and at that point you have your caramel sauce okay but say you didn't want a pourable sauce you wanted actual you know thick dark caramel more like what you would buy in a jar of caramel right so just pretend we didn't do that last part of taking off the heat and allow it to continue to boil I'm sorry I said boil I meant to say simmer so allow it to continue to simmer it's gonna simmer until it can it gets very concentrated and much darker and you can check it by whisking it at this point and you'll see that it's still slightly more liquidy and we're gonna get it let it go for a couple more minutes you'll notice it gets another level browner and when it starts to no longer in my opinion be called a sauce what we're doing is we are gonna see that it is glossy err and thicker and darker the point at which I consider it done is when it's you can see it's reduced in size significantly and it feels like it's kind of holding together with some thickness so when you stir it you can see those whisk marks in it you can see that it's kind of moving as a mass a bit in the pan and so give it a quick hard stir and you'll see it kind of feels almost like a solid shape at that point I feel like it is done and you can see this visually as it starts to change over into a more brown glossy caramel I at that point take it off of the heat and let it cool for about 10 minutes because this one actually want to use while it's still kind of warm but you definitely don't want it so hot it's gonna burn you when you use it you should be able to stick your finger in it and it's just warm not hot and you can see here that it is glossy it is dark it is definitely shiny you get a very shiny effect with this and again you know if you boiled it slightly I keep saying boiled if you simmered it slightly less if you when it was in the sort of browning butter stage it will have a slightly lighter color but the glossiness and the consistency will be the same even if you didn't take it as far in the Browning stage but maybe at this last stage of making caramel you cooked it a little too long and you notice it's kind of gloopy it's not really silky and lovely well there's an easy fix for most times just toss in like a tablespoon of cream take it off the heat immediately turn that heat off and then vigorously whisk that cream in it'll back it up a couple of minutes just quickly so and then let it cool from that stage it won't work a hundred percent of the time but if you catch it at the right moment that can back it up a step and fix the problem all right I hope you've enjoyed this tutorial if you have questions please let me know be prepared for some color variation when you make it at different times that's just gonna happen unless you are making it over and over again in exactly the same circumstances with exactly the same amount of stirring there will be some slight variation it will still taste the same it will be delicious have a great time bye", "TiMMYEwaQwc": "cheryl johnson presents the best of kitchen creations home edition today we're making caramel apples hi i'm cheryl johnson of cheryl's catering in ukiah california i've been sharing some of my favorite recipes with people lately from over the years and one of the best recipes that people just love is my vanilla caramels so i'm going to share that recipe with you and show you how it's done then we're going to dip apples into the caramel and make caramel apples and take it one step further and roll it in popcorn and make what i like to call popple apples so let's get started and see how these popple apples are done making candy requires a thermometer to get the exact temperature i like to use a second clip from another candy thermometer it seems to work better clip it on so that there's a little bit of room underneath the thermometer so that it gets an accurate temperature and it's not reading off the bottom of the pan the first thing i put in is one cup of butter which is 16 tablespoons or two quarter pound sticks place the butter in a pan that's large enough to not foam over when it boils and then turn the heat on to a medium temperature and get the butter to melt a little bit as soon as you have a little pool of melted butter you can add the sugar measure out two cups full of white granulated sugar and then you add it into the pan with the melting butter the reason these caramels are going to be so tasty and delicious is because we're using real butter and real vanilla in this recipe stir the sugar a little bit into the butter and get it to melting slightly and then it's time to add the heavy whipping cream one cup of heavy whipping cream and make sure it's the heavy whipping cream and not the light cream you won't get the same texture and thickness and the thickness is very important for a caramel they can't be so soft they won't hold their shape and they can't be so tough that they pull your fillings out it has to be somewhere in the middle an exact temperature is very important too once the butter sugar and cream have melted somewhat it's time to add the two cups of dark corn syrup which is a 16 ounce bottle this is a non high fructose corn syrup i like to drain all the corn syrup out of the bottle to make sure that the recipe comes out correctly one trick that i like to do is to just set the bottle on the spoon sitting in the pan and just let all the corn syrup drain out once i'm satisfied the bottle is drained i will continue to cook and stir until the sugar and the butter are melted the mixture is very thin right now when we get closer to the end you'll see it start to thicken up quite a bit while the mixture continues to cook over medium heat i'll wash and dry my apples clip the stems off and then poke them with a skewer or a popsicle stick and these will be the apples we're going to make caramel apples out of make sure all the sticks are straight up and let the caramel cook for quite a while it's got probably about a half an hour to go over the medium heat and it's starting to boil it will start to foam up somewhat so that's why we want to have a pot that's big enough to cook in this is the centigrade side of the thermometer this is the fahrenheit side fahrenheit is the side that we use here in the united states and we're going to cook the caramel up to about 244 degrees we stick the thermometer into the boiling liquid making sure that the bottom isn't touching so that we get a more accurate reading of the liquid and continue to cook and stir and watch the thermometer very very closely to make sure that you can catch it before it gets too high after a while the caramel will start to thicken up it's taking a little bit longer to run off the spoon but it's nowhere near done just yet continue to cook and stir and keep an eye on the liquid make sure that you get the corners so that you don't get any burnt parts because that'll make crispy spots in your caramels later as soon as the thermometer reads just under 244 degrees i'll take it off the heat and add one more cup of heavy whipping cream the reason i take it off just before it reaches 244 is because the heat continues to rise in the time that you get the cream and pour it in it'll rise just a tiny bit of a degree so you don't want it to go over the 244. pour the cream in a little bit slowly and mix it up in there and that's going to thin out the caramel once again but it will thicken right back up as soon as i bring it back to temperature the temperature i'm going to bring it back up to is 247 degrees just two more degrees above what we brought it to previously i'm going to make sure my sticks are all straight in my apples and that they're nicely air dried for the dipping process and get my wax paper ready on a sheet pans that'll give the apples a nice stable base to firm up on after they've been dipped i like to butter the wax paper a little bit to make sure that they don't stick the caramel will thicken up nicely as it gets close to the 247 degrees that we need to get it finished and once it's finished we're going to pour in pure vanilla one teaspoon of pure vanilla and that's why they're vanilla caramels because they actually do have vanilla in them since the vanilla has alcohol in it it tends to foam a little bit so you want to stir it carefully and slowly until it's all incorporated into the creamy buttery delicious caramel it's going to smell so good you can just pour it over ice cream right now and have a nice caramel sundae don't forget the nuts and the cherry see how it holds its shape once it's fairly warm not really hot but it's holding its shape well that's when the apples can be dipped the caramel won't be so hot as to cook the apple soft i make sure and coat the apple nicely and then once it's coated it can be eaten plain or rolled in nuts or different candies and placed on the buttered wax paper to firm up in about a half hour they're ready to be enjoyed or you can roll them in popcorn and make what i like to call a pupple apple i press the popcorn on it like a popcorn ball and that adds a little bit of fun and festivity to the whole caramel apple thing these make a nice addition to a halloween party or a thanksgiving dessert buffet i like to make them pretty by wrapping them in cellophane and tying them with a colorful bow that helps keep them fresher for a few days the rest of the caramel will be poured into a buttered four by eight inch pan and if it doesn't pour easily i can always heat it up just a little bit to get it to a better consistency it goes into the pan and then it becomes very nice and smooth and solidifies into a nice creamy caramel overnight sometimes i cut the caramel into squares and dip them in melted chocolate or white chocolate or make a round log and roll it in nuts then you can make slices off of it rather than wrap each one individually this delicious caramel is great on a caramel apple but i find them a little hard to eat so i like to chop up a few nuts slice up the apple and wrap it in a strip of caramel then i like to dip it into the walnuts and make an appetizer sized piece of caramel apple that's a lot easier to eat for wrapping the caramels individually i cut little pieces of wax paper so that they can be wrapped and put into little boxes or ziploc bags for gift giving or just to have around the house for people to enjoy i like to butter the knife before cutting the caramel that way it doesn't have as much drag on the knife and tends to not stick as much you cut a little strip off the end and then pry it up out of the pan it likes to stick back to itself so you have to work quickly once you have the strip out of the pan it's time to cut it into little individual squares to be wrapped up i like to cut my strips of wax paper up ahead of time because caramels can be very sticky and you want them all ready for you when you go to wrap them you just wrap them long ways and then twist the sides together so that it makes a cute little piece of old-fashioned homemade caramel candy people love these caramels they love papple apples they love caramel apples and the caramels themselves are just buttery and delicious and if i don't make these every year for christmas i'm in big trouble look at how soft and chewy and they just melt in your mouth these popple apples are really fun and kids love them and adults like them too they add a festivity to any occasion so you can eat them off the stick or you can cut them up into wedges with a knife and eat them in a more sophisticated manner so either way enjoy your papal apple your caramel apples and your caramel you can give those away as gifts for christmas or just have them around as treats people really like those caramels so if you make them you'll probably have lots of friends thanks for sharing my kitchen with me i'm cheryl johnson of cheryl's catering

on to the prettiest chocolate oh yeah ah and there is a cheat sheet in here and pictures of the cheat sheet the cheat sheet has a lot in it yeah this has more than that and we have to figure out which

clues like skipping parties on my channel like Skippy you know Skippy bikes that we have this yeah that's what it tastes like Skippy had that though the tics are candy there's a candy with that cop uniform mm-hmm and I've had man did you guys yeah that Hedgehog just says many hedgehog doesn't say what's in it what is this one that's what you won state look it looks like a truffle do that

e texturally so you can share that with you know it's like a dark chocolate but it's not better it's I don't want to say it's bland but it's not strong or it wasn't to me do you think that's strong at all but yeah that one wasn't strong this was a coffee hold me don't you act like that that's like a 75% but it has nothing else it's not the others never lose it's dark it's going so cool yeah it does

little bit of saltiness in there there's a cherry bomb what this one that's another ball they're not a lot of them are not strong flavors to me you don't want anymore this is so sweet is this one just some kind of radio the one in the middle like what's the purpose you know we have to see what it is the middle none of them say they're rap I don't know maybe they'll definitely get eaten though but in all fairness we've done a lot of reviews tonight and so I'm just lost it's a lot of sugar peanut butter cup for something that's marriage that's Matt Richardson it's math yeah I tried to rip it I hate truly that's a man no that's mint fudge I can't believe nobody picked this one wait caramel caramel oh look it exploded I don't want that one you idiot oh wow is your curiosity wasn't as strong

chocolate better enjoy your I spend a lot of money on this so I definitely want to try this phonetic very very very nutty like this remember the innovate Delft this one you can see how much we ate here that is a coffee yeah but I'm only good at talking with the best it's good quality chocolate it's really good it's not quite as sweet as what you get with the winner I was the first one we hate women's is sweeter and Russell Stover's is sweeter I have to say that these were these were kind of more diluted flavors but they were still good so that would have to be a maybe of vanilla caramel so I hope you all enjoyed this and I will catch you next time", "qIRyjXztg4o": "today on the domestic geek I'm going to show you how to make soft chewy salted caramel bites these make the most incredible gift or just keep them all for yourself now this salted caramel I promise you will absolutely blow your mind but it is a bit of a labor of love so you want to make sure that you have all your ingredients prepared beforehand and all of the utensils that you are going to need in addition I have prepared a pan like this all I've done is taken some parchment paper and laid it out in two sheets across a nine by nine baking pan I also have greased it with a little bit of canola oil be sure to prepare your pan beforehand then I've set out all my ingredients we have a cup and a half of sugar a quarter cup of corn syrup a quarter cup of water then we have a cup of cream a quarter cup of butter and a quarter of a teaspoon of salt to that we're going to add a tablespoon of vanilla now I also have two pots standing by so I have a small saucepan this is going to heat our cream our butter and our salt and then I have a much larger saucepan now you want to make sure when you're working with sugar that you're working with a large saucepan because it tends to bubble up whenever you add anything I also have a candy thermometer now I highly recommend if you were going to be making caramel to invest in a candy thermometer mine was $8 but it's totally worth the investment because honestly temperature can make or break your caramel the other thing that is worth the investment is a good pastry brush now basically I just dampen this with some water and we're going to use it to brush the sides of the pan just in case any rogue sugar crystals get outside of the actual sugar mixture itself one little sugar crystal can ruin your entire batch of caramel so we're going to start by heating our cream mixture now we're going to do this over about medium heat in our large saucepan we are going to mix a quarter cup of water a quarter cup of corn syrup and then a cup and a half of good old-fashioned sugar you really want to work on pouring your sugar in the center of your pot you were trying to avoid getting any along the sides and then just using a spatula you should incorporate it until all of the sugar is moistened and then we're going to turn our heat to about medium hot what we're looking for is this sugar to heat up to 300 degrees so our cream mixture is heated our butter is melted and we want to turn this off the heat because we don't want to scold this she's going to use my damp pastry brush brush down the sides to make sure I haven't gotten any sugar crystals up the side of the pan now once we start heating this we never stir it again you'll start to see some small bubbles forming around the side as it heats and then eventually it will all fill in and become just one big bubbly concoction a couple quick notes of caution when you are working with candy the first thing is you never want to leave it unattended it burns very quickly in addition to that this concoction gets very very hot and can scold you very easily so use extreme caution so our sugar has reached 300 degrees turn off the heat in goes our cream and butter mixture this will bubble up so just be very cautious as you're mixing we are going to turn the heat back on and now we're going to wait for the temperature to return to about 245 degrees all right so we have reached two hundred and forty-five degrees we are going to take this guy off the heat we're going to add a splash of vanilla you're going to see quite a reaction when that vanilla gets added a man we want to make sure when we're stirring it we are not scraping the bottom because you don't want any burnt bits coming off we're just gonna slam it on the counter a couple times to get out any air bubbles that may have formed while it was cooking then we're gonna leave this and let it set for about thirty minutes all right so our caramel has been setting for about 30 minutes now it's time to just top it with some salt I'm using pink Himalayan sea salt but you could use any salt you like you could use some fleur de sel or some coarse sea salt you just want to make sure that you can see it on the surface because it adds a really beautiful aesthetic to your final product our beautiful caramel is perfectly set it's been sitting for about two and a half hours now as you can see is very sticky which is why it's so critical that we really boiled our parchment paper well and look at that because we're going to be giving these away as gifts we're just going to discard this sighs this is all for you to eat don't sweat now when you're cutting this caramel you want to make sure you are using a really sharp knife and that you have secured your cutting board to the counter I would not want to see any accidents and what you have are these perfect little chewy caramel bites look at the texture of that now you can imagine just by looking at it how chewy it's going to be but of course I'll taste it just in case oh my gosh what I've done is created these little wax paper rectangles these are perfect for a wrapping and rolling each individual little caramel bite now I like to put its salt side down to preserve the sort of prettiness of that then just twist make these I promise you will not be disappointed they are worth every moment that you put into them and they totally melt in your mouth subscribe to the domestic geek for more deliciousness just like this", "NGkE3fjSFZI": "I've recently been thinking about the differences between the way I make my caramels and the way they might be mass produced in a factory I'm not really sure how they go about it in a factory but for me the process begins with the gathering of the tools I need a pot a spatula a thermometer a brownie pan a cooling rack a cutting board a big-ass knife some wax paper and a pair of scissors the next step is to get the ingredients together looking on the back of a bag of craft traditional caramels I find the following ingredient list corn syrup sugar skim milk palm oil way from milk salt artificial flavor soy lecithin so my recipe only shares two ingredients in common sort of sugar and milk and I kind of know what all the other stuff is except for the soy lecithin in any case the ingredients that I use our sugar milk cream simple syrup butter brown sugar and vanilla once I've got all the ingredients I throw everything into a pot except the vanilla and start cooking for caramels you cook the candy to what's called the firm ball stage which is a temperature between 244 and 248 degrees to prevent the sugars from crystallizing which will mess up the taste of the caramel it's crucial that you slowly heat the candy to the proper temperature and that you steer it constantly generally this takes about 45 minutes so while I am doing that let me share with you when I found out when I investigated what soy lecithin actually is basically it's an edible glue made out of soybeans that helps foods that were not meant to stick together bind with one another this decreases expense in the manufacturing process and helps foods last longer on a shelf soy lecithin is a byproduct created when soy oil goes through a D gumming process to extract oil from the beans they are soaked in hexane to soften them up so they can be ground up and eventually processed in case you didn't know hexanes are also significant components of gasoline shoe and leather glue industrial cleaning and degreasing materials and roofing supplies so the use of such a scary sounding chemical led me to wonder what the impact on health and nutrition might be for soy lecithin the FDA gave the soy industry a big thumbs up in 1999 when it suggested soy may reduce the risk of heart disease looking through other research I found a lot of statements like may reduce cholesterol or could be beneficial in the prevention of cancer but nothing definitive is ever mentioned and it turns out that all of the research that has been conducted has been on raw soy elements and none literally none done on food products in the hopes of finding some specific nutritional info about soy I went to the website for the national soybean research laboratory located on the campus of the University of Illinois on there soy benefits page under the nutritional section amidst a few unfortunate spelling and grammatical errors I located the following to nutritional factoids soy protein is half the cost per pound of meat it can also make bread appear wider I was unable to puzzle out the actual nutritional value of spending less money nor was I able to locate the recommended daily allowance for whiteness the wrapping of the candies is actually the most labor-intensive part of the process it involves a slow and tedious cutting up of wax paper into small pieces and then wrapping each piece of candy for me it often serves as a time for reflection on a number of different things I don't really remember why i started making candy but i keep doing it for a number of reasons i really enjoy the process of it as i get to pretend i'm like some kind of mad scientist alchemist i also enjoy the look on people's faces when they try one of my caramels are hard candies and secretly i'm hoping that my skills as a candymaker might find some use in case of a global economic breakdown or some other kind of apocalypse that might somehow leave the world bereft of the simple joy of tasting something sweet but i think i derived the most pleasure from just knowing that i made this thing and i made it without relying on any shortcuts nor compromising quality for the sake of saving a few pennies it really makes me wonder what the world would be like if everything that was made followed the same simple guidelines how different would it be I suppose it's hard to say", "_q_CFaXq9Qk": "the ingredients you will need are one and a half

doubling the recipes so our four tablespoons of butter are going to be eight tablespoons of butter which is one stick you're good alright yeah so I'm sick of butter and we're going to turn on go ahead oh yeah we got the right firm area that's awesome they're like medium high six at first that sounds good okay and then we need two cups of whipping cream so stick that up is really good it's one of my favorite foods in the whole world yes one pint is exactly two cups oh sweet okay so I want to measure it yeah go ahead just pour it in okay two cups of wooden yeah and um you know we usually felt at least one honey cake I never really measure things I I ball it so sometimes my husband says that things might not turn out that way nice thing about butter and whipping cream are they're measured pretty much measuring already yeah so the next thing we need is some honey this is some local honey and it's actually pretty um solid right now but I'll be perfect it tastes awesome as clover honey and we need it on a cat you never think about how much sugar is in caramel but when you're measuring this all out you're just like equally careful okay so that's probably good Mandy yeah this candy over here I hear can stir it in mmm creamy yeah it smells good already and then once that as melted work I can add three cups of sugar so that will be extra sweet and awesome and we'll just have the baby sniffs mmm she wants a bite already oh she might catch on fire okay can't keep on doing so this is actually really simple there's so many ingredients butter honey whipping cream sugar and then we will add some vanilla and that's it so five ingredients the honey smell king the butter is taking another minute it's looking pretty good I'm thinking another yeah probably my night we can end the sharers okay so the next thing your three cups of sugar okay 103 and we actually turn up the heat go all the way high because we need quick caramel Zoar other candies you need a super high heat and from lots of experience of picking caramel because I love them so much it's a lot easier to cook them on a gas stove top then Electrike is it oh I think so oh yeah you have electric I have a little bit and I don't have much experience with gas yes a lot easier so he will find out today yes I will and I'm motivated to make Carnales tomorrow tomorrow hey sugar is mold yeah oh okay so Network just kick it's going to start kind of boiling and well know that this is actually done when the caramel changes color right now it's kind of a lighter brown it's going to turn darker and then we will know it's done and it will be at 242 244 degrees so do you stir this constantly yeah I do I start constantly another awesome thing about this recipe is it doesn't have corn syrup so if you do not want the heck corn syrup in your caramel this turns out perfect so it's not good for you and honey is super good for you yeah except some milk in it yeah we're hope you don't have had all the good stuff out of it let's just say this candy is good for us yeah it's very very good we should eat it every day it's nutritious all right well grandma is stirring the caramel I can add some butter to our pan and this one helps at the farm on that steak oh wow yeah that's perfect it's a beautiful color mm-hmm it's kind of interesting because it changes to a lighter color and then all dark into having lots and lots of butter no such thing as too much money okay that's a lot of butter but YUM I'll be good yeah so I'm going to just show you the consistency of the caramel right now this would be perfect for toppings on brownies or other things ice cream yeah ice cream other delicious things and you can see it's runny and will harden a bit but it's not perfect yet um one way to tell when the caramel is done if you're cooking to a soft ball stage is to put a drop of caramel into a cup of water and if it collects in a little ball a soft ball then it's a softball stick yeah we can try that too okay so now we have a little bowl of water here drop whoops and let's see nope not done can I have all of it yeah we can try a bottle fall in the water again it's like room temperature oh it's changing color more yeah okay so it's changing color more I think really just one more minute okay oh it smells so good yeah today there isn't a little smell but I know you yeah it's getting even darker some more see the texture of the caramel that comes off the spoon getting a little thicker another hint when you're pouring the caramel from your pot into the butter pan don't scrape the pan that's our thing say food oh yeah that's awesome yep it'll cause the caramel to crystallize and happy you know be sugary yeah yeah and when you eat it um or at the right consistent right pour out as much of it as just pour it out as much as will come out and then you use a spoon later yeah we scrape the rest usually like yeah we cover the rest oh yeah we pour it into the pan usually and then we pour the rest into this bowl or a bowl and then we sneak in eat it you know when it's cool enough to touch yeah how many times you burned your tongue on Oh probably just once I think I learned my lesson well I think it looks good when you think oh oh no there goes a spoon touch it touch it um these could be burned on candy because it sticks to you yeah just burning you before you can get it yeah well why don't we turn off the stove and pour it so something time oh you have enough room there's I don't know I don't have more space is shining on it yeah you're good okay shut up oh love look at that oh and there's a spirit and I have to jump out Wow okay go to get as much caramel as you can here we have that lots of caramel yeah create and then we'll just scrape the rest later of it go to waste alright it is time I think that a caramel has cooled down enough and it is so nice looking isn't it it's beautiful and yeah I'm actually excited me too it's this Jesse's piece yeah we can get one - Jesse first small yeah oh that turned out so good oh it's fine I think she'll be happy with a big piece oh nice okay ready - Eve just stole the caramel okay so there she is eating it oh that looks delicious can you chew it up whoo she likes it she does okay now let's have a piece so as he um yeah right here spike in my hand not the very gourmet but you can actually cut this up and wrap it in parchment paper and get with your friends so this is a perfect treat to make the holidays yeah perfect for the holidays and yeah so there you go now please remember to like this video and subscribe and you can write down the con section if you have ever eaten homemade caramels before so thanks for watching", "TNdBes5CLNw": "this is a six-minute caramel recipe and it's really easy it's one of those dump and go recipes if you are making this so you may want to even double the recipe because it makes a kind of an eight-by-eight pan and if you want to get a nine by 13 just double the recipe so a quarter of a cup and the ingredients are really easy to remember of butter we're using real butter here and now we're going to use a half of a cup of sweetened condensed milk this is the thick sweetened stuff stuff used to make fudge with which as I said we're making fudge later half of a cup of white granulated sugar half of a cup of brown sugar half of a cup of light karo syrup and then vanilla two teaspoons per teaspoon or so of vanilla i'm just going to about 1 teaspoon of vanilla i should say alright so i'm going to mix this together and we're going to cook it for six minutes and we're going to stir it about every minute so Anne's gonna keep me on task here and make sure I don't get talking I don't want to overcook this caramel these are really a nice soft caramel or easy to eat and I promise you they will disappear over the holidays now some things that you need to do to get ready to make the caramels an eight-by-eight pan that we're going to spray with cooking spray caramels going to be really sticky and then we've also got some wax paper that I'm going to this is what we're going to wrap our caramels in and they just look so pretty and they're still very rustic but they're you know they're homemade they're going to be you know if you're giving him for a gift I love getting gifts from my kitchen because they're really gifts from the heart anybody can go out and buy a gift but you know when you make a gift it's just extra special it comes with love just like my kids make homemade cards for me I don't get all mushy you know anything they can go buy a car oh and stir enough of your Bush you talk but you know my kids can go buy a card but it's taking the time to make a card and saying inside that's what makes it extra special lots and lots of really fun holiday events and book signings and things like that coming up over the next couple of weeks I'm actually going to be at Cedar Ridge crafts and Nina today sampling some of my recipes from both of my cookbooks 430 26 anna and i are going to be out there it's going to be great fun so hopefully you'll come and see me I've got both my cookbooks my first cookbook just released this holiday season in full color all those great original recipes and then my second newest cookbook came out just last December so please come out and see us 430 26 and Nina stop stirring okay and alright I don't want to over stir alright so now I'm going to get back to my wax paper and just do several pieces of wax paper like everything old is new again so this may look like something that you grew up with well guess what it's back in style adding that little bit of sea salt so let's talk a little bit about place salt used to be hard to find it used to be expensive now you can pick it up right at the grocery store I know they have it at festival that's where we got ours you can actually buy it right in the salt section of the grocery store you'll be right next to the regular salt and the kosher salt this happens to be a little grinder that you know it's kind of a fun thing but they also just sell it already ground and it's a coarser salt as you're going to see when we do this caramels it's and its really got some great flavor you don't need a lot of it a little bit will do you and it's really got great flavor and texture so that's the one you know kind of a special part of this recipe so you need to pick up some sea salt that you can get it anywhere and don't worry it's not expensive it's a great way to season lots of things stakes you know just you'll use it all the time if you have it okay so we're going to stir again so I'm trying to figure out a way to get my kids to get in a picture for Christmas card this year and if you have teenager when they were little it was easy it was like you get them all dressed in their in their holiday best and you know get picture taken no big deal as they get older it's been tougher so the Christmas cards have gone downhill as far as the they used to be really cute now it's like just get out the snow with the snow hat on or for skiing I'll snap a quick picture well this year they have refused so far this holiday weekend you know the thanksgiving weekend I really tried and they want to know part of it so I'm not sure I'm a little nervous they were getting a little independent they're like mom really we're not we don't need another Christmas card I'm like well I keep saying this will be the last year I keep saying it never is the last year and then they're threatening they said will you be in it too you guys be in it too i said well nobody wants to see Bob and I we don't really change it looks they want to see you has it been six minutes in em no and you get to listen to me talk a little bit more oh gosh anyway come see me at festival foods on sunday i met a few different festival foods locations doing book signings fond du lac before the game at 10 30 to noon sheboygan the beautiful Sheboygan store from 12 to manitowoc 230 to 330 Sunday and then Green Bay West Mason for 30 to 5 30 so coming out and see me in between the game you got to do some grocery shopping anyway I beat all the festival foods not all of them but a four of them on Sunday and all of the festival foods the next several Sundays during the holidays signing okay has it been six minutes yet no you're going to just make me take my good old time okay what I'm going to do is then jump ahead so this is our caramel after it has cooled and set which takes a good couple hours and i'm just going to cut it into pieces and it's you can see how nice and soft it is and it's really easy to cut and you can make up a little squares i'm going to do them in rectangles cuz they're going to be easy to wrap that way and they'll be a nice big piece of caramel blobs caramel ok so now or take some scissors and cut our wax paper we'll get our milles which as I said it's a good thing to spray that pan because it's sticky and you can see the salt on here and we're just going to wrap up the Colonel's this when you get an assembly line going it's really pretty easy and then you twist this way and the other way and there you go Oh stir stir yeah that's the thing you want it to be six minutes you don't want it to be over six minutes you got to stir it every minute tell me when we're at about six minutes but you don't what I look the nice part about it is you don't need one of those candy thermometers or anything like that oh it's starting to smell delicious okay let me wrap one more fun thing to do make these put on some Christmas tunes and you know get into the season I might have to try one of these but I've feeling if I do not gonna be able to talk to oh my gosh it was so good mmm unbelievable six minutes okay hot hot hot if you are making this with the kiddos if you want them to back away at this point it can help wrap but this is seriously hot stuff and we don't want to be anybody getting bird okay so then we take our sea salt generously put that over the top so you get a little bit of salt with the sweet and you let this set up let it cool and then you just slice it into the sizes you want wrap it in the wax paper it'll stay good for at least the next couple weeks but I guarantee it's going to be gone way before that", "lT8vj3XdbKg": "I like a moment move it I like to move it move it I like to move it move it you're

and you keep it there stirring until it starts to boil and then you stop stirring it till all the sugar dissolves in Sirte candy thermometer in [Music] and the instructions say don't stir after your magic potion concoction I do potion so I couldn't say it yeah that see the other one I had to stir until it reached 300 and then put the stuff in well THC starts being killed at about 300 so I always wondered why are you putting it in yeah this is much [Music] we've reached boiling yep we've reached boiling now it's time to insert a candy thermometer there I go I'll put it over by the handle maybe it'll stay a little better I like to do not stir while it's being communal diselle you can see their temperature turn that to bake your phone at the same time it's got quite a ways to go wow that's a long time yeah I think we're gonna pause this of her well", "FaH2vBGLz1s": "hi I'm Stephanie Gosk of joy baking calm today we're going to make maple pecan caramels and this is what they look like these caramels have a really nice smooth and creamy texture because we're using a little bit of maple syrup they almost have a nutty flavor which is enhanced with the addition of some toasted pecans so the first thing we need to do to make our caramels is to prepare our pan you will need just a loaf pan and I like to line it with some foil so just take a piece and then the easiest way I find to fit the foil into the pan suggest turn it over we'll go easy here and just arm it to the outside of your pan and then it gives it a little bit of shape so it's easier to fit into the pan and the reason we do this is because once the caramel has set it's easy to lift the caramel out of the pan with the edges of the foil that's why you want the foil to be heavily kind of go over the sides of your loaf pan and then once you form it in there then what we're going to do is brush the inside with some butter and I like to just melt it you know they may be a tablespoon of butter and then just use a pastry brush and we're doing this so the caramel does not stick to the foil so and then just put that aside and whenever you're making candy which involves a cooked sugar syrup what you want to do is have all your ingredients and your equipment out because temperature is very important here so the first thing you will need to do is to toast your pecans you could even do this a day before so pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit which is 180 degrees Celsius and then just put your pecans on a baking sheet you can either use whole or chopped pecans which whichever you have and just toast them you know bake them for about 6 minutes just until they're you know very lightly Brown and you can start to smell them let them cool and then just coarsely chop like I've done here now if you live in a place where you can't get pecans you could use walnuts here or really you know walnuts is a good substitute for pecans and then also so have out once we do our sugar syrup when it gets to the right temperature that's when we add our pecans and you will also add 1 teaspoon 4 grams of pure vanilla extract I find I mean you can leave that out but I think the vanilla just adds another really nice flavor to the caramel and also we're going to add so have 2 tablespoons 25 grams of butter and have your butter at room temperature and I like to cut it into small pieces that way it really melts really fast into our oiled sir and then equipment you will need a saucepan you know you want a pretty heavy like a medium-sized heavy bottom because the reason you use a heavy bottom is you don't want your sugar syrup to scorch and burn it doesn't taste very good and then have a lid as well and then make things really easy is to have a candy thermometer and you can use either type the mercury type or you know now it's pretty readily available the digital which has you know you can set the temperature and it has a crow and whichever type you're using it's nice to have one where it has the clamp on the back so then you can just clamp your thermometer right to the side of the pan you don't have to hold it so and the other thing you will need is just a small little bowl of warm water with a pastry brush I just bought this silicone type of pastry brush which is really nice and that's to brush down the sides of our saucepan so ingredients for our sugar sir you will need one cup which is 210 grams of firmly packed light brown sugar and then you will need just like quarter of a teaspoon one gram of salt you will need three quarters of a cup which is a hundred and seventy-five grams if you want to go by weight let's record a cup is I think let me say 180 grit and 80 milliliters sir of heavy cream or heavy whipping cream and that's cream with a 35 to 40 percent butterfat content let's put that in there that's going to give us that really rich and creamy flavor to our caramel that cream and then you will need of course it's maple pecan caramel so you will need some pure maple syrup so you'll need a half a cup which is a hundred and sixty grams or 120 milliliters of pure maple syrup I'm using a grade-a dark amber here I mean there's different types but that's you know the one I like and like I said that just really adds a lot of flavor have that Dart the the brown sugar and the maple syrup really a nice flavor and then we're going to add a little corn syrup light corn syrup a quarter of a cup which is 60 milliliters or 95 grams of light corn syrup and you know the good part and you could use golden syrup here the reason I like to add whenever I'm doing a boiled syrup I like to add some corn syrup as you know there is a tendency well when you make any type of a boiled sugar syrup you can get sugar crystallization which means a grainy texture candy which we don't want and so corn syrup adding that really helps prevent that from happening that's why I like to add a little so what we're going to do is put this over like medium heat and bring it just up to a boil now you want to stir it you can use like a wooden spoon or I'm using a silicone spatula with a wooden handle and you want to stir it all the time because you want that the brown sugar to really dissolve and then everything to heat up of course so just keep stirring and bring it just to a boil okay so now we've brought it up to a boil so you may have to adjust your heat so stop stirring and then what I like to do is I like to take the lid of my pot put it on there and let it boil for about a minute or two and that will the steam will wash down the sides of our saucepan that way if there is any sugar undissolved sugar having the lid on there the steam will wash down the sides now if you don't have a saucepan with the lid then the other way you can do is just take your warm water with your pastry brush and just brush it down that way so what we're going to do is just let boil for about a minute so it's been boiling like just over minutes let's remove the lid so there we have it and now what you want to do is take whatever type of thermometer and just clamp it now you don't want the the end of your thermometer like or probe to touch the bottom of the saucepan you want it to just so make sure and then just put it in there like that and now what we're going to do is let it boil if you know you want a nice boil not to annual you may have to adjust your heat so caramel you can boil your syrup anywhere from two 40s 246\u00b0 to 250 degrees Fahrenheit which is 118 to Bo 121 degrees Celsius and and if you want a really really soft caramel that kind of dissolves on your tongue very easily and just just holds its shape I would boil it to 240 608 246 Fahrenheit which is 118 Celsius I like to take mine to about 248 Fahrenheit 120 Celsius I find that gives it a little more shape and a little harder so I mean you can kind of play with that just keep in mind if you live in a humid climate you may want to take it up to the high you know more the higher end of that temperature because humidity does affect to temperature or texture also do not stir your sugar syrup I find that kind of prevents the sugar crystallization if you just let it boil away on its own just the heat if you have to and that is another reason why you want a heavy bottom soft span because that will prevent any scorching or burning so um and another thing as this is boiling you may get some sugar crystals forming on the inside of your saucepan so that's what our warm water here with our brush so what you do is take that and just brush that the sides down and that will dissolve any of the sugar crystals which will prevent that grainy texture which if you've ever had that you don't want so although you still have the taste it doesn't have that really nice mouthfeel so what we're going to do I'm just going to let that boil away until it gets to 248 agrees Fahrenheit which is 120 degrees Celsius okay so we're at 248 so take it off the heat it will continue to rise a little more just keep that in mind careful it's hot and then what we're going to do is add our butter you will get some foaming up here and your vanilla extra look and your chopped pecans stir it oh it smells so good in here hey just one make sure everything's all mixed in and then my gloves back on here and then just pour it into your saucepan so and that's it I prefer not to scrape it out too much because just in case I have some sugar crystallizing there so and then if you need to if the pecans aren't even you could just even them out like that and we're done so now of course this is very hot and it's liquid so what we're going to do is just set your pan on a wire rack and then just let it cool until it firms up now that usually takes depending on your toe at least an hour and so when we come back I will show you how to get them out of the pan and how to cut them into squares okay so now we're ready so I've taken over the pan just lift it up and peel back the foil hopefully I mean depending on how much you cooked your Erbs your sugar syrup it could stick a bit to your foil if it does sometimes I put it in the fridge and if it gets a little cold your caramel gets cold it's easier to peel off so now and the thing is if it's soft what you can do is great about caramel is you can just kind of put it back into shape so now what I'm going to do is just take a sharp knife sometimes it helps if your caramel is really sticky you could lightly oil your knife and then it's pretty good and then you can always use like a straight edge to kind of release it or just peel off the foil and so let's see mine soft and pliable enough that I can kind of form it if it loses its shape so there we have it we have what's kind of cool I like how the pecans rise to the top and then you have that beautiful caramel underneath and so you can cut these as big small into squares rectangles whatever you like but just going to like so I mean this would me these would make a great gift but once you start eating them it's hard to stop so I just put them in because they are quite rich I like to just in small squares but like I said you can form them so I'm just going to take a little bit Oh once I start I can't stop Oh that is so good you got smooth and I mean so smooth and creamy texture and then that maple syrup with the brown sugar and then the pecans it really a great flavor so try making these great for your family or I mean perfect to give put in a box and give us a gift so enjoy and until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm you", "AoCsmAdB5co": "Today, we're making chocolate sea salt caramels. So, I'm starting with about three-quarters\nof a cup of sugar ran into a pot, three-quarters of a cup heavy cream, and about half a cup\nof corn syrup. I just use regular corn syrup. You can use light if you want to. It won't make it any healthier, but you can. Totally low-fat recipe. All I'm going to do is bring this to a boil\non the stove, and we're just going to cook it until it's nice \nand thick. So, my caramel is a nice golden color, just\nlightly golden, almost tan. We don't want to go too dark or else our caramels\nare going to be too firm to cut into nice, chewy caramel bites. So, I'm going to add about four ounces of\nmilk chocolate, a little bit of sea salt which is really going to bring out the flavor of\nthe chocolate in the caramel. I'm just going to stir those together, and\nmy chocolate is very quickly going to melt and start to set up here. As soon as your chocolate is melted, these\ncaramels can go right into a six-inch pan lined with a little bit of parchment paper\nor a loaf pan. If you have a loaf pan, that's really great. Just kind of press it in and spread it out\nnice and evenly. I'm just going to top this off with one of\nmy favorite things, which is cocoa nibs. Cocoa nibs are kind of unrefined cocoa beans,\njust a nice crunch and a little extra chocolate flavor. I'm just going to sprinkle those right over\nthe top, and a little extra salt. I'm like a salt fiend. And, that's it. I'm going to let those set out in either room\ntemperature for about an hour or in the fridge or freezer for about ten to fifteen minutes\nuntil they're firm enough to cut. So this is what my caramel looks like after\nI've taken it out of the pan after it's chilled for about an hour. It's nice and firm, ready to be cut. I've cut off one little edge already, but\nI'm just going to go ahead and do about a half-inch bar. I'm just going to keep cutting. If you find your knife is sticking at all,\nyou can kind of spray it with just a little bit of PAM or a non-stick spray. These are really great gifts, actually. You can kind of box these up or bag these\nup and give them to friends. That's it. I'm going to go in the other direction and\ntrim off my edges. That's your snack. That's your reward. Just nice little rectangles, and that's it. I'll do the rest of them, and then all you\ncould do is either with a nice square of parchment paper you can wrap it and twist the edges\nso you have a little candy. Or you could just leave it like this with\na little foil wrapper, and it's a beautiful candy ready to go. Just store these at room temperature and you\ncan have them for about a month. That's how you make chocolate sea salt caramels.", "tLdzdQqlJQs": "see how goodies be and look at him alright here's what's going on it's the Thanksgiving season mm-hmm there's 40 people behind the

johnson we are two sisters southern cooking [Music] hey y'all we're gonna make some caramel um candy and we're going to use that candy to put in some chocolate chip caramel cookies so you can buy your caramels in the store if you want to for this recipe that we're going to be doing later for the chocolate chip caramel cookies but elsie and i are going to start doing a valentine's series which we're going to be doing a lot of candy so this is one of the candies that you can individually wrap up in 2 paper and actually give it as a gift to your valentine [Music] okay i just put the sugar in i'm going to put the white syrup in so what happens is we're going to stir this occasionally what you're going to do is you're going to kind of just like once we get everything in here and it starts to cook just going to pick up the pan and kind of rotate the pan so it heats evenly um sorry to interrupt but these two things we're going to put to the side because those go in after we pull it out here pull it off your weak it's not been too bad it's been i've had a few days where i've had nothing to do so i did a lot of thorough cleaning of the house i got my i have a house you can come too i've had a fairly easy week so far this week so just count my blessings on that that's for sure well you know last week i got my second covet injection right so i was running like a little slow hey elsie and i were even we even brought our stools in here to sit down because we were kind of like i don't know if y'all can tell because i think some of the time we were sitting while we were filming we were because i was having a she was tuckered out i was tuckered out yeah i was having like a flare or something for my lupus so i was like extremely exhausted she was having an after effect from the um the covenant injection so but i'm telling you by saturday morning i was up and running like a crazed woman again just like i normally am i am like 10 cylinders wide open every day all day elsie knows that ben knows that i'm just very hyper even at home i'm very hyper okay so i pour in the heavy cream now yes you do this is the part that you have to worry about with um coagulating so you have to be careful if you don't want that to happen to your heavy cream so eventually you will get your your heat up this will take some time this is not going to be like five minutes and you're done it's going to take probably about 10 15 minutes for us to actually get the heat up make sure that we have it at temperature and then pull it off the heat and we can pour it in so the actual thought of this is you have to let it sit up for 24 hours it's the max um six to eight hours for the where right you have a soft shoe when it's harder it's 24 hours we're gonna have to um use ours in a recipe later so it really doesn't matter if it completely sets up because it's going to melt inside of the cookie so we're going to get it almost to the point and then we're going to put the cookies in the oven and we'll bake them later on this afternoon so we wanted to get this done first thing in the morning because this is a one thing that you want to get set up first yep then what else are we doing today we are making italian subs we're making um we're making our own sub rolls i am excited about that because we have king arthur flower bread flour that was a new thing for us and we also have some new um yeast and i'm gonna bring that in here and show you guys i'm so stoked um about a month ago we had some heavy winds and some rain and i guess a couple shingles got lifted off and we had a bad leak in the kitchen area and i come out in the middle of the night and stepped in the water and i'm like what the heck so i turned the lights on and i had a leak so we got a gentleman to come out and repair put he had to put two or three shingles back on that had blown away and this morning i come out and i see the roof leaking again the ceiling so i'm assuming it would only happen on the day that we were going to be filming right yeah so i'm assuming that we the rain and the wind and stuff from yesterday and overnight lifting them up again i don't know and it's still drizzling out there so you can't get on the roof to look yet so um i guess we'll have the repairman out here tomorrow looking at it again so that's the joys of having an old farmhouse yeah because this is this house was built in eight 1900 and then you have a couple editions that were like probably in the 80s 70s yeah probably that kind of like you know how some people just add on and piece it together i think the original part of this house was the kitchen this area which used to be a dining room area and one of the bedrooms and one of the bathrooms was the original so it was basically one bedroom one bath a kitchen and a dining room area and they've slowly added on to it over the years before i got here and we're i think the square footage on this house now this original square footage i would say is probably eight or nine hundred square feet it wasn't that big was it very big um you can definitely tell it's an older house in the center portion of the house you can you can tell the quality of the cabinetry in the kitchen is like very well made these walls look like plaster they are they don't look like they're sheetrock and they are plaster and but anyway so now that they've done all the additions on to it over the years i'm going to change my house with about 2500 square feet so they've done a lot of additions over the years okay guys so we are at about two what 220 yeah we're getting on up there it's starting to come to a boil we had to change pots i didn't have a pop i didn't have i didn't have it big enough of pot so it as soon as it started boiling it started like surging up so i had to get a bit a little bit bigger heavy bottom pan that i have so we almost had a temp yeah we almost had it up to temp and then we had to take it off to put it in on us a larger pot so then it quickly lost its temp and then we had to bring it right back up so we were talking off camera about our grandchildren oh my god any minutes updates with murray mary is now starting oh aidan's jealous of mirror aiden we talked to mira about an hour before typically before we talked to aiden every single day and normally we see mira just as sabrina's uh putting her in to get a bath and that's her happy time that's a cranky baby she is a princess but she's also a fat princess yeah she's not honestly she's nicer she looks chubbier on camera and pictures than she is in person honestly it's bizarre but anyway um so we usually talk to her and and um through facetime about an hour before uh we talked to aiden daily well last night we were um got the phone call thought we were going to be talking america's at the time it was and it was aiden and aiden grudgingly let us he's like no she she's uh she's not happy or she's he had some kind of excuse and he wanted to do the talking right then and so eventually he did take us in to let us see her for a minute but he's getting to the point now that he's trying to take over meera's time that we talked to mira so how old is he he's eight right yeah he'll be nine in march but he's funny but um so anyway so we did actually get to see her for a few minutes last evening but he tried to take over her time well you know ben's son josh has two children now and a stepdaughter sadie and then they have jackson who's two and they have a new uh baby that was born in january that's name is layla and jackson is not very fond yeah he's a little jealous he doesn't like the new baby well he's a lot younger so i mean he's more inclined too what do we have here still be along the lines of um it's still right at two 20. once it starts to go it'll go pretty fast once it starts to hit above that 220. we'll slow down a little bit on the stirring because i think sometimes that does also disturb your heat distribution yeah but i also don't want it sticking because caramel sticks very easy and it can burn very easy so you want to be careful it's just like pralines you don't want to leave them without attending to them because they will burn very [Music] fast [Applause] [Music] okay i think that we're up to the temp that we need so we're gonna get the um get it off the heat and put in the salt and the vanilla okay all right and that when you put that vanilla in it's gonna a little bit okay and take that off there yep okay so what we're going to do is we're going to um do you want me to pour or hold it because i'm here it might be a little easier if you want to guide it in just make sure we get it all all right all right we're going to let this sit up and then we will um when they become firm enough actually i wanted to put some salt some sea salt on to make them salted caramel we are using the fine sea salt you can use flake salt you can use you can coarse salt yeah whatever you want i think that's perfect that's probably good enough all right so we'll go ahead and let this sit at room temperature for six to eight hours it up to 24 hours for more firm caramel and we'll see you guys in our next video [Music] y'all i got the caramel um out of the pan just now and i'm going to try and show you what it looks like to slice it up into pieces all right this is some wonderful looking caramel i'm gonna show you the one piece and then i'm gonna take it off a video and go ahead and cut up the rest this looks so good caramel is one of my favorite candies so um i will come back in a moment and show you how i've got it all cut up [Music] hi i'm elsie and i'm debbie we're two sisters southern cooking and we thank you for visiting our page please like share and subscribe thank you", "7jSgzlk-yv8": "hey guys um I just want to

really really good so previously if you see these I really do recommend these it tastes just like coffee so I just wanted to come on here and do this review for you guys I hope you guys have a wonderful evening and weekend and I will talk to you guys later bye guys", "hr1byCrzM0E": "I think caramels are one of those things that everyone wants to have in their repertoire but they seem kind of hard to make and at Christmas they are especially wonderful to give us gifts or to just enjoy with your family and if you're anything like me you want to hoard them all for yourself soft chewy caramels are my absolute favorite and once you really get the hang of it they're actually pretty easy and you can make them anytime you want and if you don't want to you don't have to share them with anybody you can just hide them for yourself I am making really simple soft caramels today and I'm going to show you three ways that you can dress them up or leave them plain to start you want to make sure to have a 5 quart heavy bottom kettle it's important to have a large one and a heavy bottom anytime you're making candy because you don't want it to come up and boil over and down the sides and a heavy bottom is really gonna help it not burn or scorch on the bottom of the pan so two simple things that really make a huge difference put heavy cream sugar butter and corn syrup in your large kettle put it right on the stove and bring it up to a boil this is going to take a little while because there's quite a bit of ingredients in here and you do want to stir them a few times just to make sure that sugar isn't scorching on the bottom because as you know if sugar just sits on heat by itself it's gonna melt and turn to a caramel so make sure it keep stirring it together to make sure it's evenly melting and bringing it to a boil as if a lot of the candies I make it's best to be prepared early on so when you're done in the candies ready you know what to do so in this case you really want to make sure to get your pan ready before the caramels made otherwise you are gonna get to the end and have all this caramel ready know where to put it and that's no good because it's too hot just put in your mouth right away I promised I've tried I burnt my mouth don't do it make sure to have a 9 by 13 pan and just lightly brush it with a neutral flavored oil I use vegetable oil you could use any other neutral flavored oil brush up the sides and in the corners and then have a piece of parchment that fits really well and makes the sling and put it up the sides and down the middle press the parchment really well into the corners and then brush it again with the oil you don't want the caramel to stick to the pan or to the parchment or the parchment to the pan nothing really needs to stick in this case so just brush it really well foil once the pan is ready just set it aside once everything is melted and coming up to a boil keep boiling until you reach 248 degrees candy meeting is actually really easy but there are these different benchmarks that do take a little bit of time so you're probably gonna get to 220 pretty quickly but then it's gonna take you a little bit longer to get to 248 it's gonna seem like really a long time you're gonna want to walk away you're gonna want to do something else don't do not walk away do not do something else don't do anything except watch that caramel because it can jump at temperatures really fast it's really great to have an instant-read thermometer if not fit it with a candy thermometer once it's reached 248 degrees and it's gonna turn a slight caramel color so that's what you're wanting remove it from the heat and right away stir in some salt and some vanilla this is gonna help flavor it and this is right now your base caramel just like this it's absolutely delicious you could pour it into the hand and be done with it but I've never just done it with it so I pour it into my pan and then I like to do some variations on it [Music] I'm gonna break my pan into three different sections you don't have to leave it the same but just visually I'm gonna do three different types on this one pan one I like to put chopped pecans and then drizzle chocolate on and that's gonna become like turtle caramels and yeah turtle caramels delicious on the type I want to be turtle I'm just gonna put some toasted chopped pecans right on top of that hot caramel kind of press them in slightly you just make sure they adhere the middle part I'm just gonna leave plain because it is delicious by itself and for that last part I'm gonna put some extra flaky a seesaw on top so it becomes a delicious salted caramel this is honestly guesswork there is nothing important about this you really don't even have to measure any of these ingredients that you're playing on top because they're just extras and embellishments once it is cooled I then drizzle the chocolate on top of the turtle portion because if you do it right away and it's so hot it's just gonna melt the chocolate all over and that's not gonna be pretty you want to let these caramels sit for at least four to six hours because they really need to set up and cool down once they're cool and set up you can just take that parchment that you line the pan with pull it out don't worry it's somewhat pliable and bendable so if it kind of malformed it can just be squashed back together set it on a cutting board remove the parchment and then using a large knife cut it into pieces honestly bite-sized pieces big sized pieces whatever pieces you want to do you can totally do [Music] these caramels are an instant hit and everybody loves to have a good caramel it's kind of those things I feel like a lot of people are like oh how did you make caramel and it's not that hard have a good thermometer and you are set to go I can't wait for you to make these this Christmas and everyone is gonna be clamoring to come to your Christmas party to have some of these if

caramel toffee is one of those trophies which you can easily make at home and you probably have all the ingredients needed to make them in your kitchen right now so let's jump into the recipe and make this no first caramel Toffees all the ingredient list is given in the description box please check it out and before we move on click the subscribe button if you have not subscribed to grey pot and click the bell icon to get notifications whenever I post a new video let's start by caramelizing the sugar add half a cup of sugar into a pan and let it sit for some time and then you can see the sugar has started melting and it will turn into golden color and once it reaches this stage give it a mix and add around two tablespoons of water and mix it and be careful when you're adding water because the caramel is really hot and it may splash [Music] now add half a cup of thick cream here I've used a gripping cream but if you have fresh cream you can use that it works really fine and when you add the cream you can see the caramel has got lumped up but don't worry when the cream gets heated up the caramel it'll also get melted and makes it for some time [Music] once the caramel is melted add half a cup of sugar add honey mix it here I'm adding two tablespoons of glucose syrup are also called as corn syrup and this ingredient is completely optional if you are getting it you can add this into this recipe or you can skip it but if you add corn syrup or glucose syrup into the toffee mixture you will get the proper toffee texture this glucose syrup is available in most of the supermarkets or you will get it in making items supply shops you have to continuously mix it until the caramel reaches this consistency then you can add a pinch of salt caramel and salt is a very good combination to check whether it is ready put 2-3 drops of caramel into some water and if we can easily take those drops out from the water that means the caramel mixture is ready now turn off the flame add three tablespoons of unsalted butter and one tablespoon of vanilla essence and mix it until the butter gets melted after you add these two ingredients your entire kitchen will smell toffee oh it's so amazing now our mixture reached the perfect consistency now take a tray lined with aluminum foil or butter paper and pour the mixture in it and on one and the main thing which I forgot to do is greasing the foil so please don't do that mistake grease the foil really well now give a tap to three times to get rid of all the air bubbles and let it rest on the countertop for two hours and after 2 hours take a parchment paper and flip this tray on top of it and carefully remove the aluminum foil from the toffee now you can cut these Toffees into any desired shape and sizes and this is the best thing when you make your own topping you can decide the size of your topping you can wrap these Toffees in butter paper plastic wraps or with those colorful toffee wrappers which are easily available at supermarkets when you get stored these wrapped office in an airtight container and it will last long region also sprinkle some salt on top of the stuffing as I said earlier caramel tapas with salt goes really well so here it is our soft and chewy homemade caramel toffee is ready so definitely try this recipe at home and leave me a comment if you like it and we'd love to see your

and welcome to my kitchen this is the second video of a series that I'm doing this time of year at Christmastime about homemade candy old-fashioned style homemade candy and today we're going to make cream caramel luscious cream caramel we used to make these and sell them at the farmers market and people fell in love with them I did quit making them after a while because there's so much trouble especially the wrapping up of all the little individual caramels but I'm going to show you how to make them and so that you can enjoy them in your own home at Christmas time the recipe that I like came out of an old 1970s Betty Crocker cookbook and that's my favorite cookbook that I own well what we're gonna need is two cups of sugar 1/2 a cup of butter 2 cups of heavy whipping cream and a quarter cup of corn syrup they'll cook it in a good sized saucepan so that it won't boil over we need a pan de ready to put it into and what I like to use is the silicone pans because they're very flexible I can get it back out of the pan very quickly and then I prefer to wrap the caramel so they don't stick together so you would want to use some wax paper I already have some cut up here in a bag that I from whenever I was making it and selling it you'll also need a candy thermometer for best results first we'll put in our butter into our pan and then half of the cream it's total 2 cups of cream but we start out by putting half in will also add the quarter cup of corn syrup we'll warm that a little bit when the butter starts melting go ahead and pour your sugar in continue to stir all the time until that sugar gets dissolved whenever the sugars all dissolved in the mixture starts to simmer we'll add the second cup of heavy cream and we'll continue to stir then we'll use a candy thermometer and what we want this candy to go to is 245 degrees it's kind of between a softball and a hardball stage so we'll clip that to the side make sure you're the ball of your thermometer is not on the bottom but it's not up on the top either kind of in the middle of all of your your liquids continue to stir occasionally make sure your burner is not to a point too hot where it might make it scorch beware because this will boil over keep your burner down low enough if it starts to boil over just lift your pan up off the burner for a little bit set it aside and turn it down just a bit it's up to 230 degrees and it's really changing a lot in the color and the way it looks it's getting thicker starting to look more caramel e we're just gonna cook it a while longer well we've reached the temperature that it should be here's what it looks like it's very caramel e it's pretty color so I've got my pan ready I'm just gonna dump this in here very hot so make sure you don't get it on your skin because it will blister you if you need to you can spread it out a little bit I'm gonna let that cool just a little bit and then I'm gonna add some coarse salt to it I have coarse pretzel salt that I'm gonna try to carefully sprinkle across the top the salt really brings out a wonderful flavor in the caramels but I think it's my favorite I'll let this cool and then I'll pop it out of that silicone pan onto a cutting board I'll use a knife and cut it into about one inch squares I'll wrap those squares in the wax paper and it'll be ready for Christmas and it'll keep for a long time and we'll enjoy it this Christmas time thanks for joining me and I hope I see you next time when I'm gonna make another kind of old-fashioned candy bye for now", "lUtMCgxluOU": "welcome to 420 RX cannabis

"hey guys welcome after urban cowgirl today we're making a reefer natal a simple syrup that does not crystallize I know crazy right we actually contacted a chemist to find out what it is about a wraithers haul that makes it crystallize and we worked around those parameters now I'm going to be able to use this wreath throw tell simple syrup to make skinny margaritas your favorite cocktails and I will even show you a formulas you can thicken enough to how much you want you'll be able to make keto maple syrup and your own coffee Serbs that are made with a reaper tall so let's make it right now our simple syrup is gonna start with a wreath or saw now you can use whatever brand you like but we ended up preferring Anthony's wreath or tall because it comes out clear while swear bran comes out a slight Leeds hand color in the end they'll taste exactly the same but if that matters to you just keep that in mind after speaking with our chemist friend we learned that a two to one ratio water to a wreath or tall is a stable solution and it will not crystallize so our recipe will start there we'll eventually add sweet drops to bump the sweetness but you could add an alternative sugar if you wanted to and xanthan gum to thicken this syrup and provide mouthfeel we'll be using twice as much water as a reefer tall and then our basic urethral tall from the pantry this method could not be any easier you're just going to add everything that you've seen here to the pan now this is a cold saucepan that I'm using and I have not turned on the heat yet I'm gonna add all of the ingredients and then I'm gonna whisk it up now here's a xanthan gum I told you guys about this is what's gonna allow you to get it as thick as you want for a traditional simple syrup viscosity I'm using about a quarter of a quarter teaspoon you could use a little bit more if you wanted it real thick if you want to get it more like a maple syrup then you can go all the way up to a quarter teaspoon now I'm just adding a little bit of sweet drops to enhance the sweetness because we didn't use equal parts or either at all to water that would crystallize for sure you don't have to use sweet drops but it doesn't really end up tasting like stevia it's gonna taste like a wreath root all with just a little bump to the sweetness while it's still cold whisk all of this really well and then turn on the heat we only need to boil it for about one minute so the xanthan gum can activate and thicken and then I just like to pull it off the heat and cool and store it in mason jars now that you have your wreath which I'll simple syrup we can use it in a lot of different ways here's a really thick fact that I made and we're gonna make some Kido maple syrup with it but this recipe you'll just need some maple flavored extract which I found at Whole Foods or online starting with the mason jar we're just gonna pour some of the maple extract into it and then we're going to use some of the super thick simple syrup just add it on in and we're gonna top that with a lid and shake it right up amazing and now you're all ready for pancakes alright now for my favorite a skinny margarita I'm just going to put my margarita salt on the glass with a little bit of a wreath retal simple syrup fill that glass with ice and then we'll start off with putting a little bit of our simple syrup in the glass now I have this triple stack that adds a delicious orange flavor to it I'm gonna link it below it's also sugar-free so I add a little shot of that and then an entire freshly squeezed lime gotta love that fresh lime juice guys finally I'm gonna add some tequila Blanco that I got from my last trip to Mexico I love it and I will add that last before giving it a little bit of a stir [Music] and there you go that's my recipe for skinny margaritas I have one of these every Friday night so hope you try it out join the club and half won the last recipe I'm going to show you is how to make it a wreath root tall coffee syrup using the same simple syrup we made so it's gonna start off with one fresh vanilla bean and then also I'm gonna add an entire bottle of butterscotch flavoring I got this at Hobby Lobby but they also sell them at cake shops now I'll just go ahead and add a really thick simple syrup that I made now all we have to do is give it a little bit of a whisk and you can transfer it to a vinegar jar I know it sounds crazy but it is the perfect size for this throw in some of those extra vanilla beans for flavoring and then put a liqueur topper on it and you'll have the perfect little device to make yourself coffee every morning there is nothing like a good key to margarita at noon on a Tuesday that's what I always say well that is the original simple syrup guys Haridas not included we hope you loved it if you have any ideas how to use the research hall simple syrup that we didn't have time to share or that we didn't think of we've been below everybody reads those

[Applause] [Music] so you", "5K4p2FVFMZE": "hi everyone welcome to another taste test slash product review and I will be doing two products at the same time today since they're both very similar I'll be doing where there's original creamy candy filled hard candies and I'll also be doing the widow's original caramel specialties and I love the original rulers and I like the caramel ones I see me I know these the corner fold ones have been out for a while but I think these specialty ones the softer ones with the caramel I think these are pretty new while they're sitting around the package so I'll try the caramel specialties first so there is a caramel specialty and I love world is original I love caramel so up what better prep a combination not really what I expected I expected cream filled caramel in the middle but it's it's not cream pills like I thought it would be it's not like a more of a hard caramel in the middle it's still soft and chewy but what that would be like liquid what I have to say these ones not better than the original well they look more like that wrong what I was thinking of was the the reason chocolate shoes which they look similar to them nice thinking these are better than those salt these are really good like what was original you love caramel these are good next up is the rivers there's no creamy caramel filled hard candies probable try these all right camera down for a minute he's open here sorry about that and here they are really need to invest in a tripod what they look like I just barely bit down I've already been through this the center of the candy well it's not a real real hard candy it's a real soft coating you can easily choose through there we go this one has the liquid filled caramel Center that's really good I like that liquid caramel taste nice tastes exactly like the original ones the harder ones I was kind of hoping that these would not be as hard when I wasn't sure I was gonna taste test these so I can't get to the caramel but these just have a real light crunchy outer shell these are really good I would pull these over the harder ones cuz it's more like really hard hard candies so original try both of these they're very good I do believe these were bulk 249 I picked these up at Walgreens it's not full of booze originally you love caramel I should just you try these No thank you for watching", "0VVP5TmxDZY": "it can seem really intimidating to make your own candy thermometers are involved tempering chocolate but it's really simple and I'm going to show you how to make some delicious candy using things that are probably laying in your pantry I'm making soft chewy caramels covered in chocolate and rolled in nuts it's the perfect movie treat to start I'm going to measure out my ingredients and I have white sugar brown sugar cream and a little bit of salt that's it so first I'm going to measure out a cup of white sugar and a cup of brown sugar I love this recipe because I'm using brown sugar as well as white sugar the brown sugar gives it the sort of deep rich maple leaf flavor that is so good so right into the pot it goes and now I'm just gonna pack my brown sugar just by pressing it down lightly and you don't need to be a hockey puck you just want it to really condense into the cup so a little more to top it off that looks good and it goes and now I'm gonna add my salt and I'm using a really mild really lovely sea salt and salt and caramel are just kind of meant to be together the saltiness really offsets the super sweetness of the caramel so I love adding a little bit of salt so now I'm going to add my cream and this is what gives the caramels they're lovely chewy texture so that's one and a half cups and this is to make a really thick moldable caramel this isn't for a caramel sauce or anything that I want to be runny I want a really nice and thick okay I'm going to give this a stir and then I'm gonna pop it on the stove I'm going to cook my caramel up to 245 degrees Fahrenheit which sounds really really hot but in the world of candy making it's really not that high this is gonna be at a softball stage which means it's gonna be really melty and moldable and you can roll it in your hands toffee for instance is really brittle because it's cooked to a much higher heat about 300 degrees so that's called a hard crack because it cracks and in the world of candy making your thermometer is your best friend you need to be pretty exact when it comes to the temperature of your caramel because you want it to be of a certain consistency and texture so it even has the handy little descriptions right here so it says soft ball hard ball soft crack art crack so depending on what kind of candy you want to make it will help you and you want to make sure that doesn't touch the bottom of a pan that's just submerged into the liquid this way it gives you a really accurate reading so in it goes my caramel is up to 245 degrees so I'm gonna turn it off the heat take out the thermometer and I'm going to add my vanilla so I turned it off the heat because vanilla burns pretty easily so I don't need that extra flame when I'm adding this and I like a lot of vanilla so two teaspoons I'm gonna give it a quick stir just to integrate it and make sure to use a heat-safe spatula you don't want anything to melt and that looks really great I'm now going to pour it into a buttered pan and I'm just gonna let it come to room temperature if you want to make this go a little bit faster you can definitely stick it in the fridge but don't let it get too cold because we're going to be rolling them into balls later well this looks great I'm going to let it cool and then get to making candy my caramel is room temperature so it's ready to get turned into little balls about the size of a marble to start I'm gonna grab my spoon this is gonna help me scoop out my caramel and this is very sticky stuff so I'm gonna spray this with a little bit of canola oil just to make sure it doesn't get stuck okay that's about right so you can see really tacky really chewy I'm just gonna roll it in here and if you find it all sticky just put a little bit of oil on your hands but because we put in a buttered pan shouldn't be a problem well that's a perfect bite I'm just gonna keep going and portion out the rest well my caramels look ready to go so I'm going to pop them in the fridge to chill because I'm going to put them in warm chocolate later I have my homemade movie candies ready to go so I'm going to finish them up and some melted chocolate and what you see here is I melted my chocolate using a double boiler or a bon Marie and it's really simple I just make one at home I use a glass bowl and I put it on top of a pot that's filled with boiling water and I let the steam do the work so as you can see beautiful and steamy and the gentle heat from the steam melts the chocolate really slowly and gently so you don't get any discoloration my chocolate looks beautiful so let's get dipping I'm using a fork to dip my caramels today and the reason why is lots of drainage so once I put them in the chocolate and get them evenly coated I'm going to pop them into the nuts and I have toasted almond and toasted pecan you can use any nut you like this is the fun part make it your own choose flavors that you love let's grab one another fun idea is you can dip it in chocolate and then just sprinkle it with nuts so it just gets a little bit of that crunch on top or if you're not really into nuts just plain chocolate well all I have to do is pop my homemade candy into the fridge to chill until I want to have a bite and this definitely is not a guilt-free treat but it's movie night so I have to enjoy myself", "U3-Kye9Q7Fg": "hey so today we got something really exciting for you we have two new coffees that we're launching but at the same time we're launching a brand new subscription package let me tell you about it [Music] okay so the way our subscription package breaks down is really simple we separated this into two different categories for you guys calorie one is called lean in and category two is called ride on so lean in what's that all about whether you are new to making coffee at home or you're an experienced coffee drinker we wanted to give you a coffee that was accessible that was palatable but also had an exciting enough flavor profile so that wherever you are in the coffee drinking spectrum you find this super enjoyable the leaning subscription is technically our entry level subscription however we don't want you to think of the coffees that we serve in this subscription package as being entry level they're omni-roasted which means regardless of how you make your coffee at home this coffee will suit the brew method that you have we're using on our bars across all of our locations on espresso because we think that brings out some of the best qualities in the coffee but if you make pour over at home if you make immersion at home whatever you're using in your house we promise you this coffee is going to work for you the leading subscription is going to cost 10 pounds and you can pick this coffee up at any of the guild trip locations or on our webstore at www if you're in one of our sites or locations and you're looking at the coffee you can scan this qr code and it's going to take you straight to our website www.guiltripcoffee.com where you can check out a little bit more info about the coffee and see the subscription packages in more detail so this time around for our leaning coffee we have a washed processed tanzanian called linge estate this coffee has a flavor profile that's like molasses blackberry plum it's really sweet and that's across all three methods like i said before we have this on espresso at guild trip and it is super sweet but if you're making pour over you're gonna get that really nice kind of blackberry acidity up front and then as the coffee cools down it has this amazing kind of plum sweetness that starts to come forward and again that's across all brew methods so this is the type of flavor profile that's really going to suit black coffee of any kind again filter coffee espresso and americano but if you're the type of person that adds milk to your coffee so you drink like a flat white at home or a latte or something like that this is the type of sweet flavor profile that pairs really well with steamed milk so again however you drink your coffee whatever way you brew at home we honestly think this flavor profile is gonna be amazing then on our right on subscription we have an amazing coffee from finca veracruz in colombia this is a slow fermented and washed processed coffee that has taste notes of jam cranberry and pear so we've been mainly brewing this coffee as a manual pour over using the likes of a hario v60 and what we're finding is there's a real pear-like acidity up front which then cools into more of a syrupy sweet kind of jammy cranberry-like finish this is the coffee that we're going to be using as a filter option on all of our bars and we're getting some amazing results both manually and on battery however if you make espresso at home this coffee is gonna make an amazing espresso and again really sweet flavor profile that's gonna pair well with that steamed milk if that's your thing if the right on subscription sounds like your thing it's going to be priced at 14 points these coffees are seasonal which means we're gonna be changing them up every now and again and we're gonna be trying to showcase coffees that have all sorts of different flavor profiles so always go for the coffee that you think stands out the most to you if you're brewing either of these coffees at home and you just need some like tips and tricks a little bit of help when it comes to your brewing or even something like a brew recipe then come into any of the guild trip locations and ask one of our baristas and they'll be able to help you out on site if you can't get to one of our locations then contact us via any of our social media channels or head to our website again and contact us and we'll get back to you as soon as we can when it comes to the subscriptions we wanted to keep this as easy and accessible for you as possible so when you go onto our website there's a few things that you can choose from when it comes to your subscription you can choose your delivery frequency which is just how often you want that coffee to arrive at your front door you can choose how much coffee of each coffee you want to order at any one time and if you don't have access to a grinder at home and you have a particular brew method that you use you can let us know whether you want that coffee grind to that particular brew method [Music] you", "glLywR53ISI": "hi there it's that time of year again people are making and enjoying all kinds of treats during the Chris this time and if you have a sweet tooth like me candy is at the top of your list today I'm going to show you how to make the best coffee in the world I know what you're thinking that's a big statement but this just may be the best coffee in the world a word of warning to everyone before we get started part of this toffee making process involves extreme heat up to 300 degrees so before you get started please ensure that small children as well as family pets or outside of the kitchen or away from the stove before you start making this toffee this will ensure that everyone has a happy and an enjoyable experience making this toffee now you're going to want to gather all your ingredients this is going to include butter sugar Kona coffee glazed macadamia nuts these are my favorite by the way and you're also going to want semi-sweet chocolate chips milk chocolate chips work but the semi-sweet chocolate chips like what we have here these just bring a better balanced flavor to the toffee you're also going to want a long-handled metal stirring spoon similar to this one and you're going to want a deep dish or medium dish saucepan like what we have here you're also going to need a metal cookie sheet or metal pan and you're going to want to coat that with aluminum foil just like what we've done here this is just going to help with the cleanup process later on oh you're also going to need a small metal tenderizer mallet similar to this one here and a small freezer bag that I do and we're going to get started by getting these macadamia nuts chopped up first you're going to want these chopped up and ready to go when your toffee is done because we're going to sprinkle these over the top so what I do is I hope can of macadamia nuts and about half the pan inside of this freezer bag here and this is about a half can of those Kona coffee glazed macadamia nuts per batch of toffee so we get that half can in this freezer bag here and set it down like that you have your metal mallet here now what you're going to want to do is just gently kind of grind up these macadamia nuts kind of gently hitting the macadamia nuts until they break apart you don't want to make dust or anything like that you just kind of want to break them up and little chunks little bits and pieces one small enough to where they're going to stick to the chocolate on the toffee when we get to the final part of the process but you don't want them so big as to where they kind of roll off the top for you as you break it apart all right now we're going to turn our burner on and we're using a gas stove for cooking this toffee so it does heat up rather quickly and we're going to put it on a medium heat here and we already have our four cubes of butter ready to go and that equals a pound we're going to be using a pound of butter for this recipe as well as a pound of sugar so now we're going to let our butter melt down and we're going to come back and stir in the sugar okay now that our butter has melted down we're going to add two cups of sugar we already have our sugar measured out here so we're going to pour the sugar in with the butter just like that and now what you want to do is just stir that sugar right into the butter just like that we're going to stir it around until it's all mixed up you have this nice syrupy mix going here I know we started off with the heat on medium after we get all of the sugar and butter combined in the saucepan here and it's mixed up really well we're going to gradually turn the heat up what you're going to want to do is actually bring this mixture to a boil and keep it at a slow boil for quite a long time usually takes about ten minutes till you get it up to the point where you're at about 300 degrees between 285 and 300 degrees is the mark that you want to hit on the temperature okay and we're back and our mixture here is starting to thicken up quite a bit here and you want to be sure that you don't leave the toffee mixture unattended you want to keep stirring it just kind of gradually stir it around the edges around the bottom of the saucepan just keep moving it around and you do want to gradually turn that picture dial up a little bit you don't want to turn it on full blast you don't want to put it on high you just want to keep turning it slowly up from the medium point there so it keeps boiling like that and the color that you want to achieve is between a medium to dark umber in this mixture so you do have to keep stirring it you don't want the bottom to burn okay we're back just to check on it real quick here and our temperature thermometer here says that we're only just over 250 degrees so we got to keep stirring this around quite a bit we're going to come back when this is ready to pour okay we are back and this toffee is ready to pour out all right make sure you turn your burner off on the stove you just want to let that sit for a couple of minutes now and then we're going to add the chocolate chips and the macadamia nuts to the top of it alright now that the toffee is set for a couple of minutes what you're going to want to do is take your chocolate chips and just kind of sprinkle them over the top of the toffee just like that and kind of space it down a little bit don't want to punch too much chocolate up in there you don't want to be too sparse with the chocolate though either make sure you get a good amount on there okay we are back and the chocolate chips have set on the top of this hot toffee here for about three minutes what you're going to want to do is get a butter knife and then just gently kind of spread those chocolate chips right across the top of the toffee there and the toffee is actually already pretty hard but it does need to sit for approximately two hours before you can eat it so what we're going to do just keep spreading the chocolate across the top of this toffee and then we're going to add the Kona coffee glazed macadamia nuts alright we are back and we're going to put the final touches on our toffee here so we have this bowl of our crushed Kona coffee macadamia nuts and we're just going to sprinkle them right across the top of the toffee here you can see the the size of the crushed macadamia nuts here that's probably about the size you want to achieve when you crush them what you want to do is just coat the whole area across the toffee where the chocolate is because the macadamia nuts are going to stick to the chocolate they're not going to stick to any part of the toffee on the edge there because that's already cooled off and harden quite a bit so just try and coat the chocolate all over the toffee alright and that's pretty much it it looks like I'm just about done here alright doesn't that look good now what you're going to want to do is stick this cookie sheet with the toffee on it in the refrigerator and you're going to want to let that sit for approximately two hours or longer but two hours is pretty much the minimum once you've let it sit then you can take it out and break it up into small pieces and box it up and send it off to your friends as a great gift all right you saw how to make the best toffee in the world if you'd like the recipe all you need to do is contact me through youtube or send an e-mail to david Spees at hotmail.com happy holidays and thanks for watching you", "qAYgGgWN7Bk": "good morning your average Joe viewers Mon come to you today with another iced coffee option we did the starbucks mocha frappuccino which was coffee flavored milk with some chocolate and way too many calories so this time we've got skinny cow just to keep things kind of coherent i also got mocha so we're comparing trying to compare apples to apples first thing you'll notice is I can't get into this thing there you go I got the seal broken alright so let's take off this lid and they really don't want you to drink this trying to hold it up see you can see I'm good haha area open alright so this is the skinny cow ice cream heed iced coffee drink it's 120 calories person reading is milk and then water than trying to copy it actually looks a lot like the starbucks ingredient list this has 120 calories per bottle he's still a little high I think for the size of the bottle um but let's give it a taste maybe if it's amazingly delicious this will be worth the calories it smells exactly like the starbucks Frappuccino there's less coffee taste in this then this starbucks Frappuccino app hold on I got hit with a chocolate milk first now I'm starting to get a bit of a coffee taste this taste eggs now i'm getting let's chocolate than coffee this tastes exactly like coffee milk like I said I'm from New England where coffee milk is actually thing where you have coffee syrup instead of chocolate syrup it is not caffeinated it is not true coffee tasty for what it is but it is not coffee it is coffee milk this tastes exactly like coffee milk yeah that's coffee milk um I will I will finish this but I will not be repurchasing this i believed it was kind of pricey it was almost two bucks for this bottle for that i can go to donuts and get nice coffee or wawa and get nice coffee that tastes better um so I don't think I'll be buying this again there's also some weird ingredients in here we got kerrigan in gellan gum sugarless gum monk fruit to extract so why you need fruit in your iced coffee fruit it's a great thing I'm all for fruit but not my iced coffee but we got monk fruit extract we have baking soda in here die potassium phosphate these are things I just don't think we mean you no iced coffee I did promise you guys an iced coffee shoot of my own homemade I am planning on doing that today I was supposed to go to work but I got a sudden day off because well my students are sick so um I'm off today so maybe I can shoot the second video today and get that uploaded later this week I wouldn't waste my money on Starbucks I wouldn't waste my money on this um I guess I just don't like prepackaged iced coffees let's stay tuned for my next video um and like I said save your money skip the skinny cow it wasn't that very good have a great day", "fwsh4yVqY50": "welcome back to your feel good breakfast show well we are about to have a lot of fun since we have the kids sorted we think you deserve a morning kickstarter coffee but this time with a twist they say that adventure in life is good but consistency in coffee is even better now i wholeheartedly agree with this and this is why there's nothing better than the perfect cappuccino and speaking of which there's a certain presenter jamie lee who's claiming to be a coffee expert so today we are putting those claims to the test with our very own blind coffee taste test challenge so now how it's going to work is i'm going to invite jamie and graham to come and join me there we go oh look at them all sassy very very sassy and as you can see i have four coffees in front of you and there are four capsules in front of you now i'm going to give you a brief description of the various nespresso capsules that's available and i'm going to ask you to identify which of these coffees is associated with which capsule are you ready i'm ready to drink all these coffees i'll tell you that much okay i've got two sick kids at home so i haven't slept and i've already had about nine cups of coffee so i'm worried i've desensitized my coffee thing the coffee meter in my head but now i'm ready i'm ready i feel very sad that i spoke to you in confidence i did not say that i was the queen of cappuccinos [Laughter] okay so i've got a couple of descriptions to go through you are welcome to start tasting listen to what i'm explaining to you and see if any of them hits a bell the minute you think you know just place the correct capsule in front of the coffee wow you got it okay so there is for example the esperanzione geneva levanto which has a balanced acidity bitterness and a caramel notes to it then there's also the master origin india which has high bitterness and spicy notes there's the cape town e vivo lungo which has a high intensity spicy with woody notes and of course last but not least in no particular order the cozy which has high acidity citric flowery notes oh okay okay here we go um oh that's it's a bit difficult it is difficult it's very difficult not supposed to be easy it's starting to taste the same it's still great i'm having yeah so this is going to give you that kick you need don't look at graham i'm not i'm just trying to get inspiration from this no i have i actually have no idea so i'm going to go through them do you want me to go through some of those those tones again the espirazioni i feel like i pronounce it differently every time but it makes it sound romantic it's lovely when i speak foreign to you yeah okay well it is the geneva graeme you've got two more capsules to put down no i don't know actually i'm just it feels like more of a randomy kind of a thing okay i'm having a look at the results jamie you've got one out of four correct what no that's four you have two out of four correct can i tell you the correct order please please please okay so the first one you had was in fact your india oh really there we go that's what i got right cool here we go your second one was your cozy yeah that's the one i got right there we go was the acidity that gave it away for me there third is the one that i keep changing the name and pronunciations of nova levanto that's the third different pronunciation you've given well and then last but not least of course is from the explorations range it is cape town wait and i got two lungo you do know that this gets recorded hey are we going to go back and check can't go back but i'm pretty sure you only had one it's fine i got coffee out of the deal i'm happy do you know what i liked about this because i i never kind of do a comparison of so to be able to taste how different the flavor notes are and i think it's a bit bewildering because there's such a range we've obviously been able to taste all of them um but i really like the kind of the subtle differences between and you really get a feel for it comparing them yeah and what about that yeah you know why because it's robust um it's got a lot of flavor you know like they say the captains are kind of coffee snobs but there's a reason because we've got such a rich coffee culture here i i really liked it i found that the others a little bit too acidic for me definitely um this was kind of i was going to challenge you and say you know what i just hate what you said but absolutely i agree with cape town oh there's coffee they nailed it yeah they nailed it well that's why i was called off to cape town they know what capetonians want and like i'm the winner that's what you were trying to say there is that very impressive the reigning coffee champion of the world oh well i'm very impressed with your knowledge really really well done graham and you know what let us know on facebook and twitter if you perhaps have a fun and favorite coffee that you like but you've also you know i need to say well done to each and every one of you and if you at home have a favorite coffee that is yours let us know on the espresso facebook or twitter pages and include that hashtag nespresso espresso here we go you wanna do cheers yeah man just cheers oh [Music]", "QU6c_FN_0-w": "low carb mocha

over there yeah I don't say I'm gonna get cracking with the video um if you're wondering why we're in the st. Pierre as well is because we are doing some other cooking videos after this one mmm so yes crack on yep I need these other two recipes to do I'm holding the camera with today my mom's gonna be here in this video excuse me simplest about this is pop from the vanilla essence no extra tea just gonna put it all in the saucepan together so we need a [Music] a medium hate that come on I'm gonna do is put my older really my butter my to keep the smooth we'll make sure we get what we can out of that if you have a vibrated milk hopefully gateway my brown sugar ruling carrier think in the description below bigger sauce / nice my whipping cream combined to that combined that Lester can wonder today it's get my left I have a candy thermometer if you haven't got one I might betray you have to do it without sir I need it to be at a hundred and twenty that Celsius I'm just going to pop that in there and we'd be back when it reaches I still liked it but this done so you not put off by just bugging holing the butter actually does now into it once the temperature starts to cut up and get there but I'm only at 40 at the moment obviously doubt turned back on do give it a stir every so often and just if you could say it was stopping after we go somewhere only yeah I don't doesn't mean there's actually you can deform all right yeah it is a carry different monitor you can do if you haven't got candy thermometer is Oh get a bowl some ice cold water and oil it'll play and my mum used to like that and and you just get your water and you drape a bit of your mixture off into the water it's best if a car water and if it sucks teeth thumbs a bowl but it's slightly sticky your lap like a soft one and if you bond it hard obviously if you leave your toffee a little bit longer and it'll form like hardball as soon as it hits the water okay say we are starting to bubble very starting to melt all right but don't be cool by that that will all combined in obviously my butter wasn't melted it was home which is the way to be it's the way yeah because the idea is you just put it all in and well less misses a one pop yeah basically yes um we'll all start combining nicely obviously when it reaches the temperature this does take a bit of time you see something you want to do on a medium although you don't want to rush it and that is caramel it's not a dirty spot before anyone spots it as I would wipe it off but I know Wyatt on with the thermometer so it wasn't like at my play was the thermometer they've done that after trying to get it to stick yeah we go inside for me it was playing up today yeah but as you can say my butter has now all mouth it's lovely in there that's a take bit time with it and now I'm just gonna turn it up to high hey and let that come up to a hundred and 20 Celsius when you're making toffee I know we had an old saucepan but I useful making sweet it's a hard face and I don't care if it gets wrecked or not sure what saucepan we had ah what we've had is what am I saying the spirits loose bones what we heard it no is the biggest soul spin poppin enough because if you don't have spent it does that yogurt note to self if you have a make sure when you do interest be you have a big enough saucepan that was not big enough anyway oh yes ago are the end them of the video just to liven it up not what to do we're just over the Honda desert thing let me see on the camera but yeah not long to go now we're nearly there um I'm gonna clean up the oven obviously this season we're not there as yet but if I just show you it's a little bit what you do once it's off hey did you take a bit and just add it to you Walter and see what he does well as you say that it's really soft it's just dissolving at the moment are you applying for it to get to temperature it yeah feels about five hours right yeah get your camera man or you get chairs get your camera man while you pretend you can't leave it to make you drink I'm like son honey took longer because we had that little miss Amelia [Applause] as you can see this is what I'm named by [Music] if you know it fits its sticky lovely to my spoon now if you drop it into there let's just say that it's Mexican yeah but

sometimes there's bubblegum in the middle for an even longer lasting finish the larger ones are just for show most shawl breakers are about the size of a golf ball to make their bubble gum centers a worker blends synthetic rubber with powdered resin which will dissolve the rubber he adds a thickener a preservative and an oil called soya palm staring so the candy won't stick to your teeth after mixing and steaming at 300 degrees Fahrenheit for four hours the batter pours into trays to coal sugar coloring and flavoring would deteriorate in the heat so workers add those later there's enough of this base to make gum centers for four hundred and fifty thousand small jawbreakers after 24 hours the batter's hard workers chop it up and blend it with corn syrup to make it softer and sweeter they had just under 100 pounds of finnish gum that didn't make it into jawbreakers before because it wasn't the right shape now they had natural and artificial flavors which can include lemon orange strawberry grape even tutti frutti then they add icing sugar it makes the gum smoother to chew than regular sugar wood workers dumped the batch into an extruder that shapes to continuous streams of batter called rope another extruder divides each rope into six hollow tubes the cavity inside will become pockets of air inside the gum centers the next machine slices the tubes into segments that are three feet three inches long a mechanical arm pushes the segment's into the channel of a forming machine steel rolls then slice through the tubes and shape them into balls the balls range in diameter depending on the size of the jawbreakers being produced air blows through perforations in a cooling tunnel to cool and firm the Centers then they fall into another forming machine which restores their round shape other jawbreakers have hard candy in the center the machine that makes them works like the presses drug companies used to make pills it feeds candy powder into dies then applies up 25 tons of force to compress the powder into a solid candy now for the rest of the jawbreaker first they dump the candy centers into what's called a coding pan they had a hot mixture of water corn syrup and food coloring then dextrose a type of powdered sugar the fan rotates for 20 minutes as warm air drives the ingredients over the Centers the factory repeats this step ten times for each layer talk about a sweet ordeal making a jawbreaker takes four days workers give this badge special treatment they speckle these jawbreakers with different colors giving them with this company calls the psychedelic look after letting the candies drive for 24 hours a worker adds pinches of powdered carnuba wax this gives the jawbreakers a shiny finish sliced open you can see these jawbreakers have ten layers of flavors and sugar surrounding either hard candy or bubble gum course they measure two and a quarter inches in diameter as big as a billiard ball and if you're counting calories forget it a jawbreaker is ninety percent sugar", "aCiEG0BRDdM": "oh very unusual I didn't imagine that weathers would ever do chocolate you've actually got it all mixed together and swirled in as one Moorish it's

or as little as you like depending on how many people are involved you'll probably recognize this coffee for its whipped fluffy appearance that peaked during quarantine and dominated tick tock trends but this coffee actually originated from well somewhere else i have found equal articles that say that this coffee is from south korea and india so if anyone knows actually for sure leave a comment down below watch for the spillage here it can get quite messy and it should end up coming out looking like this with nice fluffy peaks so now it is time for assembly grab your plant-based milks or regular milks i just did regular and that nice fluffy golden coffee topping and some straws and that's it that's all you need the trick with this drink though is to really stir in that coffee mixture
