hands sounds like i just popped a [ __ ] soda this thing is straight sizzling just like that solar pop seltzer sound when i think of the words afghani and i think of the words purple i don't come up with anything else in my mind except for funky and berry this is just as bland as the smell and the taste the look it's good the dry it's so [ __ ] weird i don't i don't know how they get it to the end point or what they're doing but it's it's not they should have snap crackle and popping let me get back in well at least i got my fresh cup something else that my little assist rocking here she hit me with this that's that gsr drip on the cup you can get yours however you'd like this is what i wanted got the flag draped the colors going down i think it came out pretty dope this kind of stuff she does you do any kind of custom orders you want your design your labels and she's a small business so go ahead and try to support somebody local if you want i'm not asking you to i'm just telling you that this is the kind of work she does it's good stuff the grinder you see how it does if you're smoking these woods smoking these blood fills it great gives you a nice little chunk you'll end up with that fine powder mess this afghani purple nah i can't i don't wanna for the 60 bucks it cost me for this blunt i really really want this to be good i really really wish that this had some kind of boop bap or anything you know a papa a little smack a little something but it's just so not there it's just so bland it's just a waste it looks pretty decent it's just not carried the right way to me not dried the right way to me this is all again in my opinion what the [ __ ] do i know i only been in cannabis for 30 years a resume that is not written down anywhere you know people always ask me about myself there's nothing i can tell because i wouldn't ever tell myself this right here though i will tell you about it it [ __ ] sucks afghani purp bom you're going in the trash you're out of

a\nlittle swatch that I've made so let's begin you're going to chain six one two\nthree four five six now you're going to count back to the\nfourth chain one two three four and we're going to place a double crochet\nthere and in the next two stitches and now we've made one cluster which\nconsists of a chain three loop on the end and three double crochets and that's\nRow one now for Row two we're going to chain 6 one two three four five six\ngoing into the fourth chain one two three four or you can count up the three\none two three whichever way is more comfortable and\nwe're going to do one double crochet and then another double crochet in the next\nstitch and another double crochet in the next stitch and that's another cluster\nso now you're wondering where where do I go now and what you do is you turn your\nwork or flip it or twist it however you want to comprehend that and then your\nhook will just automatically fall right into that chain three space and you're\ngoing to do a slip stitch and then chain three one two three and do three more\ndouble crochets in the same space that's two and three and that's row two\ngo to row three we're going to chain six one two three four five six go into that\nfourth chain put a double crochet another double crochet in the next\nstitch and again in the last stitch double crochet and you're going to turn\nyour work and slip stitch into that chain three and we're gonna do three\ndouble crochet we're going to chain three first and now do three double\ncrochet in the same space one two three slip stitch into the next chain three\nspace chain 3 1 2 3 three double crochets in the same space 2 & 3 gonna double crochet I'm gonna double\ncrochet and your third double crochet like to turn your work slip stitch and\ncontinue this row across same as before when you get to the end of the row I\nwill show you how to decrease now that you've completed this row I will show\nyou how to decrease what we do is chain three one two three turn your work and\nslip stitch in that chain three space and now we're going to do another\ncluster in that chain three space so we're going to chain 3 3 double crochets\none two three and then we're going to slip stitch in that chain three space\ndo another cluster we're going to chain 3 3 double crochets in the same space slip stitch in the next chain chain 3\nspace and now we're going to chain 3 1 2 3 three double crochets 2 3 and now\nwe're going to slip stitch in that next chain 3 space and then we're going to\nchain 3 1 2 3 and then we're going to turn and slip stitch into that chain 3\nspace on your left and you're starting to decrease so let's do the next row\nwe're going to chain 3 1 2 3 3 double crochets in the same space slip stitch in the\nnext chain three space chain 3 3 double crochet 1 2 3 slip stitch in the next\nchain three space chain 3 turn and now we have one cluster left chain 3 3\ndouble crochets in the same space 3 slip stitch in the next chain three space\nchain 3 turn and slip stitch into that last chain 3 space and now this is where\nyou started and you went all increasing up through here and then start your\ndecrease right there so the beginning and the end next I will show you how to\nchange colors at the end of our row we're going to chain 3 turn and at this\npoint we're going to add a new color so I already have the slip knot on my yarn\nput that on your hook pull that through and then we're going to chain 3 1 2 3\nand tighten that last turquoise loop down a little bit and I'm going to\ncrochet over my tail of the purple and then we're going to continue with the\nsame pattern sequence so I have my chain 3 and I'm going to do 3 double crochet - okay slip stitch in the next space\nchain 3 3 double crochet slip stitch in the next space and that's how it'll look\nand you keep going and then you can tie this off make it secure so it doesn't\ncome undone and that's all there is to it I hope you've enjoyed this

of outdoor cannabis I know it's nighttime what I'm shooting this early in the morning sleep is for the weak hmm no coffee no a spliff look cause I've been hmm about stations all week and it's absolutely paid off now it's time to show you guys the final four plants we've got your last look at the most purple cush you're ever gonna see and some two superstars sativas okay let's get through with folks here we grow hmm it's been a very very busy week fortunately there hasn't been any rains hasn't been any terrible thunderstorms but nevertheless - at the ready and I've been keeping unusual hours I've also been busy harvesting a couple of plants so let's pick up with blue coach berry the most purple specimen of the bunch and it is safe to say that this girl is incredibly dank and incredibly close to harvest get a load of these boards oh my god maximum frosted maximum purple tones and those beautiful orange hairs oh yes oh yes okay this week I promise is gonna show you my jeweler's loupe but I just couldn't figure out how to you know get a good angle with on the cameras I can't really zoom in any better on these trichomes than with the with the video camera or something I'm trying to get in under what you can see look it's totally frosted and I'm trying to hold a napkin in there at the error all on this particular plant completely milky had a try comes now I just I'll show you the actual jeweler's loupe in one of the smoke reports or maybe just in the next episode before we wrap it up so you know when I'm talking my book pocket microscope whatever you use was that is all you need you know to really get in there but at the same time you know your quarterly ball I'm gonna be honest with you because I've never come that's of course had so many so much frost that's how many orange airs and within at the end of week age and you know that wasn't dawn so this girl is absolutely ready to go so I've been just flushing it with the five milliliters per liter of coconut water and we'll just take it down here we have a look and the medium is not quite dry so I'm gonna clip her tomorrow wit her sister that has also produced some purple tones now not quite so rich the developments but get a load of these notes oh yes indeed you stuff so just a sugary and just as ripe and ready for harvest too so just a pullback week that Blue Crush Berry is a really killer strain that's one for definite I'll be growing this again pleasure to grow out of the whole lot of the easiest to grow most suitable in my opinion to the environment and the climatic conditions and definitely responded really really well to my experimental organic nutrient regime does it go admit last year was all about you know using the minimal amount of Canada synthetic a typical indoor nutrients and applying what I knew there outside this year starting off with the auto flaring plans you seen back in spring was you know taking that a step further okay seen what's the minimum we can do with the autos with those synthetic nudes but still got great yields okay then with this particular crop how can i integrate as much organics as possible and then finally make the switch where I'm just using organic products on a pretty much there now ladies and gentlemen so the next crop you see sometime in 2020 God knows where I'll be hopefully I'll be on the move applying for a lot of jobs internationally so anyone if you have received my CV take this video into consideration the mind knows how to cross course okay right now moving love and the purple tones don't stop get a load of this LA amnesia they can't you two just keeps on giving okay definitely the sugars and the frosty and fattest colors it luck quite possibly the pick of the litter if I'm honest it depends on the high now it's gonna take a lot to cut that new course very but this is in your direction swinging city but it's gonna be very uplifting as opposed to crack a lock and you can see no popcorn those few boards you say even the kind of stragglers I lollipop themselves just the top no bit so it's all lovely stuff and purple tones yeah that is now confirmed right this is what my hypothesis was going into it that it was the OG Kush if it's in the mix in their genetics and you got a bit of cold water then you'll see some purple tones and depending on how much of it is in there and if it is the real deal OD Kosh has been crossed in and you'll see because I didn't see it I'm a sense Easter because that's not cross that og cush and it didn't see it I'm a Mendocino skunk that's also that's not grass ecology cush but I think all these strains have a little bit of G caution including the atomic cell Hayes get a loaded up these purple tones super sugary nogs now these are actually beginning to rival the LM need very very frosty city without a paradise seeds folks and they don't take that long to flare get a load of this and we gate I reckon next week I'm gonna say now it's gonna be the last episode of the cultivation part and his series so there you have it folks say bye-bye to the blue coach berry been amazed so Colin time I'm eight weeks I'm furious flaring and that was nice you know eight weeks of adjective growth got your shooter mainline and that's another thing if you want to learn how to mainline yourself got a recommend this technique for all the kinds of growers indoors or outdoors want to get total control over your crop and the maximum yield only the top shelf colas that's in looking at a torchon yes absolutely I could have blasted all of these plants out with a variety of chemical fertilizers blown the boards off twice the size oh yeah I could have done that but it would have been fit for human consumption absolutely not why not gonna smoke it up that's another reason why you know I stay away from hydro if I can I'm not knocking it in a desperate situation as yeah as opposed to smoke and not yeah it smoke your highlighter but know when it's my own stuff I want the absolute perfect Sun growing cannabis as natural as possible no contaminants no unknown chemicals that will turn me or future generations and ways behind me into the elephant back you know all right honestly I'm waiting for that the near future gonna wheel a bloke out onto a stage with two heads and six-fingered hands and I'm gonna tell you a week ago you look like Brad Pitt and then you had tree going to this high ground bang okay folks I hope you've enjoyed make sure to set a reminder don't miss the grand finale these are soaking satine coals have not for you next week okay thank you for your attention thanks for your support greatly appreciate it you know without you guys I am literally talking myself you know I don't get any help from YouTube the

you haven't already ok folks until next week it's the top shelf grower design now oh yes it's a good day to harvest some purple we have a great weekend and bye bye", "bs3Dw-5HFTk": "[Music] hey everybody welcome another episode of you do my name is bud thank you for joining me I am here in quarantine I've got you know I've got everything I need here so it's not too too bad one thing you definitely need those you need some decent weed and right now I am showing off some of these products from Josh hush cannabis club calm you just go to that website and they have such a variety of different things on there that and it's great because it just delivers right to your door or to your post office so and in times like this where essential services are being cut off or not being cut off cannabis is kind of on that fine line you know a lot of people don't think it's a an essential service which may be fair enough but I'm sure there are people that you know genuinely need it for medical things but we are also getting into growing the seasons so a couple things a couple things are okay there okay so right now I have this it is Afghan Kush this is a high level indica indica dominant strain has a little bit of sativa in there but cush as you may or may not know is one of the more kind of like there's no one like pink Kush is no one to be quite potent stuff same goes for this Afghan Kush this is one of the original strains of cush out there mmm okay this is what it looks like nice bud on there it's a little bit fluffy but it's also really sticky like this in your fingers already I can feel it sticking really nice smell there's light kind of floral notes to it a little bit lemony a little like a white pepper kind of a smell to it almost has like a banana pepper kind of vinegar enos to it it's really nice so I'm gonna grind this guy up and see where it takes us again I've tried I've tried these products a few times now I've this was 3.5 grams and now I'm down to this last bud but I've really enjoyed it this is a day well I'm on the third week of quarantine here which I know hopefully all you guys out there taking the appropriate measures and if you're you don't have to work then hopefully you don't have to go out or if you're working from home and hopefully you don't have to go out too much I know for myself I'm fortunate because I'm basically being waited on hand and foot here because I I met at my parents backyard but and that's because I came back from my my Southeast Asia trip that I was on about three and a half months early and so my home has been rented out and now that there's a renters freeze and you basically you can't kick anyone out which is fine I agree to that so that's okay everyone needs a place to live but that's why I'm here currently but it's not too too bad as far as I'm concerned as long as you guys stay on your property or away from other people then we're good okay Oh once this stuff some busted up a little bit you can smell how like oily and dense and and mmm pungent this one is really nice okay in a row a little joint here I've you may have noticed I've switched to zigzag Silver's and they just look cool there there's they're thinner than the whites which I normally use but I'm getting used to it I like it okay let's try this one out so I want to say thank you to all the new subscribers that we have pumping in right now because I guess it's it's April so of 2020 and you know it's starting to get to be around growing season so hopefully there's a lot of people out there looking at some of the grow videos I have a lot of updates on those videos and hopefully I'll be doing some growing from seed videos coming up soon so okay here we go [Music] it tastes nice and fruity already a little bit earthy very like that white pepper smell on when it's freshly ground up is on the on the palate you could say mmm these ones are very potent in the 25 to 27 THC range but also there's there's higher levels of CBD and some of these products from from hash because they primarily focus on a lot of the indica dominant strains um this one tastes delicious sometimes you you find different strains that smell so beautiful this is one of them if you can get yourself some Afghan Kush I highly suggest it it's a classic basically you know it's kind of like pink cush is a classic these are that the go-to blueberry another classic so again couple puffs should do the trick let it settle in I can usually feel I don't know about you guys but I can usually feel it after one or two puffs and and it kind of is a good gauge of where you are but there are like some people call them creeper creeper weed where you don't feel it for like maybe 10-15 minutes and so people like that it's not working and they smoke a [ __ ] ton of it and all of a sudden they're too stoned for their own good and I gotta say there aren't you know when you're first starting to smoke pot you you're not as used to it or accustomed to it so it's you don't want to have a bad experience by getting too stoned I know that definitely happens for people so again go slow take it easy thank you for joining me this stuff's really good it's really good for creativity and I say that with all of them but that's kind of just what pot does for me personally it's this one also kind of makes me a little bit and a little bit speedy in the sense that it is an indica and it should be mellow but I do get a little bit I don't want to say hyper it's not the right word but I think people who smoke pot know what I mean when it's got a little bit of a sativa edge to things it makes you you know start something without finishing it most like starting a painting or starting your dishes or writing a song or making a coffee and you forget to drink it all that kind of stuff it's this this one does that to me for sure anyways you guys thanks for joining me my name is bud click like subscribe and we will see you very soon thanks again stay safe out there [Music]", "ppcEWrZHOyM": "hey guys it's robin rs island crafts and welcome to my studio many of you may recognize this as my miter square blanket and for those of you that are new and haven't seen this before this is a project that i've been working on and off on well mostly off i'd say for maybe five years quite possibly five years and i just got stalled on it every time it came around i'm like i should work on it i need to work on it i love the look and i love the scrappiness but it is made using leftovers of sock yarn which is a very thin yarn and you work it with very thin needles and it just takes a bit of time for me to make a square the squares themselves are two and a half inches square of course and the knit on the miter which makes them fun and they make this little line and stuff on it which i really love but i just find that i will find any reason not to work on it i love the blanket and i want this blanket but i can't seem to put forth to work on it right now and i don't find enjoyment out of forcing myself to work on a project i don't like having to i don't mind scheduling some time and saying okay like every monday i'm going to work on my socks and every wednesday i'm going to work on an afghan i don't mind that but when i say you have to work on this project before you can do a b or c it just doesn't work for me several of you have asked for some help some guidance a little tutorial on how i do my miter square blanket because you'd love to do one yourself but you're not really quite sure about all the different parts of it and everything and it can be a little bit not confusing or difficult you just have to think through it and once you get going then it becomes easy peasy and even like me when i don't work on it for an entire year i find it easy to come right back to it the way i do mine it's a really simple pattern so you don't have to have a lot of thought into it some of them you have to do a lot of counting and stuff the way i'm going to show you guys in this series is going to be an easy way for you to remember where you're at at any given time but you're definitely not going to work on this small yarn and with the tiny needles and such but i'm going to show you the yarn that i picked up recently that it's going to make a lot easier for me to actually finish a small afghan for myself i don't need anything large just something a little bit to cuddle up with on the couch or something a little bit of a lap can i'm not going to take this apart i put a lot of hours into it i haven't decided exactly what i'm going to do i could turn it into a cushion i would have to take off these that i've already put on this way i might just continue to square it off and make it into just a small little something that i can hang up or lay somewhere but i'm definitely not going to take this apart so today i'm going to show you what yarn i chose show you how to read a yarn label a little bit in case you haven't done that before so that you can either go online or go to the store and purchase what you need and then i'll show you what i purchased i was thinking that it'd be nice to use a worsted weight yarn so that would be using a larger needle because this is a knitting project there is a crochet version by the way i just haven't tried that yet and then i thought well maybe i should do it in some pastels i love a nice easter pastel color palette i know it's kind of uh different off of what i usually have is the big brights and bolds against maybe a black background or something but i also like pastels so i went and looked at the baby yarns but it's like baby yards are a specialty yarn and they're a little bit thinner than the worsted weight and it just seems like the store wants to charge extra because it's a baby yarn instead of just pricing it like average with everything else so i said all right well forget the pastels let me go wander off a little bit and i was at michael's and i found one of my favorite yarns michael's has a brand called impeccable now you're not gonna be able to buy this anywhere but at michael's so you can find something similar red heart is the same is the same i'm gonna show you how to see the label but you can use any yarn you want whether it's the same size as mine if you want a thicker heavier blanket you can do it in bulky or super bulky and you would really whip through that blanket super fast because it doesn't take many stitches when you're working with big big fat yarn so i found the impeccable and i thought okay well you know i love impeccable the baby yarn was 9.99 for a skein that was just a little bit bigger than this and i wanted a variety of colors so you're talking 50 60 70 dollars for an afghan i thought that's a lot of money just buying acrylic to make something for myself so i wandered around the impeccable was on sale for 2.99 michaels puts this on sale all the time just wait a little bit it'll be on sale and i think normally it's 3.99 anyways and then you can use one of their coupons and get a discount so i found this light gray but this isn't what caught my eye these two are what caught my eye oh a salmony color and i'll see if they name these this one is called sea green and this one is arbor rose and my gray is classic gray so this is kind of a salmony color and this is i don't know a sea green it has more of a blue color to it but i really liked that so i thought those were really they're close to pastel and yet they're still a bit bright so that was fun so then i brought in an orange this one is orange crush and the purple is magenta i thought that was really fun so i look okay so i've got the basically a red an orange a purple a blue well i need a green so i found this green this one is citron see right citron so oh there we go just in case i don't have enough yarn or in case those colors get to be a little bit too much i purchased a second gray that way i can calm these colors down by interspersing the gray throughout here and there and give it just that nice look to it so i bought one two three four five six seven of them at three dollars a ball so there's twenty one dollars give or take tax and stuff like that so i thought that was a much better price for me to purchase a large amount like this because i can't just buy sometimes when you're buying the acrylic yarns you can go ahead and maybe you're gonna find there's dye lots and stuff but most of the time the colors are the same especially when you're doing something like a gray if i were making a big gray blanket and i can only afford five at a time i could buy five now i can come back next month or when i get through those five and buy five more and spread out the budget like that but for this i want to have a variety of patchwork colors kinda like a patchwork quilt mixing all the colors up i'm not going to be doing rows or anything like that i want that really mixed up look i'm sorry but i can't tell you exactly how much yarn to buy it's all going to depend on the type of yarn you buy the size needles you use how your tension is when you're knitting and how big you want your afghan to be we can start out when we make our first square we can go ahead and knit our first square to the size and with the needle size we want and get it to the look we want and the feel then we can weigh it and then we can get a bit of an estimate on how much yarn we're going to need based on how much that one square weighed even though we're going to say that i'm having all of these different colors i can kind of figure it out once i get started and i see how big my squares are i am going to want to do a little bit of a grid and do the math work to figure out the size so that i can instead of just randomly saying oh i'm going to knit on this one and then i'll knit on this one i want to actually color in some graph paper so i get an idea of where they all are so like when we're laying out a quilt and we can disperse our colors and our fabrics all around so when we get to the end we don't notice that we had a big blob of purple over there and then we have none up in that corner so i want to just play with it a little bit so when we get to that point when we make our first square when you do the miter square blanket you make the first square on its own and then you start attaching them as you go or if you want you can knit them all individually and then sew them together and that way you have the opportunity to move them all around and however you want i am going to show you on how to do each little element of it and how we do the first because we start down in the corner and i'll show you how to attach them when you're going on the long side on this side and then i'll show you how to do them on that side and then i'll show you how to do the center but then i'm going to have to sit down and think too do i want to make mine all individually so that when i get to a certain point i'm not going to have this giant blanket sitting in my lap i think that might be a good idea too to make them individually and then at the end i can lay them all out into maybe little nine patches and then stitch them together so let's look at the yarn and figure out what's going on with these labels so you guys can see what i've purchased and then get an idea when you go to the store on what you want to purchase as i mentioned it's impeccable and this is from michael's most yarns will come with a pattern on it so when you're looking at the yarn trying to decide what size needle or crochet hook you want you have to be careful that you look right underneath where all the measurements are you have 285 yards four and a half ounces because as you get going it'll also have this section down here where you want to see that this says little pebbles crochet poncho so if you're looking for the crochet hook size you have to be careful because this one does say j yes but this might not necessarily be the same size it's recommended for the yarn all different types of patterns might use different types of yarn the majority of the times you're going to find that this will match the recommended hook size but we want to use a knitting needle so this hook size isn't going to help us so we need to come back up and then we need to look at this section here this is a medium weight yarn so it has a skein of yarn right there with a four in it that means it's just your medium it's your average one that's not too thick not too thin if you want to get a bulky there's a five and a super bulky is six and as the numbers get bigger the yarn gets thicker now when we get down to the sock yarn see how this one's a four my sock yarn is a one and there's even a super fine one that's below that so that just shows you the difference between a the sock blanket i'm working on and the one we're going to do here see now here it says that your crochet hook that they recommend is an h so that's definitely different than what they showed on the bottom and a lot of that has to do with the type of texture and stuff that the pattern is so check out your pattern on what type of hook or needles required and a lot of times you really need to do like a gauge swatch when we do our squares we're going to knit the first square and then we're going to evaluate it do we like it is it is it too tight do we have a really tight tension is it too loose and airy and the blanket's not going to keep us warm or is it loose and airy and it's going to be perfect for a summer blanket spring or fall or you want something heavier for winter so maybe we need to go up a needle size or down a needle size if you have a size 4 medium worsted weight yarn at home and you're not going to use it for this blanket you can go ahead and test out a square with that and that way you'll know which size needle you need to use so if you don't have the proper size needle and you don't want to buy a bunch of them we might have to test it out and you might have to go back up to the store and pick another one out or order it online or there's a lot of ways on amazon and other places where you can buy a whole set of them i did purchase one from michael's and it was very inexpensive for compared to knitting needles and such again i picked up their brand it's loops and thread i went with a size nine because when i looked at this here the knitting needles are a little bit different you have to kind of peek in there and i thought it said the size and i thought it said a nine in there but now that i can see it in the light outside of the door that says an eight but that's okay i also have size eight needles i do find that sometimes i will knit a little bit tighter so maybe i want my blanket to be a little looser so i'll be able to try the eights and the nines i went with the circular needles because i went with a 16 inch also and because i wanted something instead of having the straight needles through let me show you on this one i'm knitting this one on double points so i have these straight needles that are sitting in there and they're just depending on how much yarn you have on how many stitches you've casted on your yarn could come all the way to the end with your stitches and it could easily come off and at any time that this could slide off i did make a double point needle case here i will put a link to the pattern that i've shown a video on how to make these so if you're using the double point needles or even the circular ones they do have straight needles that are pretty short that have a stopper on the end so that could be an option too i just really enjoy working on the double points so as you see they have this short little cable in the center here these are nothing fancy they are perfectly fine i use these a lot for knitting hats and stuff i do prefer the chow goo needles they have a nice red cable in the center here let me pull this out and show you these are great for knitting i like them for knitting socks and for knitting shawls and sweaters and stuff so they have this nice cable and the cable always just stays like this a lot of times these plastic ones they get they stay the shape that they were in the package so you could have a little bit of struggle this one feels nice it's very flexible and it's not a hard hard tubing or plastic in there and then you have the where it's joined onto the needles so there are a variety of needles that you can purchase and different whether you want the circular needles or you want to go straight and even if you just have double pointed needles on with the they're pointing on both sides double point those are usually used for knitting in the round you could use those and just put a cork or a stopper on the end of them eraser you can always put into there get some of the air dry clay and make little stoppers for the end so that you only have one end that's pointy and the other end can stop the yarn from sliding off so i'm going to go ahead and try the nines and see if it gives me a nice flowy it's kind of like when you're doing something with clothing and you want it to lay on your body nice and have a nice feel and flow to it a nice drape we want the same thing with our afghan generally in terms we don't like anything that's super firm and stiff that's really can almost stand up on its own unless you're looking for something like that it's also kind of hard on the shoulders and hands and elbows when you're knitting super tight like that so when can you expect these videos to come out these videos aren't going to be part of my normal friday tutorials generally they're not going to well they're not going to be part of a saturday live stream if necessary we can always do a live stream on a different day at a different time so that you guys can ask questions and i can show you different things if that's what you need to see so until i actually get started on this i don't know exactly when they're going to come out as i do them i'll probably have them come out once a week i like to go ahead and get started and get a few made ahead of time so that you guys have something that's already lined up and ready to go so if you're not already subscribed it might be good to go ahead and subscribe to my channel and hit that little notification bell so that youtube will let you know whenever i put a new video out i guess we should get back to this for one quick second this yarn is 100 acrylic which means for me that the cat fur can get on it and go through the washer and dryer no problem this yarn tends to wash up really nice oh there's even a nice little afghan on there i might have to save that but a lot of times if you want to you can go online and find these on the michael site or whatever the loops and threads you can look up and google it and see if you can find some free patterns for it they're not always just on the ball of yarn so if you're concerned with anything it has all of the little washing instructions here you can't iron it you can't bleach it but it goes through the washer and dryer i might have to look up what all these other symbols are this is made in turkey most yarn it seems is made in turkey the biggest thing is what you're going to need is you're going to need to choose your yarn and they all need to be the same thickness so if you pick up a size 4 you want to buy all size fours you don't want to mix a 4 with a 2 and a 6 because you're going to have your your squares aren't going to line up properly they do have the washing instructions machine wash warm permanent press setting do not bleach tumble dry low do not iron do not dry clean that's probably what that is do not dry clean they do have the lots but as i mentioned oh this just shows that it was looks like it was manufactured it just seems like it says 12 1 of 2020. these are all the same up here this one's got a different lot that was nine of 20 20. now i don't know if 2020 is the actual year but it just seems like that way but they do have a variety of them and as i said with what i'm doing it's going to be a patchwork blanket so it's really not going to matter if all the colors are going to be the same because if i have to pick up another ball of this sea green blue the two squares aren't going to be sitting next to each other they're going to be in some form like this so it's not like anything is going to be right next to each other to see a color variant and if there is it's not going to matter to me it's not going to bother me so i'm hoping to see you guys in the next video i hope you guys want to join in and make a miter square blanket or just kind of hang out with us and see our progress as we go so remember i have a link down below we have a facebook group for arlo's island craft so if you want to show off your yarn purchases and which ones you decided to go with or ask any questions you can ask down below in the comments you can ask in the facebook group or you can go ahead and send me an email you can also tag me on instagram if you want to use the hashtag rs islandcrafts and that'll pop up and we can all see your yarn choices over there also so i'm hoping to see you guys next week where we're going to start with our very first bottom right hand corner square and then we're going to work our way from there so thanks for hanging out with me and i'll see you guys next time bye", "XreC0FePOl8": "sup guys paid 22 here sorry I've been doing any updates I've just been really busy with harvest and whatnot there's another plan I got sitting in the dark super frosty you can see the purple and the leaves starting to come out this is purple haze I wish I had a better camera once this harvest is all over I'll be getting any camera which I've had time looks like a great producer not bad I definitely should get my 4 ounce average per year the base is actually covered but it's about an inch and a half on the base for the most part of lollipop to kind of obviously missed a few you know with these Ranger but whatever other than that though it's looking for fire look how cursed Lee that is wait to smoke this it's going to be delicious it's epic these are some buds that got drying from the Afghani 17 one second guys like that looks pretty ball look how crystally that is fire that's how all the buds are I like this Afghani it's a [ __ ] awesome yielder couple of the plants I got almost six and a half ounces off of loves topping really branches out I mean it's kind of hard to tell but city you see this is all one plant that is one plant that's the top that's kind of our see what those are all like the middle nugs not bad right say so all that from one [ __ ] plan I think Justin tops and probably 5 ounces just in the tops a couple of these when they're wet we're got what was it 78 grams so I'm sure dry they're probably i'll teach just dense as hell yeah this is how I dry I know there's many techniques many ways but uh this is my dry / darkroom basically I just use a 4 by 4 10 nothing special I don't need a humidifier in here or anything I like to let it dry nice and slow I do got a fan blowing against the side wall just get some movement but not directly on it it's on low probably tomorrow I will come through and pick off the leaves and then give it another 24 hours but smelling bomb then I came I wish there was smell-o-vision name but look at that stacked alright guys well like i said i'll try to start doing more updates you know I really got backed up trying to build out this other room would just wait until you see this other room the plants are [ __ ] monsters these are just a couple of clowns all right guys I'll see you next time please", "K7oIxl1q7GE": "if you enjoy my videos leave me a comment and let me know and consider subscribing so you never miss a new video I'm gonna be using the dark purple and the light purple color I recommend using at least two colors see that you get a nice contrast with this pattern you can use whatever size yarn and corresponding hook that you'd like so we're gonna begin with our Slipknot and your chain needs to be a multiple of 18 plus 6 and just keeping in mind that this is going to shrink as you start to work the pattern so making your chain longer then you actually want your blanket to be or your project and if you're following along with me chaining 36 plus 6 for a total of 42 chains and I'll meet you at the end of the chain so I've made my chain first we're going to skip the first 5 stitches and work a double crochet into the sixth chain from the hook so double crochet in u.s. terms treble crochet in UK terms next we're going to make two more double crochets into this same chain space that we just worked so that we've made a cluster of 3 double crochets next chaining two skip two chains and work three double crochets into this next chain so that now we've made two clusters of three double crochets and again chaining to skip two and make three double crochets into this next chain so we're getting ready to work a valley so we're gonna be working peaks and valleys so that we get that ripple effect so to work our belly we're going to skip five chains work into that sixth chain making our double crochet and two more double crochets into that same chain space one more so that now we've got our Valley here so we'll start working back up to go make our peak so we're going to chain two skip two and work three double crochets into the next chain space chain two skip two and make three double crochets into that next chain space so always working in clusters of three double crochets okay so we're ready to make our peak so as you can see here's the valley and then here's going to be the peak so on every third cluster you're either making a peak or valley so to make our peak we're going to chain three and make three more double crochets into this same space that we just made our cluster of three so there's actually going to be six double crochets into the same chain space so here's our peak and we'll start working back down to make our Valley so now again just chaining two skip two and make our cluster of double crochets again treble crochets if you're in the UK chain two skip two and making another cluster and one more and again to work a Valley we're going to skip five chains and double crochet into that sixth chain making those three double crochet cluster here we'll chain two skip two and make another cluster of three double crochets so as you can see it's really easy and this is actually the hardest row of the whole thing the next row is even easier because you're just going to work into those big spaces here so we'll chain two skip two and then work our last cluster into that last stitch so for this very last double crochet leaving it so that you still have two loops on your hook because we're going to change color so you want to bring in your next color and just loop that around your hook leaving enough to weave in your ends and just pull that through to finish the double crochet just tug here to tighten it just a little so now with the new color we're going to chain 5 and turn our work I'll just cut my older color here so from here this is where it gets really easy all we're going to do is double crochet into this huge chain space here and we're going to make our 3 cluster okay now we'll chain to and now we just work into this next huge space here making those three double crochets so we've reached our Valley so when we get to our valley each time we're basically just going to skip it and work into this next big space here no chains just right double crocheting into that big space making our three double crochets so as you begin to work up this is going to start really pulling down and then again chaining two and working into our next space for our three double crochets so we're coming up to our peak so we're going to chain two and work three double crochets into this space where our peak is two three so to continue with our peak we're going to chain three and make another three cluster into this same space continuing with our next double crochet cluster two three chain two and go into our next space so this is a really easy pattern great for beginners and it really makes some beautiful blankets so again in our valley we're literally just going to skip it and work double crochets now into that next big space 2 3 chain 2 and going into this space next space 2 3 chain 2 and then working our last double crochet cluster into this last space to end the second row and again if you want to change your color just leaving this last double crochet with two loops on your hook and you can bring in the new color really easy and simple way to switch your color and just finish that double crochet and pull down here to tighten and again at the end you're going to chain 5 and turn your work and then just continue that same pattern over and over super simple so hopefully you guys have a better idea of how to make the grannie ripple stitch again consider subscribing and don't forget to hit the little Bell button so you never miss a new video", "-51gtFuayO0": "hello everyone it's glenda and welcome back to creative grandma's channel today's crochet tutorial is for the purple passion throw this is a beautiful afghan made with the mandela ombre in this beautiful colors of purple this is the color number 219 chi and i want to give a special thank you to lion brand for sponsoring this video and supplying me with the yarn to make this afghan i just thought this yarn worked up beautifully it had so many different shades of the purple and it just was the perfect yarn for the stitch pattern so let me tell you a little bit about the yarn and then i'll give you more information about the afghan and show you the stitch pattern up close so this yarn comes in a 5.3 ounce cake 150 grams 344 yards 315 meters it's machine wash and dryable and when i make these larger projects i want to be able to put them in the washer and dryer and keep them clean and nice this yarn is a hundred percent acrylic it has a very soft feel to it it is a wonder to work with i absolutely enjoyed working with this yarn it's made in india and it is a four medium worsted weight yarn now for this pattern today you're going to need seven cakes of yarn this afghan measures 42 inches across by 52 inches long now for today's project if you want to make this larger you're going to need to purchase more yarn you're going to need to use the stitch multiple of 4 plus 10 so you would chain 4 chain 4 again so it would be 4 8 12 increments of 4 until you get it to the width you want and then you need to add 10 more chains to start your afghan now let me show you some of the up close features of the stitch pattern now i don't know the name of the stitch pattern but when it's laying flat you really don't see how beautiful the stitch pattern is when you lift this afghan up you're going to see with spring and summer coming you want a more light and lacy afghan you don't want those really heavy chunky afghans you want something that's just light and lacy and still going to keep you toasty warm so when you look at this afghan you see we finished the afghan with a simple double crochet picot border just a simple border but just gives it the perfect accent as the finishing touch for this afghan and then when you hold the stitch pattern up you'll see that this stitch pattern is worked in v stitches and shells and when you work this pattern it pulls that v stitch ever so slightly inward and it creates this beautiful diamond if you look here you can see it a little bit better with the lighter color you can see these beautiful diamond shapes being formed in the pattern it's just beautiful now the lion brand mandela ombre comes in many wonderful color choices so you can check out those color choices now this afghan will be available as a kit directly from lion brand's website on march 5th so i'll have a link in the description box in this video you can click that

you would like to make this afghan so grab your yarn grab your hook and let's get this project started i already have my yarn attached to my hook and i just used a double knot you can use whichever method you prefer when you join your yarn on your hook we're going to begin and we're going to chain 174 chains you're going to yarn over pull through the loop on your hook and this creates your first chain the loop on your hook does not count as a chain yarn over pull through that's two three four five continue until you have 174 chains and i'll be back and we'll start row one i'm back i have my starting chain with 174 chains to begin row one we're going to yarn over the hook and you're going to skip the first six chain one two three four five and six you're going to insert into the seventh chain from hook work a double crochet yarn over the hook pull it through the chain you have three loops yarn over pull through two loops yarn over and pull through two loops that's how you make a double crochet we're going to chain one and then work one more double crochet back into that same chain and this creates a v stitch of a double crochet chain one and a double crochet all in that same chain now we're ready to start our repeat so if you need help working across your afghan this is where you're going to click back on the video you're going to work from the start of the repeat until i say this is the end of the repeat and you're going to repeat that across to within the last three chain so let's begin the repeat you're going to chain one you're going to skip the next three stitches one two three and we're going to work a double crochet into the next chain you're going to chain one and double crochet back into that same chain so what we're doing is working a double crochet v stitch of one double crochet a chain one and a double crochet into that chain and that is the end of the repeat so let's do it again you're going to chain one you're going to skip the next three chain one two three and we're going to work a v stitch into the next chain double crochet into that next chain chain one and double crochet back into that same chain so again you're going to have that double crochet chain one and double crochet into that chain and that is the end of the repeat so very simple repeat for row one so let's go ahead and do it one more time and then you can continue on your own again you're going to chain one skip three chain one two three work a double crochet into the next chain chain one and double crochet back into that same chain so that is the end of the repeat so again if you need help just click back on the video you're going to chain one skip the next three chains and work a double crochet chain one double crochet into that fourth chain and you're going to repeat that across until you get to the last three chains and i'll meet you there i'm over at the end of row one i have three chains remaining one two three this is what your work looks like so to finish row one again you end with three chains remaining and then we're going to chain one you're going to skip two chain and work a double crochet into that very last chain across the row and that's how you end row one and this is what your work should look like so row one is our base row and row two and row three will be our repeat rows so very easy pattern very easy repeat so let's go ahead and start row two we're going to begin with the chain three one two three and this beginning chain three counts as your first double crochet now we're going to start our repeat so again if you need help with row two just click back on the video to where i say this is the start of the repeat work until i say this is the end of the repeat and you're going to work that across to your ending

over the hook you're going to bring your hook to the front of the work insert from front to back and back to front around the post of that stitch so your stitch is laying right on top of your hook and then we're going to work a double crochet yarn over pull underneath the post of that stitch you have three loops on your hook yarn over pull through two yarn over and pull through two you just made a front post double crochet and then you may have to pull your work apart to find that chain one space we're going to work two double crochet a chain one and two double crochet into the center v stitch

live it was like like we're like they had stream yard and they like click here you go in the stream yard and boom there's everything and everybody and so you know that's in your family that are immediate families like i didn't know if i was considered what i was actually considered you know because i'm one when one hurt we all hurt right so no matter how distant we may be in um our family and our lives and we get busy with the hustle and bustle of things um when honey funerals weddings whatever we was all there it didn't matter was all there and this was different because this was a situation where we we couldn't be all i'll be there and i couldn't under i couldn't understand that i just i it just didn't i didn't know what to do right so it was crazy thank you so much vivian i appreciate that [Music] hey um you said uh you have my condolences yeah for real thank you so much you guys are amazing yes we will thank you so much brenda d mack prays for you kelly and family i'm

up snatched right where they need to be [Music] yes let's see um y'all pray for me my neighbor was extremely rude to me about some gifts being delivered to his kids right i remember that i have not spoken to him since i let him know about a creepy creepo what a creepo my kid saw on our dirt road and he just thought of the thing from christmas what i choose to forgive but he makes me angry okay we gotta forgive him even more and more girl make him something make him a hat he just now text me back that's why i brought that up oh okay wait a minute so heather what he do i mean what did he say i mean that we need to pray continue pray for him for that to be healed for your heart not to be offended huh because some people are just special oh he just brought up the thing from christmas i choose to forgive but he makes me angry okay okay one of the tenets of my therapy is that people are always doing their best no matter how it seems yeah they're probably doing their best in that moment we don't know what people are going through and all that i mean we're we're living in a space where it is really a challenge to just just be you know what i mean um you know seeing things that is happening and things that he was snarky oh okay we pray for him just say god bless you in the text and don't keep don't go look i got a text this week y'all from somebody who i have not heard from in a long time and thought they chose to text me and my brother they put me and my brother in this text and i was like oh brother don't respond let me respond because let me do that let me respond and i'll try with everything in me by the holy spirit not to hurt him not to offend him but to know i wasn't playing in love and that i want the best for him and his family this person thought i should feel some type of way about a situation not that it happened in our family that okay you know the situation around i don't like talking about stuff like this i don't even get down with it because i work in a space where i'm around how can i say um in my in my first job i'm around stuff that has to deal with politics right i don't want to hear about it i don't want to talk about it i don't want text about it i just don't i don't care who you like it don't matter to me i don't care the only thing i care about and this is 100 is what does the lord require of us and that is it 100 all this extra nonsense is going on and stuff people choosing to be mad about choosing to be excited about choosing to go off about honey if we get caught up in these worldly things we are not living our fullness of what god has created us to be in this earth to show an example of his love and his kindness throughout the world right so my thing is i ain't got time for that so this person chose to text us about some stuff in that space and i was like so because i work in that space i know how certain things go so i will share this with y'all and i'ma get off it whenever somebody new comes into office it don't matter the party it doesn't they do this across the board period if they enter because it happens in my office all the time um whenever we get a new governor i'll keep it on that level whenever we get a new governor ladies and gentlemen please understand this this is what they do they interview the current staff not all staff but the higher up staff okay such as chiefs such as the director's office such as deputy directors all these people in that space the new administration interviews those people they got to go through it all over again an interview with the new head honcho in charge the new head honcho in charge can ask for resignations because they have their people that they want to bring in house to put into place there's nothing that this is the way it is across the board whether it be state local federal it don't matter this is how it works it happens all the time i'm telling y'all this is what happens because it does it happens and there's so am i going to get mad because somebody chose to ask for a certain type of person or a person that they deem to be um that should stay in their position because this is a nice person and they're great i've met a lot of nice people that had to turn in their resignations when a new administration came in there ain't nothing you could do about it it's not a double standard it's both it's that's the way it goes that's all i wanted to say about that but this person chose to text me about that and said i should be outraged you know why they said i should be outraged i will tell you this they said i should be outraged because they felt like they could tell me i should be outraged because of my darker hue listen what i don't get down like that look i love my family i love many cultures i love everybody i love love love everybody i don't care if you black white brown blue purple green orange yellow i don't care yes they thought that i should be upset because the person that they probably liked i don't know should i should be outraged and the media should really be covering this chair please i said look don't i said i ain't going back and forth with you i'm gonna tell you i'm gonna try to paraphrase my text and jennifer know how i am i i'm a nice nasty honey a nice nasty i was as nice as i could be but i said i'm not going we i said why would you choose to bring this stuff up in my face and why would you choose to bring it to me and my brother because we look a certain way because you might be outraged child people cr people are crazy i'm telling you what the way the world has been going honey all the different kind of people have been coming out though well what i'm gonna say will works honey people you thought was on the up and up you finding out oh okay um but all i can do is what the bible says do listen i love people period i don't care about your ethnicity i don't care it don't matter it doesn't matter i love everybody it makes me so upset that people would really think that because i'm darker that i have a darker hue than i'm i'm a certain way people think i vote in certain ways because i'm of the darker hue and you don't know me y'all don't listen people don't know me and that all i care about and this is the truth 100 hear my heart ladies and gentlemen brothers and sisters in the chat and in the bushes i love you i don't have to know you 100 to love you according to what the word says and because i love god so much i love you so much hear me i love the lord i do and honey i am if he called me home today i'm good because my heart is about that we are all god's creation that is what i will say we are all god's creation period and i love what god has created i love you and i don't care what you look like i don't care do you hear me i don't care so please if anybody thinks any other that's why i don't do all that don't come in here with no politics and all that stuff please never do that because it don't do nothing but divide divide dividing my channel is about love honey and i and i said that before and if you're a friend of mine and you know me for real for real you know uh honey i'm look what you see on this camera is what you see in person ask jennifer jennifer is my friend for real in this chat that is my friend you can ask jennifer what you saying here is what you're gonna get out there perry point blank amen i don't care all i'm gonna ask you to do is to love as well if you have certain biases and all that i ask you to take it to the lord blade at his feet lay it at his feet oh i love you oh look who mimi cat do honey i love you yeah yeah i am so tired of this stuff you guys and we we're supposed to love the bible tells us and not many people in this chat may not be in the word in the bible that's okay i don't care about that but if it's love i know what the word says for me to do and for me it is to love and the word tells us to love he said love our neighbors as ourselves you know what i mean and so i love you and that was just that's instruction that's even that's point blank period [Laughter] so do i get caught up in all this shenanigans is going on heavens no child please but the people what breaks my heart are people who say they love and they get caught up in in all this stuff and it and it does nothing but divide and cause pure hatred hatred and this person tried to get a rise out of me because of my hue you hear what i'm saying because of what i look like you thought they said why oh you it all caps you should be outraged for what honey child please get out of here no so i just told them god bless you i said don't come i said uh i said all right i said i am not gonna go back and forth with you over stuff don't even get down with so let's not let's not do that huh so yeah we are to love it is the truth honey i'm like go set your little happy crazy self down and go ahead let's go on the cast how about this what's going to cast out that demon let's do that let's cast out that spirit that nasty spirit right there that spirit of division that's going to cast that out and pray that the spirit of love for the love of god overtake you let the love of god overtake you huh good gracious yeah to love is the most of the you better come on in here heather it is the truth so i love you guys so you may not have wanted to hear that but i had to share that because heather brought that her situation triggered my heart about that situation so i had to tell this person heather i had to tell them i said listen may the peace of god that passes all understanding cover your heart and your mind you and your family may the blessings of god overtake you and that was it that was the end of my message because i was like no i ain't gonna go uh back for with you now back i'm sorry you guys but i had to share that a little bit we we just have to love that's it you may not like certain things heck there's a lot of things i don't like honey but that doesn't mean i don't love you i don't love you and i'm not gonna be tripping off of you know because i'm lighter darker i got lighter brighters and i'm darker right milk chocolate dark chocolate honey my my husband dark chocolate i love me okay don't let me let me just let me just go to bring it in listen it doesn't matter what you look like i love you anyway honey i love and what i love too i love different cultures oh my god i've i do i i don't i just do love absolutely love i love different types of foods and stuff like that honey i got friends from my one one of my um co-workers said and she's one of my lighter writers that's what i call my beautiful caucasian brothers and sisters my lighter brighter family she said to me she said kelly um you remind me of june what's her name june uh cash yes come on here yeah um she said you remind me june cash hey good evening good evening joyce campbell i'm just i'm just running my mouth today honey because heather triggered a little space in my heart about the love of god and treating people who yes i must have been there for that yeah you you were for that when my one friend she said that i reminded her of june cash she said you love people whether you know him or not and she said she thought that was just the best thing she said she said i'm not wishing for you to go or anything like that she said but i'm sure she said if i ever come if if it ever come if it ever happens god forbid that i have to come to a service for you like if i pass away she said honey there's going to be bikers up in there there's going to be homeless folks up in there they're going to be people of all from all nationalities up in there i'll just start cracking up i say ciao you're so funny it's because i and that's i've always been that way so you know y'all just love love people love people it don't matter it don't matter you want the best for people i don't care what you like that that is not our job let me also say this it is not our job to judge people that are not following christ the world is condemned already i know what the bible says the world is already connect on those who aren't father who aren't following god okay that the world's already judged for that it is our job to love and i just admonish people just to love people can we just do that it don't matter what or who they are we're to love them period so anyway i love y'all i love y'all two four five six and i think that's seven so anyway that's enough of that being said you guys i don't want to keep getting it going into all of that but i just love because the word says love and that's what we gonna do and i took that to heart and it is in my heart and so people that come at me outside of that honey i just have to remind them to love and try very hard and not get offended and if i get offended i take it to god and say father help me forgive them and lord take this offense because i don't want it to cause a level of bitterness in my heart as it relates to that person because father i pray you forgive them because they don't know what not ham sandwich they doing [Laughter] it doesn't matter what or who they are we are to love them i need to write that that is right heather and i'm telling you and sometimes it's a hard moment you know um the word cuts both ways because me and because anybody else i'm talking to in this chat um it cuts both ways i think forgiveness is sometimes it's the hardest thing to do and so what the lord has placed on my heart is the people that i have a hard time forgiving and people i thought i forgave honey the lord let me know that i need to go ahead and make them something precious and send it to them and so i've been doing that and i sent it with a note but there here's my prayer right jennifer that's what i said i said lord i hope they don't call me after they get it i don't want to talk to him i don't want to talk to him right now i'm not ready i'm not ready to talk i just want oh privy oh this stitch i'm doing is a puff stitch for the green i'll change it i know it's hard oh man that's hard heart song creations i know it's hard i know it is i know hey crochet every day with judy i know it's hard honey god has given us a gift to make stuff with our hands and if we're making stuff and praying over that stuff as we make it makes it a little yeah it'll sneak up on you yes it will come on unforgiveness stuff you thought you forgave honey green if you think the green was hard wait until you get to the purple oh yeah yes judy the purple's right here i started it but i started i stopped when i started reading i said because i wasn't um i wasn't mature to handle the instructions from this stitched in christ okay baby steps yeah so that's right jennifer baby steps huh but yeah i'm telling you heather girl it's hard but it's something that has to be done he said how can you love me every day and you don't love somebody that you see every day you don't even see me but you love me but this one over here you don't love i just frog my purple yeah so hey you guys that are working on these the green i switched the stitch up if you have not can't tell i did i decided to switch to stitch up because i um felt like it was just too much to try to keep going i kept frogging and frogging the frog i said lord jesus i don't have time to be frogginess forever lord so i decided to take the stitch um first i was going to do the orange stitch and i changed it because i really love the puff stitch so i've decided to do the green one in the puff stitch the one the same one we did for purity i'm doing for growing in christ okay yeah and um so the purple one we'll see if i get to the purple one grandma anna and it's not um very uh i'm having a hard time working it and getting it done i promise you i am going to switch to

way i just followed everything on youtube whatever we made this okay so um what it is is like what the difference which i learned how to make it differently like the um you join with the you do a chain three and you join and you and you keep going around right that's not how i learned how to do it i learned how when you get to that joint you um do a uh single crochet okay instead and you chain three and go the other way so you there's never a wrong side yeah i was like what and there's my other grandma so cute oh she's a happy one in that one i'll tell you yes i see where you get it from

is my cup this is my comment for granny d because granny d gave me this furl hook and i have not been able to put it down since i [Music] ooh that's pretty isn't it just i love it and she she was like trying out because i so i met her for a giveaway that i did on my page or on my channel and i um i was like i was looking at her address and i was like this address is an hour away from me so i was like i'd be happy to meet you at like a michael's or something and we can trade or i can give you your stuff and she gives me this entire bag full of yarn and i'm like no i'm supposed to give you yarn and um we go to starbucks and she's like try this hook you have to try this hook you'll love it and i try it and she's like it's yours and it's just she's the nicest person in the world but so that's my bragging about grant meeting granny d and using this hook i don't know i've seen you know people use them but like the handle it just looks like way too fat for my hand like like you know like it'd be too uncomfortable it's it's perfect because it from for me at least and i have very small hands so i was surprised at how because it looks very big but it's like you're making natural fists um so i imagine if your hands were larger it would be even more comfortable for you yeah why are your minds in the room so if you have a friend who or someone you know who has a hook like this or even investing in one just one hook that you use a lot um that it's worth it because i have not been able to put it down and i'm like my clovers are crying because i'm not touching them and i'm like so

instant pot no do you have you ever had spaghetti in it no i didn't even best made the slow cooker so i doubt he'd like the insta pot oh okay i love the instant pot although i'm always afraid it's going to blow up even though like just a pressure cooker fear i'm just afraid it's going gonna blow up i don't know yeah yeah i used to i used it twice and i didn't like how i did my oatmeal and i there's got to be a way that i can do it where it makes my oatmeal perfect and i i've tried it um in the crock pot i didn't like how my oatmeal turned out and i didn't like how my oatmeal turned out in the instant pot so i don't know i just still cook my oatmeal on the stove certain things i just think are still have you worthy overnight oh uh no i have not here's the thing about here's the thing about me here's the thing about me with oats before you go there i'm gonna tell you i don't like the um processed ones much i only eat those if it's in a granola or or if i'm using it as um some type of base or something like if i'm doing something with uh let's say i'm making a smoothie and i have i do have those oats for that but um to like let it sit and wait is it good though girl it's so good so it like puffs up and it's fluffy it's almost like pudding texture it's it's the craziest thing um i i followed a recipe i found online where i used some cocoa powder and i smushed a banana in there so that i didn't need any sweetener and it was it's just like it's light and airy and i just put it in the fridge overnight and it lasts like all week so i can eat it every day okay it's but you have to use instant oats so but they don't taste anything like my dad doesn't like instant oats but he will eat um overnight eggs okay so i might have to try those i am not beyond trying something new now i will try this because i do have those to see if it tastes pretty good so yeah i'll try it one day i promise you i will and then i'm gonna let you know girl i promise i ring okay let's see yum you could put fruit in a instead yeah i have some dates i have dates instead so i use dates instead of sugar to like especially when i'm doing like smoothies and stuff oh man yeah they're good instead of

how are you hello antoinette are you into it we'll see you all right can we show you how i joined so i all i did was stick my hook into the top of the chain three under the top two loops right and all i do is slip stitch yeah and then slip stitch into the next two stitches yeah that's yeah that's the other way i was talking about i learned how to do i yeah i like that way too but i really like this way um i don't know it's just a preference for each person right so i do like i like that way too but i like this way better for me yeah but there's so many ways you guys you can do the granny stitch so don't like your pigeon hole into one way of doing it i just like this way i don't know i like how um it lines up those lines i'm a square okay let me tell y'all let me tell y'all this okay full disclosure okay you ready so i love grids when i was in school in high school um i had art class and marky mark you might know what i'm talking about too we had to do like grid art and basically what you do you take a small picture and you draw a grid over it like you do i remember doing that we did that in school yes rolls and columns and you can make that take that small picture and do the same amount of rows of problems on your canvas as big as you want it right and you can recreate that picture by drawing each square and so ever since then i have been obsessed with grids and anything that has like a almost a perfect square look i don't know what it is i love plastic canvas that's when i got in the plastic canvas because i loved the square look i even got into cross stitch because even though you have that canvas stretched over that little doohickey thing i don't know what you call it you stretch it over there you put it on there i just know that's it and you twist it that's all i know but it's a lot of little boxes if you can see it it's a lot of little squares in there i don't know what it is i love it when i saw this version of the uh the uh of how to do the granny square i loved it and you know why because you could see these little boxes throughout you see them can you see them you see what i'm talking about that's why i loved it that's the only reason i'm special i'm a little special so see y'all got my little boogers y'all see what's wrong with me i love squares but what we did was let's say you know there were strips of grid yeah and we'd sit there and the teacher would kind of type out you know what to do and then you'd have to should say like color the top one in the middle of your grid color that square and then as you go out grow you know grow it bigger and add one more square each time on each end yeah until you make a pie and it'd make a pine tree yeah say at the end you you directly in the middle of those rulers you'd have to line up the the exact middle of your pine tree and then eat those two directly in the middle and and color those two and to make a stem yeah and yeah that's nice and so with the the same thing with the grid now we use charcoal uh no i don't do graphics you know what i would probably be addicted to those two because of the square sensation i don't know what it is y'all about them dagger on squares i just ever since then i was like you can recreate anything you can make it bigger and i was just mesmerized by that for some reason um i have been using my denmark's uh mystery bag yarn which was just different uh demerol's uh studio do in different colors i like denim rose demiro demo more am i saying right lord y'all pray for me i'll just jack that butchered that name okay yes do musical graphics no no i probably should um because my brain loves squares it loves grid art um if let's see squares are great as long as you think outside them that's right i think outside the squares that's it but the thing is when i did grid art like that i did it with um you guys it was um uh it was charcoal art so the the pens pencils they were charcoal um so um each one was a different color gray um it was a different uh shade of charcoal okay so it was like all the way to black right and so every so i wrote i did the grid with pencil and then when i needed to i'd go and erase the grid but the the picture still came out and you wouldn't even be able to tell there were grid lines in it when it was all said and done i got something to show y'all my mom got from her boss mm-hmm oh nice she got a bunch of buttons from um her husband's uh i think cousin passed away but wait i'm not done i'm so sorry wow okay so yeah yeah so um i probably should kristoff i probably should do graphic ends because there were a whole bunch of numbers i like squares and that's probably why when i do the c to c oh my gosh i need to try c to c and i got to try graph against okay all right all right say uh isn't that a cool bottle that is a cute cute bottle i like that bottle man that's nice yeah mm-hmm i made a decaf okay i was at michael's today they are moving and i got a lot of yarn for 70 off oh my goodness i

here this is the one I got I got the Mendocino perps right here this is just a this is one of the phenotypes I got to the mendo purps I got some other ones over there I'm gonna get into in a minute it's a good one I like this one it's nice and bushy and it's not too it's not really he is one of the taller ones smells real good none of them I none of them got any purple Leafs or net no I mean they got some of them like a more than all of my majority of them got all of them pretty much got purple stems like a few purple stems here in there but ain't none of them got the the dark leaves or Nothing hear me but it's gonna come later in the year you're already know they all are I'm really looking forward to this blue dream purple though there's going to be some fire right there I like those I'm right here I got a couple grand daddy purp clones these aren't even my knees and my friends she just brought me yesterday later tells the good ones that they're gonna be good there I made sure she made sure their females of their female naked so my garden they're just going to join it hello granddaddy purp clones not too sure who she got him from do did it weird though he put some peril at underneath the sand he put sand on top of it I don't know they smell good doesn't it look healthy so much nobody's doing got the miracle gro feeding him this season I'm feeding him to get miracle-gro azalea familiar right our dendron plant food 30-10 10 plant food I give it to him I give I give them I give each plan 5 gallon bucket full about two times a week if I can remember I'm going to do that the whole veg and then got some special for when you start flowering close this one up real quick take you guys at the other ones real quick come on lil [ __ ] Frank right there like and [ __ ] down I Frank smile on [ __ ] got this mental prep right here this is the other female I was telling you about this one's just these holes I put him in right here I had to put him in some smaller holes he try to keep him smaller because of the Kate the limited space i got because last year we had some [ __ ] getting nosy but I had to really tuck them back here but yeah I dug the hole are you mean they're still getting bigger than out then I then I thought they were which is good because I need a big I needs mark get better I mean everybody knows that but that's how I everybody is but then we can't get too greedy you don't want to get you [ __ ] you mean ethnic is looking at it can get too greedy but this Demento / phenotype right here the other 1i got this is a good one I think haven't really decided which one I like better but it depends on the buddy you know it's a good one knowledge they're pretty good this is a this is one out here is a think this is another Mendel / kind of like one of the one in the cage over there just over there just not as bushy definitely does make tops but still good though we got this grand at you right here looking for pushy oh man like if this grand daddy is going to be some big grand daddy right here I can't wait to see which is better though mendo perfect to grant any part blue dream perp is going to be in the zone without i call it the running across it would that forgot that was the blue dream one's gonna be in class of its own but do I really want to compare the two perps I got one back here the granddaddy Linda that right there is other men doper I think it yeah I think I only got one of them blue dream in upper back there cut the window / baby planted a little late but they're doing [ __ ] Frank dog [ __ ] them up but I coming back though they're gonna sit right that one this one's doing a little bit better he get this one's didn't get it as bad that one right there i got this when i hear this is the middle part two different another phenotype that I got I got a few different ones I got two of the same ones I got three altogether to the same ones and the two other ones and this one's another one and this one is just this one might end up really be my favorite it's not going to be as big of as a yield as the other ones work but man it just looks so much healthier you can tell still Amendola purpose all the same strain but man it's the way this one came in is just good and you see you see is just healthy this is those ones see I got this garden slow mini garden just let many gardeners a mini garden over there that's what we doing for 2013 they've all been out here will this last these those two babies barely been out here for about two and a half weeks maybe three weeks not even not even really don't like two weeks they've been in the ground for like two solid weeks like i said though they got [ __ ] up attacked by the dog so you feel me they're coming back though they're good that one and all the rest of the ones they're all about two and a half three months old they got putting the ground literally just because I was anxious except that one right there though that bushy one that smaller one that men dope hurt that one was the 1i did in a pot that's why it's so healthy looking like that and everything I kept on wanting to pot for a while some different soil and stuff and then put it in the ground about the exact same day I put them babies in the ground so about two weeks ago but still look at it from here good hopefully all this year you don't feel good jun 22nd saturday 2013 my first video see you guys later", "7CAul05DZSY": "what up YouTube king's head coach here and it's been a while since i updated and today I'm going to show you what I'm currently working on once in week 5 and get it on reef are flowering so right here in the front this is the white widow let me zoom in to show you how it's looking so this is my week 5 on the white widow it's actually yelling out a lot and I will say all these plants have gone through a lot of stress haven't really been able to take care of them as much I'm busy masum bills take care of but fortunately they really know how to water a plant so yeah still white widow week 5 kind of hard as a sweet skunky smell to it then the buds are kind of going one more down looks like might have a little bit more bud than last time and in the back over there's the Afghani would just kind of hard to get there let me get there there it is the staff gani thought so yelling up a lot this one glass this one has a more of a like a would smell to it except the leaves are kind of turning purple a little bit little bit less but um there you go but it's frosty and sticky so these two are in week 5 a flowering right now so let me share the other ones okay listen right here this is a team oh for sure you can tell by I was spacing on it that week for a flowering this is the Bella haze it's really frosting you know something tells me this is going to be one of maybe a little bit of but everywhere it's stretched out a lot so this public string i will probably not want to go to the tent or maybe let it with alleged veg time because truly huge he actually does have a like a mango smoke to it like this fresh like this fresh smell to it look if you walked into the ocean to see with this fresh breeze that's on smelling it right now this one actually went through a little bit of I got burnt so the light was too close and he it's not really a heavy drink of water that doesn't drink a lot but it's really big and huge so we'll see how many weeks it takes for this one I'm thinking about 12 weeks one of a 14 weeks over there in the back I believe this is our purple from a perilous I'm not yeah there's our purple Paris in the back supposed to be a sativa i also got like heat damage with it you see how the climb sock so big and tall also we get for a flowering frosting sticking just smells funky on them now Carrie see Tom Canty tell no smell no it's just really Skokie it's really hairy too I'm not supposed to turn purple so we'll see if that's true and over here we have our blueberry blue every og it's a little bit more skinnier in the buds the flower also wait for how's it go piney smell to it so and this one here I keep forgetting what this one is you look playa this urn from chronic lights which is more the lights and chronic helica pine smell to it too we for also so cool so there's think of my week for week 5 of flowering sorry currently he was looking right now just these two are given up pretty early my mind of all that stress that has been happening to it and on i was getting busy so it's been hard so let's check out the bedding plants ok guys so here it is here on my clothes that i took from the kinky to crush last time they're kind of died down here now you see all the leaves on the bottom i have no room to put it the anymore so i'm just waiting for the flowers so let's finish I could move some stuff this is my granddaddy actually no stress trained it a little bit and then I'm sorry grow up we're just kind of experimenting on that so let's kind of short bushy and I just said hey you know I'm sure to bend it down maybe I should keep it tight down or something and I've some my Twitter clone right there this is my cat VLAN I believe now officially my girl scout cookies hasn't been talked like Amy's water and that one is my Candy Land actually let me get in there Candyland this is the top once also looks like these water right now and this was my one hundred percent indica the double Glock actually super cropped it I bet all the branches down kind of broke them off those getting too big so now the problem is that it's getting too big to the sides yeah and over here my king see the kush spot like the biggest one has to prop this on so many times I kept bending down and breaking the branches and still keeps going up a little luck right there hard to tell but yeah probably i'll do it again looks like the all these need water so this is my bedding plants so stay tuned for more peace", "kfevnFywKjU": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 and today we're gonna check out this purple Afghani by Dorado platinum extracts now that's nerado platinum extracts if you know Spanish anyway so let's get right into it the THC a comes in an eighty point zero zero percent THC comes in at nine point six percent with the total coming in at seventy nine point seven six percent that's basically all of it if you guys don't understand why I got or why there's three different numbers for THC there is gonna be a video linked at the bottom of this towards the end the kind of explains then goes over that if you're interested in any way shape or form you should definitely check that out never hurts to know more about your products that you're trying aid that that's kind of my theory behind that now these guys don't have score marks which is kind of annoying now I have to like figure out how open this thing I'm not a huge deal obviously I could to just had scissors and done this before but as you guys know I point out the little details I love score marks just because it makes it to where I don't have to go do something extra to open my package with that just use my teeth go ahead and pop this guy open so I do like this packaging it's nice and simple I love the fact that they don't have a bunch of extra packaging that they don't need for just this tiny little thing right here and with that let's hop right into our here actually oh let's just do that so this is what this looks like this is a blonde crumble as they set on their packaging now this stuff looks really really good it's not yeah it's a nice hard crumble like almost like a wax type thing so this has a pie ninis a little bit of flour eNOS not not too much more pine than anything else yeah definitely and a little bit of earthiness so this I smell pining and Mercer and for sure those are the two terpenes that give that flavor to cannabis so with that I'm really excited to try this and see how it turns out I'll be back with you guys in a couple of days to let you know how this what as what's up so I went ahead and tried that purple Afghani and we were just surprised that it hit us so hard this is a budget-friendly concentrate so whenever we purchase those we're not expecting to be just floored this one as far as the flavor goes not a whole lot there nothing bad but also nothing unique and nothing distinctive so just a good clean concentrate taste if you guys don't know what that is it's just a really light faint floral kind of kind of taste that you barely get a little bit of and then the high that 100% is gonna be the reason why we pick this up again probably soon is it just its stony it's really really stony from the second you take your first stab you start to get really relaxed you get that like you it's mostly like I don't want to say it's a head relaxation it's a full-body thing but you really just get tired I guess is what I want to say and so if you're looking for something for me like I said I always smoke at night so if you're looking for something like that to kind of like end your day with and hold you off through the night then this is an awesome choice and again it's budget-friendly so always worth giving it a shot and with that I think that's all that I'm gonna say about that there's not too much else to say if you guys do end up trying it let me know but one thing that I will talk about is I do have a it's an EDM show so like a rave in Spokane on 4/20 at the pin I'll link down to the event page in the comment section so if you guys are in Spokane at all or in the area or interested in any way shape or form go ahead and check out that go ahead and check out the event page and then if you have no interest in EDM but you love what I'm doing go ahead and hit that sub button and with that I'll be back again with you guys soon",

going to give them anything just you know clean cleanse water pure water for the next couple of months but they're not next couple months what am I saying that next couple weeks and once they get once they start to get real deep into flowering because I'm barely seeing signs they're going to start flowering pretty soon so when I do that I got a little something for I'm going to give them some bat guano dig into the soil and put it all around and start watering like that and then I'm going to give it some not too sure yet on what else I'm going to give it something to some type of bloom yeah I mean something for some to blooming I'm not sure yet though i don't know i don't really think i'm going to use any miracle gro products for the for the for the for the flowering i thought i was but i don't think i am i think i'm going to go a little bit better more expensive you mean get some good buds why not that's what we're doing this for a little granddaddy clones looking good definitely you

"5no8kuzz0I8": "all right you guys so here we go this is where we'll be taking some of the mothers the mothers are afghani bubba kush granddaddy and a cbd strain of course from one of the best companies in the world and that is scentsy seeds one of the original originals and it's a cbd strain it's right here what's this one we just took a bunch of cuttings off of it so i'm really excited but these will be the new we're going to make and you'll see this will be the room that we're going to be making a lot of the seeds the feminized seeds the autofeminis and we'll be making feminize out of these very shortly um very interesting when i came here they've been using these led lights as you can see they are not too bad there was a little uh lack of water here and so some of the plants are crowning and stressing just a tiny bit of combat other than that they look really good really healthy and really excited so this is where again uh the cuttings that you've been seeing that i've been working with and taking these are the plants that they've been working with uh very healthy they've been using a basic general hydroponics food feed and everything else but really nice and and really strong so looking forward okay take care guys you", "951nBmp2ELI": "welcome to another video with token 10 for Tony this is a medical marijuana review damn forgot up today we're doing move sauce they call it gold but a sauce with THC a crystals and terpenes I tried to remove the sticker bit like most other I got the purple Linda with cherry Afghan so purple Linda's a high perk that an indica and cherry Afghans a hybrid 74% of THC and there's a little bit left there we go that looks grainy but apart if it uploads the right thumbnail put a light behind it nothing lighter work and you could really see the THC crystals the resume to do that's what the chunky things are it's supposed to inhibit you from getting hungry which would be nice and a pure indica because that way you're not halfway asleep and then starving happen to go eat sorry still soon um today we're gonna be taking a DAB with her it's an imitation her brother was only 10 bucks um but it works pretty good I like it's my favorite one so I used most to dab out of it's got the double donuts to cool it off and it's real thin cloth now if you can see that or not on there it's pretty thin glass so it cools off pretty quick so you never have to worry about burning your lungs or your throat I did that when I first got this guy here I don't know if it's because I didn't um season the bowl first or if I took a hot dab but I couldn't talk for about a week even trying to scream understand that like I was whispering so that ain't no fun so like I said this one cools off real quick you can tank out the stuff but I find because the sides are heated it ends up melting anything on the sides it touches and I think you waste product so what I do is take a little dab and put it on this I can't look in the camera and then put it inside and do that but if you can see I usually heat from here to the tip then I heat the top first and then the bottom and pretty much by the time you do that it's cooled off and ready to go I heat the bottom laughs up him touch the dab to the top of the glass that way anything that runs down hits the hot part on the bottom and that's a good thing I learned about this it collects you can see there the reclaim and will end up just going down and cleaned it out boy didn't use alcohol and cleaner good it'll just collect down here in the bottom I saved some to season bowls with now I got bored the other day and try some this doesn't have a burnt taste to it or anything I guess because it's just getting away from the flame and running away so I guess it's excess product or something but the reclaim is pretty good in there let's get us a little dab of this stuff this stuff by the way the only thing you taste in there is cherries you taste the cherry out there um if you're new to my channel like I said I don't have a dab Matt I use the gatorade lid and just took a meal heated it up with a blowtorch and milled the spot so it just keeps your dab up off of the table just like that mm-hmm let's see if we can get to some camera frame let's heat it doesn't like so it just takes a few seconds this one was real quick back and forth on the table get a little warm and stuff on the bottom again just like at least I got Raymond the camper there just like I'm a little cherry berry stuff that's good and this stuff I know some of you're gonna go oh it's expensive this 85 a gram and yet when you compare it to the $60 chatter it's expensive but if you're comparing it to the gram of the true stick which is $94 it's a little cheaper the packs air pods they're about 50 $60 for a half gram this is still cheaper but I understand it is $85 is this expensive but it's tasty it's a lot smoother than the shatter I like it in the crumble I just don't like the price but soon we're getting more and more dispensaries the last five that just got their license last year should have some product out here the first of the year I imagine or a dispensary open I thought I seen one that said they was doing delivery now I'm not sure vitae cams growing I think they got four or five stores now so move will grow a little bit more get some more stores in and key reliefs up to 17 true leaves got 22 so as more and more get there's more more competition I imagine prices will start hopefully going down next year some let's eat this up again right there on the top and this is a hybrid but he smoked too much of it that purple wind that comes out it's pretty much an indica after that but just be careful but like I said it is tasty tastes like cherries you don't taste any weed enos to it or nothing like the babe cards still makes you cough though hmm laughs you haven't tried it Christmas is around the corner don't forget treat yourself try something new that's half the fun on this anyways let's try a new crab even though it's only 74% that's one of the more stronger ones I said sometimes you can't rely on THC on that stuff so I hope you guys are all tokin something out there too like I say if you guys haven't had a chance to try some crumble or some gold sauce or blue crumble treat yourself for Christmas you deserve it we'll be doing some more videos this week some shadow runs I believe I'm going to dispensary tomorrow it's monday delivery day so see what they'll you didn't knew wooo eyes are watering little bit on that one a little bit of dab sweats going even alright so if you haven't subscribed go ahead and subscribe hit that thumbs up button let's know you liked the video leave a comment down below tell us what you're smoking on or token on rather hope everybody's having a good night until the next video", "Kz59o5lkOVs": "reading everybody can a medication here hope you guys are doing well I just wanted to show you i'm starting three new strength and i'll show you how I do it so basically i use a little plastic container take paper towel about four sheet three or four sheet you fold it and then you put water on it and fold it and its really soaked with water you don't worry and you put the water like lukewarm not too warm not too cold just loop one and I put them a day ago and here what we have right now that thing can't focus properly on there's but so here we have the first one is so the first one is the deep purple cush the second one is the Afghani and the third one which is right under here is the zhang jie zhang jie those three strengths are pretty good zhang is supposed to be very very good and I can't focus enough to show you but one of them has already started to thing more focused broken anyway start to crack as you can see start to crack a little bit anyway basically that's how you do it and then you close your paper on top put the lid on top of that thing and sit that into a warm place so usually when I do I put it on hot water tank or something like that so if you put it on the hot water tank it will be just warm enough Thunder to warm up the paper towel and water keep it just a tiny bit warm and that should be usually it takes couple of day three four days sundstrand takes longer depends on the seed depends on the quality of the seed of course the seed works frozen before so at least put your seed like in the freezer for a couple days before because it has to be like exactly it replicate exactly the nature which is in fall the plant drop it seen it freeze stay frozen all winter and in the spring with humidity and water and the Sun hitting the ground it warmed up and then they hatch they answer whatever how is prom or something like that but anyway that's basically what you have to do all right so that's basically what it is for the seeds now in a broom we'll take a look in the room to see what's going on there in about a week now their pin transplant and they are doing pretty good as you can see you'll start to come back up and we're very damaged or week or whatever but as you can see the leaves are starting to pick up back again nice leaves not burn oh nothing so what I use they use advanced nutrients the three parts it's hall in cocos and look at this here huh it's amazing how to show you guys that I had some seed actually an interval for a title a strop and I recycle my focus oh look look what happened here yep a little seed that actually had to need cocoa and is now growing slowly with the other one so what I'm going to do I'm going to rule that then put it on a little container it's actually heater they hate 18 @ band or the sky walker or across a boat so all no one has been flowers but usually when plan when seeds are from irmo food I plan they are always female so actually this one here is from that you this one was from actually from a batch of mobile ash after I was done with the bubble hash i set the wet stuff there in the bucket and suddenly basically he popped up a couple seeds out of it so it was amazing that's why I kept it because it's a miracle see what kind of look pretty nice already I could tell going to be a widely so it's more actually an indica and sativa the leaves are very wide study believes has been the sea of being blown but yeah the room is doing pretty good and that's under for a 3011 right now and I have 12 plants in here I'm going to cook couple more clones before more or i might just only grow in this batch i might just want to grow 12 but put three plant under each light so i have 4000 watt here so when they are bigger a bit i'll switch them to three plant under each light so i'll have enough space to move them around and actually make some little bush with them and i'm sure i will our this as much as if i had a the same amount 16 because the size of plants also matter so as you can see here it's getting very nice the leads are kicking back obviously light deficiency fertilizer the first NC seems to be going away they were very neglected for months and little compares in the room with only fluorescent key 5 light so they were very bad but anyway now it's time to do another prop so because I need my medication so and I'm going to have to trim them as you can see there's couple yellow leaves that needs to be term again and I'll top them also so they branch more on the bottom less height but I want them to come to high in here I have those tomato cage that goes with them let's put that air-conditioning home because I just known as an amateur pretty high in here so I just kick around listening on the fan is working full max over there and I unconnect the filter for now and despite that you see actually recycle the air for the winter but in the summer of the warm that air in the building so I just unconnected and exhaust completely outside without any filter actually until they start to flower and when they start to flower then I put the filter on because I don't want to have no smell around the building or nothing so but yeah and I have the fans going on around I got to install the next one in that corner I'm going to have four I might put six actually because I got six and it was fan out from home depot twenty-five dollars each and go wrong I've been using those fans for 33 years now some of them are been spinning for two years without oh maybe stopping couple months and they still going I actually had that's why I bought this one to replace because I had a black one that was very high quality expensive almost hundred bucks and it didn't so I start to think that the price is not always equality so those things are breathing it is first a lot of erotism it's really going to hit there's a nice flow of air and it's very comfortable for me so if it's comes over comfortable for me to be here it's comfortable for the plants basically that's what's going on that's the first week after transplant they are kicking back up i watered them couple days ago I'm going to check back tonight but I think they are good for another two days without water and hope there's another one there you go put there just what I saw another one going in there so I'll go around and make sure that there is any glowing that I actually save them put them into another container actually it's always good to have some strength of difference man best friend was really good like the hate 18 @ ban ho what a good medication it is the 818 and the Skywalker was really good medicine I actually used them both together at the same time and my god I was medicated perfectly like didn't have no pain then had no stress no anxiety or nothing and now i am on my whole stuff because i ran out of it my old stuff right now which is my first or second crop since I've been licensed for years and it's the Afghan push but not as good as the Walker now DS 1 R 2 train wreck that's a new strength I started I never actually used train wreck so but I heard good thing about it I'm giving it a try and now i got the tree strength i showed you before that's going to come to jean eating Afghani and the deep purple cush are going to be the next crop so I'm going to do like maybe four of each so I'll have four different strengths the next time I'll have for plant of each should we find I like to have different strengths because different strengths the different kind of thing for your medication alright so I'm going to clean the water bucket right now and fill the water watering couple days but I always sit my water for three four or five days sometimes a week before and I have oxygen in the air going in the air pump heating hair into the water so we call with oxygen and it gives time to do a heavy metal to be evaporated and Chloe and all this because i don't have the water systems you will treat the water so reverse osmosis I don't have any system of that some items normal tap water which is pretty good and every time I every time basically i set my fertilizers it gets it gets pretty good on his own because the ph it's a ph perfect that i use from advanced nutrients I'm probably going to change fertilizer after this prob because advanced such areas is getting expensive really expensive and i think would give it a try maybe two remos nutrients because we Mo's I see his plants in following his channel and these plants are huge so the urban grower and he use a basically garbage can 30 litre I think it is from brute and you basically go plan that reach like 7th 18 time little Bush big buds and this fertilizer seems to be a really nice so I want to give a try and it's cheaper than actually advance assurance so let's see what's going to happen I'm still not sure exactly which one still looking at it all right people if you liked the video please subscribe share with your friends keep on watching because I'm going to produce a lot more videos for this grub and i will show you guys as i go how big they're going to come as you can see you had a lot of space in here well when they earn about second or third week of flowering there will be no place to walk around here i will have to crawl on my feet under to water them basically i bring demo almost close to the light and they are pretty big so i give them like 3-4 weeks of the veggies vegetations time before I switch the life and the success at the end you see the result at the end if you keep them longer it well worked I rather grow less plan for them bigger than doing a lot of plants because it's more work to maintain a lot of plants and yeah it's a lot of work so these are less work and you could take care of them better actually if you have less it will be a little sick so all right people see you next time keep on watching share with people and please subscribe it helps me any little help I could get to Google my medicine garden I appreciate you know everything is very expensive this room is close to ten thousand dollars all together already since I started so it's a lot of money but it would cost me about four or five times to get my medicine for a full year it will cost me at least three times more what I paid to initially set up that room and now it's just a maintenance to do to it washing between change the light bulb between three crop and basically the rest is just okay the fan last forevers and things like that so you need to replace them that bad alright people keep on watching and have a great day take care of yourself people medicating", "jrNE2a5CpHQ": "what's up YouTube eat your boy I'm back if you like this make sure you hit the thumbs up

much for joining me today in this video i'm going to show you how to make my sugar plum fairy blanket if at any point in this video you do like what you see please push that thumbs up button and if you haven't yet subscribe to my channel and click the bell that way you don't miss any of my videos i try to release a brand new video every single friday covering a wide range of different types of crochet projects and you're not going to want to miss out at the very end of the video so you're going to want to stick around i actually listed out all of the possible different types of blanket measurements that you could possibly make this blanket in and i will include an approximate foundation row chain count along with approximately how many rows you will need to make and here's the kicker i'm also going to include approximately how many skeins of yarn or how many yards of yarn you will need to make that blanket i figured that out for you for this blanket and i'm really excited so if you are curious at all about any of that information you're going to want to stick around to the very end of the video where i have made a chart that i'm going to stick on the end and if you want you can pause the video and find the blanket size you want to make gather up all of your information all of your materials and be ready to go alright i will also include a link in the notes section exactly how to follow the pattern for this blanket if you choose to make this blanket in the future as well as i will include a link so you can print out the chart and have it forever if you want so let's go ahead and dive right into what materials you're going to need to make this sugar plum fairy blanket the materials that you're going to need to make the sugar plump fairy blanket will include a size 5 weight bulky or chunky yarn in the case of this particular blanket i used i love this chunky yarn in the color heathered french lilac and that gave me that beautiful purple color that i made this blanket in but really you can use whatever color that you like as long as it is the size five bulky chunky weight yarn okay you're going to need a crochet hook size p or eleven and a half millimeter crochet hook and a pair of scissors that's all you're going to need to make this blanket if you're curious how many yards of yarn you'll need meters of yarn ounces of yarn you'll need to complete your project stay tuned to the very end of the video where i have made a chart that includes all the many different blanket sizes how many yards of yarn you will need to complete that project how many meters and how many ounces of yarn you will need i also will include how many chains are in the foundation row approximately and approximately how many rows you will need to make to make your desired blanket size it's so great okay so once you've gathered all of your materials let's go ahead and start making this amazing sugar plum fairy blanket we begin with our yarn and our crochet hook starting our project with a long enough tail to weave in the end at the end of the project so i give myself about three four inches and then i create my slip knot attach my crochet hook and we are ready to go okay this pattern is worked in a multiple of two so i'm going to just be making a small example swatch for you that way i'm not making an entire blanket and getting through everything i'm going much faster so i can show you what to do quicker in my example swatch i'm going to chain 20 chains okay so here we go one two three four 19 and 20. great okay so once you've reached the last chain for your desired blanket here's what you're going to do you're going to half double crochet in the third chain from your crochet hook so looking at our chains remember the loop on our crochet hook does not count as a chain so one two three going to half double crochet in that third chain perfect and then you're going to make one half double crochet in each chain all the way across to the very end and that is your row one you should end row one with two less stitches than were in your foundation row so for me i change 20 but in my row one i should only have 18 half double crochets i used those other two chains as my turning chain to get me on to row one okay so go ahead and continue putting one half double crochet in each chain all the way across row one and i will meet you at the end of row one to show you what to do next 17 and eighteen great okay once you have made your very last stitch for your row one we're going to chain two one two turn our work and now we are all set up to do row two the chain two does not count as a stitch okay we are not counting the chain two as a stitch in the first stitch space right here we're making one half double crochet so i'll actually take my pinky and kind of pull back the chain two making room for everything there we go half double crochet in that very first stitch and now we're set up for our pattern the pattern we are using for this particular blanket is a half double crochet cross stitch here is how it's done we're going to skip this next stitch in the second stitch or third so one two three so skip one next one make a half double crochet perfect all right now you're going to half double crochet in that skipped stitch so yarn over insert your crochet hook into that skipped stitch yarn over pull through and really extend it like pull that yarn up and then yarn over and pull through all three loops let it stay loose try not to make your stitches too tight here we want our stitches loose so the blanket is much more comfortable and that is your first half double crochet cross stitch let's do that again skip the next stitch half double crochet in the following stitch okay and then half double crochet in that skipped stitch so yarn over insert our crochet hook into that skipped stitch yarn over pull through and then i'll actually keep pulling a little bit allowing some slack there allowing it to be a little more loose yarn over and pull through all three loops that is what the stitch will look like okay now the only thing that might get you is the stitch that we started with might look like a regular stitch but what you don't see because we made this half double crochet stitch over the first is this stitch right here already has that first half double crochet stitch in it so be mindful of where your stitches are that way you don't accidentally use a stitch two times okay all right so we're going to continue this half double crochet cross stitch pattern all the way down row two and i will meet you at the end of row two to show you how we move on okay last three stitches here okay so skip one next one half double crochet half double crochet in the skipped stitch you should be left with just one stitch left over remaining you're going to half double crochet in that last stitch and that's it you've just closed off row two row two is done okay to move on to row three you're going to chain two and this is the repeat pattern for every single row here on out to finish your project after every single row you will chain two one two you will turn your work every single row you will put one half double crochet in the very first stitch great and then continue on doing the half double crochet cross stitch pattern for every single row it's just repeat repeat repeat pretty easy so yarn over i'm gonna skip one next one half double crochet and then half double crochet in the skipped stitch skip one next one half double crochet and half double crochet in the skipped stitch now again the longer you make this blanket you're gonna have to be mindful to pay attention to your stitches and not use a stitch two times this is something that happened to me a couple times and so when you reach the very end of your blanket if you're left with two stitches you know that you accidentally skip this or added too many stitches here in the rest of the work because when you get to the very end of your work you should be left with only one stitch remaining and that one stitch is where you put your last half double crochet before you chain two to turn okay so it's a good way to gauge your work this is one of those blanket projects that after you get the rhythm you really don't need to count every single row which is amazing making this blanket one of those really nice relaxing blankets that you can just go but i do highly suggest that every couple of rows you give it a count and the count you are looking for is going to be the same number of stitches that were in row one so for example my row one had 18 stitches so my row two my row three my row four should all have 18 stitches okay and that just counting every few rows will help you to eliminate getting through the blanket and halfway through you're noticing that your blanket is starting to angle or be off and it helps you to eliminate which rows were on target and where you can see you got off target okay it really helps so last stitch one half double crochet row three is done and that's it now how do you end the row last row of the blanket is your choice you can choose to just continue this half double crochet cross stitch pattern all the way up to the last row and then tie off your yarn and be finished or you can choose to have your very last row be a row of half double crochets just one half double crochet stitch in each stitch if you want but honestly you really can't see that this is just a row of half double crochets pronounced enough to try to create symmetry so i'm going to let that be up to you on what you want to do for row or for your very last row okay i do however want to show you if you're working this blanket and you run out of yarn what you can do yep i am going to be showing you how to do the invisible knot trick if you have already done the invisible knot you already know how to do the invisible knot you can skip this little section but it's really fast okay so let's say i'm going to cut my yarn off right here there we go okay let's say you're crocheting crochet crochet crocheting and you're getting to the end of your skein you're running out of yarn and you need to attach more yarn to keep going with your project here's what you're going to do take the yarn that you're running out of that's attached to your project and stretch it out that direction take your brand new skein of yarn that you want to add to your project have that yarn go in that direction but them up against each other take this side two fingers wrap them around your two fingers take the little tail here wrap it over between your two fingers and have it come out facing towards your fingernails pull and it'll create a little knot on this side let's make our way over to the other section two fingers wrap around your two fingers little tail take the tail over between your fingers and have it poke out towards your fingernails take that side pull so it forms a little knot there you got a knot here you got a knot here take this yarn this yarn pull and this forms the very strong invisible knot that isn't going anywhere it's super strong take your scissors you can actually cut these tails really close to the knot and it doesn't go anywhere i've tried this i've used this multiple times and that knot is good okay there we go and then you continue your project without skipping a beat so let me get through this section get to that join because you're using the same color yarn here let me get there perfect okay stopping turning my work over there's the join there's a little knot but it's camouflaged you can't find it you can't see it because the yarn is the exact same color it's also this really nice bulky yarn so now you can continue on with your work without having any ends to weave in yes and without having anything to address at the end of the project except for your beginning tail and your end tail that's it isn't that a beautiful thing all right so now you are off and continuing making your blanket stay tuned right after this for the chart so you can decide which blanket you want to make and how much yarn you're going to need for it and how many foundation row chains approximately that you're going to need and approximately how many rows you're going to need to complete your blanket it is honestly the softest blanket ever it's a amazing makes for a

right so I got this one here called Afghan Kush by pure Sun farms and it's coming in at eighteen point seven percent THC or if you want to save milligrams at one hundred and eighty seven milligrams I got this like a couple weeks ago I've just man I'm still going through my OS 220 there it's like endless the 28th thing anyways when was this packaged Oh 8 19 August 19th so maybe a little dry I don't know well I assume so actually because because I know these guys they like to have their stuff all dry day what it seems but anyways let's just take a look here first I'm gonna first I'm gonna check this though we got a make sure 100 point zero because that's how you do it let's say you gotta make sure it's accurate right so here we go 100 point 0 gram weight look at that that's accurate that's what that little triangle means so we're gonna take that off put this on and hit the tare so if we set this to 0 so this container counts as nothing right now thinks there's nothing Casey didn't ever know what that means that's what that means ok so as usual it's in these shitty bags I hate but I hate all the things that they that this stuff comes in so this is no preference really I hate all of the methods they use [Music] he's got these weird slidewalks they're gonna slide it there we go okay so I'll trade this kind once before the last time I tried it was alright well there's some nice big buds in there it's kind of hard to see it's so dark in this bag there you can see a little bit a little bit see a little bit okay let's pour it on here here we go is the big test pure Sun firms here we go oh shit a little pee oh my god there's stuff flying all over the place that and this maybe they did it they did it normally I wouldn't like to have stuff go flying out of the the screen like that but they can't really help but plus it ended up being a being the right weight anyway so you know whatever can't complain there but I can't complain about these fucking stems though look at this shit look at this fucking thing they could have easily broken those off instead they decided to send their garbage to me so these are the biggest buds I've ever gotten from pure Sun farms I can't believe that these three and this is the 3.5 but it is we just check that right so let's have a close look at the here alright so I actually looked at all the trichomes on these and already opened up but it turns out I forgot to press record on the camera fired so I didn't get any of the trichome video so let's redo that whole part right now I will check out the outside and when I checked it last time actually having the outside was okay but the inside was really nice and look right there what are those big blobs that trichomes they look a little bigger than normal but they're nice and kind of maybe they combine and meet super ones they very amber sort of a look to it here see the outsides this is the outside again here they look okay but I mean stuff got knocked off in the bag and you know they look a little old some of the some of them they're they have a sort of a little old look a bit but not not nearly as bad as the the glow buds look where do they all go they're all missing where'd they go [Laughter] anyways yeah I'm not super impressed by the outside well I'm also not unimpressed I'm kind of in the middle it looks like right here is a nice patch look at this this is the outside on this one so this one's nice I didn't see this part earlier that's kind of nice to get a little bit of a sort of an amber nest it it's C it's like Tianjin some of them not as much that it's just cloudy but break down here some more cloudy ones yeah it's sort of a mix of cloudy and amber anyways any questions I'm open to take a look at sine is so dry but since I missed all that let's just break over another one here that my guess why not this one oh my goodness [Music] it's just dust everywhere okay well let's check it out oh now that looks nice doesn't it it's a lot in there there's a bunch more yeah there's quite a bit inside it's just the microscope there we go Howie I see that looks okay nothing super crazy but it looks decent look down there you can see they're all sort of an amber color to them maybe I can super zoom on that let me see if I can get super zoom on that yeah I got a bit of a super zoom on some of these guys let's see it's a mix of cloudy and amber colored that's nice and anyway so look at this mess we go try the soup alright so I just got back inside from testing this and the stuffs not very impressive you know the first time I had it it was okay and this time it's just kind of you know yeah it's not so good but you know it's not the worst but it's definitely I think the thing that really kills it is the yeah how old it is it's four months old or so I don't know it's just so dry it's like really dry and I don't know I think that really needs to be at best before date on these or something because this does not it feels like it should have been better than this but I don't know I I guess I would buy it again but only if there was no other options you know cuz there's other good ones out there like good supply yeah has jean-guy and royal highness and they're usually better than this and they're slightly cheaper than this too so it's hard to hard to go with this when there's that and they're readily available you know but anyways it's not the worst subscribe if you want see more videos I got more stuff to open here soon already so yeah anyways we'll see you later have a going happy new years and all that see ya [Music] you", "ZO-X_6S2NhU": "[Music] [Music] so [Music] do [Music] done [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "XzSLQLRZ_g4": "hi I'm Maggie from Maggie's crochet comm and this pattern number is PT 0 to 8 and this is called purple mountains majesty ripple Afghan I love that name I don't remember naming that but somebody might have named it here at the Maggie's crochet office so anyway this is a basic easy scale ripple Afghan and I love in ripples to see this color combination of three shades of one color so you could use Purple's blues pink and then the one white to separate it and I like that it has the the main colors the three shades at the beginning and at the end of your Afghan so you can make this as long as you wanted to and this size here in the pattern is 48 inches wide by 7d No yeah 48 inches wide by 54 inches tall it seemed like it was taller than that and the worsted weight yarn I think there's two types of worsted weight yarn one is a lighter drapey weight yarn but this is the heavier worsted weight yarn and the suggested hook is a size I or whatever size you want to use to try to get your gauge and these are worked in the back loops of the stitches so we have a youtube channel and that's maggie well done and if you look around there i've got a video on how to work in the back loop and the front loop then both loops some basic crochet skills so once again this is pattern number PT 0 to 8 and it's available at Maggie's crochet comm thank you for watching you", "UlqPx9S9NJc": "everybody you know the [ __ ] is going on we all here this matchbox well you know what the [ __ ] I'm doing I'm sitting here taking this flour breaking it down and make it into wax let me show you guys what I'm about to be dabbing on here you go guys just you guys could get a little look at what I'm messing with right here as you can see this is the wax that I created shatter if you want to call it as you can see very nice clarity nice color amazing flavor it smells just like flour some terpenes in some flowers come off a lot stronger than the others some don't so right now what I'm about to explain is the whole point of extraction so the reason why I extract it because one buying it is very expensive you know you're gonna be paying a person 70 80 bucks for a gram of extracts where you can get a quarter ounce of weed for less than that for way less than that and turn it into wax so for example if I were to get a quarter ounce a week for 50 bucks right and I come out with 1.5 grams 1.4 grams okay usually that's like roughly the number that you get like 1.4 so if I found a quarter for 50 instead of buying a quarter for 70 even though I'm buying that Everclear you know I'm only buying it one time but I could do like three or four washes off of it so they say you add another five bucks to to the 50 bucks so it's 55 bucks for the full gram I mean it really all depends on the amount of money you're spending on the flower if the flower is cheaper you might get the gram for cheaper it's really what it is a determination of the flower so the flower is really really good it's gonna give you a lot of a lot of extract it's not the flower they were so there's smokiness the tea you see that's fun so what I'm doing is I'm using Everclear to extract the THC to then make this okay now some people might not approve of this because it's not being done inside of a lab but you know what I bought after had labels that came out of labs and didn't not taste good at all it's his it fake yeah man I'm not I'm not weird anymore I've you know I've bought stuff from dispensaries in you can't really trust you know you can't trust anybody I've at this point in the game you know that's how it really is so right now I got my own stuff I'm going to take a DAB right now just to show you guys the what's who's it's what's it's yeah that's a big piece right there let's go see this is a matchbox world we are here so what I'm doing is I'm extracting this right here all this flour I'm breaking it up and I'm going to pass this brand of Everclear favorite you can see it it's made in the United States everywhere it's just green alcohol me the same LeWitt's followed by loves coat 190-proof yeah this is really good man this one gives me the best color now there's another brand of Everclear right here same brand but in the plastic bottle no way you want to go for the glass bottle that's what you want to go for and generally you want to go for like you know brown filters and stuff it doesn't matter you know you're stuck extracting so what I saw you know a long time ago that I used to do is I used to let the ever care sit in it sit in the UM in isolette the buds sit in the advocator so what I used to do was extract more chlorophyll so when I do this this process I'm doing pastures you know the liquid is just passing through the flower it's not sitting and it'll sit in it for like a second you know then at that point that's the stuff that I can take to save to them turn into to them turn into a fool green wax okay so this is the smokeable wax and then you take the remnants of anything you make food green glass now depending on how many washes you do will determine how much you get on the second watch so the second watch so your first wash you might get a grant or you might get a half a gram the second air wash you might get on another little half a gram of something like mixture of like cannabinoids and a little bit of chlorophyll you know this sounds really good sorry smell that purple just comes right out I smell that purple eyes man it's a indistinguishable given we're out here you know what's going on in the batter's box when I'm with you dad that I have lined up and I'm birthing a ball rip from the little bit of this brother to break it up cuz there's about 3.6 in here so my little pinch probably that so what I like to do is I like to break it up a hand I don't mean to break it up with a grinder today with a grinder comes out a lot more grinders make the flour come out make the extract come out was very very dark everybody don't like that any pieces of them all too big okay good [Music] right now but blessing you guys with a bomb this is a master bathroom everybody out here breaking up I just cleaned my bomb - I painted up on no it's me and my girl ball so you have been listening to some community clean me you know the [ __ ] is going on we out here there's a master bathroom falling rip dad rip wick always highlighter with wick what I like to do - oh man let me show you guys can I do this oh man there's actually a really good idea watch so what I'm gonna do right now I'm gonna show you guys how to combine dives and bone ribs okay so we're gonna do is let me heat this [ __ ] like I can a little bit I'm gonna heat this thing so it's red-hot and then we'll put it on top of the bowling this just like that okay I'm starting hailing from the fire or from the heat that this protrudes okay and then while I do that well this is piping hot and it cools down my dad is already ready so I'm gonna I'm gonna clear this bar it yeah my my shirt you know I hate going out there and buy anything extracts man you gotta make yourself so this is the only way to do it you gotta do it yourself I've more trust in my in my faith in my room I'm still cooking in here than anywhere else and because not butane is not going to like and I walk out the room - with you know I let the humans go out the window and whatnot it's actually very good to cook the sauce I because it fits a lot faster but I'll adjust the weather right now I made we got it as a mathematical so the thing is diamonds but when we can listen to music down the barn up again and then watch so yeah here we go of my other videos I have a couple videos where I'm like extracting extracting and I'm outside anyways guys matches will be out here using the bottom of this to heat this up is steady using fodder Afghani Afghani Kush and purple granthi purple ready [Applause] gummy lit all right guys Cheers that's what I do man make my own die my own residual there but hey man I'd rather smoke this and supposed to [ __ ] [ __ ] man you know everybody everybody's out there [ __ ] Sun and face [ __ ] bro I bought faith week I bought CBD flower head [ __ ] fake wax bro from from some dude he gave me back some some other [ __ ] for free book man you know how pissed that was I just gave somebody 50 bucks for something fake I should blew my mind blew my [ __ ] mind for something fake bro I think wax like I'm not gonna be inhaling faithful you know what I say you're not good you're not gonna get me anymore okay and then like the dispensaries run here are way too expensive but I'm gonna get this [ __ ] renewed and I'm gonna get a strainer to and after that sometimes they're expensive for firm using just like how you know I will go out to New York and buy a for 50 bucks going on making this wax do [ __ ] I just drop the whole bunch of this [ __ ] true Sarkozy here yeah so I'm gonna use about that much other clear you know nothing about an hour to cook out you know if you use the whole bottle you're gonna use the whole bottle all I can you're not even gonna use a whole bottle mouse honestly probably use like half this bow on an ounce because you were watching each ate individually 8/8 washing your Apes individually is the best way to get the best yield because you can go a little walk it's enough we to give you a grand and enough liquid to pass through you know like it's a pastor and click down fast it's all equilibrium it just comes together you know like 8th individual wash 8/8 just do 8th just do eight eight eight washes spread it out eight times into three into three filters I have three filters right one two three in here the white part and then this funnel thing about the three filters right I've eat of them and then put a finish and then wash each one and then squeeze each one out save each one that's how you're supposed to do it like as as much as you see the kid some think you could do a lot at once but you're gonna get the most if you do a little bit at once but you see how rosin is you know they have big rosin presses to do eighths and they have small rods and presses to do you know tiny little grains and nuts so this is exactly that way masterbox well you know the [ __ ] is going on we out here making my own [ __ ] wags I don't give a damn you know take you down to my level so I'm dropping into my hopping c1c I go right above it okay it's falling okay now that right there if I don't wash it again that's gonna be the gold Asst you know the gold is not what I do it here second wash bat right there I just added a little bit more chlorophyll okay see I didn't even all liquid okay passing through passing through okay a little bit cream it out one more time there's a lot of THC in that [ __ ] what you do is you save this one see that's my last watch okay few times like this because THC does get stuck in the liquid in the actual thing now I close it up okay right and put it on okay see this all the way that's it and then you save this Yuri wash it and this usually trans purple because the me is purple they answer tone and it's good to any of these guys is a master batch mode we out here you know if the [ __ ] is going on too many whites sorry guys", "yNx_LUsNiPI": "but before anybody bashes me in the comments below um yes this is a [ __ ] fake jersey what's going on guys stony rob here back for another youtube video i hope you guys are having an amazing day because mine is going amazing like every other day in today's video we're gonna be reviewing this afghan kush straight from afghanistan i'm [ __ ] kidding it comes from uh the dispensary i kept it for like two days i haven't opened it up so here it is sealed tight nice afghan kush by pure sun farms and without further ado let's get this video started afghan kush is an almost 100 indica which is grown in the hindu kush mountain range the smell of hindu kush is generally earthy and hash like i'm gonna open it up and see the smell of this bud so i'm gonna pop the seal right open like this [Music] so here we are popping it up and i ripped it completely open this was not the intended way of opening it i'm assuming because i just went full blown rambo oh this one smells good damn and this is what it looks like i got one gram just for the review so this is probably like .25 grams the afghan kush generally smells earthy this one smells more pine soily and obviously as you can see there's a lot of mercians on it it's got a kind of a coffee taste well not a taste it kind of has this coffee smell to it just a little bit just a hint just enough so you can smell the coffee smell off of it but it's mainly earthy a musty smell but yeah earthy pine soily smell afghan kush apparently has a hashy taste to it when smoked i haven't smoked afghan cushion well over a year and i can't quite remember the taste of it but we are gonna get to that in just a second i'm gonna smell it just a little more and i'm gonna get to the [Music] rolling [Music] let's not forget that buds of the strain are generally condensed and filled with trichomes i just rolled this joint and holy crap this tray was filled with so much teeth that my whole hand was filled with teeth i literally have a huge amount of teeth obviously there's some bud on my finger but there's actually a huge amount of keef so if you're somebody who likes to collect this key make sure you got a grinder that has a keef collector because mine didn't so all the keith is straight up in the bud in the joint nonetheless here we are we've got this nice ass spliff rolled up we're gonna try it out we're gonna smoke it and i just bent the damn [ __ ] roach but regardless we are gonna smoke this nice afghan kush and let me just go get a lighter and we're gonna light this baby up what's up guys here's a little disclaimer if you're not 18 or a legal cannabis user then you know what [ __ ] off of my video so yeah f off and under youtube guidelines what i'm doing is a hundred percent good and gucci so yeah have a good time so here we are baby we are gonna light it up this is the funnest part of all strain reviews man trying out the bud it wouldn't be a strain review for not trying out the bud am i right [Music] right as i'm puffing it i can honestly taste the hash in it the earthy taste is one of the most overwhelming sensations in this whole joint without this hashy earthy taste i don't think it would be defined as a afghan kush to be honest because this one is actually pretty good i may have forgot to mention afghan cushes generally range between 12 to 20 percent thc the one that i got right now has a total of 16.6 thc before anybody calls me out this ain't no loud right this ain't no crazy ass loud 30 i couldn't find any afghan kush higher than this right and i was specifically looking for it but i haven't been able to find a 30 plus afghan kush up here in canada if somebody from the united states or i don't know from any other country that has legal cannabis drop it down in the comments below if you know any company that sells a 30 plus afghan kush because of the hashy taste it is kind of rough on the lungs and i'm not gonna lie it's sometimes rough on the lungs it's strong on the inhale on the exhale you're pretty chill [Music] so halfway through this joint really i'm starting to feel the effects of it i'm feeling relaxed which is something i haven't felt since this morning i'm kind of feeling happy you know i'm sedated right and i think this is going to be a good bud if you're trying to elevate yourself trying to put yourself in a higher state of mind i wouldn't feel like doing something super productive maybe some chill editing maybe some chill gaming but i wouldn't go to work i wouldn't try to go to school or just be full blown productive on this strain right i think it's a good nighttime strain it's a good like lazy morning strain i wouldn't say it's a active strain so what i'm gonna do is put this little baby out go take a 20 minute break come back and try to solidify and talk about the effects of this afghan kush so it's been 20 minutes and i just smoked some afghan kush and i can safely say that just like on the website and the packaging it does give you that relaxed and cooled effect um i'm having trouble in difficulty speaking because i just don't feel like running through my mind and it's kind of like my thoughts are lagging behind to what my mouth wants to project and it's kind of hard to speak like i already said like i said you shouldn't smoke this when you're trying to be a productive student or a productive worker or whatever i wouldn't use this for a workout to be honest i use it post workout if you're trying to get my drift this is a solid indica it's a hundred percent indica basically it's a very strong strain in the sense of a body high it doesn't hit the mind as much as any other strain and that pretty much covers the whole afghan kush i really enjoyed it i'd rate it a 8.5 out of 10 so a solid strain in my books so to pretty much sum it up afghan kush is basically a 100 indica dominant strain which is grown in the hindu mountains with other hindu kush's this butt is earthy and hashy towards the smell like the main effects of this train is relaxed and happiness like i smoked this and i felt very relaxed i don't feel like talking very much and i feel like going to bed or doing something very very light so that pretty much sums it up for this video if you enjoyed this video drop a like and hit that subscribe button this is tony robb you guys know the drill um", "iikQz7-Qs6k": "hi let's talk about the Afghan curse train

channel greetings from Edmonton Alberta Canada okay and this sunny day I am going to be starting this tutorial well actually I started on Sunday today is Wednesday so far I have crocheted this long and I just want to let you know that it's a really really fun to work with I had a hard time leaving it but unfortunately I had a customer pay me to knit him a dude sweater deliver lebra ski dude sweater so I will be doing a demonstration on how to knit that one on my next tutorial so I have to put this AHA this aside and just wanted to let you know for three days well no actually two days non-stop I have been crocheting this so far and it has been 22 inches long it's really fun and I just love how the colors turned out and I do really suggest the Burnett satin yarn it's it's hard to work with because it has a couple of strands on it when you crochet it but the end result is beautiful and plus like after when you knit or crochet it's nice and smooth I just love the end result so I do recommend Burnet satin yarn it is this yarn and I just love it okay and another thing it does shrink while you're crocheting so I chained I'm going to be giving you all the information after but I just wanted to let you know because I'm putting this information on the beginning of the tutorial because I did shrink I wanted I always aim for 32 by 32 but unfortunately this one ended up with a 27 yeah so it did shrink the reason a drinking is because of the valley and the top the valley in the top it gives the trace so I would I did 6 times 27 so the stitches are 27 multiple of 27 stitches so instead of doing 6 I should have done a 7 but now I know and I feel very bad I think I might get my crochet one for myself because I just loved the way how it turned out the colors starting the inspiration who gave what gave me my Cotton's throw over but I just love this how the colors turned out is there are six different colors the green the dark pink it looks red but it's a dark pink this is a dark pink it's a dark pink lighter pink another lighter pink the light pink looks very light and then ivory white and green so I just love the how it turned out so let's get started and I I joined this stitch it's really fun look how it looks I just love how it turned out and I have another idea as I crochet I'm gonna try to make as stripe without the up-and-downs this looks lovely yeah like there's nothing nothing nothing to say about the stitch it's just gorgeous but I want to try something that goes straight not going up and down and I think I have an idea for a spray us for a spike straight I don't know what I would call it but I'm gonna this is called this is there's already a pattern and I will put it on the description there's a chart into it I can't post the charts on my to tour in my video because it's due to second third copyright or something like that and like this is my own from scratch video that I'm taping so I cannot put someone else's a chart or anything so I will put the link below and you will check into it there's a lovely chart and if you want go into my fans Facebook page I put a album it's pictures and I put a chart there too for the two like this is done with three three double crochets and there's also two chart and I followed the chart and Swedes if it way easier than reading the lot some people is everyone has different ways to crochet I like to follow the charts I just look at it and I just crochet or knit but I will put the information below and if you have any difficulties it can you're welcome to ask me I'll try to help if I don't forget because I keep on going with different projects different different patterns and I'm going to finish this and put this on my Etsy it's a small blanket and I will do the edges I'll do the edge of single crochet and I will try to put while I was crocheting I thought I would put up I will do the straight maybe two or three rows of single crochet and then for the edges I'll do a bobble stitch on my previous or there's another tutorial on my youtube channel if you go into it I'm going to make that a little bobble on the like a pompon on the end to give that different look we'll see and I'm going to put this on my Etsy shop to sell it but I am planning to make one for myself just for myself could just look how it looks I just love the way the color floated look like roses from my garden okay so let's get started and I'll hope you'll enjoy this tutorial and let's go ahead before we start I just wanted to show you how I got the colors from this is my inspiration but I have it it's a cup cover that I put it on my chair because it's leather and it gets so hot because of the leather in my skin I don't like it but I put this cotton cover it's uh and I love the color the pink you can see the different Pink's so what I did is I went downstairs again to my basement and I grabbed all of the colors that I can find these are brunette satin okay here's one of the labels I was on sale I always check for sales these this came out when it was a cancer week I think and so it's Burnett satin this is one of the color again and the color is flamingo sort Teresa you just focus it okay yeah this was that zellers yeah in Canada when we had zellers so that's what I'm trying to get rid of these yarns because these are pretty old okay so flamingos and the number is hard to read it is one six eight zero zero four if you can find it you can't so I grabbed one of this color I grabbed green and I bought these at Walmart years ago and then I have the price it's like 697 Canadia and look at it so that was a good deal and Michael's had it this year earlier this year 2017 so these are old and I grab some of this pink pink lighter yarn and I had ivory and I had white okay so just to these are all from the Burnet satin family so there are shiny I I had a friend that I had a co-worker at one of my works where I used to work and she would always knit with Burnett blanket and she would tell us how good they are just wanted to focus on the color doesn't this look good I'm aware this this color looks great so we're gonna start with green and the pattern of the stitch to granny oh boy it can be done two double crochet or it can be done three double crochet I am going to show you how to crochet the three double crochet oh I just love these colors I love it looks like a rose peony peony oh I love it the pink the green green isn't this green is one of my favorite color and the white and ivory and then the dark so we're going to start with two I'll put a chart here and a chart for a double and I will put the pattern how to uh where you can written pattern I saw this couple of years ago today to March and several years passed by so fine and they I'm doing the demonstration okay it's called the granny stripe so what what you're going to do is chain as long you want 27 multiple of 27 chains so I did my foundation chain this chain and I will put the link here again on my description before asking questions please check my description box I tried to put all the information there and I still get the same question over and over okay so just wanted to let you know like I if I have a pattern I will put it on the description box and what I did is I did 27 so I think there's six here 6 27 so about 150 chain ok and my goal is to crochet 32 by 32 or think it it always becomes yes a little bit smaller because the pattern is like this 2 square to granny so it's going to go up and down up and down down the hill the grandma skyped spiked let's Skype spiked my ripple blanket that's what it's called and I'm going to be knitting 2 rows well I'm not going to count this one so wha this is going to be the foundation how we're going to start so consider this is a chain and I'm trying to not go over the board the previous tutorial I loaded it took me almost 20 hours to load it to youtube so I'm just trying to do as short as I can just under an hour and hopefully it will be shorter than that so chain as long as you want and what I change is 27 times 6 so there's none of the 50 chains here and what you're going to do is just look at the label on the on the yarn and yeah I don't want to go over this at stake times every time I do a tutorial just check your says five millimeter crochet hook so grab one of your five and I'm comfortable we'll see how I have a four here if I not comfortable I go I will go with the five here I have to both crochet hooks here when is the five when is a four millimeter Dylan's a G us G ones the us H so I will go work with either way so chain twenty seven multiple of 27 and that plus what we're going to do is and I will put the pattern and there's a there's a graphic there so that's how I am doing this tutorial like I said either you can do two double crochets or three double crochets and I am going to work with the two double A three three double crochets for this tutorial because I wanted to show more crochets instead of to get me a big becomes more laterally like up and down so okay I am going to chain extra three chains after multiple rows just 27 one two three I have here and what I'm going to do is I am going to skip two three on the third so one two three so 5 let's say chain three and then skip two and then the third do a double crochet loops just like this go in there and do a double crochet we're going to do three double crochets here I always pray when I start a project so hopefully I will finish this as soon as possible okay okay so there's no chain between these gaps just wanted to let you know so we're going to skip to and on the third we're going to do another three double crochets and this pattern is gonna be up and down up and down it's like going to the valley going up the hill going down it's it's a ripple stitch yeah it's all to it so and then we're again we're going to skip to one two and on the third we're gonna do again three double crochets the other one that I have seen it's done with two double crochets so we're doing three double crochets it just gives more texture to the blanket you can do it either way I'm doing it three I always choose the hard way okay so we did three now we're going down the valley and what we're going to do is we're going to skip skip total of five stitches to create that V that's Valley okay so count your one two three four five so this is the fifth just like this on the six want to lose it six this fifth and this is the sixth so we're gonna go we're going up the hill now so again you gonna do three double crochets I'm using Burr not satin you don't have to use Burnett satin this is what I have in my stash and I want to get rid of them because these yarns are pretty old I believe since 2009 before Zellers was opened here in Canada so that's the reason I'm using satin and like I said one of my co-workers she was she was always knitting with Burnett's satin so I just wanted to try it out and see how this turns out or else I used to / saber Burnett Super Saver for my acrylic blankets and this is how it looks like so far we're going down the valley and then again we're gonna do we're gonna skip to and on the third we're gonna do another three double crochets on the same we're doing these three double crochets and I thought why don't why don't I do it tutorial I'm gonna do a blanket so I thought there's no from start to end show me how it's done so this is how it looks like and now we're going up the hill and when we do a rip a blanket when you do up the hill we chain right so we're going to be chaining so we're gonna do we're gonna skip two and on the third we're going to do it again so there's always two double two double crochets three sets of two sets of three double crochets in the middle even when you go up and down just to show you like this is up so this was consider up so there's two again there's there's two in the middle okay and this is the third then we're going to chain three okay on the same same we're gonna do another three double crochets two or three and again we're gonna we're not chaining anything between just we're only the chain we do is three is when we go up up up the hill just like this okay so we're gonna skip two again and on the third so one two on the third we're gonna do three double crochets I think I split it yep I did oh no did I didn't it's hard to see when you're looking at the camera okay just like this so we're gonna do three double crochets and after the three double crochets we're gonna skip two two stitches so 1 2 3 on the third we're gonna do with three double crochet - okay this is the valley it my dog is here with me my doggie I shut the door cuz my husband and my son there's a big there's no loud yeah like to shut the door and my doggies inside as you wants to go out but every time I shut the door she wants to come in where she wants to go out pets say you can't live without them okay so this is the valley so we're going to skip again five stitches so it's a repeat what we did so far it's just a repeat it's a very easy and simple just a basic rip pull of stitch ripple blanket stitch and this is the grandma spiked spiked SPI ke spike okay this is the foundation so we're gonna skip I I'm marked 27 so I did extra - I guess so I'm just gonna remove this marker that I put cuz i chained 20 set multiple of 27 so that was one of my marker so I'm gonna skip 5 2 3 4 5 and on the six I'm gonna make three double crochets just like this just like this so it's no chain and when you come up the hill there's to chase or continue crocheting like this if you get confused go back rewind it start from the beginning so we're going up and down down the valley going up the hill going down the valley so I'm going to continue crocheting all the way to the end and I will meet you at the end ok so I'm at the end and it went perfectly so I am doing the last what I'm going to do is I'm going to change three and then make another double crochet three double crochets on the same spot or up the hill and after that one two and three and then we're going to change total of five from here you can weave this end later so I just have extra two chains so that's perfect one two three four five I'm going to turn my work I'm not going to start the spikes yet I will start on the third row when we change the color so on this row we're just gonna repeat what we see so I'm gonna do three arnis split okay so I'm gonna do three double crochets on the same top hilltop just like this okay and I am going to continue doing no change nothing so what I'm going to do is I'm going to do three double crochets I'm skipping here and I'm gonna make three double crochets here just like this and I'm gonna make another three double crochets here I'm on the valley now I went from the top Hill and I'm down and from here I'm gonna jump here so I'm gonna I'm sorry I'm gonna skip here to create that valley three double crochets and then you will notice the hills and the valleys are becoming just like this as you can see okay so continue crocheting like this all the way to the end and we will change our colors and then we will start doing the spike and before that I just wanted to so I'm going up the hill and then don't forget we're on the hill so we're gonna chain three after three double crochets so don't forget that and we're on when you are in the valley you have to skip one to create that V just like this three so continue crocheting all the way to the end okay so I'm at the end and what I did is I went from the valley up to the hill and I did three chain three and I'm gonna do three double crochets so this is two and then three and I am going to chain total of five same how I did it at the end but before I do that I'm just gonna cut this cut this yarn and I'm gonna add this dark paint that I have and this is how I'm going to join and I think this would be this is how I do it just do a go over twist it just like this and then make it tightly and I'm going to add this to this here and I'm going to crochet these two yarns together just like this tightly so we did one chain two chain three four five and I'm going to turn my work and I'm going to make three double crochets here but to do that I'm going to leave this with me together this is how I do it if you look at my previous tutorials you will see I don't like weaving in at the end I hate that who likes it right I'm gonna just do it while I crochet and then I'll be done with it so I'm just gonna repeat what we have done on the previous but this time we're going to do the spike okay so here we go to do that I'm just gonna jump here straight here and then I'm gonna move this with me and I'll cut the yarn so I'm gonna jump here and then make it one double crochet like I said you can do two instead of doing three so what I'm gonna do is to spike is this I go I go between here one two three so I go between here I grab it grab my yarn and I pull this a little bit longer and I do one and then two the two crochets you go to the same that's how you do the two double crochet but this is a three so we only do one and then I come back and I do a double crochet here in feast if you don't want to do three double crochets you can do to to do the two you go back here to do make the two and this is how you make the spike granny spiked my purple blanket this is how it's done it's easy and simple just a regular ripple blanket that you do and then you just go to the next one I'm just gonna cut these so I have weaved it's that you know doesn't it look nice with the green and the pink and later on I'll use the dark lighter pink okay so we're gonna jump to the next set of three and I'm just gonna do a regular double crochet here and then from here I'm going to jump to the bottom and then go between just like this it didn't make a double crochet and then the third one is just a regular that's all to order this is how you make the spike and then what I'm gonna do is I am going to skip skip here because we're in the valley and I'm just going to go jump here and make a double crochet and then I'm gonna go between here on the bottom and then pull this a little bit longer than regular just like this and the third one is just a regular double crochet you go between next to it and again just gonna come with jump make a spike go down here just like this so it's very easy and simple and this is how you make the spike like I said you can do to to do to to you do two double crochets on the same instead of doing here go jump there so that's that's the only to it if you want to do it with two and then you just do the regular set of three double crochets and then chain three so there's no spike on this when you go go up up the hill just like this then you go jump and then you make a spike you go here then you make the third one just a regular double crochet so you I'm sorry so you only do two spikes and that's all to it so I will let you crochet the rest is easy is simple and I will let you crochet as long as you want so today's Sunday I started this stitch oopsie I have to do the second one spike don't forget stop talking Freda pay attention to me okay and then oh why didn't it happen because I didn't go down oh look what I did see you have to go down that's why it doesn't look good Wow so you have to go down here all the way down don't go between that chain here so go down and then pull now it looks better that little okay and this is how it looks like and then write the value so we skip and it's just a repeat so go down all the way down here find that yeah so I will let you crochet the rest is just to repeat what we have done and these are the only tools that we do the spike so like I said I started today today's December 3rd Sunday and I will try to post this on youtube on Friday and I will try to continue to crochet ever do with different colors and show you at the end and then give you an idea how it will look like we're at the beginning of this tutorial I will show it at the beginning and I don't want this tutorial to be long because then it takes forever to post it on YouTube first I have to save it on my computer and that takes hours and then I have to post it on YouTube and that takes several hours I wish they can find a solution for that but unfortunately they have it today's 2017 still nothing so far so I hope this tutorial gave you an idea how to crochet the granny spike Ripple blanket stitch because it's very easy but you just need to see the details of how to crochet it so I will put them for the written pattern and the chart I followed the chart I don't like reading patterns because I found it confusing it doesn't say I'm not going to give ya not gonna talk about the pattern it's already written so it's free and then I found a chart way easier okay so thank you very much for watching my tutorials please if you haven't subscribed yet please do subscribe please give me the thumbs up that one person yeah you don't like me do you Oh gives me that thumbs down on purpose as soon as I post it must be in one of my subscriber so well we can't please anybody right we cannot please everybody okay so this is how we crochet thank you very much and happy crochet [Applause]", "RgEDa8lhePU": "[Music] [Applause] licorice definitely has a

kind of licorice fruity flavor to it that oh nice oh hell yeah dude and wish I had five yeah man I'm glad you had a good harvest last year man last year this year looks a lot better but you're definitely not as big and they're pretty small but it's a high percentage you know P ganic organic no-till very minimal nutrients in our eatery input so definitely going to be some really great smoke all in all yeah you know it happens you know the some seasons are good now and some seasons are bad you're gonna have seasons where you're gonna have a crop failure the same thing with the farm the foreign partners and soybean farmers some years they have a good soybean and corn yields stomach sometimes they just ended up going to put the bankrupt I had to loan more money to the banks and that adds up over time they become this huge debt system like that yeah dead system where they just keep blowing the banks oh nice hi I fire for 20 Pineapple Express integrated yeah that's definitely did it you know a lot of dead heads we got a village this year yeah the pineapple express man I gotta say that's a great strain I really want to grow that one next year if I can't it's not that's cool trying to find some seeds or clones of it but I wanna try to just start specifically selecting different strains for outdoors that are more heat tolerant more tolerant more multi-resistant not what I'm sorry mold resistant no leaf resistant I'm pretty [ __ ] up from that last two here guys starting to [ __ ] up my words here I apologize for that ahead of time when I get really highs kind of to pop up no word so but I want to try to find strains that are going to be good for the climate that man especially right around we get an October November that's when the mildew starts really becoming more prevalent in the garden I'm starting to see more of it of animal as well really starts popping up because of the hierarchy movie and the offshore winds when we do get offshore winds man but right now we're getting this in an event so it's coming a lot more drier actually the lovest Indian summer that's basically what it is right now I wait see I can't remember the name of it with the geological term ology of it I should say is well duh when it gets a lot warmer during the fall and winter and it's above average temperatures they usually call that a uh I usually call that it and in summer so just a fun fact actually I am kind of doing a trim do you I got rid of all the funnies I'm just trying to get rid of the fans I'm not trying to get rid of sure there's a lot of relief on that's what trying to like extra careful not to rip off your fitter is that really you splashed that would be placed down during or under this is the whole bed right here just in high specs yeah do you have smash bags I don't know if I have the whole set but I have some the hashtags yeah that's just why I was thinking that I can find three of them mana be perfect then we can start making some pretty good Ashe and like I was saying man who'd you take the are these separate runs we'll do the first run with you is we'll do the indoor stuff afghani and the oh so Kelly trainer had mixed together is that whole plant material managed they could be smokeable it's sticky this bump and thought still I'd rather just make hash I process it there's nothing like smoking that stuff yeah be awesome and make some fire present a sh t out of the have seen the buds here on the [ __ ] something that's bigger plan I know no key will take all the other butts out here over here on the basketball court I'll chop plants take all the pop our buds process then chop off all the fan needs and I say toss in the freezer for 24 to 48 hours then make smash out of it [ __ ] again we've seen these people student don't know what the [ __ ] they are but every year I see them they suck Stan the cheese's right out of the stand there check that out I don't know if you guys would get a good view of that but a little beetle on my butter on my stamp on this stem but sit there sucking up all the cheese's yes it was yeah once you see those beetles actually know what growing Oregon we have actually have some plants that I'm drying completely whole I'm not I don't have the fan leaves on them I've ended up chopping all the families off but I have after the whole plan thing from the from the raj hanger or another hang but the garage right store pulley system so I do have some buds that are drive that way but I like to I like to turn them off sometimes and going through the trim system of retitle videos I'd smell amazing no I'm not smoking a blunt actually I'm trying to quit smoking to that so it has been rolling up with bolo de Chile and taking fat clobbered abs like this one right here of the Afghani indoors grown hard percent began ik no-till that's about it I don't actually I don't really like to taste the tobacco anymore used to like the taste of it my weed I mixed behind with weed and cannabis wrong terminology for that but uh now anymore I'm the ice road European joints I used to love that mix much back cigarettes my cigarette [Music] making process but my bow has burned black tastes like plastic it might be what you're dealing with is because reason why it came out black and white I tasted plastic there's reasons for that first reason is that the is somebody contaminated the buds with the plastics or maybe it was bagged - sometimes when I put a cannabis and plastic bags I might get that plastic taste but also the reason why they came out black this is the quality all around you have to have a high quality in you get high quality out so what I like to do is I like to start with the most freshest most healthiest trichome cake THC red drenched buds I'll take those and put it through the process but if I have some lower quality material I really don't like to run that stuff but I usually like to make ethylene for I never had experienced but uh yeah what I do is I just make sure that the buds that you're getting me making cash their highest quality possible-- make sure that you grow your own you know you're not getting it from some muttering shady dealers cheating source guys the best spots are always grown when it's hungry on the throne that your own home I mean because you know that how you're taking care of your glass you know what you're putting into them you know what you're gonna get out of it you know the pH PPM's what kind of water using its filtered or not you know this is the hose water basically you know you'll get the whole you know you'd be able to get that whole idea of how it's all that it's processed with the shady dealer that you might have picked it up from I don't know if that's your buds or if that's like some shady dealers buds it sounds like a shady dealer that you may have picked it up from and you gave me some stuff that's kind of like not the best quality stuff not and ended up contaminating or having a contaminant I eat plastic in it and that basically is what you know why I grew my own this is the reason why I don't like picking up from a shady source from a friend because I know if I produce my own planets you know I produce my own product I know what I do though is I would use live buds and a lot of people would like to use fresh freshly dried buds but I would always go for the freshly frozen buds because with this you're getting a lot more higher quality product and you're getting a higher terpene value as well and it will actually melt in your bowl I mean this stuff would like will turn into like a wax you know or like how it rosin would burn you know our melt and that's the kind of quality you're looking for [ __ ] look at this you got a caterpillar my buddy here yeah chickie chickie your duck come on there you go yeah I hope that answers your question and you're using that man that's really just toxic your your health it may have had plastic and it sounds like he has plastic because I would have a plastic taste and smell also another thing about making hash I've learned from Frenchy cannoli is the time that you spend just how you educate the water and how you agitate the plant material on the ice you don't want to be too rough like where you're hot you're just just really like knocking the shell the ice in the cannabis plant or the canvas flowers and that you are trim but you want to go nice and gentle you know and you want to be a nice smooth mix see where it's not over agitating it and your breaking more of that plant material rather than try comb heads instead you want pure trichome heads you don't want to have any of the stalks with the or the plant material itself that's basically a lot of folks would go for the stalks they'd still in extract that but they want the pier 99.9% heads like bubbleman evoke man's goal he's talking about he talks about sifting out just purest extract the purest hash that you can using the best quality and this best methods of mixing it now he's done videos you can check out his channel bubble man's world on YouTube and he uh he shows everything that you need to know about making hash and how to properly extract it and process it and I like his methods to be honest because every other method and him and Frenchie cannoli are the best hash papers I got to say in the USA France and in Canada they're the best all hands down and like they made some of the best hash in the [ __ ] world managed of dabs perfect and yeah but it's basically like I was saying just making sure it's not too rough you have to you have to also like what I would you actually recommend getting the washing machine a cannabis washing machine is actually the best way of making your ash because it washes it just that the right current at the right roughness you just got to make sure that you don't have too much ice but you don't have too much too much plant material as well that's another big thing is making sure that you have let's see you know say 25% plant material to 40% plant material then the rest is ice or maybe using I think I might be wrong on that actually have to read go through or either re review the Frenchy cannolis videos but uh believe it's like 25 or 50 percent hash or ice sorry yeah 25 to 50 percent ice and then the rest plant material I believe that's I think that's the ratio that he goes by it could be wrong please correct me if I am wrong so that way I know I'm not making the right ratios here but uh making sure that the ratio is correct and consistency is correct and that makes a perfect hash so I hope that really answers your question helps you out on your journey and making excellent quality hash for your head stash and for your friends and them and over here the East Coast I'm in at home my hometown actually all the farmers 32 CBD and we're from corn oh hell yeah man it's awesome matchi that's what everyone should start doing everyone should just drop a horn forget it and just destroy just destroy your corn crops grill him only because that's a more profitable crop and I think more consistent in the market nowadays especially now that him is doing more about also becoming more accepting thank you for your advice is the second time maybe I still yeah also the bags are very important to go to go to bubble man's world or not bold man's world sorry gives you fresh head ease yeah [Music] oh thanks doc this is actually a pok\u00e9mon's website definitely recommend this site if you're looking for high quality bags high quality sifting sifters I mean dry sift screens I mean sorry but also a lot of other amazing products well here you put that here go ahead and check them out Oh whoo that link works let me know that link work or not work or not and we did not resend it worries oh yeah man making house really is it's really specific and also another recommendation recommend is another yeah another recommendation I would recommend would be when you're making your hash make sure your hash is done in a cold climate when you make hash like here we're in Southern California it's like 93 today or 92 today that's terrible temperatures to make hash you got to make hash for the best climate I'd say for making hashes 57 55 57 but even low hard can go Lord's like in the 40s 30s 20s W even better because and you can make way more higher-quality hash you have a consistency in temperatures for the water and for the material so that way you're breaking out more trichomes and you're getting a whole lot better you'll so that's another recommendation I would give to you over making the best option actually not we're gonna hang this body for go ahead and try all this but up this is all this trainwreck step is I'm sorry Natsuki I eat purple Smurf beautiful chicken all right now start drying this stuff up these are all the dead plants that we've harvested so far the fuel the sticks that I just left over but all these little popcorn them so they're left over we're gonna make some bubble hash live resin half so we'll do a tutorial or how-to video on that and stay tuned for that it ought to be coming soon maybe chop those down actually tonight I'll go ahead and start harvesting everything a freezing thing everything also I brought in a whole bunch of plants from the outdoor guide to the temple we've got the grapes topper Brad sit down oh yeah these skittles and Wi-Fi oh gee and then we got all plants from the washing closet that's like the best smelling plan around man next to this one here the Z skills and the Wi-Fi

combat controller and the seals are attempting to rescue their lost teammate you'll watch Chapman's heroic actions as he saves the lives of his entire SEAL team and then another 18 members of a Quick Reaction Force earning America's highest award the Medal of Honor Chapman and the seals exfilled are mh-47 helicopter John is the second individual to exit and immediately moves in the direction of the summit he can be seen moving off to the right of the screen alone the team is taking heavy fire from every direction as indicated by the arrows as Chapman begins engaging targets you can see spent cartridges ejecting from his m4 Chapman then begins closing with the enemy forcing his way upslope in knee and thigh deep snow he is constantly under fire as he does this Chapman's Team Leader begins to close on Chapman following his trail through the snow the dark mass above Chapman is a fortified bunker containing two enemy fighters each armed with ak-47s who are firing down on the team in the darkness this bunker will come to be known as bunker number one to the left of the tree and bunker one is another gray mass this is a rock outcropping that came to be called the boulder between bunker 1 and this Boulder can be seen the body of slain seal Neil Roberts the man Chapman and the others are attempting to recover [Music] Chapman still alone and closest to the enemy pauses to engage targets as his team leader follows him but never actually catches up with him [Music] Chapman on his own now makes the decision to charge directly into the enemy bunker despite withering point-blank fire Chapman now literally on top of the enemy engages the two combatants and kills them saving the lives of the remaining seals he does this from a distance of no more than ten feet these actions by themselves earned him his first Medal of Honor he then climbs into and takes control of the bunker having cleared the immediate threat Chapman is then joined by his team leader in bunker one you can then see Chapman and his team leader engaging the next bunker known as bunker - which is situated to the left edge of the screen this bunker manned by a handful of Chechen and Uzbek fighters also contains a heavy PKM machine gun hand grenades and rocket-propelled grenades John Chapman is shot twice at this time in the torso and collapses incapacitated you are now looking at a new angle and at the left of the screen can be seen the two and fireteam and team leader on top of the boulder just below it is bunker one with the mortally wounded chapman one seal can be seen firing his modified m60 machine gun from the hip into bunker two on the right side of the screen until he is struck by grenade shrapnel and tumbles 10 feet off the top of the boulder collapsing at the feet of his team leader thus setting off a chain of events that would lead to the seals abandoning Chapman on the summit the wounded seal and the team leader can be seen conferring about his injuries moments later the seals decide to retreat from the summit because their position is untenable in the face of continued massive enemy firepower they can be seen moving toward the right side of the screen and passing the body of Neil Roberts unfortunately the seals do not pass John Chapman who is above them an inside bunker one [Music] this angle shows three seals in a triangle the larger black heat signature is a smoke grenade just to its left as a donkey and dead al-qaeda fighter killed by Chapman the steepness of the mountain can be seen as the seals begin to slide down the near shear face [Music] the team leader desperate for relief and now with two wounded teammates asks for uncontrolled airstrikes from an orbiting airforce ac-130 gunship the impacts you see are from 105 millimeter howitzer rounds being fired onto the ridge top in order to save the remaining seals because neither the seals nor gunship know Chapman is alive he is experiencing these detonations from his position at approximately 5:20 in the morning Chapman recovers and begins to engage the enemy bunker one is on the right side center of the screen and bunker two to the left near the screen Center it will never be known what caused his incapacitation and recovery of the two rounds that originally wounded him at least one was mortal and at this time he is experiencing severe blood loss and shock despite that he begins his one-man stand against two dozen enemy combatants during this time Chapman initiates a series of radio calls many of which are heard by a fellow combat controller and teammate of his and Delta Force operators on a nearby summit despite this combat controllers replies Chapman never acknowledges weather because of damage to his equipment or himself will never be known this new angle and footage shows Chapman at the top identified by the green dot under the tree at bunker one the lower center of the screen shows the first enemy fighter who is about to charge Chapman in the hopes of killing the American the timestamp at the bottom shows it is now 6:05 in the morning and fully light he's been fighting alone now for 40-plus minutes and has received more gunshot and shrapnel wounds as a result of the fierce combat this scene shows the second of several enemy charges in this stunning display of determination and courage Chapman can be seen fighting hand-to-hand with the fighter in the larger screen display can be seen additional enemy moving on to the summit but right now John Chapman is fighting for his life six minutes later in this new shot Chapman can hear another helicopter approaching the summit he is in the bottom center of the screen underneath the tree and can be seen in the magnified inset box as he begins his desperate final stand to save the lives of the 18 men on the helicopter the red dots are enemy fighters John begins engaging the enemy in multiple directions and is rapidly approaching the last of his ammunition the helicopter contains a quick reaction force comprised of Rangers pararescueman and another combat controller it is now 613 and the helicopter is short final the enemy is desperately trying to displace Chapman so they can put heavy weapons or rocket-propelled grenades in bunker one while simultaneously engaging the helicopter with the choice to save his life or the lives of his unknown comrades Chapman makes the decision to climb out of the bunker and begin firing in multiple directions as can be seen in the inset suffering from as many as a dozen wounds Chapman is in fact already in the process of dying as he fights the helicopter is struck by a rocket-propelled grenade and makes a remarkable controlled crash just below Chapman and the summit Chapman now off-screen continues to cover his comrades as they pour out of the stricken helicopter some of them are fatally shot as they exited these images with Chapman fighting the enemy at close quarter are the last to show him alive and in this heroic act thus qualifying for his second Medal of Honor ultimately Chapman would expend all but the last few rounds of his ammunition until finally after sixteen bullet and shrapnel wounds Chapman succumbs when he is shot through the heart we will never know his final thoughts or words but what we do know is his decisions and actions single-handedly saved the lives of 23 comrades for more information about John Chapman's

people interweb this dragon guys with the picture it's not like it salute to not nation representation because you know what's the greatest nation there's an operation video definitely talking aboot so marijuana I did I do have some Afghani Kush so since they subscribe this is the best in a lot content I'm trying to do this video here about Afghani Afghani Afghani Afghani till array because you know oh there it is I need to do this video because I have some some marijuana called the Afghani and the Afghani here is a pure indica landrace strain named after its geographic origin obviously is grown in Afghan and Afghans where the earliest varieties of cannabis are believed to have been grown so this is going back to the motherland almost I mean this is where civilizations would have started around Afghanistan around what is that other place but basically Afghanistan Afghanistan gammy the Afghani strain is a heavy indica breeders worldwide have come to treasure Afghani for its heavy resin production which is passed on genetically with a sweet earthy aroma Afghani delivers a deep sedating and relax ation and euphoria patients are commonly turned to this potent indica for treatment of insomnia pain and stress disorders so we're looking to these stress Afghani is like a good strain to do it with the strain attributes being of course relaxed sleepy and happy on the leading with euphoric and hungry on the end of it flavors being earthy pungent and very sweet and there was another term that I heard for this strain it was called like pick win or something serious but blood regardless a couple reviews here I suffer from terrible insomnia Afghani is by far the best I've tried for this normal couch lock indica seems to be very very rate of how the light scent can be described as wood fresh and earthy taste incredibly mellow coming yet assertive effects in golf view total body coverage a full face goes sweetly numb that's the 10 out of 10 I definitely agree that it smells and tastes very mellow very earthy the straighten smells very earthy with a pinch of sweetness to it and even the butt itself is like very fluffy almost not too fluffy so I've got some density to it lightly dusted with some like light colored crystals and lightly colored hairs as well inside though breaking up on a but it is actually like plenty hairy and oh it smells so much good so many crystals on the other side of that but there I would definitely get you a shot of these buds here real real quick Carini fan beanie on here I don't know how okay so macro come on all right there's the buds very nice-looking buds very lightly colored as well looking to be a big fan of this strain for as heavy as an indica that it is oh no watch for as heavy of an indica that it is the smell and taste of it is like really mellow you'd be expecting like a really heavy cushy smell to something that that's this strong but it's the opposite actually I put in the Magic Bullet here of course as usual rolling up with the raw paper filter tips as well as the raw paper 300 pack today put this strain review so quite yet again I'm quite pleased with the with the overall value of this bud it's not a bud that I often come across but definitely will look out for it in the near future when I'm ordering some of these lovely flowers here I did have smoked Fox vape except for accessories hollering hollering back at me and they said they're gonna send me a water pipe to test and review for the channel so shout out to them because they're gonna send me some product to do a video on which is matte matte cool I mean I never even have to contact them they contacted me so good thing of these smoke session videos has kind of been reaching out to people you dunno but I'm actually here I'm rolling up I'm rolling up real quick real real real good buds here fluffy not sticky at all oh I mean I'm no strain I'm most marijuana strength expert but I do enjoy the smoke and I feel like I'm pretty educated on the fact on the matters of fact here so but not I'm not the most educated on it don't get me wrong anyways spliff is coned up let's go hmm how should we smoke this one - belly everyone the hoverboard I think so so stay tuned I'm gonna grab the flotation device alright so you might be wondering what happens on dude cruising on the hoverboard it's not such a bad idea so we're gonna go around the block find a nice space to blaze yeah yeah we on the pathway oh this is actually not a bad spot to spark it up there's a lot a lot of light here a lot of cars though I don't like the amount of cars right here so we're noise pollution it's honestly getting to be a little bit nippy outside I know it's probably dark but I'm just gonna spark this you know I'm gonna add the dry toka is phenomenal and amazingly enough the taste smells tastes even sweeter flavors than the smell so that is definitely a plus right now Bern's mellow the just like straight from the woods earth yeah the first actually the first time around when I smoked this I smoked kind of a big a big one paper and those Roz and I fell asleep for a few hours it was that potent overall very good strain not to be not to confuse it with Afghan Afghan Kush definitely a very potent landrace landrace being like it's an uncross train no one's crossbred it with any other strain this is an original strain that has just grown from the earth so that's an amazing fact definitely worth checking out if you ever come across it is say an Afghanistan a lot of the best weed is drone same with California same with Canada on that west coast hopefully I enjoyed that Duke Cruise movie I sure did on an Afghani make sure you guys check out the rest of my videos they subscribe I'm gonna see if I can get up these curb I haven't been having much luck check yourself one more traffic okay I just learned something there the faster you go the hub keyboard to get up curbs the more of a chance to have on making it yeah I definitely feel it in my my eyes and I'm in like a zoned out high right now I just caught myself showing off from the rabbit hole on YouTube and that usually happens when I'm really really baked so good job with that afghani and uh I'll give it a five I'll get a 4.5 out of 5 I don't normally rape my strains but that one was good enough to rate honestly obviously it was so bitter but the rolling of another one till next time", "rDyNNsrXVok": "another one of the strains i picked up from kira leaf this morning well actually that they delivered is this uh afghani tried and true probably all around kind of my go-to from kira leaf old school genetics straight indica really works well for pain sleep etc [Applause] helps take the edge off some of my anxiety when i smoke this never really had an awful batch oh this one looks really good it's got that mmm that slight earthy smell with that pungent really can't go wrong with afghani it really is like about the same thing as nine pound hammer but a little bit more i don't know honest i'd say i just kind of like i think this has a little bit better indica effects than nine pound hammer also a little bit tighter looking on this batch this is these these nugs are actually what cure leaf you've really done a lot better on this batch here and the last with the these are a lot tighter better trim nugs and it actually weighs a slight bit over normally normally cure leafs are a lot stingier i mean 3.5 is kind of all you ever get from there so this is looking pretty good um i already opened one and smoked uh half a joint and it was really good smoking nice um a little on the dry side and the ashes are slightly dark but it's smoking good uh it's not going out constantly uh overall decent batch you know so i got myself a nice nice quarter of afghani to get through the holidays here can't go wrong there especially when uh for 35 a jar well happy holidays let me know what you guys think of uh afghani thanks a lot", "bxkUO0SlAss": "bringing the people behind our food to life we start seeding carrots in the early spring then we sow them again in the early summer in the late summer and then in the early fall and these are late fall carrots these are called Qin Kuroda and it's a Japanese variety that we found just do really really well here this time of year they have a really great sweet flavor and very nice crunchy texture and they get big like this and then still taste really really great they don't have any bitterness at this time of year at all they're not one of our main crops here but we do grow them our CSA members certainly love them we love them we get the cutest little things that are really twisted together where there's two this is actually just one here's what I've learned about the different colors carrots were red originally and we've tried growing some red ones there's some Afghani carrots I want to try to grow that are just solid red there's purple ones but the couple times that we've grown the purple ones it was only on the very outside so just washing and rubbing it with your finger was enough to wash the purple off so I've seen ones that were purple all the way through and then there's big yellow carrots that we've grown before that have massive amounts of greens but they also that also makes them be really good for this time of year seems like the bigger greens are go well better in the fall for some reason whereas in the summer they're the greens are much smaller little less less of the carrot goes into making the green but this for some reason this seems to make it so it lasts well into the fall and into the winter if the rodents didn't get to them the colors that we've grown the yellow and the Reds and the purple that we've grown aren't as sweet most of the work on breeding them for flavor and sweetness and crunches is still the orange one you", "Ye3v7eiQHOM": "Hey, welcome back to The Crochet Crowd as well as my friends over yarnspirations.com. Let's continue our stitch along together with the Flora Afghan. This is again my own design. Let's open up the book and you can download this if you haven't got it already and each month it gets updated with the next set of patterns that you'll find. So what we're going to be working on this time is the Posey. So the Posey here is going to be making three. This is revision one that we are filming and like always if you see anything that is wrong just let me know. In the back of the book there is contact information to be able to highlight how I want you to present it to me so I can exactly see where your problem is so that I can fix the pattern if required. So we're gonna be making three of these things. This one has a bit of depth to it. There is also tapestry crochet so there's a learning technique involved and there is a total of sixteen arounds in order to do it and in this time we're just going to get ourselves started. So we already have an introduction for this particular afghan so you're gonna be making three of these and I'm gonna be showing you some cheating techniques, of course along the way. So let's without further ado let's grab your crochet hook we're using Caron One Pound. Of course if you've been using another yarn and other size hooks please continue to do that so that all of your particular projects can match together. So for next month for August we are going to be moving along then and you have all the different squares that are available to you right here and we're gonna be moving on to Lily's in August right here. So we're currently working on the Posey. So without further ado let's get started. So let's take a blown up look of this particular square. So what we're gonna be doing is starting off with a little bit of popping work that will happens and then eventually we're going to be doing this layer here which is gonna make it sink downward. They're gone, then going to get involved in tapestry crochet for I believe at least two rounds and then we're going to create another ridge which keeps that coming down as well. So then we continue out to the border. So what's gonna happen here is that the outside here as we transition to the outside is the exact same in every square just to make it very convenient for everybody and so the last four rounds like all of them are the exactly the same. So let's grab our crochet hook a 6 mm, size 'J' is what I recommended but of course stick with what you've already been doing if you haven't already started this particular project. The colors that you will see in this particular sample I do have three colors that were shown on the sample but of course you can mix and match anything you wish. So I'm just gonna be doing that same thing today so I'm not matching exactly what you see in the pattern color wise. So we're gonna start off and with the slipknot and I want you to chain four and that will be part of your first double crochet. So 1, 2, 3 and 4. So what we're going to do then is fourth chain from the hook so the very beginning one I want you to put eleven double crochets into that beginning chain. so we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and  11. So I want to double check. So the first chaining that you have counts as one of them so there should be total 12. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. So once you have that done I want you just to slip stitch to the top of the first one and pull things nice and tight. You can never change that later so pull it nice and tight now and let's progress up to around number two, and you'll notice that it changes colors within the pattern for the round two. Let's continue. I'm gonna keep this yarn just going one more time. So we're now going to start the beginning popcorn for round number two. So if you're joining new yarn, you'll join it to where you fastened off before. So we're going to start with the beginning popcorn which is different from a popcorn. So the beginning popcorn all it is is that you are going to chain two to start so that you can get it started and then you're gonna plush, push [chuckles] push, in uh, three double crochets sorry about that three double crochets. So 1, 2, 3. Now you're thinking why did I do uh, two and not three. I found that when I did three it looks sloppy. If you do um, chaining of two only it looks better. So you're just gonna just release that from it's um, from the hook or from the hook and come in the top of the first chain two and go towards the back side and then grab the loop and pull through and then chain two, so 1 and 2 just like that. Okay, so in the same one that you just did that in you're gonna push in a regular or put it in a regular popcorn. So in the same stitch a regular popcorn. So the regular popcorns are four double crochets into, into the stitch first and then release the loop and come to the first one of the grouping of four, towards the backside and grab the loop and put it on just like that. And so all you're just gonna do then is that you are then going to chain a total of two. So 1 and 2. So you're gonna skip the next stitch that's available to you and go to the second one over and do the exact same thing. So there's gonna be one popcorn complete first, so there's four double crochets. So 1, 2, 3 and 4. Okay, release the loop, go to the first one of the grouping of four, put on the loop, pull through, chain two and then in the same one that you were just in put in another popcorn. So four double crochets. So 1, 2, 3 and 4. So lots going in on the one stitch. Release it the grouping of, go to the beginning of the grouping of four, put it back on, pull through, chain two and then advance. So skip the next stitch and go into the next one. So you're gonna have six groups of these twos by the time you get all the way around. So I'll meet you at the end of this round. This is round number two. So I wanna show you a little cheating technique. See this piece here that is part of the first stitch but it always looks like it doesn't belong when you're finishing a round. So I've done one popcorn in the final stitch where I'm supposed to and then I'm supposed to do another one. If I were you and you were me what I would do is start your popcorn where you're supposed to, the second last popcorn so start it and put in two in to where you should and then just advance to the next stitch for two. I know complete cheating. Then release it and then pull it through and then what what can happen is that you're gonna chain two and then finish it with the top of the first popcorn and what this is doing is that it's hiding in that last section so it looks like it's completely invisible. If you do it the way that you're supposed to do it you end up with a slight gap here and it's really quite noticeable especially you as a crocheter. So finish that how you like. I'm gonna be changing up my yarn at this time and moving on to round number three. So let's start round number three. Just create a slip knot and I'm gonna show you how to do a standing single crochet. Of course if you don't like to do that, just join it to any of the chain two spaces. So just pick one, chain one and then single crochet into the same space and then chain one, single crochet in the same space. But if you wanna do a standing just pick any one. I don't like to pick necessarily the same one where I finished because then you end up with the traveling seam line. So I like to go a little bit earlier. Any chain two space will do and insert your hook in noticing that the loop is already on the hook because we're gonna do a standing single crochet. So just scoop the yarn underneath and keep both loops on the hook and then pull through two and that's a standing single crochet. You're gonna chain up one and then in the same chain two space single crochet. So the top of the popcorn is where everything is gathering. Its right directly beside see this right here, that's where you wanna go. So single crochet there. So the next chain two space are all gonna be the same and it's just one single crochet, chain one, one single crochet and then single crochet in the top of the next popcorn and that's all you're gonna do for this round, round number three. So jumping over to the next chain two so single, chain one, single and then single in the top of the popcorn. Please do that all the way around for round number three. So I'm coming up all the way around there will be one single crochet in the final popcorn to keep the repeat pattern going and then just join it to the first single crochet that you have. You can keep this color going or you can get rid of it at this time. Your call, you can decide what that makes sense for you. So at this point that's the end of round number three. So for myself, I kept this color going for round number four. So it's up to you and let's continue. So to begin the next one we, if you're going to start a new color then you'll be in the middle of the chain one in between the two single crochets that you have. So this is a nice easy round. So we wanna, if you're keeping the same color just slip stitch to the chain one space and then begin. You're going to chain four which counts as a double crochet and chain one spit, uh, and chain one. So it chain four and then just double crochet back into that same space, chain one space. Just like that. So it's a V-stitch. So now you're going to chain one and then go to the next chain one space and then put in a V-stitch. So a double crochet, chain one, double crochet. Just like that. Then chain one, go to the next chain one space and do that all the way around and that's it for round number four, and I'll see you at the end of this round. So when you get all the way back round last V-stitch chain one first and then go to the third and the beginning chain four to make sure that that first V-stitch stays where it should. So I'm gonna get rid of this yarn now, and I'm going to start you on round number five. So let's begin round number five. You can create a standing single crochet once again. So any one of the um, middle's of this of the chain ones in between the V-stitch is where you can join and that's all we're gonna do. So we're gonna just go in there and join it. Scoop it and then pull through the two and that's a standing single crochet. So once you have that joined what you're going to do is go to the next and V-stitch. So just go to the next one and we're gonna place in seven treble crochet in there. So we're gonna go 1, and 2, this is 3, this is 4, 5, 6, and 7. Oops, I gotta get that seven in there. Make sure there is seven. I just dropped my yarn here and just make sure you count so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So the next V-stitch is going to be a single crochet only and then in the next V-stitch it's gonna be seven again. So I want you to repeat that all the way around. So it's gonna be seven and then one single crochet and then seven and then one single crochet and you will have a total of six of these all the way around and then six of the single crochets. So I've got my seven in here and I've already started with my single crochet and that's where I'm going to go into my first single crochet and slip stitch. So you'll notice that it wants to bend forward. So we're gonna be using that. When I was designing that I saw that I'll thought let's use that to our example or our advantage for having texture. So get rid of this color if you wish and then we're gonna be moving on to round number six. So let's do round number six. We're gonna do a back post double crochet, but as a standing one. So just have the loop on the hook already and wrap. Keep your finger pinched so it doesn't unspinning self and then just come in and isolate the first post and stay to the back side and then yarning over pulling it through. Noticing that I'm still pinching down and then yarn over pull through two and then yarn over pull through two. So now that it's joined you have yourself the first back post double crochet. So continuing along each one of the trebles that you have will be a back post double crochet and then when you get to the end of that you're gonna end up back in the single crochet and that's still also going to be a back post double crochet. Just like that. So once you get to the single crochet continue to make that a back post double crochet and then carry on and you'll notice that it will keep the lift and now you will have the nice indentation in the beginning. So carry on, one back post double crochet in each of the stitches going all the way around and that includes the single crochet. Okay, when you get all the way back around just join it to the top of the first back post double crochet. I'm gonna get rid of this color and I'm gonna switch over now. You'll need two different colors for the next two rounds. We're gonna be doing tapestry crochet. You're gonna notice it's kind of bowling up still. That's what we want so don't panic and then I want you to fasten off this yarn. If you'd like to keep this yarn and not do tapestry you're more than welcome to do so and that again I just want you to have choice when it comes to learning how to do these ideas with your crochet steps. So let's start your tapestry crochet. So you can start right where you finished or if you can, wanna start somewhere else that's up to you. And we need to color so I'm going to use purple and and I'm gonna use gray. So the first color that we're going to join only has two stitches every time we're going to use it in this particular sample, and then the second color always has three in this one here. And we're gonna have to do an expansion round to keep it growing equally. So just join it with your yarn and you can do a standing single crochet as well. So just make it a standing so 1 and then the next one there's only two stitches of this particular color in this. So you're just gonna come into the next one, pull through but don't finish it and then just grab your new yarn here and use that yarn to finish. Just like that. Okay, so now your new yarn is ready. So these yarn strands that you have, the stragglers and also the the one leading to the yarn ball here you wanna drag up underneath your stitches. So the beginning one here, it's always gonna be the same all the way around it's gonna be repetitive. The next stitch that you will have, just going in, will be two single crochets. So 1 and 2 and then there's gonna be one in the next one but when you it's the last one so you don't wanna finish it. Drop it and just grab the gray up and finish it with the gray. So the next stitch is going to be gray. So do you see how you got a loop there? Just pull on your yarn strands make sure that all of your items get nice and equal. So there's gonna be two gray, but you have to switch back to the purple on the second one. So you just start it and then just drop it and then just get your yarn ready. So you wanna continue to drag these yarn strands underneath. So again purple it's going to be two into the next one so 1 and 2 and then one by itself, but you don't wanna finish it with that. You wanna join it back. So any kind of slack now is your chance to pull on it, tighten it up and as soon as you bury the stragglers in far enough you can get rid of those two and then that is one less thing you need to worry about. So let's switch back to gray. So the gray is only for two stitches in a row so we have 1 and 2 and if you haven't already figured it out we're only expanding when it's on the purple. So just drop it and finish it with purple and then there's two purple's in the first one so 1 and 2 and then one into the next one and don't finish it and just drop your yarn and grab the gray and then there's two gray's in a row. So that's kinda how you do tapestry. It's kind of a really helpful way to do it in the sense that it's so easy, it's not hard and what we're gonna do in the next round is that we're gonna use the gray and the gray will be the expansion so that it looks equal by the time we're done that. So we only have two rows of doing tapestry. It's enough to not drive you up the wall, but it's enough to also to look nice on the project, too. So two rows of tapestry. Okay, when you get back around your last stitch will be the purple. Okay, so it's keeping in sequence of like sets like gray and purple, gray and purple et cetera. So when you finish the last stitch you wanna switch over to the gray to get ready for the next round. So round number eight. So we're gonna continue with the tapestry and then use that then to slip stitch to the first so then it's all ready to go. Keep that purple ready so that you can still continue to bury it. So in this particular one is that we are going to then um, continue along and chain one. So with the gray now, the first stitch of the gray, you're gonna put in two single crochets, so 1 and 2 and noticing how that I got the purple buried underneath it and then one. So when you finish that last one drop it, get your gray or sorry get your purple backup. It's only for two rounds, okay, and so each one of the purple's is just one stitch each. So 1, 2, and the 3rd one don't finish it and drop it and get your gray ready. So the first one at the gray again is going to be two single crochets. So 1 and 2 and then one into the next one drop it and get your purple ready and one single crochet each of the purple and then just switch out your yarn as soon as you get to the last one don't finish it drop and go. So it's easier now because I've just practiced the first round and so you can see it's looking pretty amazing. So let's continue then and do that for round number eight. So when you get all the way back around, you're just finishing off with your purple. To make it look consistent drop your purple though finish that with the gray so that you can use that gray then to attach it to the first one. So use your tapestry needle, hide in everything. So my goal at the end of this round here was that each one of these colors had an equal number. So you had three, three, three and it looks pretty circus-like in a pretty awesome. So you'll notice that the pucker really kind of pulls up in the middle. That's intentional right and that's awesome. So we're now gonna continue into round number nine. I think almost the hardest part of this is almost done and we're gonna uh, like as far as I'm concerned as far as the tapestry. I know if you don't like the tapestry just do the same expansions that you had but without with just one color and therefore you're good to go. So I'm not that particular if you would like to skip that part of my particular project. So I think it's just kind of fun. So let's continue to round number nine. So get rid of your yarn and let's start with something fresh. Let's begin round number nine. I'm gonna show you a cheating technique here. Of course, it's the whole point of a tutorial right? It's nice to be able to follow in the instructions but if you know the whole point of a tutorial is learn something new. So what I want you to notice is that you see how that we have three gray's in each. When you join with a slip stitch it always looks like there's an extra. So I'm gonna teach you how to get rid of that right now. So let's just join to the one before, okay and we're gonna do a standing double crochet. So to do that is just pinch it put it on the hook wrap the hook first and then going into the stitch. Noticing that I'm leaving the straggler down on top pull through, pull through two and two and then pull things nice and tight. So now that we've joined it, I want to show you how I can cheat the system. So in the next one here, see how it's the one before? Technically there should be two double crochets in here. So what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna skip that in my mind mentally and just go right into this joining space. So it's not, see how it's not in the top of that one and then just put one double crochet there and that fills in that space. It's not cheating it's just being realistic. So now the next five double crochets you're just or five stitches you're gonna double crochet. So let's just count those so 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and I want you to see something. See how that we joined it to the purple before the gray. The next, the next purple which is the last part of the purple is the expansion. So there's gonna be two double crochets in that one. So technically when I started if you, if you, you should have put two into the first one but I had you put one into the space here to hide it. So it's a neat kind of idea. So hopefully that makes sense. So five in a row, so 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and look where I am. The last purple is gonna be the expansion. So there'll be two in there. So hopefully all that made sense. It's just, it's nice to had learned things in order to cover it and then when you come back around to join it you'll notice that there really won't be any spacing for you to be able to visually see. So without further ado continue around and let's finish off round number nine together. So when you come all the way around with putting your five in a row technically the last uh, purple here would have had two in there, but I told you how to cheat it and then just join it to the first standing double crochet. So now we're gonna do uh, round number nine. So let's get rid of this color again. And if you do a nice job here of just really pulling things nice and tight we're gonna do a back post double crochet round in order to provide the final lift for your texture on this, on this particular square. So let's continue now to round number ten. So let's start round number ten. I'm gonna show you how to do a standing back post double crochet like we had done before. So just wrap the hook or put this on the hook, wrap it once and pinch. Go into any back post and pull through, pull through two and two. So simply all the way round is going to be one back post double crochet as you're going around like so. So I'm just hiding in my loose ends as I go. It just makes it a lot easier and also that you're able to make them secure as well. So one back post double crochet. Here's a tip I want to leave with you. It is really easy sometimes to accidentally go not into a full back post. So, let me just show you. So sometimes what I do by accident is that I come in from behind and sometimes I just accidentally go in and I don't get all the plies. So let me just finish it like I wanna show you. And what happens is is that I miss a section of it that does happen. So once in a while, you want to just take a quick glance and making sure you're getting the full stitch for that because what happens is that this is noticeable and if you do that, then what um, you'll notice that it won't look perfect when you go to do that. So it happens to me more often than I care to admit um, but that's part of the stitch work and it looks amazing if you can get it right all the way around. So back post double crochet one in each all the way around for round number ten. So as you come all the way around just make sure you take a quick glance. Make sure that you didn't accidentally catch any plies that are or didn't separate any plies when you did that, So just one back post double crochet in each and then you're gonna come all the way to the very last one and then just join it to the top. You can either keep this color going or you can just change it out like I'm about to and we're going to do a couple more expansion rounds and then we're going to then continue then and finish it off in a square like we normally had been before. So let's get rid of this color and try something new. Let's progress in round number eleven. You're gonna start your yarn. Remember what I said about joining stuff so you can hide it. So do it in the first time and then it just is out it out of sight out of mind. So come into the stitch before the join and I want to do a double crochet. So I'm gonna do a standing one. So just wrap, so if you don't like the standing just a join, chain three and that counts as your double crochet. So just doing it with the standing and technically you're supposed to put two into the first one but go into the space right here that is the join itself and just say that is two into the same one, and then that'll hide it perfectly. So now the next seven in a row, sorry, the next six in a row is all gonna be one double crochet. So we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So the next one has two in it, so just put in two. So the very first one was counted as two just so you know even though we just put it into the space and then the next six in row is all by itself. So 1 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 and then two into the next one. Please do that all the way around. This is round number eleven. So in keeping count the very final six stitches are by themselves. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. So do you see that there's no stitches that looks like it's left over because you filled it in right there. So just join it to the top. So you can either change out your yarn I'm just gonna keep it just one more time and then I'm gonna show you the cheating technique when I get back around. So I'm gonna keep it going. If you're going to change out your yarn this is where you'll do it and you'll just start up in the first one and you're gonna chain three and then a double crochet into the same one. So this time around seven in a row is by itself. So we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 and then two into the next one so 1 and 2. So you're expanding. So please do that all the way around. So seven in a row and then two, seven in a row and then two. I'm gonna show you a cheating technique because the way that we started here I'm gonna show you how to fill that gap in too. So let's get there in just a moment. So just coming all the way around the last seven or by itself but I wanna show you how it can finish off the seven. I've already counted so I'm not counting now. So I wanna finish off and I wanna get rid of that gapping space that will occur if I don't finish it off with my cheating technique. Maybe one day it'll become a standard of crochet. But if I finish now and the last one and then I join up with this space right here. Oh my god this will drive me nuts. So what I wanna do is that I wanna make two together using the spacing here and the final stitch. So just wrap, going in pull through, pull through two and then going into that join right there and pull through and then I can join it to the top of the first chain three. Like that and what that did is that I filled in that space, beautifully. Mm-hmmm, that's right. That's what I'm talking about. So let's get rid of this yarn now and now we're gonna proceed now to like we have with the rest of the squares of the last four rounds all being the same as each one in order to get ourselves into a square formation. Let's begin round number 13. Lucky 13 next! So let's look at this picture together. We have four rows left. So at this gray is where we are now. So we're now going to use two rounds to get ourselves to be a square. This final round here of this gray kind of solidifies it in then the final single crochet row makes it fabulous. So let's do that. Just use some fun yarn. I always did mine that the next two rows were always the kind of the same color like keeping them together as one color but you can make them multiple. I don't care it's up to you. Let's begin the, for next round lucky 13. One more thing before we begin. As we begin this transition if you haven't already followed the other videos you'll notice that it's like a mirror. So once we get one side done like just half it says the opposite the other side. So we're gonna have like trebles that will be your corners and then one treble that will be by itself. Then you have three doubles, five halves, eight of these singles and then five halves again and then three doubles and then one treble by itself and then a corner. So it's always opposite to each other. So once you do one part of it and do the other and then we get to the other side and then do the same thing. So it's one, three, five, eight, five, three, one. There'll be a test on that later. So let's begin. You can do it as standing treble if you want to or you can just chain four. Just attach to any one. So just wrap the hook twice if you're going to do a standing and going into a stitch and pull through, pull through two, two and two and I want you to put another treble into that same one. So this is one half of the first corner that you're working on and you'll finish this corner when you get back around. So let's work our way across to the other corner. So it'll always be the same. So it's going to be a treble first by itself. Okay, so I'm gonna simplify my terms. So one treble then we have three doubles, 1, 2 and 3 just like you have here and then see this is the join and things so you can kind of cheat it. So there's gonna be five halves but you can cheat the first one if you want to. Go into where it's joining if you run into that at all and then just going into the next one that is technically the stitch pull through and then pull through all of that and that is one of five. It, it will look fine. You just gotta keep on going. So you're gonna come into the next stitch. So that you're gonna half double the next four. So you technically have five in a row. So this is what we want to do. So 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Then you're gonna have eight single crochet in a row. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. Then we get bigger again. So there's gonna be five doubles or five half doubles so 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and now there's going to be three doubles. So 1, 2 and 3 and then finally one treble by itself. So wrap the hook twice and by itself. And now we're gonna officially start the corner. So the corners will each be two trebles followed by a chain two and two trebles into the same one again and that finishes that corner. So I'm gonna take you through one more side. Okay, so you see that it's gonna kind of getting bigger and bigger so it can make it awesome. So let's start one more side. So the first one is in treble by itself. So 1. The next three are doubles, so 1, 2, and 3. The next five are halves. So you know, you're noticing I'm not worrying about jumping over any stitches. I only have to do it when I get to that join. So I'm at 3, 4 and 5. There's gonna be eight singles. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 and I just wanna fold the project sense it's hitting my microphone cord. So there's eight now there's gonna be five halves. So 1, 2, 3 4 and 5 and then there's going to be three doubles so 1, 2, 3 and then one treble by itself and then another corner. So that's the other corner right there. So to do a corner is two trebles followed by a chain two and two trebles. So just reverse this video back if you need to review on how to do a side again. You can make your notes as well if that's easier for you. And when we get back around then you'll notice that we are going to be kind of almost square we're not quite and then we're gonna use the next round to get ourselves pretty much close to square. So starting again off. So one treble, three doubles, five halves, eight singles, five halves, three doubles, one treble, another corner. Please do that all the way around. So I'm coming all the way around and my stitch count is right. Sometimes when I'm doing these kind of things I can be off by a stitch and what happens is that it's like are you gonna frog it all the way or are you gonna try to fix it? So what I would do like if I was to do this and I was missing a stitch I would just add in an extra stitch. And then if I was one, if I was finishing too early, I would put two stitches together. That's just me, that's just I'm okay with that. So you're gonna finish the final corner of trebles and then you're going to join with the half double crochet join at the top. So just wrap the hook, go into the top of the chain four or the standing and then pull through and then pull through all of it. I'm going to keep this color going and then we're going to then just quickly review into round number fourteen next. Now let's go into round number fourteen. And what you want to do is you wanna chain three and it counts as a double crochet and double crochet into the chain uh, into the half double crochet join space. So it's going to change your counts just slightly as we're going across. So in the next three it's gonna be three doubles. So 1, 2, 3 and I tried to keep it simple when I designed this. The next three are half double crochets, so it's three so 1, 2 and 3 and now for the next eighteen is single crochets. So let's count those out. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18. So technically should only be six stitches left 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, see I've got it. So it's gonna be three halves. So 1, 2, 3 and then three doubles so 1, 2 and 3 and in the corner, it's always gonna be the same. So it'll be two double crochets. So 1 and 2 followed by chain two to turn and then two double crochets in there. So let me verbally tell you what you need to do. So it's gonna be three doubles, three halves, 18 singles, three halves, three doubles and then another corner of two double crochet, chain two, two double crochet. Please do that all the way around. This is around number 14. So when you get back around just join it with the half double crochet join to the top of the first chain three. Now that's gonna be this color for now and now it's gonna get even simpler as we continue. Two more rounds to go. Let's finish this off and let's start round number, number 15. So we're gonna start off with a nice simple round. You're gonna come into the corner you can either do a standing double crochet or you can just join, chain three and that counts as your double crochet. Of course I'm gonna do a standing because I feel fabulous and it looks good too. So just join it and then double crochet one more time. So you're doing the first half of the corner. So right in every stitch going across is just one double crochet and you're welcome for making it so simple. So just, [chuckles] just do that one double crochet in each and when you get to the next corner it'll be the same is two double crochet, chain two, two double crochet and I want you to do that all the way around and this, color is only on one time like for one round and then we're gonna the final round off in just a moment. So get all the way around and let's call this quits for today. When you come all the way back around don't forget to finish that final corner and then join it to, with the first one with a half double crochet join. So Jeanne actually taught me that many years ago. I've known Jeanne awhile now. So here we go. Let's get rid of this yarn and do one final round. It's your last round around the park and then that concl uh, concludes your posey. So let's get ready uh ready your next yarn. I'm gonna use purple. I'm feeling adventurous today and let's finish this off together. Okay, let's finish off your final color choose whatever one you want. I did it for mine that the flora each one of the final borders was the same color so it looks good when it comes together. Again, your creativity, your choice. You can do a standing single crochet at this moment and then that counts as one of five and you want five singles in the corner. So this is 2, 3, 4 and 5 and then just one single crochet in each of the stitches all the way to the next corner and then each corner as if you didn't guess already has five single crochets. So that'll conclude off then that round and then I'll see at the end of this round and then we'll finalize our video for today. When you get all the way back around you've already done your corner, so you're just gonna slip stitch and finish. So because this is the very end, if you've been hiding in your ends all along it'll probably satisfactory. But the very final you're not gonna hide those in as well because the fact is it could fall out. So just pull it through, grab a tapestry needle and it's not my own trick, but I learned it many moons ago. Put it on to the tapestry needle and I want you to put it through the back part of the stitch work. So stay towards the back side and I'm gonna turn the project around so I can see the back. So with your needle just pull it through. Don't warp anything so just pull it snug but not to the point where it changes the look and then going in a different slightly different path but in the other direction pull through and then finally another slightly different path in the other direction. So go back and forth three times and that's a charm and that's good to go. And this would be how you conclude off this. So you need a total of three posies in order to do this project if you wish. Of course if you'd like to make a solid afghan just with this it's awesome too, and you'll notice that the top wants to pull up so if you wanna push it down you can if it if it's willing to go down. But it has some texture to it and actually I really like this color. You know, I just found that yarn on the floor here in my studio and I thought ah, you know I'm gonna use it cuz I don't have a lot left of it, I love it I think it's awesome. So have a good one. It may not be your taste, but that's okay. Everybody has free choice. So until next time see ya and this is the Flora Afghan for the month of July 2019. Bye. Bye \ud83d\udc4b", "v03msmQ6lsk": "how's it going YouTube player grows um come back with an update on the garden these are the final five plants that I will be finishing out to complete my I guess you can say my entire grow log videos for the last six years so let's just jump off to it um back here is the last plant of rainbow sherbert great smoke I'm still smoking on it still after six weeks of harvesting the other strains this one right here is the short phenotype of OG Kush it's an okay yield er I'll show you in a minute what it looks like the same with this one it's a pineapple chunk of kind of a low yielding plant more sativa and than anything and I'll show you that one as well um the last two over here if you saw earlier videos these are the ones I've planted from seed these are the two grapefruits from female seeds over there and I guess Amsterdam they came from attitude seed bank so matter of fact I'm not even sure they did I think it was their Twitter giveaway where I want a raffle from female seeds company and they send me like five beans of like black sugar c99 in this grapefruit which I decided to try so they're looking pretty happy a little bit of stretch but I think there's a diva dominant could be who knows anyway let's move on over um I'm not doing any more clones there's no point it's December 2 cold right now it's about sixty degrees I got the garden at 74 um I got six plants left in here here's the pineapple chunk kind of wispy Airy buds anyway I can't focus right now so that sucks well what I really want to show people is this one let me get it here great and the sticky trap falls on my shoulder fun let me get this off one quick Jesus Christ [ __ ] I don't even need it anymore pointless to have it alright anyway back in the garden sorry about that everybody's heads are shaking and [ __ ] so this is what I want to talk about right here this is Afghan couch special this month its ferocity and get it to focus come on all the times right Jesus [ __ ] anyway I can't get it to focus for [ __ ] this sucks dude so I wanted to come in here and show y'all fan Li frosty frosty frosty this is phenomenally frosty there we go let me get that [ __ ] craziness this one's real pretty I mean the buds are not that big but damn what they make for up torn sizes just coated with resin there it is Afghan Kush special looks the great this one I hear is rainbow sherbert she's coming into her own back here we have tall phenotype of OG Kush that looks pretty good to swivel around another rainbow schubert about five feet tall and if I turn around again here's a short while what was the short phenotype emoji looks alright not as frosty as the other ones and then see if we can get a focus on pineapple chunk no more come on anyway this one's more wispy and airy and not as frosty as the other so yeah but that's it these are the six and flower let me back up here and that's pretty much it so I'm gonna cut this video off now there's fine not much more to see anyway and I know y'all hate long video so rate comment subscribe and let me know your comments what you think about me starting like a firearm chalice something you know show off my antique firearms and all the modern ones I get and mind you I am in California so we do have that the band coming up on assault rifles ooh evil anyway so it tends to that I'll let y'all know in the future if I'm gonna do that and I may just [ __ ] do it and show my face and all better stuff since this will all be gone so", "FLMvb1F4RQI": "what's going on guys back here with the grow tent and we are on day i think it's day 27 or 28 flower so we're just starting week four flower and as you can see the buds are popping out everywhere on these plants and we're getting really really nice bud development going on the note spacing is really close together so i'm expecting some nice big colas and we just got so many tops and all these plants guys so now they're about halfway through flower on week four i want once you guys start guessing what you guys think the total harvest is going to be on these three monsters so there's going to be a contest and that's only for anybody in canada because i can't ship the winner cannabis to the united states so the person who guesses the total harvest of all three of these plants the closest in canada will receive a nice goodie bag of the flower in the mail so yeah guys we're on day 27 i think it is so just at the end of week three just starting week four flower now and just looks so beautiful guys look at that wow just uh did some defoliation as you can see a bunch of leaves in the ground there taking off all the yellow leaves and all the weak leaves everything's looking bomb so we're gonna start feeding here already mixed up the nutrients as you can see there's growth all the way to the bottom just like to water them all nice and evenly we're still giving them the advanced nutrients michael growing bloom i'm giving them about full full strength now on the micro growing bloom so they're gonna start stacking up the colas really heavy these next few weeks man i just love the sound of the water just going out there let me asmr that sound guys just a just a beautiful sound oh yeah these buds are definitely gonna love the nutrients they're getting they're like feed me feed me so yeah now the sites are developed but they're all going to start stacking on weight now so this is a crucial time with the nutrients to be giving them you know the right amount of nutrients you don't want to be skimping out at this point or your final harvest is going to be poor almost done feeding here and then i'll get these plants back in the tent so you guys can get a nice look under the lights the temperature is starting to drop here where i live so now uh i'm getting a good uh temperature range it's sitting at about 77 78 degrees fahrenheit max when the lights are on all right let's get these bad boys back in there and we'll show you what it's looking like it's one of the monsters in there i like to rotate them too each time so they get nice equal lighting and nice even growth i have to make the best with these leds they're low heat but the intensity is a lot lower than high pressure sodium lights or anything like that so that's two of the monsters in there we have two of the monsters in there now look at that guys they're stacking up nice it's time to put on some weight on these colas they are so heavy when after feeding seven gallon pots they probably weigh like 15 or 20 pounds at least i would think all right guys full just the bench lights on here so you can see it better so yeah guys we're stacking up super nice here got growth all everywhere on the plants that's probably gonna be our thumbnail right here just nice growth everywhere are these plants guys so yeah i'm just gonna wait and see how they stack up these next few weeks gonna be crucial to for the size they put on so stay tuned for that if you guys have any questions or comments leave a comment below hit the thumbs up subscribe if you already haven't and stay tuned for updates guys and see how massive these plants start stacking up these next few weeks it's gonna be pretty interesting to see i might throw another supplementary light in there for the last few weeks so we'll see but so far the one aglix is killing it one aglix 2000 w which is 408 watts at full power in this 4x4 so so yeah guys if you guys are interested in the giveaway and you guys are in located in canada as the videos progress you can you can save your guests all the way up until harvest day so you don't need to guess now but uh the person who's closest to the total harvest dry weight will receive a nice uh sample bag of this flower so stay tuned for that guys it's time to give back to the cannabis community appreciate all the people who are subscribed everybody's been hitting the thumbs up it means a lot it's definitely been helping me in the youtube algorithms getting people interested in watching my content and we just hit over a thousand subscribers now i think we're like 1200 subscribers which is pretty awesome man would not have thought i would have that many subscribers like a year ago when i started this thing so i appreciate that anyways guys that's it for today this is the update starting week four flower with the afghan kush peace out guys", "TvfqPOYjoNk": "well the finished product i don't think it came out as good as i was hoping kind of puckered here but it's pretty i did a little scalloped edge so that's that on to the next project have a great weekend everyone", "geHvPJb5iDQ": "hello and happy Saturday this is another quick upload from my a toe to grow we're coming back at you with the purple cross righto we're about 14 days from seed we're looking nice and healthy and we definitely don't have any complaints of the then she's taking her sweet time I guess no complaints no patient I'm really looking forward to seeing what this lady has a store we did start with the Mars 200 300 watt LED about 28 inches above the canopy or I should say the seedling we did drop it down to about 25 and 24 inches once it started getting a little bit bigger and I just dropped it down to 20 inches this afternoon we will eventually move it to 18 but you know we'll wait a little while wait for it to get a little bit bigger I think today is going to be the first day she gets introduced to the grow Science organics grow newts these auto flowers they move along very quickly but if it's anything to learn for my last gorilla glue Auto flower grow and there were than cheese canes in the Alaskan purple they move quick before you know it the flower on you so we'll start early we definitely won't give them as much nutrients as we normally do in the event period but it's definitely time to start because before you know we're switching over to the blue newts so with that said start mixing it up [Music] you folks stuff right there all right new to mixed nice and diluted I had just give just a tiny bit just enough to soak the roots really all you want don't overwater it I'd only give it too much excuse me the super super well do another upload in a few days see what these babies are looking like but yeah I mean for my last couple bros i'm using this group growth or science organics they loved it I mean they were just the colors they're just so vibrant nice dark green didn't start fading into the lake flower I was very very impressed so yeah that's about it for this upload hopefully nothing a week or so you know well I started see what this plants gonna start looking like maybe 21 days or so at that point hopefully she starts uh really turning away here because I am looking forward to at least top of this playing a couple times to see what yes do anyway joy the rest of your Saturday look forward to bringing the other uploads too", "PMUyggM7iLc": "hard rock emerged in the late 60s and one of the most prominent bands in this revolution Iraq was deep purple their importance for the hard rock scene is undisputable Lord Ulrich from Metallica has said they have probably been the primary musical back bone in my body ever since I first heard them when I was nine years old Lars and Metallica now they are here to read your citation please welcome drummer Ian Paice and bass player Roger Glover from legendary deep purple [Music] thank you very much thank you - too much it'll go to our heads your Majesties your Royal Highnesses excellencies ladies and gentlemen and musicians in the early 80s we were kind of riding high during a big festival in England festivals were fairly new at that point and the idea of having lots of people getting together and enjoying music was you know I know Woodstock had done it but still in England it was a new thing and I heard this band backstage that what they were onstage I was backstage and I thought who's this Metallica I'd heard the name didn't know anything about them and I went on the side of the stage to have a look and a film and there's something happening here I'll tell you why because the audience were seeing every word they say and that's what impressed me when you touch that many people with your music there's something special going on and Lars paid us the great respect of doing a wonderful speech for us couple years ago and it's now our turn to repay the honor what a band what a band they are you got something to say I have the official thing here that remember in New York last gave it to us for about 25 minutes and I didn't know when he was going to stop but it was glorious and we do thank you for that anyway here we go to the real stuff the 2018 polar Music Prize is awarded to American band Metallica not since Vargas emotional turmoil and Tchaikovsky's cannons which I loved as anyone created music was so physical and furious and yet so accessible through virtuoso ensemble playing and issues of extremely accelerated tempos Metallica has taken rock music to places that it never been before in Metallica's world both a teenage bedroom and a concert hall can be transformed into a veritable Valhalla the

everyone it's me Darlene I am here tonight with a new crochet series I am going to show you how to make these blocks that look like log cabin quilt blocks huh pretty cool huh I have four designs that I came up with and this video will show you block number one I think this is actually block number one and then I will have the other blocks coming up the video tonight is kind of long because I try to explain as I go you know what we're doing how to tie the ends and all that stuff this is very basic just single crochet but I will have linked down below and on the end screen and in the pinned comment basic single crochet tutorial and even one more basic just showing you how to make a slipknot in a chain if that's where you need to start I also show you just one way to take care of the ends that we have normally I like to take care of my ends as I go I like to crochet over them but I didn't do that for this tutorial it was rough getting back to the swing of recording for crochet but I'm back with it and I hope to continue with it I will still be doing quilts tops sewing and crochet a lot of you asked me about knitting but I don't know how I would record that because I knit with one of the knitting needles under my arm and I have my both hands-free and I would just need some kind of overhead camera mount which I don't have if I can't ever get that I would love to do knitting videos because I love to knit too so just sit back and watch block number one you might want a piece of paper so you can jot down how many stitches are in each section so that might come in handy I don't have any written instructions for this I tried my hand at that and it was a lot of work too much for me to take on right now but it's something I'm working on for future crochet videos no promises but you know have a piece of paper and jot down notes as you watch the video and then when you attempt the first block he just put the video on and pause at the end of each step so you can get caught up and that's the way it works the videos for block number 2 3 & 4 will be quick and then there will be a final video showing you how to put these blocks together I'm only making 12 it's going to be a very small Afghan for the sake of the tutorial but you can make as many blocks as you want to make whatever size Afghan you need so just stick around and I hope you enjoy the tutorial today we will be working on block 1 this block starts with a piece that is ten stitches across and ten rows up and then we work around it so I will be making one with you right now I will be using the same pattern but different colors I'm just using regular four ply yarn like Red Heart yarn I'm actually just using scraps that I have and I'm using a size ten and a half or K hook I made my Slipknot and I am going to chain eleven if you need a video on how to make the Slipknot and the chain and single crochet I have a video for that in the description box under this video now we are going to work 10 single crochet so we go into our chain pull through yarn over pull through two and we're just going to do that all the way across chain one and we're going to turn now we're going to go back with single crochet and we're going to do ten rows you're going to chain one and turn at the end of every row so I'm just going to continue until I have ten rows and then I will show you what that looks like I completed my ten rows and it's very easy to count rows with single crochet let me take my hook out each ridge is two rows and you can see the ridge is really really good so there's two four six 8:10 and I know I'm right because we're going to have our beginning tail and our ending tail on opposite corners so that lets us know that we have an even amount of rows here now we're going to be picking up another color and we're going to be crocheting on the side and that's again very easy with single crochet I'm going to go ahead and use a cream color so there'll be a nice contrast for you now instead of doing a chain one with my purple and turning like we normally do I'm going to chain one with the cream color so I'm just going to pull that through and we're not turning we're not turning around and going back in this direction we're keeping the right side facing if you need to mark this you can put a little pin or something so you know that this is the right side the right side when you're starting your beginning tail is at the bottom right and your ending tail is at the top left we're going to turn this now let's look first at these stitches the easiest thing to see is what I call of the bumps there's a bump here cause a bump here here and here now remember we just did ten rows so we want to pick up ten stitches going across so each Ridge is going to get two stitches that bump that I pointed out is a good one because it's pretty easy to see the other thing that's pretty easy is what I call the bar it doesn't really matter where you pick up your stitches as long as you keep it as evenly spaced as possible so let's look here it's kind of easy here is the bar here is the bump right here on the top here's the bar here's the bump so if you go bar bump bar bump bar bump all the way across then you will have two stitches on each Ridge and one Ridge is two rows so it's a little bit hardest to see sometimes at the beginning but I'm just going to go here and single crochet now I'm gonna find my bump it's right there single crochet here's my bar single crochet and my bump single crochet two ridges that's four rows and I have four stitches so we're good well then I keep going Bar bump and sometimes the little bumps can be tight but you just deal with it well here's my bar and the last bump is this guy right here at the end whoops right there okay that's actually one row but I'm calling this the pickup row and it's not going to factor in when we continue you'll see what I mean but that is indeed one row I'm calling it the pickup row we're going to chain one and turn now we're going to work for rows and we know we have ten across I'm going to chain one and turn at the end of every row and I will be back when I am done my additional four rows and this is what we have so you can see it's just like working log cabin style we started this way now we turned we went this way and now we're going to be working on this side so let's look at what we have we have this pickup row that's really row number one we're not concerned with that one let's look at our ridges we have one two ridges so we know we have four rows plus that pickup row but we're concerned with the four rows that we completed after the pickup row so when we turn we want four stitches in the cream color and then this piece we know we have ten so we're going to do ten across so we're going to pick up four here and 10 here and that will give us a total of 14 stitches I just need another color I'm going with this yellow and this is actually a different kind of yarn is it three ply it might be four ply I think it's four apply but it's it's finer and that's okay this is scrappy so I'm going with it all right right here I am going to chain with my new color and we're going to start working in that direction so I want four stitches in the cream I want two stitches per Ridge and there I go going into the bar and the bump is right there there's my four stitches now don't worry about this leap here over to the purple but do try to find your original chain it can be hard because that was the foundation piece of this block so you can count one two three four five six seven eight nine ten this is the guy I want to go in right there we're going to do ten single crochet across chain one and turn now if you wanted to you can not your ends and weave as you go but I think for the sake of this tutorial I'm just going to leave the ends loose and then I'll show you how to tie and weave them in after so we know we did four and ten so that is 14 total and we are going to work six rows in addition to this pickup row so six more rows so when we're done we will have three nice ridges on the right side and I will see you when we get there okay so we just did six rows so we're going to be picking up six stitches two per Ridge and then here we know we did ten rows and we can even count to four six eight ten so we're going to be picking up ten stitches here so that's a total of sixteen it's going to use this blue I'm going to chain one come on right there I don't know what that sound is outside I don't know if you can hear that it's weird like something's being dragged across a road or something okay here's my bar and here's my bump my bar and my bump I'm going to be calling these sections so this is section 1 section 2 section 3 and now we're working on section 4 this yarn was a little bit thinner so it's a little bit harder to get my hook under there if you have a hard time you know putting your hook under the bump you can always have a smaller hook available just to get in that bump and pull the yarn through but you shouldn't really have any trouble ok now that's my 6 now we have to do 2 4 6 8 10 we have to do 10 stitches so I'm just going to go here as my bar very hard to crochet with a camera I have a tripod and everything right here between me and my hands 2 3 there's a tough bump right there as soon as you can just pull it up with your fingers 4 yep and there's my last bump chain 1 turn and for section 4 we are going to be making only 2 rows so 2 additional rows and I'll meet you when we are done I am done we have two rows which makes just like one Ridge Plus that little pickup row down here now we're going to go this way so we have two rows here so we need to pick up two stitches here this is the top of our original piece which is ten across and then we have four rows here because I can see two ridges so two four so we're going to pick up four stitches there and I'm going to take this green and do my chain okay I'm going to just go under here for my first stitch and under my bump and there's two and that's all we need for there now we want ten across our starting color eight nine and ten and now we need to pick up four here now you can see it depends on which edge you are on like if it was the right edge or the left edge because it's a little bit different so you can see here I have a choice of bars there's one here in the front and there's one here in the back when I have that option I take the back one so this is my bar here's my bump my bar and my a bump chain 1 and turn we're going to work six rows and there should be ten eleven twelve sixteen stitches in all and I'll just see you when we're done we just did this and now we are turning this way and we will be working on section number 6 we have 6 rows here we have ten across and we have six rows so we will pick up six ten and six and I'm going to use some maroon I actually wanted to repeat this color or this color I like to repeat in the same block but I'm really down at the end of these scraps so I don't have enough of either of those colors I don't think to do the four rows that we are about to do so I'm going with something that I know I have enough of there's my chain now we want to pick up six which is all about the bars and the bumps that bump is up hidden a little bit there we go okay now I'm going to do ten across and I'm doing six is my bar and if I bump I had to work at that one chain one and turn and we are going to work for additional rows should have 22 stitches and I will meet you at the end you can just push pause get your rows done and then come back my lighting my natural lighting is changing so you know if things look different that's why okay I just did my four rows so we're ready to work on section seven we're going to turn we're going to want to pick up four stitches here fourteen stitches here and then two stitches here let me get a color alright I went ahead and changed the settings you know it's funny I have automatic settings on this camera but it never changes automatically it seems like it should adjust as my natural lighting goes away right there's my chain one and I'm just using some red and I'm going to go ahead off-camera because it's getting hard to handle this with the camera in my way so I am just going to do what we have been doing I am going to pick up four stitches here because we have four rows I will pick up 14 stitches here and then two stitches here and then I'll see you at the end okay I'm at the end I did my chain one we're going to turn and now it is 20 stitches across and we are only going to do two additional rows so push pause do your two rows and I'll see you when we are done we are done section seven we are turning of this way now we are going to be picking up two stitches here sixteen stitches here and then six stitches here and I'm going with the yellow I'm going to repeat this yellow and I like it when I repeat that it's in different directions so this is going this way and then the yellow will go this way you do whatever you want I'm not concerned at all about you know the design of these blocks there scrappy and it all works pick up to here and then sixteen and then six and I'll see you when I'm at the end and I will chain one and turn now we have 24 stitches to work on and we are going to complete two additional rows so we will have one Ridge on the right side and I'll see you when we are there we just finished Section eight we are working on section nine going this way I'm going to use eight purple that I just grabbed ooh I didn't even realize I started with purple so that'll be pretty there okay we're going to do two stitches sixteen stitches four stitches that will be a total of 22 stitches crocheting this way is getting very frustrating I have to have a better setup okay I'm going to do two sixteen four way over here and you do the same starting with two this soft yellow yarn I have a hard time with the bumps it's over we did it now I will do sixteen across and then we have those four stitches at the end in that other color push pause do the same and we'll meet again when we're done right I did my chain one I'm going to turn we should have twenty two stitches across and we want to do just two additional rows see you when we get there we are done section number nine on to Section ten we are going to be picking up two stitches 22 stitches then two stitches I'm going with cream again I know I need two stitches here how do I know that because I have just two rows how do I know it's two rows because it's just one Ridge 22 stitches here how do I know that I counted and how do you know for sure because you also counted I bet you didn't ok I'm going to work all of that and then I'll have two more stitches and I'll see you at the end I picked up all 26 stitches chain one turn and we are doing again just two additional rows and I'll see you when we are done we just completed section ten and now we are going to work on section 11 we need two stitches here because there's just two rows then we have 20 across and then two at the end chain I will pick up two stitches 20 stitches and then two stitches for a total of 24 stitches and I'll see you at the end and I will chain one and turn now I'll be working two additional rows and we have a total of 24 stitches hit pause get your rows done and we'll meet at the end that's it for section 11 we are going on to section 12 we will be doing two stitches 24 stitches and then two more stitches for a total of 28 stitches so I will get another color I will pick up 28 stitches and I'll see you at the end here I did my chain one we are turning and we are going to complete six additional rows and as I said you should have 28 stitches across so push pause do 6 more rows and I'll meet you at the end we're getting there we only have two more sections to go and we will be done we just worked on section number 12 we did 6 rose in addition to our pickup robe we are going to turn and we are going to pick up six stitches 22 stitches and then two stitches for a total of 30 I will get a color and I'll meet you when I'm down here I'm at the end chained one I will turn and now I will do an additional four rows and we have 30 stitches across and I'll see you when we're done we just finished Section 13 we did four rows in addition to our pick up row it looks like this we are turning and we are doing our last section section 14 and we only need two rows and we are going to be picking up four stitches 26 stitches and then two stitches and that will be a total of 32 stitches I'll see you when we're here I'm at the end chain one and turn now we're going to work just two additional rows on these 32 stitches so exciting we're almost done push pause get your other two rows done and I'll meet you at the end and we are done and all I do at the end is I just take my yarn and pull it through so this is what we have now what the deal is we end up with either 32 stitches or what would be 32 stitches on every edge so don't worry if your block doesn't look square if it looks a little bit more rectangular some of that is just an optical illusion because of the way we are going around and but you should have 32 stitches on each edge now this edge we just did so we have 32 stitches but now on this edge we have 24 here that we can count and then we have 2 here because we know this is just 1 Ridge so that's 2 rows then we have 6 here because we have three ridges so we know we need 6 stitches here so we know we have 24 26 28 30 32 here we have 28 plus 4 is 32 here we have 30 plus 2 is 32 so when we put these together whether they look square or not they're going to match up now I want to show you how you can get rid of all these pesky ends there are many ways to handle this you could have done it as you go some people like to tie a knot and then just trim or a magic knot and trim I'm telling you I know people say oh the magic not never comes apart but if you don't do it exactly right it comes apart I like a good old fashioned not so I'm just taking two that are together and I'm going to tie a knot like a square knot any kind of knot like that I usually do it with a crochet hook and that's when a smaller hook comes in handy I just go under my stitches and pull that through I just usually pick whatever looks like a good place pull it through and you just do that or you can take a big yarn needle and just you know thread the yarn needle and then push the needle through and you can do that so you just do that to all your ends let me just get this one I like to do it you know probably a couple of inches so like that and then I snip kind of close and you just tug a little bit and it it just finds its way home you could make as many blocks as you want like this oh let's measure this is approximately 12 inches square that's a nice sized block of course if you use a different kind of yarn or a different size hook or you crochet tighter than I do or more loose than I do it's gonna vary but you should still at least come out with something that is pretty much a square shape and that's all you care about once you make one you know what size your block is going to be and then you can just figure out how many you need in total for your Afghan now for this video I am making just a tiny tiny Afghan it'll be a lap Afghan or it could go to a small child I'm only making 12 total I have four different blocks that I will show you and I'm making only three of each so this is block number one block number two is the same like log cabin style but we're going to be starting with a different size Center so it makes the whole entire block a little bit different so I do hope that you like this I think it's super cool I haven't put any of my blocks together yet I'll be doing that in the final episode so do stay tuned for episode 2 make sure you subscribe and if you're watching this in the future well then there will be a playlist down below in the description and in the pinned comment and most likely on the end screen so you'll be able to see the whole series and get caught up thank you so much for watching and I'll be back with my soon bye you", "Z6gcfUbT0pc": "hi guys and welcome to hooked for life with Marybeth temple in this video I want to take a very quick look at the surface crochet embellishment for the purple plaid throw now these blocks are stitched in big color-block sections and then this this little stripe is added on after in surface crochet now because I didn't want the loops of the surface crochet all oriented in the same direction it's a nitpicky little detail but as you know if you do my patterns nitpicky little details are my thing I wanted it to look the same whether it was upside down right side out left right however it was oriented so instead of doing one vertical line here and horizontal line there I have done a vertical line to the center point and then zippity-doo-dah off to the right for the horizontal line then I'm gonna flip the work and do the same thing horizontal line to the center or a vertical line to the center and then horizontal line off to the side and again the reason I did that is to make sure that it mirrors so here's how you start the vertical lines now this pattern and a lot of patterns that use surface crochet on a vertical line I have chain 1 spaces here it just makes the verticals a little neater than trying to do it in the top of a stitch because as you may know if you're really really nitpicky like me single crochets don't line up perfectly they offset just the least little bit and your surface crochet will do the same thing if you go straight up so this pattern calls for doing your verticals in a chain one space so I'm going to start with a slipknot on my hook and I'm going to make sure to carry the working yarn underneath the work so there's my first chain one space I'm going to insert the hook yarn over pull it through yarn over pull it or I'll nut yarn over and then pull it right through the stitch so all I need to do this is very simple all I need to do is keep the working yarn under you'll get into a rhythm and then just work all the way up you don't want to pull it too tight because it will affect the height of the work and of course you don't want it to be too loose because you don't want it to stay up and pull so let's go just a little bit farther now let's take a look at the other side of the work all you get is this nice straight line and I can weave my tail into that line later so I'm going to go ahead and go up to the center point and then show you how to work the horizontals now to do the horizontals I am going to I got as far as I needed to get and then I'm going to turn the work 90 degrees counterclockwise so I can head off in the other direction now so far as working in this direction goes I don't need chain one spaces to keep the line straight because no matter whether you're looking at the wrong side of the stitch or the right side of the stitch if you're working in the top of the stitches it's going to be perfectly even so 1 2 3 4 I'm going to work here I'm working in essentially the tops of the stitches of the fourth row of the eighth rows that are in the same color so once again my yarn is underneath and I'm working working working across but again I'm not looking for chain one space is there anything else crazy because I'm going to get a perfectly straight line by working in the top row the top of the row in the stitch where that you know the next row of single crochets is already in there but there's plenty of room this particular pattern is made with with love from red heart and it is a worsted weight yarn with a size J hook I'm using my hook from my Denise needle sets because I use that for pretty much everything and then when I get to the end let me see if I have some scissors and of course I don't all I need to do now is cut the yarn pull it through and then it off so there's my first section of the surface crochet and now I'm going to turn it 180 degrees start here go to the center and off in the other direction that will give me my cross but it will orient the Lu of the surface crochet so that it is perfectly mirrored thanks so much for joining me here on hooked for life with Mary Beth temple please consider subscribing to the channel for more interesting crochet knit and crafts videos thanks for joining us we look forward to seeing you again real soon", "85NpjI22-ws": "hello everyone this is Glenda and welcome back to my channel creative grandma today's video tutorial is going to be for the easiest homespun Afghan ever this Afghan pattern is two completely different looking Afghans you can either make the plain version which I show you further along in this video so if you want to jump ahead you can see that simple Afghan where it's a more lacy look where you're just doing that background or you can do the finished version where we're weaving in strips and making this beautiful weaved Afghan so if you want to see the other version just go ahead and jump ahead into the video where when I get done with the pattern repeat then I show you the basic Afghan before we weave in the strip's this Afghan is gorgeous either way you make it so let's get started and I'll tell you everything you need to get started so for this project today I'm going to give you three different material lists because again there's three different ways that you can make this Afghan the first way is like I show in the middle of the video where you can make this Afghan without these strips in it and it has a nice open mesh work very lacy beautiful design so if you want to make it with just this background color then you're going to need nine skeins of the color of your choice and that is without a border so for this Afghan I chose the homespun and this is color number three one one I believe it's called rokoko it's a tannish brown very beautiful for the fall season and that is this color here that I used in the background so if you want to make the really easiest Afghan ever with no border then you're going to need nine skeins of whatever color you want for the background now if you want to make the easiest Afghan ever without the strips and you want to add the border then you need two additional skeins for a total of eleven skeins of the background color so if you want to make the Afghan the way it looks here where it's completely weaved in with the strips then you're going to need nine skeins of a background color and you're going to need an additional five skeins of a multi color now this color here that I used is color number three one five Tudor very beautiful coordinating color with the background color and that five skeins is used to make your strips and to put the border on in the multi color and you're also going to need a size ten and a half K or six point five millimeter crochet hook you're also going to need a yarn needle to weave in all those ends of those strips once we get the Afghan finished so let's get started to begin I already attached my yarn to my hook I used a double knot you can use whichever method you prefer and we're going to begin and chain 125 you're going to yarn over the hook pull it through the loop on your hook and this creates your first chain the loop on your hook does not count as a chain you're going to yarn over and pull through that's two yarn over pull through that's three yarn over pull through that's four continue until you have a chain with 125 chains I'm going to finish my chain and I'll be back and we'll start Row one I have my chain with 125 chains made and now we're getting ready to begin Row one so let me zoom back up now when you're working with the homespun the first row you really have to pay attention when you're working in these chains because it is a textured yarn you just have to look at those chains and you can see when you your hook you can see that the holes open up for each chain so let me try to grab this chain just show what I mean when you're looking at your work some of the chains will have two loops in it you just have to look at your your chain and see here's my next chain here's my next chain where that hole is and just use your hook to poke through the chains and you can see where they are I hope you can see what I'm trying to say because I don't usually use the textured yarn you can just see where the chains open up by using your fingers too as well and you can just open them up so you can just look at those chains so let's begin we're going to start and we're going to skip the first three chain we're going to work a double crochet into that fourth chain from hook yarn over the hook you're going to skip one two three insert into that fourth chain work a double crochet yarn over pull through that chain you have three loops on your hook yarn over pull through two loops only yarn over and pull through two loops only you're going to work a double crochet into the next chain and again if you're not sure where the chain is you see your stitches in this chain here take your hook and put it through the next hole and that opens up your next chain yarn over the hook insert into that next chain yarn over pull through that chain yarn over pull through two yarn over and pull through two you just made a double crochet we're going to continue working one double crochet in each chain across again if you're not sure where your stitches take your hook find that next opening open it up with your hook before you make your stitch that way you'll have your right stitch placement yarn over the hook insert into that next chain work a double crochet yarn over the hook find your next chain insert into that next chain work a double crochet yarn over the hook find your next chain insert into that chain work a double crochet continue and work one double crochet in each chain across and I will meet you at the end of Row one I'm over at the end of Row one I worked my last double crochet into that last chain and you should have one double crochet in each chain across your row so when you look at your work one double crochet should be in each chain and you should have a total of 123 double crochet across your row so your base row is finished row one and now we're going to start row two rows two and Row three will be our repeat rows for the pattern again this is a super easy pattern now we're ready to begin row two to begin row two we're going to start with the chain two one and two you're going to turn your work now this beginning chain two is going to count as our first double crochet most of the time you do a chain three but a chain three will be too high so we're only going to chain two so that chain two counts as the first stitch you can see how it lines up with the first stitch and now we're going to work a double crochet into the top of the next stitch yarn over the hook insert into the top of the next stitch work a double crochet so when you look at your work the chain two counts as the first double crochet and then you worked a double crochet into the next stitch so we're starting the row with two double crochet stitches so now we're getting ready to start our repeat so if you need help click back on the video to where I say this is the start of the repeat and you're going to work until I say this is the end of the repeat and we're going to work across to within the last stitch so let's begin you're going to chain one you're going to skip that next stitch you can see your stitches here just pull your work apart you're going to skip that next double crochet stitch and you're going to work a double crochet into the next stitch yarn over the hook skip that next double crochet insert into the next stitch work a double crochet and that is the end of the repeat so let's do it again you're going to chain one you're going to yarn over skip the next stitch insert into the next and work a double crochet that is the end of the repeat I'm going to do it a couple more times with you again the start of the repeat you're going to chain one yarn over skip the next stitch insert into the next stitch work a double crochet that is the end of the repeat I'm going to do it one more time again this is the start of the repeat chain one yarn over skip that next stitch insert into the next stitch work a double crochet and what we're doing is creating little open boxes across the row so go ahead and repeat you're going to chain one yarn over skip the next stitch insert into the next stitch work a double crochet repeat that across until you get to the end of your row to your turning chain do not work in the turning chain and I'll meet you there and show you how to finish the row so I'm over at the end of Row 2 I worked my last double crochet into that last double crochet stitch and then we have our chain 3 turning chain and these are the three chain that we skipped when we started Row 1 so you're going to work a double crochet into the top chain of that ending turning chain 3 you're going to yarn over insert right into the top of that turning chain work a double crochet so you're ending with two double crochet we started the row with two double crochet and we end the row with two double crochet so when you're looking at your work you can see that you have that double crochet chain 1 skip the stitch and you repeated that down your row to the end of the row so again let me find the beginning of my row here we started with the chain 2 double crochet so we started with two double crochet we worked a repeat across the row and when you get to the end of the row again you ended with those two double crochet so now we're getting ready to start row 3 which is the last row of our repeat rows so we're going to begin with the chain two one two you're going to turn your work again that beginning chain two counts as the first stitch so when you're looking at your work you can see how it lines right up with that first stitch we're going to yarn over insert into that neck stitch and work a double crochet for Row three we're going to work one double crochet in each chain one space and each double crochet across the row until you get to your ending chain - so let's begin yarn over insert into that next chain one space you're going underneath the chain one and right out through the back yarn over pull it back through that space work your double crochet and you're working right around the chain one space you're not working in it you're working underneath and around yarn over insert into the top of that next double crochet stitch and work a double crochet you're going to yarn over insert underneath the chain one into that space and out through the back yarn over pull through that space yarn over pull through two yarn over and pull through two yarn over insert into the top of that next double crochet and work a double crochet so again this is the repeat you're going to yarn over insert your hook underneath from front to back underneath that next chain one space work a double crochet yarn over insert into the top of the next double crochet and work a double crochet and that is the end of the repeat so go ahead and continue work one double crochet underneath and around the next chain one space work one double crochet into the next double crochet repeat across until you get to your ending turning chain two and I'll meet you there I'm over at the end of row three I just worked my double crochet into the last double crochet across and then we're over to that ending chain two of our turning chain so we're going to yarn over you're going to insert your hook right into the top of that ending chain two just see here's your stitch and go right into the chain beside it at the top and work your double crochet and that is the end of Row three so when you look at your work you can see your first row is solid double crochets working one double crochet in each stitch and then your second row you have that open mesh work and then the third row we're working solid double crochets across so for this pattern you're going to repeat rows two and Row three until you get a total of 89 complete rows finished so at the end of Row 89 you will fasten off now 89 will be a solid double crochet row so you're going to start with that solid double crochet row you're going to work the pattern up and then you will end with that double crochet row so go ahead and repeat rows 2 & 3 until you have a total of 89 rows completed and I'll meet you there now remember this is very easy to count your rows because you're going to have that open mesh row right in between so very easy to count 1 2 3 and so on to the end so I'll be right back when I'm at the end of row 89 and show you my work I'm back I'm over at the end of row 89 it's quite large I'm going to just show you here is the pattern very simple pattern I'm going to move to a different room and throw this basic background Afghan over a chair so you can see it a little bit better of how it would look for your home decor so let me go do that and I'll be right back so you can get a better look at the Afghan so this is what the Afghan looks like just the basic background if you don't want to make it fancier with the chain strips so if this is what you prefer the quick and easy simple version then you would skip making the strips and you would jump ahead in the video and go right to where we're putting the border on the Afghan now remember when you're watching the video and you're putting the border on when you're going in those row end stitches you will not be going in to the end of the strip you'll just be going in to the end of the row end stitches so I'll explain all that in the video when I do the border so if you're going to make the fancier version where we're using the chain strips and weaving them through the chain mesh rows then let's jump right into it and I'll start showing you how to make those chain strips and once we get our chain strips made then we're going to weave them in and do our border and you're done so two Afghans with one pattern so let's get started so now since our background is done we're getting ready to make our chain string so again I'm using this beautiful multicolored and this cream color brownish color here matches up nicely with that brown we use just a nice subtle changes of color for in this mesh weaves space here of the rose so to begin your strips you're going to take your contrasting color in this case it's three one five Tudor I already tied my yarn around my hook and again I just used a double knot so to make our chain strips we're going to chain 135 you're going to yarn over your hook pull through the loop on your hook and that creates your first chain the chain on your hook does not count as a chain yarn over pull through and you can do it loosely if you prefer yarn over pull it through that's three yarn over pull through that's four continue until you have a chain with 135 chains and I'll be back when I get my chain made I'm back I have my chain it has 135 chains so a little bit long of a chain to get in the viewfinder so now what you're going to do is once you make the chain 135 you're just going to clip your yarn you're going to fasten off and you're just going to take your hook and just pull your hook out and just tug and that will create a secure knot so that's all there is to making your chain strips you just chain 135 and fasten off now all you have to do is make a total of 44 chain strips of 135 chains so this is a good project to do while you're watching TV they work up pretty quickly so I'm going to go ahead and make the rest of my strips again you need a total of 44 of these strips that have a hundred and thirty-five chains so go ahead and make the rest of your chain strips and I'll be back when I get mine made and I'll show you how to weave them through the mesh rows I'm back I have my Afghan on the table I'm getting ready to start weaving my strips in when you look you're going to have a big pile of all these strips so what you have to consider when you're weaving your strips in is when you're pulling your strips out now here's the purple one here's a purple one try not to use the same color after the next color so if you use a purple then look through your strips and maybe here's a brown with some green that might be my next one and then here is maybe a pink with brown so kind of sort through oops I just tied a knot in this one so try to sort through your strips and make sure that you're not putting a lot of the same color next to each other just pull out a different color as you're weaving these ends so let me get this set up I'm going to move it a little bit closer so you can see a little better of what I'm doing now Row 1 is the right side of your work so have your Afghan with the right side facing now I'm not sure if you're left-handed if you start on the left side I'm right-handed so I'm going to start right over in the right hand corner of this first mesh row where you have your open spaces here so you're starting in Row 2 so I'm going to zoom up so I'm going to start with my purple strip and what you want to do is it doesn't matter which end you choose one end or another it really doesn't matter you're going to come over to that first row and mesh and you're going to come from underneath the bottom you're going to take your strip and go underneath those first two double crochet stitches let me see if I can zoom up just a little bit more so when you're looking at your work here's Row 2 this is the row we're going to start in we're working in these mesh rows 2 4 6 every even row and again you're going to take the end of or chain strip you're going underneath those two beginning double crochet and you're just going to pull that strip up through that opening the first opening and then you're going to take it down through the next opening up through the next opening and if you have a long enough and you can weave your end in a yarn needle and just take it and pull it right in and out and weave it up and down through those strips is a little bit easier than what I'm showing you go down through the next and then pull up through the next so you're just going up and down through those open mesh and it's creating that weave look so I'm going to go ahead and continue putting my first strip in and then I'll be back and show you how to do your second strip so I'm back I weave my strip across that first mesh row and I'm over to the other side so when you get to the end of the row you should have your two ending double crochet and one space in one double crochet so you should end the row by taking the end of your strip over that last double crochet in from the top to the bottom down through the last space and it will be underneath the two double crochet so you started by going underneath the beginning two double crochet and you end by going underneath the bottom two double crochet now if your chain is a little long now I have that much extra what we do is when we do that border you're going to come in and go into that last chain and then you just adjust this and just pull it until it just fits nicely and you can just work that in until it just runs nicely across the Afghan our first strip is in let me see if I can zoom out just a little bit more so you can see how that looks so that's our first strip now we're not going to attach the ends until we do the border we're just going to let these ends hang so if they come out and get worked back as you're weaving these ends and don't worry about it all you have to do is when you come around just put them back in place and then we're going to crochet in through that ending chain to secure that strip to the Afghan when we're doing that border very simple to do I'm going to grab my next strip I think I'm going to take this blue one here and then I'm going back over to the right side of my Afghan so now the next row we're going to start by going over top of the first two stitches so it's going to be start underneath start above start underneath start above you're alternating the way the strips are going to cross your blanket now if you choose to do them all the same way that's your preference you can design this any way you want you can keep them all the same now I prefer to alternate mine so instead of starting underneath I'm going right into that first space of that next mesh row so what happens as you're weaving in then this end will be over top of those beginning two double crochet so that's one way you can tell so you don't mess up is one will be under one will be over top so let's begin our second row I have my next strip we're going to skip these two double crochet and we're going to insert from top to bottom into that first chain space so take the end of your strip and just insert it from top to bottom through that first chain space and then you're going to bring it up through the next space jump over the double crochet go down through the next space come up through the next space down through the next space up through the next and you're going to repeat that across your row so I'm going to go ahead and weave my strip across and when I get to the end I'll be back and show you what it looks like I'm back I got my second strip weaved in and I noticed that this strips a little longer than the other strip because I must have got sir with my chains so again what happens is you're just going to pull that chain back just keep it roughly right there now this one will be over the last two double crochet on top of your work and then just take that chain and loosely weave it across and just let it be nice and loose on your Afghan and you'll slowly work that right across your Afghan it might take a little while you might have to go halfway across but as you can see it's now all weave din and this is what those two rows look like so you notice we ended this one underneath the stitches this one over top the stitches and when we started we started underneath two and then we started this row over top of the two so what you're going to do is take the rest of your strips and go back to where I showed you how you started row two in that mesh and you're going to go to the next mesh row and you're going to start underneath the next one you're going to start on top of the tube double crochet so just look at your work now if this one's on top and this one's on top then you know you started in the wrong plate place so you need to go underneath and up through so grab your next strip and if you need help just click back on the video it's just easy if you look at your work like this is underneath this is on top so I know that this one has to start underneath that you're just going to pull it right up through that first space down through the next space up through the next and continue weaving your strip across now this one's almost identical color so this one might not show up as well but weed that strip and across making sure that each strip is a little bit different in color try not to run purple purple purple try to separate those colors a little bit so I'm going to go ahead and weave in all my strips and when I'm done I'll come back and show you the finished Afghan with the strips in and then all we have to do is our border I'll be right back I'm back I have all my ends weaved in and if you notice I have a lot of ends over here and we're going to fix all this when we get our border on now I do not weave in my ends right now it's up to you but I usually wait until I get my complete border around and then I come back and watch TV and just sit and weave in all my ends so this is what the Afghan looks like it's pretty big to get it all into the viewfinder but this is what it looks like when all your strips are weaved in you should have the right side facing of your Afghan this is the last row we did row 89 I believe so what we're gonna do now is we're going to start our border so I just kept it a really simple double crochet border because I'm trying to make it the easiest Afghan ever so it's just going to be basic border on this one so this is the right side facing and this is the end of row 89 where you finished off that last row so you want to go over to the right hand corner of the last row you made so that's the top of the Afghan and we're just going to go over here to the right hand corner so I'm going to zoom up and then we're going to start the first side of round one of our border so for my border I'm using the color Tudor this is color three one five it's the Lion Brand homespun it's that multi color so I'm just going to take and attach my yarn to the upper right hand corner double crochet stitch so we're going right here to the corner so we're getting ready to start round one so I'm over on the right hand side top of my Afghan right side facing and we're back to the beginning of row 89 this is the last row we worked and you're going back to that very first stitch of the row where you chain two you're going to insert your hook into the top of that beginning chain two now I'm going to leave about a six to eight inch and I'm just going to pull my new color through and we're going to start with a chain three one two and three in this beginning chain three counts as our first double crochet of the round and you can see how it matches up with that stitch below we're going to start and work one double crochet in each of the next nine double crochet stitches I'm going to be working through the top of the stitch and then underneath this piece of yarn that's left over from starting and that will weave in my end so take that extra yarn that you left from starting hold it right up against the top of your work you're going to yarn over find your next stitch very easy to find follow it to the top insert underneath the top two strands of that next stitch underneath that strand of yarn and work a double crochet that is one of nine yarn over insert into the next stitch find that stitch follow it to the top insert into the top of that stitch underneath that strand of yarn and work a double crochet that's two of nine now I'm going to continue and just count as I make my stitches yarn over insert into the next stitch work a double crochet that's three yarn over insert into the top of the next stitch work a double crochet that's four yarn over insert into the top of the next stitch work a double crochet that's five six seven eight and nine so let's double crochet two together yarn over the hook insert into the top of that next stitch yarn over pull through yarn over and pull through two you're going to leave two loops on your hook you're going to yarn over insert into the next stitch yarn over pull through you have four loops on your hook yarn over and pull through two loops only you have three loops on your hook you're going to yarn over and pull through all three loops on your hook you just decreased one stitch and double crochet two together and it just makes it so it just tightens up that border so now we're going to start our repeat our repeat is we're going to work one double crochet in each of the next ten double crochet stitches and then we're going to double crochet two together that will be our repeat and we'll repeat that across to the last three stitches so let's begin I'm just going to count my double crochet stitches and we're going to work one double crochet in each of the next ten yarn over insert into that next stitch work a double crochet that's one to three for five six seven eight 9 and ten so now we're going to decrease by one stitch and work a double crochet two together yarn over insert into the top of the next stitch yarn over and pull through yarn over and pull through two loops only yarn over insert into the top of the next stitch yarn over and pull through yarn over pull through two you have three loops on your hook yarn over and pull through all three loops on your hook and that is the end of the repeat so let me show you just one more time because I think I forgot to say this is the start of the repeat so if I did I'm sorry about that so again this is the start of the repeat for going across the first side of round one of the border we're going to start here if you need help click back on the video and start here work until I say this is the end of the repeat and you're going to repeat that process across to the last three double crochet stitches so let's begin the repeat we're going to yarn over and work one double crochet in each of the next ten stitches there's one to three for five six seven eight 9 and ten now we're going to decrease one stitch and work a double crochet two together you're going to yarn over the hook insert into the top of the next stitch yarn over and pull through you're going to yarn over and pull through two loops only you made your first double crochet leaving the last loop on the hook you keep both loops on your hook yarn over insert into that next stitch yarn over and pull through you have four loops on your hook yarn over and pull through two loops only you made your second double crochet leaving the last loop on the hook and you have three loops on your hook yarn over and pull through all three loops on your hook and you double crochet two stitches together and decrease by one stitch and that is the end of the repeat so go ahead and repeat across one double crochet in each of the next ten stitches and then you're going to double crochet 2 together and decrease by one stitch if you need help just click back on the video repeat across until you get to the last three stitches and I'll meet you there I'm over at the end of the first side of round one of our border on the top of our Afghan you can see we have three stitches remaining of this row and you ended that last repeat with double crochet two together and then you have three stitches so when you look at your work you can see it has a nice look to the top of the Afghan we decrease just a few stitches across the top and this really helps so your Afghan doesn't stretch all out of shape because you're pulling this a little bit tighter together so that's why I like to do that with certain Afghans so let's go ahead and finish the first side of round one border we're going to work one double crochet in each of the last three stitches yarn over find your next insert into the top of that stitch work a double crochet yarn over find your next stitch follow it to the top insert into the top of that stitch work a double crochet yarn over find your last stitch across you're going to insert right at the top of that stitch and work a double crochet so the first side of our border is complete now we're going to work our corner you're going to chain two one two and this helps make the transition over to working down your length so I'm going to just turn my Afghan so the length is now at the top so I'll be working down the length and here we have our first double crochet row and stitch you can see here is our stitch to the end of the row and we're just going to be working underneath and around this stitch we're going to work two double crochet into this row and stitch yarn over the hook insert into that row and stitch and work two double crochet there's one yarn over insert back into that same row and stitch and work your second double crochet now when we're working down the length this is where we're going to be securing our strip ends so what you want to do now this is the start of the repeat so if you need help you're going to click back to this portion of the video and you can just watch it from where I say this is the start of the repeat to where I say this is the end of the repeat and then you'll repeat that all the way down the link to the next corner so what we're going to do to secure our ends is one row we're going over the stitches and one row we went under the stitches so the only rows we have to adjust is the rows that end going over the stitches I'm going to just lay this down you're going to take the end of the strip that goes over the last two stitches and we're just going to push that down between the last two stitches just insert it and push it with your fingers right underneath the work so it's right between those last two stitches you need to have your chain strips underneath your work because we don't want them showing on top so what we're going to do now is we're going to work one double crochet into this next row end stitch and into that ending chain of that strip it's very easy please don't get intimidated by some of these techniques they're very easy you're going to yarn over you're going to go under that next row and stitch so if you need to just stick your fingers in there if you get confused here's the row end stitch go underneath that post of that stitch and then take the chain strip find that last chain here it is insert into that last chain and you're just going to work through both thicknesses yarn over pull through that chain pull through that row end stitch you have three loops yarn over pull through two yarn over and pull through two you just made your double crochet and you also secured that row end stitch now again we're going to have these ends and we'll weave them all in later when we're all done with our Afghan so now we're going to work two double crochet into this next row end stitch yarn over the hook insert into that next row end stitch if you're not sure just stick your fingers in there till you find it insert underneath and around the post of that stitch and work two double crochet work your second double crochet now we're over to the next row and stitch and you'll notice that this strip is already underneath the two strips so if you pulled this through again you would be at the top and we don't want that so you're going to keep this strip underneath both those stitches and we're going to work one double crochet into the row end stitch and then you're going to grab the end of that chain make sure you have the right chain and you're going to go into that last chain so yarn over the hook find that next row end stitch insert underneath the end stitch find the next chain strip insert into that ending chain of that strip working through both thicknesses you're going to work a double crochet now we're going to work two double crochet into this next row end stitch again if you need help just use your fingers find that row end stitch yarn over insert into that row end stitch and work two double crochet one yarn over insert back into that same stitch and work your second double crochet so that is the end of the repeat so we're going to do it again so this is the start of the repeat you're going to go to the next row end stitch and you'll notice that your chain strip is on top so you want to take that chain strip and push it down through the last two stitches right in between and take it underneath that last row end stitch you're going to pull that chain up and then you can just adjust this and make that so it just fits nicely across until it just lays nice you're going to yarn over the hook you're going to go underneath that next row and stitch so use your fingers find that row and stitch go underneath the post of that stitch grab your chain strip insert your hook into the last chain of that strip you're working through both thicknesses and work a double crochet and this secures that chain strip to your Afghan find your next row end stitch and we're going to work two double crochet into this row end stitch yarn over the hook insert underneath that row end stitch underneath the post work a double crochet around the post of that stitch that's one yarn over insert back into that same row and stitch and work your second double crochet find your next row end stitch and you'll notice that this change strip is already underneath your work so you're going to leave it underneath the work and you're going to keep it underneath both of those two double crochet you're going to yarn over the hook insert your hook underneath that post of that next row end stitch grab your chain strip find that last chain insert into that last chain work a double crochet through both thicknesses find your next row end stitch just use your fingers poke until you find it here it is you're going to work two double crochet into this row end stitch yarn over the hook insert underneath that row end stitch work a double crochet thats 1 yarn over the hook insert underneath and around the post of that same row end stitch and work your second double crochet and that is the end of the repeat so go ahead click back on the video repeat from where I say this is the start of the repeat until I say this is the end of the repeat and repeat that across to the next corner and I'll meet you there I work down my length I add hatched all my strips and I'm over to the next corner you should have ended with two double crochet into that last row end stitch down the length and when you look at your work if you see any spots where when you attach this to the back and it has a pretty good loop then just slowly maneuver that over until you get that worked out it may take you a while but you'll get it worked out and just work that across the Afghan so they're all laying nice and smooth so now we're down across our second side and we're getting ready to work across the foundation row so to begin we're going to chain two one two and this forms the corner and makes the transition around to the other side so I'm just going to turn my Afghan again so I'm working across the bottom of our Afghan now now with this pattern you have to remember that you worked around that first stitch that last row end stitch of the last row going down the length but this is your first stitch when you're working across the bottom so you have to remember to follow this stitch down and work a stitch into that very first chain at the base of this stitch you're going to yarn over find that row end stitch it's covered up with those stitches follow it down to the bottom of that foundation chain insert into that very first chain across and work a double crochet we're going to work one double crochet in each of the next nine double crochet stitches yarn over the hook find your next stitch follow it to the top insert into the top of that stitch and work a double crochet thats 1 yarn over find your next stitch follow it to the top insert your stitch work a double crochet so I'm just going to count my stitches that was 2 three and again if you don't know where to find the chain we're just following our crochet stitches up to the top and inserting right in the top of that stitch that's four five six seven eight and nine so we worked one double crochet right into that first stitch for one we work nine more so you should have a total of 10 2 4 6 8 and 10 double crochet stitches now we're going to double crochet 2 together and decrease by one stitch so we're really repeating what we did at the first side of our Afghan border yarn over the hook insert into the top of that next stitch yarn over pull through yarn over and pull through two loops you have two loops on your hook and they remain on your hook yarn over insert into the top of that next stitch yarn over pull through yarn over and pull through two you worked your two double crochet leaving the last loop of each stitch on your hook you have three loops yarn over and pull through all three loops on your hook you double crochet two together and you decrease by one stitch so now we're going to start the repeat if you need help you'll click back on the video to this point where I say this is the start of the repeat for the third side of round one of the border so you'll work until I say this is the end of the repeat and repeat that across to the last three stitches so let's begin we're going to work one double crochet in each of the next ten stitches so I'm just going to count as I make them there is one to three for five six seven eight 9 and ten now we're going to double crochet two together yarn over the hook insert into the top of the next stitch yarn over and pull through yarn over and pull through two loops only yarn over insert into the top of the next stitch yarn over and pull through yarn over and pull through two loops only you have your two double crochet work leaving the last loop of each stitch on the hook you have three loops yarn over and pull through all three loops on your hook you double crochet two together and you decrease by one stitch so that is the end of the repeat again you're repeating what you did on the top of the Afghan across the bottom of the Afghan so go ahead and work one double crochet in each of the next ten stitches and then you're going to work a double crochet two together to decrease by one stitch if you need help just click back on the video repeat that across to the last three stitches and I'll meet you there I'm over at the last three stitches you'll have two double crochet and your ending turning chain three so this is what it looks like going across the bottom of that foundation row and now we're getting ready to finish the third side and do our corner we're going to work one double crochet in each of the next two stitches and one double crochet right into the top chain of that turning chain so yarn over the hook insert into the next stitch work a double crochet yarn over the hook insert into the next stitch and work a double crochet yarn over the hook you're going right into that top chain right beside the last stitch made insert into the top chain work a double crochet we're going to chain two for our corner one two and then you're going to turn your work so we're working across the length you're going to start and work two double crochet into this first row end stitch yarn over the hook insert into that first row end stitch you're going underneath the the row end stitch and working around this post work your double crochet thats 1 yarn over the hook insert your hook underneath and around that row end stitch work your second double crochet now we're going to the next row end stitch where we have our chain strip now this strip is already underneath those last two double crochet so we want to make sure our strips are underneath our work and not on top so you're going to yarn over insert underneath that last row end stitch grab that chain strip insert into the last chain of that strip and work a double crochet through both thicknesses you're pulling through that chain you're pulling through underneath and around that last row and stitch and you're working that double crochet you're going to yarn over find your next row and stitch and work two double crochet around the post of that row end stitch there's one yarn over insert and work a second double crochet around the post of that end stitch now this next strip is on top of the work so you need to put it underneath that last strip so just insert it between the last two stitches so it's underneath the last row end stitch yarn over insert underneath the rope and stitch grab the end of that chain strip insert into the last chain work a double crochet through both thicknesses find your next row and stitch and you're going to work two double crochet into the next row and stitch yarn over the hook insert into that row end stitch work two double crochet one yarn over insert into that same space and work a second double crochet find your next row and stitch this row end stitch the chain strip is already underneath the work so you're just going to pull that up you're going to yarn over insert underneath the last row and stitch then grab that chain strip keep it underneath that last stitch insert into the last chain work a double crochet through both thicknesses find your next row end stitch yarn over insert into that next row end stitch and work two double crochet there's one yarn over insert back into that same row and stitch and work your second double crochet so that is the end of the repeat so if you need help go ahead and click back on the video to where I say this is the start of the repeat work until I say this is the end of the repeat and you're going to repeat that all the way down the length to the very next corner so go ahead and do your repeats and I'll meet you at the next corner I'm over at the end of round one we just completed all four sides of round one of our Afghan we have to finish and put our corner in so we're going to chain two one and two and we're going to join with a slip stitch to the top of that beginning chain three count up one two three insert into the top of that beginning chain three yarn over pull through that chain and pull through the loop on your hook round one is now the Afghans too large for me to get the whole Afghan into the viewfinder on the table so I'm just going to zoom out and show you a little bit of what your Afghans looking like you just went across all four sides you come down your length and this is what your Afghan should look like so we're going to do one more simple round of double crochet this round will be so much easier than the first round so we're just going to work one double crochet in each stitch across to that next corner chain to space and then we'll work our stitches in the corner so let's begin round two we're going to start with the chain three one two and three that beginning chain three counts as that first stitch of round two so now we're going to work one double crochet in each stitch across now with the homespun because of the way it's twisted it's hard to see those chains so the best way to do it is look for the stitch follow it to the top and you're going to insert at the top of each stitch so yarn over find your next stitch follow it up insert into the top of the stitch work a double crochet and I forgot to mention that this is the start of the repeat for all four sides so you're starting by working one double crochet in each stitch across to that next corner chained to space so if you need help click back on the video and repeat from this as the start of the repeat until I say this is the end of the repeat and then you're going to repeat that around all four sides of your Afghan so yarn over insert into the next stitch work a double crochet yarn over find your next stitch again just follow it right up the stitch to the top insert work a double crochet yarn-over find your next stitch follow it to the top insert into the top of the stitch work a double crochet work one double crochet in each stitch across to the next corner chained to space and I'll meet you there I'm over at my corner chained to space and now we're going to work five double crochet into our corner chain to space you're going to yarn over insert into that corner chain two and work five double crochet there's one two three four and five and that is the end of the repeat so now what you're going to do is just turn your Afghan so you're working down the next side and you're going to click back on the video and you're going to repeat from the start of the repeat to the end of the repeat around your remaining three sides you're going to work one double crochet in each stitch across until you get to the next corner chained to space then you're going to work five double crochet into each corner chain two space around so go ahead and if you need help click back on the video and I'll meet you at the end of Round two I'm over at the end of Round two I just finished the last round of the Afghan and we finished with five double crochet into that last corner chained to space and now we're going to join by counting up to the top of that beginning chain three count up one two three insert into the top of that chain slip stitch yarn over pull through that chain and pull through the loop on your hook I'm going to go ahead and fasten off I'm going to weave in my ends and I'll be back and I'll show you the finished Afghan laid over a chair so you get a better idea of the overall look I'll be right back our Afghan is finished I have it thrown across my chair this is what it looks like with those beautiful weaved and strips you can make this in any color combination you wish you can even turn this into a Christmas Afghan you can use a beautiful pure white background and use red and green strips or you can just make it in any colors to suit your home decor I hope you enjoyed this video again the link to this pattern will be in the description box and until next time happy crocheting everyone you", "9BCsVawtWjw": "hi everybody welcome back to my channel i've been making these little granny squares and i either have two extra or i'm gonna need two more not sure yet this is what i've got done and if i put one more row around each one because i want the same color on the edge or every one of them so when i sew it it'll be all you won't be able to see it so i'll sew it together with that edging color so that'll take care of the spaces i have in between and then i can give it a good probably three-year-old border so it will be where did my sunlight go it'll be that big so i am hoping for the best i still have to weave in all these ends i went over these you know as i went with these different um rows it's just 16 double crochets 16 puffs 16 uh five double crochets kind of together and then the regular granny so look who won't get out of bed hi you're sippy that's okay okay so everyone i will show you when it's all sewn up and done together have a blessed day bye-bye", "B_XkHhSsHBU": "hey guys so i'm just here in my f2 room as a lot of you know i uh work on my own breeding developing my own strains and so that's what we're doing here of the so okay so i guess i might as well start at the beginning in case some of you don't know so what you're seeing mostly is a chem dog afghani cross that i did a couple years back and this is the f2 generation so what that means is i took chem dog mother and an afghani male and i crossed those together i took those seeds and which were the f1 generation and i sprouted a bunch and germinated a plant to carry for the next generation the f2 generation that's how you got most of the plants you're looking at today this one right here as you see that's my pheno type five this is the only one here i feel is worth uh carrying forward to the next generation try and zoom it so you can get a better look that's my chem dog afghani f2 phenol there some other ones in there don't think the lights too good you know a decent look and stuff but it's honestly if you're pheno hunting and you're we're trying to breed strains to potentially maybe one day put them to market you're not looking for garbage you're not just taking pollen and chucking them at random plants in hoping that you get some seeds um you know we're looking to breed certain characteristics in one of the reasons why i started with chem dog is because i love fuelly stank ass weed so i figured let's go with chem dog so yeah for my f2s this number five here that's that's the one that that i'm gonna keep now for some other notable awesomeness here see if we can get you this is the meathead so in other videos you've heard me talk about meathead plenty and then also meathead bag seeds so these are for meat had bag seeds this right here zoom that in a bit see looking pretty good right now the original meat heads that i had were like these really crazy like stretchy almost like vines as my buddy murray says it's like so long in between your nodes and i ended up with a few bag seeds out of off the last plant and so i decided to sprout them to see what happens and end up with a bunch of male plants that are much bushier than the originals and a lot more crystal covered so we're going to see how that meathead works so really really big fan it's number 10 right there you know what type that is i think i started off with something like 86 of these chem dog afghani f2s there's another uh meathead this one's a little bit more representative of the actual apparent uh plant that i had just quit show oh yeah and then also so i'm talking about all these brief breeding projects so i've got in here this one here is an alaskan thunder [ __ ] that i've just thrown in the blue room room to get it started it's in it's about its second week right here and then as is that ghost train haze right there what else are they this wedding cake right here and this meathead right here so and particularly this meathead as you've seen or as i've heard me talk about it see how stretchy that is in between the nodes like that's pretty crazy and yeah these ones are a little bit better they've been stripped for clones down below it's why they're not looking quite as good so some of you are probably saying what the hell is all that other stuff you got there so i wanted a lot of light in between all of my plants so that they i can really see what they're gonna do so i don't have any dark spots so that's why i spaced them out so much for phenol hunting but when you do that you know your plants are going to grow up tall and you're going to be able to grow some stuff in here so what you see down below so what you're looking at is swiss chard right here swiss chard that i just put my dirt bed there and let it do its thing right there you got some red swiss chard that's a coffee plant back through here look at all that kale i'm one of those weirdos that does a smoothie every morning for breakfast and stuff like kale is great for it okay well i think i've made it to the point where i'm just rambling so i should probably wrap it up there's no avocado alright have a great day", "mtRDZGRn29U": "hi everybody i'm ellen gormley and welcome back to my channel today we're doing the trillions of triangles pattern so this was a pattern that was free on red hearts website for a very long time i designed this back in 2005 but people have been having a hard time finding it um lately and so i thought i'll just demonstrate it for you so i have here's the original blanket in my house the old house from gosh 18 years ago is when i designed this well was 2005. and there's a couple different configurations of triangles that i was putting together and you can see it makes this really cool optical illusion of a hexagon when you put the triangles together but there's lots of different ways that you can lay out the triangles to make different effects and it's totally up to you how you do it this is how i designed it where i made all the triangles and then i just put them around on a paper or on the uh on a sheet on the floor to see which design i liked the best before i sewed or i'm sorry crocheted them all together here's a solid color one like in the blanket and here is a multi-colored one that i made so that you could see the different rows let's get started i have an eye size hook and i have a couple colors of bravo worsted the original was in red heart super saver but i have some bravo worsted there's a link in the description below for this yarn if you are interested and so what we're going to do is take a yarn a smooth kind of yarn and this is a hundred percent acrylic and i have an eye size hook we're gonna chain eight one two three four five six seven eight this is actually a very easy pattern so you will be feeling very relaxed i think relaxed and it's a valuable use of your time so we will slip stitch in the eighth chain from the hook to form a ring now we're going to chain one two three which is the first double crochet and we're going to place four more in the ring so that we have five if that beginning chain three counts as the first stitch so i'm just placing some stitches in the ring i'll have five this is a very easy pattern i think you'll see in a few minutes just how easy this is and how it makes spectacular results from a very meditative and easy um and easy to memorize plan so one two three we're chaining to make the first corner of the triangle now the uh triangle is of course three corners so we will repeat this a few more times so that we get three equal sides and three equal corners so we're doing five double crochets please subscribe to the channel if you want more crochet content please like this video if you are happy about seeing a triangle pattern a little knot here let's get this undone okay so we're placing five double crochets on each side one two three four five we're chaining one two three for the corners and the remaining side is five double crochets so you guys might know that i'm known for afghans i love afghans i think this uh the best use of this triangle is an afghan you could continue to make it bigger and bigger and make it a shawl but i feel like it's not the right proportion i like shawls that are deeper of a shallower of a triangle with longer sides and also this makes a very thick fabric very spongy and stretchy which is wonderful for a blanket but maybe not so great for a shawl one two three for the last corner we're going to slip stitch in the top of the beginning chain three to finish round one so we've now done the purple section of this multicolored triangle now this is interesting here so i've got my i'm gonna pull it tight with my little tail a little bit even though i chained eight i'm gonna pull it a little tighter i'm going to chain one and make my front post double crochet around that chain three beginning chain three so we're going to start with a front post double crochet that chain one is going to disappear behind the stitch and become nothing oh look there's a flaw in my yarn so i'm going to go ahead and pull that out i like to cut before and after the knot and then keep going with the new yarn so i'm going to pull back on that last yarn over and pull through and just change yarn right there cutting the knot out yarn over and pull through with the new yarn so there's a front post double crochet around the first stitch we're going to back post double crochet around the next stitch and we're going to alternate this front and back along the side so now we'll do a front post double crochet around the next double crochet and a back post double crochet around the next and that is what makes this a reversible pattern so get this last front double crochet so on each side we're starting with the front post double crochet and ending with the front post double crochet so it's going to be odd sizes now i'm going to chain or i'm sorry double crochet two in the corner the corners are all going to be double crochet two then chain three and this yarn is just fine okay it's just it just grabbed onto itself is all it's not another knot so chain one two three and two more double crochets in that chain three corner space so in the corner space is two double crochets three chains two double crochets see there it is between my thumbs all in that chain three corner space now it's time to do the next side and we will again always start aside with a front post double crochet and back post double crochet around the next one and so because we have front and back post double crochets alternating it really is a very reversible pattern so it looks very very similar on the front as it does on the back okay yay love that because of the front post double crochets i feel like this pattern uses a ton of yarn which is fantastic for a scrap blanket you can really go crazy with all the different colors and have it be a real kaleidoscope effect you can use up a bunch of your stash and it would be really gorgeous so now that we've come to the corner again i'm double crochet twice in the corner i'll chain three one two three and double uh two double crochets in the same corner okay so i did not change color i do prefer this triangle to be all one color mostly because i sometimes get tired of weaving at ends and so it's easiest and you can still make amazing color work with this is actually three different shades of blue i think you might be able to tell you can do amazing color work just doing one color per triangle rather than changing color every triangle so or every row so if you change color every row like this i think it is really beautiful but when you put a whole whole bunch of these all together i don't know if it would be too busy one way to test that is to take a photo and then on a collage app multiply it a gazillion times and kind of move it around on like a photoshop or a pic collage or some other kind of um photo editing tool i actually here i'll give you a little little heads up i actually years ago back before all that editing silly stuff i actually photocopied it i took a photo and photocopied it on my copy machine and printed out a gazillion of them cut them all out and then i played with them by moving the pieces of paper around to see the configuration of where i wanted them to go so you could always go cold old school like this as well if you and then you only have to make one of each color and just photograph it a bunch of times or copy it a bunch of times and then you can play with it and really move it around and see how you want things laid out before you start crocheting it all together so we'll slip stitch in the top of the first front post double crochet to finish the round we now have two rounds so we now have the purple and the gray so i think you're gonna see here that this is so easy and fun so again chain one and then front post double crochet around the first front post double crochet of the row and skip that beginning chain one does not count as anything back post double crochet around the next one and i did kind of weave in the ends as i went along front post double crochet around the next one you could totally keep going with this square or i'm sorry this triangle so used to the square language but this triangle this motif you could keep going and make it really big um and do a blanket of just a few of these but this blanket i think it had a pretty huge number of triangles if i remember correctly it was like 84 of um two of the colors and then like 60 or 56 or something of the other two when we get to i'm sorry the last color so it was 84 of 1 84 of the other yes oh no i'm sorry 84 of one color 56 of another color and 56 of the third color so if you um get your calculator out i don't do math in my head um in public 56 plus 56 is what 112 plus 84. so that's how many total squares or i'm sorry rectangles triangles you need for a blanket that will become how big is this blanket uh 55 inches by 89 inches it's a very big blanket so two double crochets three chains two double crochets all in the chain three corner space and then continue the pattern with beginning with a front post double crochet to start the side and then alternating with a back post double crochet and front post double crochet and we are alternating so so so fun also if you do just one color you can just take one color with you if you need to travel or sit at a doctor's office or sit at a soccer practice you can just assembly line it and just bring one color and one hook with you to do it rather than bringing multiple colors with you wherever you go okay it's just grabbing onto itself it's a little tight in the skein but it is all good now and then you get into a nice relaxing rhythm because crochet is supposed to be a relaxing and valuable use of our time and i think that it is and like i said before if you don't mind hit that like button and subscribe turn

know please leave me a comment if you'd like to see something specific right now i'm kind of going through my archives of old patterns that have been out of out of publish that that i know people still really like so if you happen to uh be on ravelry you can see the whole a pretty good huge body of my work about 300 published patterns that are on there i've published more than that but there's about 300 300 of them up on my ravelry i'm ellen gormley and my name on ravelry is go crochet so if you want to go check that out and need some help on any of my patterns drop me a comment and i will drop me a comment here on youtube though because i don't usually check my ravelry very often but leave a comment here on youtube on one of my videos and tell me what pattern you're interested in or what difficulty you're having and maybe i can help you by demonstrating the tricky parts of whatever it is that you are finding tricky all right two double crochets chain three and two double crochets now we will finish this row differently than we have the other one so heads up so we started in the middle of the row over here middle of the round i should say on the middle of the side and so we just need to finish and so remember we are doing a front post double crochet for the first side first stitch and a back post double crochet for the second we will continue this for a total of five rounds and that completes the triangle then when you have all the triangles made so we have done three together okay but we'll do two more exactly like that with starting each uh side with a front post then doing a double uh double back post and it's very similar on the front in the back on multi-color you're going to have some ends but with all one color you're not going to have any ends so once you have all of your rectangles that's when the magic happens and you'll be laying them out and putting them in the right configuration and crocheting them together with the wrong side or the wrong sides facing each other so that the seams are just single crochets through the back loops only to create this seam on the surface to make these cool graphic diagonals that hold it all together i really like how the holes of the chain three corner spaces these holes here become a design element in themselves like you can see the let's see is this one this one you can really see the holes line up to create this almost like a poinsettia poinsettia shape here so a triangle is here okay do you see it here's another triangle but when you put them all together it creates an optical illusion so i hope you have a lot of fun with this please like and subscribe continue watching watch the ads when you can because it helps me out i really appreciate it and that is all for today i hope you've loved this triangle presentation and i will see you on the next video", "kAeoTkCg1sc": "[Applause] [Music] we want to burn one b so yeah let's check it out [Music] um but dance the smell is amazing very

purple look and color pop I just launched a new palette it's called it's my pleasures and it's very heavy on the purple so this kind of inspired today's a video I did like a full on pink look a while ago so today we're going on all purple and wonders I really love like my bronzy smokey brown eyes I actually really like wearing purple I think it looks really pretty on brown eyes I'm going to be doing a full face as well so got further ado let's jump to the video I'm gonna start off with the Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood flawless filter I've been loving this it's kind of like my everyday staple now I love applying this all over the skin it just gives a really nice pretty natural glowy look my skin just looks a bomb when I have this on so I have been using the heck out of it but another know like how adorable are these Beauty sponges these are from Real Techniques they're just several balls they're so cute I'm gonna be using this too and they're purple I didn't even do that on purpose but I'm just going to buff out the Charlotte Tilbury like it just makes this in so pretty I'm actually low-key obsessed with this product for my foundation I'm gonna be going into the wild to shake luck all-in-one glow I used this in my last video where I was trying it for the first time this is going to be my second time trying it I'm still testing it out I want to see how I really feel about it but for the most part you guys I actually really liked the way it looked at the end of the day it looked so pretty my forehead was so smooth I don't know it just looked flawless I'm trying out the brush on this side of my face I just kind of want to see how it applies one I think I like it a little bit better with the sponge just because it looks a lot more flawless and skin like so I'm gonna stick to using it with a sponge also in my last video I try to use funky concealer and in that video it was a little bit too a light and bright so I actually went back in yesterday and I got a new shade I had a 150 so I got a shade 170 it's not like a huge leap because I still don't I wasn't sure because they all look kind of yellow after 150 and I didn't want to go super yellow or super golden underneath my eyes so this was the only one that was kind of like worn on the neutral side oh yeah is definitely a lot better I think this is a better match for sure still a little bit brightening but it's not super overwhelming I think is actually like the perfect look I like to concealer color for me I like to sponge so far it's like really squishy and really really nice I thought like the shape was gonna throw me off but it's almost just like using the butt of a bee blender or the under eyes uno momento I actually have the baby one so let's see if this fits a little bit better yeah it's not bad I still I think I prefer a little bit of a tip to my sponges I'm just gonna go in with a little bit more concealer or if this is too light to do spot concealing we're gonna find out I'm gonna go into the little funky match sticks in the shade amber I'm going to do a very minimal nose contouring so to set all of this in place I'm gonna go into my award Mercier translucent setting powder whoo oh shoot I got too much my brothers I'm taking my shoe a little bronzer duo here with sunlight and suntan I like just mixing up these two shades together one of my favorite bronzers to use alright blush I'm going with a different tone than I normally do I'm taking in this shade right here it's called happy tune and this is from a table it's a really pretty kind of white lady bubblegum matte blush I think I've tried this color before whoa it goes on really nicely like a very nice soft blush it's not super overwhelming actually they like that a lot a really cute color also I'm so sorry I feel like I'm just zipping through things and just going like really fast but I don't know I feel like I'm just like I'm a mission today so for my highlighter I'm going to go into the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills and Nicole Guerrero palette I love this I don't think it's available anymore but I'm trying to make an effort to use products I haven't used in a while like things that I've forgotten about so I know that I love this palette I'm gonna mix the shade kitty cat and forever young together onto the cheek oh so good oh my goodness you guys this is intense with a lot of highlighter I'm just gonna blend that out a little bit I love that my brow products are purple I'm using the urban decay Dubrow blade in a taupe trap and the little tint in the same color I absolutely love these products and watch ever using these for my brows every day so I'm just gonna fill them in nothing crazy over here alright so complexion is done before I move on to the eyes I'm gonna give up my skin a nice little spritz of the Catrice dewy glow fixing sprayed this is what the inside of the colour-pop palette looks like it's super pretty like these metallic colors are gorgeous I am going to start off with this shade right here it's called kitten fish I'm assuming that is catfish is baby a kitten fish so I get it the shake is really pretty it's kinda like a soft lavender violet shade alright so this gonna be the first transition color I'm basically going to oh man well that's a lot more pigmented than I thought I'm basically gonna add this to my crease but like we blow it out I'm gonna bring it out a little bit too I feel like I haven't done purple look in such a long time I think the last time I did it was my Halloween Martian video I'm also choosing the shape kitten fish on my lower lashline actually really like this color a lot I feel like just this color alone like this add some mascara or lashes and it's like this really cool pastel look I don't I really like this but we're going to charge it up so now I'm going to go into this shade right here it's called fanfiction again I'm really interesting like a muted key I feel like it's more like on the pinky side I'm just going to see if this deepens it up a little oh wow it looks a lot more purple I love that but officiate in the palette is called sleeper it's kind of like a plummy color I'm actually going to mix it with a little bit of Chiclets which Chiclets of cute just so it's a little bit more purple and the shape is a metallic shade but normally you know I don't know who made the holes but to put metallic colors in the lid but I'm just gonna mix the two colors together just I want it to be a little bit more purple and we'll just see what happens I think that worked quite well I'm going to go into the shade of Chiclets and I'm going to take out on my tiny little brush here and I'm gonna deepen up the lower lash line with that being a little bit more of kitchen fish and I'm just going to blend the lower lash line so all the colors kind of like mesh together here are some of the metallics from the palette this one up here is Chiclets this one is mr. Sandman and this middle shade is called Burt's shine that color is beautiful I think I want to put that on the inner corner of the eyes I can get be like a really pretty pop this one is gorgeous but Afghan like I think I want to go more purple action idea from the lid I'm gonna take this shade and pop it in the inner part of my eyes but for my lids I might use something else oh my god this color is gorgeous I look you want to put this all over my eyelids oh my wow wow wow wow so for my lids women do is I'm going to take this Stila magnificent metals a glittering globe shadow is in the shade of Sunset Cove I feel like this would look really really pretty on the lids I'm gonna just pop that on the center ooh okay or that I'm not technically gonna call this a cut crease but I do kind of want it to be a little bit more sharp I'm not technically calling you to cut crease because um I'm not good at them I don't want to name it something that is not it I'm taking a little bit of sleeper and fanfiction and I'm going to just clean up the line a little bit we're not stopping here don't worry I'm actually gonna take the sheet earthshine that we put on the in front of your eyes I don't put that on top of the steel eyeshadow just to give it like a more purple pop because this has like this really gorgeous like fluorescent or full shade in it now I'm gonna take that shade arts shine and I'm just going to place that right on top of the Stila shadow let's see what happens ooh okay so it's not like a crazy difference but I can see more purple I actually oh this is gorgeous I went ahead and added some purple to my waterline this is decal puck cream gel color in the shade piggy bank I'm going to go ahead and do a black wing real quick and some mascara I'll be right back hi guys I am back with the finished I love you guys I love how it came out I'm a feeling at this purple it's beautiful like the colors like that lid it's just everything it came out so nicely if you guys have been waiting up for a full on a purple palette from colour-pop look no further like this palette isn't beautiful and I love the look that I created let's finish off this look with some lips I don't know why I'm having such a hard time finding the perfect color to wear with this look I'm gonna try the lion crime you know for lipsticks and airborne unicorn this is literally the same type of purple so we're gonna see if this looks good I'm hoping I just I don't wear purple lipsticks so I feel like I don't have many Oh [Music] as much as I don't love purple lipstick on me personally I feel like

so in this video I'm going to show you how to crochet the shell stitch pattern you can make this pattern as big or as small as you want and you can use it to crochet any size blanket or cushion cover for my pattern I used a 4 millimeter crochet hook and us terms so thank you very much for watching and please subscribe to my channel for more crochet thing that we want to do for our pattern is you want to do a slipknot so to do a slipknot you want to wrap the yarn around your finger once and then twice and then take the first loop and put it over the second loop and then take the second loop and put it all the way over your finger you then want to take your crochet hook and go in through this loop and pull tight and that is a said a so once you have your Slipknot we are now going to work our foundation chain and you can make your foundation chain as long or as small as you want as long as it is a multiple of 6 so you can chain 6 12 18 24 30 you can chain up to 60 120 180 however long you want as long as it is a multiple of six so if you're making a blanket you want to do a longer chain so maybe up to 120 or 180 but if you're doing a cushion then you may want to make a smaller foundation chain but as long as you chain a multiple of six so one two three okay so I've just got them doing my foundation chain and for the purpose of this video I have chained 42 but if you're going to be doing a blanket or a cushion cover then you will probably want to chain more than that as long as it is a multiple of a six so once you have done your foundation chain we are now ready to move on to Row one again Row one the first thing that you want to do is chain two so I'm going to chain one then two and this is on top of my foundation chain and let's create our turning chain so once you have chained to you now want to work a single crochet into the second chain from the hook so here's the first chain from the and here is a second and into this stitch you want to work a single crochet so to do a single crochet you can search a hook through the stitch that's the second stitch from the hook pull up a loop and then yarn over and pull through both loops on your hook and that is one single crochet so once you have a single crochet you now want to skip the next two stitches so I'm going to skip this stitch and the next one and into the next one so the third one along from the one we just worked in I'm going to work five double crochets all into this stitch so skip two stitches and into this stitch work five double crochets so to do a double crochet you yarn over and go into the stitch yarn over and pull up a loop then you yarn over and pull through two loops and then yarn over and pull through two more so that is one double crochet and I'm going to work five in total all into this stitch so I'm going to do a second one and then a third and then a fourth and then a fifth five double crochets all in to this stitch like that so once I have done that I'm now going to skip the next two stitches so I'm going to skip this stitch and the next one and into the next one so the third one along from the one I just worked in I'm going to work a single crochet into this stitch so skip two stitches and into the next one along work a single crochet into the stitch like that I'm then going to skip two more stitches so skip this one and this one and into the next one along work buy more double crochets all into this stitch so I skipped two more stitches and now I'm working five double crochets into the next stitch just like we just did right okay and once you have done that we are going to repeat this all the way along our chain for Row one so what you want to do is skip two stitches and then work a single crochet into the next stitch then skip two more stitches and work five double crochets into the next then skip two stitches and work a single crochet then skip two more stitches and work five double crochets so it's skip two stitches single crochet skip two stitches five double crochets skip two stitches single crochet skip two stitches five double crochets just repeated all the way along our chain for Row one so I've done five double crochets so now going to skip two stitches and work a single crochet into the next one the third one along then I'm going to skip two more stitches and work five double crochets into the next like that and you can see here we're repeating our shells so just on fire double crochets I'm going to repeat that again so skip two stitches and then single crochet into the next then skip two more stitches and five double crochets into the next and no matter how long or how short your chain is you're going to repeat this all the way along skip two stitches single crochet skip two stitches five double crochets and just keep repeating it all the way I just completed that and worked all the way along my chain and I'm now coming to the end and I have three chains left and no matter how long or short your chain was at the beginning you should always have three chains left at the very end and finally the last thing that you want to do for Row one is skip the next two stitches and then into the very last stitch work a single crochet into this stitch but whilst we are working our single crochet we are going to change colors to the color of Road 2 so the first thing that you want to do is go into the stitch just as you would with a normal single crochet and pull up a loop as you would with a normal single crochet but instead of completing our single crochet with this pink color so usually we would yarn over and pull through to complete our single crochet we are going to complete our single crochet using our new color so the color that I am using for Row two is this navy blue so what I'm going to do is take this color and put it on my hook and then simply pull this color through these two loops so I've dropped my pink color and I'm pulling through the blue color and then I can fasten off the pink color so the color that I use for Row one I will simply cut my yarn making sure to leave a tail that I can weave in later and I will continue on using my navy blue color okay so I've just fastened off my pink color so this is the color that I worked 401 in and I am now using my blue color and I am ready to move on to take enroute to I'm going to chain three one two and three and I'm using my new color here and I'm then going to turn my work and my chain three counts as a stitch my chain three counts as a double crochet so once I have my chain three the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to work two double crochets into the very first stitch so that is going to be into the last single crochet of last row I'm going to work two double crochets into the stitch and I will then have a chain three and two double crochets all coming out of this first stitch and that's will count as three double crochets so I'm going to yarn over and go into this first stitch here like that and I'm going to work one double crochet and I'm then going to work a second into the same stitch so that is the last single crochet of last row so once you've done that this is what you should have you then want to skip the next two stitches so I'm going to skip this stitch and this stitch and those are the first two double crochets of this shell here so I'm going to skip the next two stitches and into the third stitch along so this is a very center of the shell I'm going to work a single crochet into the top of this stitch so I'm going to go into this stitch this is the third stitch of the shell and into this stitch I'm going to work a single crochet so I'm technically doing a single crochet into the top of the shell from last row and then going to skip the next two stitches these are the last two double crochets of the shell and move on to the single crochet so here there is a single crochet in between these two shells there we go and into this single crochet I am going to work five double crochets and five double crochets is what makes a shell I'm technically going to be making a show into the single crochet so I'm going to skip these two stitches and go straight to the single crochet and into this single crochet from last row and going to work five double crochets so I'm going to be working in another shell into this single crochet so five double crochets all into the single crochet so there's three four like that that's five double crochets so once loads on that I'm now going to skip the next two stitches so that's the first two stitches of the next shell from last row and into the next stitch so the third double crochet of the shell I'm going to work a single crochet into the top of this stitch so a single crochet into the top of the shell just like we did before and then going to skip the next two double crochets here the last two double crochets and go straight to the single crochet of last rows you can see in between the two shells we have a single crochet and into this single crochet I'm going to work five double crochets again so I'm going to work another shell into this single crochet so for five double crochets into the single crochet two like that five double crochets and you want to continue repeating this all the way along into the top of each shell from last row so into the top of the third double crochet V shell you are going to work a single crochet and then in each single crochet from last row you are going to work five double crochets so you're going to working a shell into the single crochet so you're going to skip two stitches and work a single crochet then skip two more stitches and work five double crochets then skip two stitches and work a single crochet skip two stitches work five double crochets skip two single crochet skip two five double crochets and you want to work that all the way along for Row two and you can see you are creating shells in between the shells of last row that is what you want so I'm going to skip the next two stitches and work a single crochet then skip the next two stitches and work five double crochets into the single crochet from last row so there we go that's five double crochets and I'm going to skip two stitches and work a single crochet and skip two more and work five double crochets into the single crochet and you want to repeat this all the way along for Row 2 it doesn't matter how long your chain is or how long the work is just keep repeating this all the way along okay so I just got done working that all the way along for road two and I have worked my final single crochet into the top of the last shell and to finish off this row I'm going to skip the last two stitches and into the very last single crochet from last row here I'm going to work three double crochets into this stitch so I'm technically working half a shell and if you remember back at the beginning of Row two we did a chain three and two double crochets which counted as three double crochets so that was half the shell and we going to work another half a shell in for this final single crochet so I'm going to yarn over skip two stitches and then into the next stitch which is a single crochet work three double crochets so there's one there's two and whilst I am working my third one I am actually going to change color so this is going to be using the same method that we changed from Row one to two we're going to change colors so I'm going to yarn over and go into the stitch pull up a loop yarn over and pull through two loops so go and do a double crochet but do not complete it so don't finish off the last step of the stitch instead we are going to finish off the last step using our new color and I'm going back to the pink I would recommend that that is what you do so you sort of alternate between the pink and the blue or your two colors so you want to take your color your new color and simply pull this through so drop the color that you were using and pull your new one through you can then cut the yarn that you were using previously and we are ready to move on to rotate it right begin row three the first thing that you want to do is chain one and ten and your chain one does not count as a stitch so once you have chained one and turned the next thing that you want to do is work a single crochet into the very first stitch so here is the very last double crochet of last row and this is the double crochet that we changed colors on as well and into this stitch we are going to work a single crochet like that and row 3 is very very similar to road - the only difference is that it starts different and ends different and simply for Row three what you want to do is whenever you come to a single crochet you want to work five double crochets into the stitch just like last ring and then whenever you come to a shell you want to work a single crochet into the top of the shell so into the third double crochet along and just keep repeating that all where long you will be doing five double crochets into each single crochet and then a single crochet into the top of each shell and five double crochets into the single crochet then a single crochet into the top of the shell and just repeat that all the way along and I will show you what to do at the very end so I've done a single crochet it's a very first stitch and the way to look at it these three double crochets counted as half a shell so technically this first stitch here is the third stitch of the shell so this is the top of the shell and that is why you have worked a single crochet into it so we're now going to go on to the single crochet and into this stitch you want to work five double crochets so five double crochets into the single crochet from last row so you are working a shell technically into the single crochet like that you are then going to work a single crochet into the third stitch of this shell so skip the next two stitches and then work a single crochet into the top of the third stitch or into the top of the shell then move on to the single crochet and enter the single crochet work five double crochets so there's one and there's two so like that so five double crochets you then want to work a single crochet into the top of the next shell and then work five double crochets into the next single crochet so it's very similar to row two well practically the same thing except for the beginning and the end and you just want to repeat this all the way along for Row three okay so I'm just coming to the end of Row three I have worked my final set of five double crochets into the single crochet and I've now come to this set of three double crochets here so this was the chain three and two double crochets that we did at the very beginning of row two and this counts as half a shell so what you want to do is skip the next two stitches and into the third stitch along and this should be the very top of the chain three you want to go into the stitch so go into the top of the chain three and work a single crochet but do not complete your single crochet as we are going to change colors so take your new color you're going to be new using for your next row to take your new color and you want to pull this through you can then fasten off the color you were just using and we are ready to move on to the next record so I've done Row three and I have my new color attached and I'm now ready to move on to the next row and this pattern is very easy because the rest of this pattern is simply just repeat rows 2 & 3 so you simply want to repeat rows 2 and then 3 then 2 again then 3 again then 2 again and 3 again and just keep going you can go for however long you want obviously if you did a longer chain you may want to do more and more more repeats of it but you can do however many you want and that is it for this pattern just keep repeating rows 2 & 3 and remember to change color at the end of each row and that's how simple it oh I've just done row 3 so I'm going to begin repeating row 2 again and to begin Row 2 the first thing that you want to do is change through the case I've chain 3 and you can go back on the video and just keep rewatching rows 2 & 3 again until you get the hang of it but eventually you'll find that you'll just know what to do because it's very easy and to remember is that Row 2 always begins with a chain 3 and rows three always begins they chain one so to begin Row two always chain three and speak in Row three always only chain three and turned and this counts as a stitch and I'm going to just do Row 2 so I'm going to work two double crochets into the very first stitch and if you remember the chain three and two double crochets counts as three double crochets and it's very easy because Row two and Row three are very nearly the same thing the only difference is the way that they begin and the way that they end is slightly different so you've chained three and then two double crochets you now want to work a single crochet into the top of the shell like that and then five double crochets into the single crochet and just repeat this all the way long single crochet 5 double crochets single crochet 5 double crochets just as we've been doing for row two and three this row is just repeating road two and then we are going to repeat Row three their motor again and Row three again so now do a single crochet then five more double crochets so we're just repeating road to here okay so I'm just about to finish repeating Row 2 I have done my final single crochet and into this very last stitch here I'm going to work three final double crochets so three final double crochets into the very last single crochet so I'm working half a shell and I'm not going to complete my last double crochet as I'm going to change colors and I'm changing colors to a cream so I'm going to change colors and simply pull my new color through I can then fasten off and I can begin repeating rows so to finish repeating Row two and now I'm going to repeat Row three I have my new color attached and I'm going to begin Row three by chaining one and ten and my chain one does not count as a stitch and then going to work a single crochet into the very first stitch so this was the last stitch of last rows the last double crochet I'm then going to work five double crochets into this single crochet from last row so five double crochets there's one and two and three like that five double crochets and then going to skip two stitches and work a single crochet into the third stitch of the shell and then going to work five double crochets into the single crochet and just continue to repeat this five double crochets single crochet 5 double crochets single crochet and just keep going I've done five double crochets and a single crochet so I'm just repeating Row three and if you want more detailed instructions then you can go back in the video and watch me go through Row three a lot okay so I'm just coming to the end of Row three I've worked my final set of five double crochets and I'm now going to work a final single crochet into the top of the turning chain here so okay final single crochet but I'm not going to complete it as I am going to change colors and I am changing colors back to this color here this purple and that way I feel that the pattern comes out a lot more if you alternate colors like that so I'm going to change colors so just pull this new color through to complete the single crochet and fasten off this white color so I just got done repeating Row two and Row three and I'm simply going to do this again I'm going to now repeat row two then row three again then row two then row three again I'm going to keep going and you can go on for as long as you want and like I've said before you can go back in the video and re-watch these two rows or I will also have written instructions on the screen and a second at case you just continue repeating rows two and three for however many rows you ones and then that will be it with your blanket or your cushion cover you could also add a border or an edging to this blanket to finish it off of it for this video I hope you enjoyed it and found it easy to follow please make sure to subscribe to my channel for more crochet videos and thank you very much for watching bye", "6I_F-ZiWOG8": "this is a kunzite not he most looks like this has to be irradiated this is from a single crystal from Afghanistan that was cut perfectly down this this is the C axis of the crystal and that crystal was about this long and about that thick and had an amazing color and there was one large stone that was over 170 carats there was this one that's 85 carats and then some smaller 30 characters that I had but I thought you'd enjoy seeing that because it's a spectacular", "hekLEqZ_p4k": "Hello, I'm Marly Bird, proud spokesperson for Red Heart Yarns, and I want to show you how you would do multiple color sequences to achieve the planned pooling look. To understand what I'm talking about, take a look at this really beautiful wrap. You can see that we get this really great argyle look using the crocheted moss stitch, which is a single crochet, chain one, single crochet, chain one. And we are doing that over a multiple of color sequences. For this particular wrap, it has four color sequences. By this point, you should understand the planned pooling process. And if you need help with that, I do have a perfect planned pooling video right here on the Marly Bird YouTube channel. I'll be sure to put a link in the video description box right below this video. Once you understand the concept of planned pooling, and how the colors are shifting, the idea of doing a multiple color sequence is really simple. What we want to do is, instead of working through just one sequence, we will work through as many sequences as necessary for our project. In order to do that, we simply work our moss stitches maintaining the three single crochets in each color of the sequence for the number of sequences we want. Let me show you an example. As we look down here, you can see that I have already done a number of chains that I know would be the correct length, at least long enough, to accommodate the number of color sequences I want. Now, in this particular part, I've already worked through one row, and the second row, and I'm starting row three. So I'm beginning my shift. In this pattern, you can see I have two color sequences. I started off with this salmon color, and so, let's see where we get back to the salmon color. All right, it's right here. So there's one, and two. So if I were to stop right there, this would be a full width of one color sequence. But, for my particular pattern, I want to do two. So I would continue on. Here's the salmon, and I work through until I get down to two more salmon colors. Then it's just a matter of working our planned pooling as we know. I chained two, and I worked my stitches all the way back. Notice I'm still only getting three single crochets in each color until the end. Now I'm here on row three, and this very first stitch I did in my chain one space is also that salmon color, which makes it so that these stitches down here are going to shift in this direction. If I had made that particular stitch the pink color below, if I made it this stitch below, my stitches would actually stack. Because I don't want them to stack, it's really important that I force that stitch to be that salmon color and it makes these colors shift just as I want. You're familiar with planned pooling, so none of this is new. What's new is the fact that when I get to the end of my first sequence, I just continue on! Like, I don't even pay attention to the fact that it's the end of a sequence. I just maintain my stitches all the way across this row. Let me show you what I mean. I'm working my moss stitch, and I'm making sure that each one of my single crochets are in one color. And so, as I work across each color of a sequence, I just need to make sure that each single crochet of that color is the same color is...is three. Okay? So I need three of the same color. So I have purple, purple, purple, chain one. Doesn't matter what color the chain one is, and I carry on. I'm coming up to where this would be the end of my color sequence, okay? And you'll see here, I'm just moving right past it, not paying any attention to it. So this would have been the end of my color sequence, okay? This would have been the end of it, but I'm just moving right on past it, making sure that I get the three single crochets in each color. As long as I maintain my three single crochets per color, it doesn't matter how many sequences I have, because I will still finish the row just as I would if it was just one sequence. Pretty simple, right? So as I carry on like right here, I need one more of that color... and I'm just repeating my sequence. And remember, I crochet around my chain because, see how it's starting to curve on me? And I can make it so that way all of my stitches are nice and even as I straighten everything out. Let me just kind of go like this... Straighten everything out on my chain, just like if it was a an adjustable ring. It allows the stitches to not have to cram up on each other, and it allows you a chance to really establish a gauge that works for you to get those three single crochets. So here it is! This is me working across one full repeat, and then I'm starting my second repeat. And I would end just like I would if it were on the first singular repeat. Hopefully, all of that makes sense, and you understand better how to do multiple color sequences using the planned pooling technique. I will tell you, that using this Super Saver pooling yarn makes this technique a lot easier, because we've designed the yarn to get exactly three single crochets (using the moss stitch) out of each color in a color sequence, making it really convenient, and easy, and hopefully you'll have great success in your planned pooling endeavors. If you'd like to try out some patterns using multiple color sequences across a row, you can check out the free patterns that are available at redheart.com. This pattern I started off showing you, is a beautiful wrap pattern using the exact colorway that I showed you today. And you can make this wrap. Once again, it is four color sequences wide, and you just make it as long as you want it to be. Along with the wrap, there's a beautiful blanket. This blanket uses the colorway, Papaya. Isn't it gorgeous?! It is five color sequences wide, and you can see how simply stunning all of these colors are together. You'll also notice that each particular color only has three single crochets, and they're all offset by one every other row. I finished off the edging on this one with a really great edging that I like. It's just half double crochets worked through, I'm gonna call it the third loop, and so you get this really cool simple subtle look. And this uses just a plain Red Heart Super Saver color. But this blanket is stunning! You are now all set to run out, grab some Super Saver pooling yarn, and make a blanket, or a wrap, or any item that you want to make that has multiple color sequences.

Visit youtube.com/MarlyBird.", "EIWxH9TRHz8": "Welcome back to the Crochet Crowd as well as my friends over Yarnspirations.com. I'd like to present to you my Center Burst Afghan, and this is using the new Bernat Velvet Yarn. So here's what the yarn looks like here, if you go to find it. And, it is extremely soft, I think this is gonna be the, one of the biggest ah,yarns out there for maybe 2018 and definitely for 2019. I love the weight of this yarn. I love the feel of this yarn. I love the look of this yarn. Everything about this yarn, I love. So what we have here is ah, designed by me where you're going to start off with the center, and this is made up in squares. So there is a total of twelve squares that make up this particular Afghan. So it's three by four for the configuration. So these squares are actually pretty big in size. They're a total of 15 inches by 15 inches, and you just start off with the center. Now what's going to throw you off is this bursting of color right here, and this is really quite amazing. So let me tell you a little bit about that. When you go to look at the back of one of these squares, you're going to notice that there is a traveling seam line. So see how it just is I can reach it and grab it? What this is, is that it's just resting. So when you see it up at the front here, what's happened is that you are literally crocheting around it, and moving it into position, and out of place in order to create this look. So it's actually really neat idea when you're going to be able to do this. So, I think it's a really kind of a,ah fun way. So in this tutorial, I'm going to show you how that's done. There's really no easy way to explain it in ah,written format. So I'm going to show you that to you instead. So the tutorial is going to have it showing you how to do these squares, and then there's two rounds at the border. So what colors are you going to need? So you're going to need a total of seven Bernat Velvet Balls. So you'll need two soft blues. You will need two Terracottas, Terracotta rows just like you see, and then you're going to need only one, of this ah, Velvet Teal, which is this color of the burst, and then you'll need two  Vapor Graze that you see. So it's a really neat, particular Afghan to do. So once you get the squares done, you're just going to whip stitch them together. So just using your Terracotta rows, just whip stitch them together. So the border is very simple, and then what you have, is that you're going to start off in a corner, or wherever the corner may be, and I'm sure it's just around the corner here. So what's going to happen is you're going to join it into a corner. And remember you're going to chain up three and that counts as a double crochet, and you've got to put four more double crochets. And you're going to follow it all the way across and double crochet around. So in the corners, you will put five double crochets. The final round is my favorite kind of edging. It's the Picot Edging, and what's going to happen, is that you're gonna single crochet picot, and then single crochet in the next. So then move to the next single crochet picot, single crochet in the next, and it gets this really beautiful edge that you see. So this tutorial that I have for you, is ah, using Caron One Pound yarn, it may be easier for you to see, but ah, this yarn is very easy to work with. But because I've already kind of filmed this already, I might as well show you the existing tutorial, because it's exactly what we're gonna do today, so you can enjoy your Afghan. And without further ado, let's get started, and let\"s direct you down to that particular tutorial. We'll see you again real soon, and enjoy. Welcome back to the Crochet Crowd as well  as my friends over at Joann.com, I'm your host Mikey. Today we are working on the New Orleans Mardi Gras Crochet Cruise Square. Now for everybody else you can work on this as well, but for my cruiser friends we're going to be doing this as our charity project, which is a celebration of color. You will notice that the colors that you see are meant for Mardi Gras, but you on the cruise, you can express your own creativity, your own colors, and all I need you to do is pay attention to the pattern as well as the sizing so that you can mat, mix and match your squares with other squares on the cruise ship. Let me tell you a little bit more about this. My cruisers friends you have to worry about your sizing. So when you have this, what you have is that you're going to measure it out and it has to be a certain ah, dimension. So it's about twelve inches across for your square. So what I would recommend in that we're gonna do this in tutorial format, is that we are going to do a quick measurement after we do the middle circle. You'll be able to know after that middle circle whether you're too tight or whether you're too loose. So what happens if you're too tight? Well, you're going to increase your hook. You'll make your hook size a little bit bigger and restart. Now if you're way too tight, then what you want to do, sorry, if you're way too loose, your square ah, circle will be bigger. So you're going to decrease your crochet hook. What I would recommend is use that middle, circle as your guide before going any further, and then once you determine the hook size that is right for your hands because everyone's  unique, your tension is unique. Then you're able to match these squares with the neighbors on the cruise ship. So what we're going to do is approximately about four inches in there, but we'll take a new measurement once we get there. We're recommending a five and a half millimeter a size. \"I\" crochet hook in order to play today. But again, I want you to pay attention to your tension so that you will match the squares the best, when it comes to all your cruising friends on board the ship. This particular square has been really inspired by Mandela's. So I was thinking about overlays, what you can do to make things pop, and have a lot of fun. So you're going to see the green and the gold when it's just spiking out with color. So it's kind of like a sun, it's kind of like a celebration, a firecracker, a pop. But when you turn this over, what you're going to notice is that they're solid circles in the back for those. So it's a really neat idea. So if you're looking for some new tips and ideas, this is definitely it for you.  So enough jibber jabber, let's get at her.  We're going to start with our five and a half millimeter size. \"I\" crochet hook. I'm recommending Caron One Pound Yarn. If you cannot use that yarn, than just get something that's equivalent to it, and pay attention to your size. So even if you're changing the brand, my friends, make sure that your sizing is still accurate, and you adjust your hook. So without further ado, let's get it into the pattern, and um, I do have a downloadable pattern for you and everything has been written out in an instructional format. And I also have some photographs there for you to be able to see. So let's get at her. So let's get started. We're going to start off with the slipknot and we are going to insert our hook into the slipknot. If your new to crochet just take this step-by-step, and you can also reverse the video if you need to. I need you to chain a total of three. So one, two and three. To get our posts going all the way around, there's twelve of them. We're going to go into the very beginning chain, so count it back to the third one, and I want you to double crochet a total of eleven times in that beginning one. So, this chain that you're skipping over top of is included into this, as a count, so this will make it a total of 12 at the end. So just, let's just say that's one, and that just go into the one furthest from the hook, the third one, and double crochet. That's two, and keep on doing that until you get a total of twelve. We have three, and four. Now, you're noticing you have the straggler, just go right up over top of it and trap it right under, in your position. So we have four done. Let's do five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven and twelve. And what I'd probably recommend too, is just double count, make sure you have the right number of posts. So let's just count now so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 12. Once you have that done, slip stitch to the beginning chain at the top, and pull through and through and you're done. So that's what you can do if you've gone over top of your straggler, grab your scissors and just cut that out, and you don't have to worry about looking at that any further. So let's continue then, on to round number two. Round number two, we're going to double the size of the circle. So I need you to chain three to start. That counts as a double crochet here, and throughout in the pattern. In the same stitch, I want you to double crochet one more time. So this one's a pretty easy round. We're going to put two double crochets in each stitch, going all the way around. So let's just do that together. So we're just going to go one and two into the next stitch, and then advance to the next one after that, and put two into that one as well. I want you to continue all the way around, putting two into each. So by the end of this round, there should be twelve sets of two, going all the way around. Please do that, and meet me back here in just a moment. So once you get all the way round, make sure there's twelve sets of two, which I've already counted off-camera, and I'm just gonna slip stitch at the top of the first one. So look everything looking awesome so far. We're gonna continue with our yellow one more time, and we're gonna go for round number three, and we're gonna expand our  circle again. Let's just chain three, and that counts as a double crochet, and that's the only one that will be in this beginning stitch. The next one will have two double crochets in it. So one and two. So the repeat pattern, for round number three, is that the next one will be one double crochet by itself, and then the one after that will have two double crochets. And I want you to keep that same idea going all the way around and do that, and meet me back here in just a moment. So now coming up around to the end, the last stitch should be two double crochets. Now I haven't done anything special. I'm keeping in line with the count of the pattern. So remember it was one by itself and two into the next. So to finish this off we're going to get rid of this yellow now. I want you to slip stitch to the top of the first chain three that you started with, and we're gonna get rid of this color. I'm recommending cruisers that you actually get rid of your colors, and use your darning needle to be able to finish those off as well, and ah get that, done. Okay, so let me show you how to do that, and I'm only gonna show it once in this tutorial, and I'll build, it'll be right here. To hide in the loose ends, use a tapestry needle, really it doesn't take that long. Turn it over to the back, and then just glide it through the backside of your, of your circle. Do this, for every time you need to change your colors. And if you go through once, don't pull it to the point it's gonna warp your circle, and then go through different path, for the second time, and then finally go back one more time, a third time and third time is a charm. So you'll never have this pop out on you. Because we are gifting the charity on the cruise ship or, or, when we're done the cruise. What you want to do is that you want to make sure your tail ends are woven in, and because you're exchanging with your friends as well on board, do this because then they don't have to do it later. So let's move on now to round number four. And round number four we're gonna start getting ourselves into more fancy footwork. Let's do it now. So let's take a quick measurement. Now I've gone further in the tutorial then I should of, but um, I've just put this right back in the tutorial where should be, so after you get these three done. It is approximately four inches. Now, if it's three and ah, three point seven five inches, I wouldn't worry about it. If it's four point two five, I wouldn't worry about it so much. But if you're seeing a considerable difference, if your square, if your circle at this point is more than four inches, like say it's five. You're going to have to adjust your hook to make it smaller to compensate for the ah, size, and then just do the three rounds again and see if you've gotten closer to the four. Now if your circle is much smaller like a three. Then what you want to do, is that you want to increase your hook size, and then ah,just redo these three rounds once again, and try to get as close to the four as possible. And I'm only telling you that, because on the ship people that don't pay attention to that, you end up with squares that are significantly smaller and squares that are way too big. So just take a time, and just do your first one to get your size crochet hook, that is going to match this particular moment. As we move up into rounds, number four, five and six, they're all the purple. But what we need to pay attention to is that we have these spaces in between, okay, which is creating this starburst. I'm going to show you a way that you do not have to fasten that off as you're doing it. You just have to be very strategic on how you're finishing off each round, so that it will, these green and the gold will fit into the proper space. So rounds number four, five and six, will be this purple again. That's just my choice. You can make it any color that you wish. Let's move along, to round number four. So let's begin round number four. We're gonna start off with the slipknot, and I've given you a holiday on this particular um,section right here, on round number four. So every other stitch is going to get something. So we're just gonna start off, it can be any one that you wish.  Just start off in any one, and just insert in and pull through, and chain a total of three. So one, two and three. In the same stitch you just did the join, I want you to put two more double crochets in there. So one and two. So the repeat pattern going all the way around is that, and you see how I went over over top of that, you want to do that so you can get rid of it later. Skip the next stitch and put three double crochets into the one after that. You're going to do a total of eighteen of these sets going all the way around if you're skipping the stitches, and if you're doing the right count, then it'll work out for you. So skip the next stitch and put three double crochets into the next. Please do that all the way round for round number four, and then we'll come back and we're gonna start doing some overlay work. Do not fasten off this yarn, when you get to the end. So let's get there now. Okay so now we're all the way back. Now my cruiser friends, where you're going to struggle, if you're going to screw up your count at all, we'll be right where you did the slip stitching, when you finished off your circle. Make sure, that your don't including that slip stitching as an extra stitch. That's where people go wrong in circles. So there should be eighteen sets of three going all the way around. So let's count together. I haven't done that yet. So let's, if I'm screwing up you'll see it live on camera. So one two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen and eighteen. Eighteen is your magic number my friends. So am I reminding you of Sesame Street? (Mikey singing) One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. So, what you're going to do, is that you want just to pull up a loop and let it hold. In the pattern that says to fasten off, but you don't need to. So this is kind of your ad libbing. This is where tutorial comes into play. If you went up over top of their starting strand, I want you to get rid of that, because you'll end up with all these tails at the end. But if you went over top of it, you should be good to clear that out. Let's grab our next color which would in my case will be Mardi Gras Green, and this pat, or color on camera will be called Kelly Green. So if you're using Caron One, One Pound it's Kelly Green. Let's bring back our green now, or bring up our green, and let's start round number five. We're now going to begin our overlay. So now that you have your large loop, I want you to start in right here. If you're left-handed it was, it'll still be where I'm pointing. So what I want, is that I want you to create a slipknot. Create an extra long strand because you'll have to get rid of that later okay, and insert onto the hook. So my cruiser friends, I noticed some of you don't know where to stick your hook.(Mikey giggles) (more giggling voice)\"I'm gonna tell you where to stick your hook\". Okay, so here we go. So this is where we have the strand coming out from the ball. Okay, I want you to stick your hook right where I'm pointing.. It is the third one, and I want you to stick it in behind. So I want you to find the third stitch back.(giggle) Okay, so look at it. You see this stitch, and I want you to bend it over, (giggle giggle) and go in from the back side of this stitch. Okay, so it's you're just attaching it. It's not a stitch, it's just attaching. Okay, so you should still have those stitches clear in the front. Okay, and I want you to wrap that hook, and attach it to the back. (giggle,giggle,giggle) So just pull through and through.That stabilizes this whole thing from falling apart. So let's put that straggler in behind. I'm continuing, I do not want a tail here. So now that it's attached you ready to play. So I want you to look directly(trying not to laugh voice)  between the two stitches, the two groups, and there's a lonely little stitch, all by itself that's the one you want to play. And then you're gonna skip the next one, and you're gonna go into the one that is in the next. So let's just start. It's going to be a treble. I know how you love your trebles. So wrap and wrap and it's a front post treble, into the one that is resting in between. So it's a front post treble. So go around it, and then just pull through, pull through two, two and two. Now if you can count to three, this is not a hard pattern for you. So let's just do that. So one, two and three.That's a chain, and I want you to skip to the next one that is directly in between the two groups. It's right there. So you're technically just skipping one. Wrap the hook twice, and coming through, and then pull through two, two and two. Do you see that? So chain three. So one, two, three, and then skip the next one, and go right into the one in between. So how many of these do you have going all the way around? That is the million dollar question, but there's no million dollars today. (Mikeys giggle)Mm-hmm. I don't make that kind of money. So what do we have? We're gonna chain three. So if you have eighteen sets, of three going all the way around, you should have eighteen of these, front post trebles, going all the way down. So what I want you to do is continue that all the way around, and we'll meet you at the other side. Because we strategically have to position this starting strand, in a way that we can still access it without interfering with this. So let's continue on. As I come back around you're going to notice that there's two sets here of threes, and this is where all of the strands coming from. So I want you to take that large loop, and the strand leading to the yarn ball, and put it in front of the work. If you don't put it in front of the work, it's not going to work for you. Trust me. So we're going to just chain three. So one, two, three, and now that that's leaning forward, I still want you to go and skip the next one down here, and front post treble, like that, and with them leaning forward both the loop and the straggler, I want you to chain three. One, two, three, and join it to the top of the first treble. If you do not put that forward now, what's going to happen is that you're going to interfere with this later on. So making sure that it's in front now will keep it out of the way. Now up until this moment, I've always been fastening off everything, but if you don't want to fasten off you don't need to. Just hold it in front now and fasten off. So using your darning needle, I want you to get rid of this green. So create that extra long tail, using the darning needle like I showed you before, and finish this off in the backside, so that it's not going to fall out. So do that, and I'll meet you back and we'll continue then to round number six. So now that your yarn strands are in front here, so that you didn't have to fasten off. Let, you will notice that this is almost like a cage. Okay, so you can see it's like a picket fence. It's just sitting in here. It's attached to where I asked you to do it, because it's easier to start off that way when it's attached. This is what the back looks like. Isn't that pretty? So this square can turn over to the back and not be too much of a problem for a visual. I want you now, to start up and get your hook ready, and I want you to pick up that loop and pull it back tight back to in a position. We're going to work in front of these chain three spaces, but before we do, let me zoom in. So to start this one, we're only going to play within these three stitches that you see. Okay, so. we need to, if we are, if these green ones need to be shifted around, this is when you're going to do it, and just shifting to make sure that you're catching all the stitches. You're going to chain three which counts as a double crochet, and in the next one here, you want to put two double crochets. So that's the middle one of this grouping of three. So the chain three was in the beginning of the grouping of three. So there's two into that one. And then the final one in that grouping of three is going to be one. So do you see why that you attached it in the back when you did the green? You would have interfered with this stitch. So the first one is one double crochet, two into the next, one. So what you're seeing with the green, I want you to shift it. So it should be resting right in between the next grouping of threes. So just shift it, and then just so that you can see the first one once again, and you're going to double crochet into that one. So by shifting it you're getting it into position and it's always going to stay there. So it's one double crochet. The next one has two, and then the final one of the grouping of three is going to be one double crochet by itself. Okay, so now here's the green, I want you to just shift it so that you can see the first one of the grouping of three, and double crochet. So see how you're not touching that green, at all? It's just as sitting there, and the next one will have two, and the final one will have one by itself. Just turn it over. So what you're seeing here, this is that green line I showed you in the very beginning. So it's just resting in behind. Isn't that awesome? So continue that same idea, going all the way around, for round number six. So I've now come up all the way around, and what you just need to do is that slip stitch to the top of the beginning, and all of your green has now been trapped into position. So pull up a large loop again, and we're going to then start, and I'm going to bring gold, because gold is going to be in the next overlay that sits in here as well. So let's move along then, to round number seven. So we're now going to begin an overlay once again. So this is the second time, and the last time it'll appear in this project. So create an extra long tail, and let me show you where to stick your hook. Now we did it before, we stuck it in the back. So we have a grouping of four. See with, this is where the strand is that we're resting. I want you to attach it to the second one in. Okay, so the second one, just bend it forward, and come in from the behind. Sorry, let's just put that on the hook first, and just bend it over, and get, just attach it to a fiber in the back. Okay, and this is just gonna stabilize it to hold it into position so that your first stitch looks accurate. Now technically, what you could have done, is that you can attach it down here, and chain up your four, and then that's a Front Post Treble. It doesn't look right. It's better that you attach it from the back. So now we're gonna do a Front Post Treble, and we're gonna go into the middle one of the grouping of three. So this is the last round that you did, we're going to come into this round right here. Okay, so just look straight down, and Front Post Treble into the middle one. It should be directly in between the green, that you see. Now because the circle is bigger, I want you to chain four. So one, two, three and four. Remember the last time it was three? It's now four, because the circle is bigger. I want you to skip, in between the next set of greens, and go to the middle one, in the purple, and Front Post Treble. Do you see that? Chain four. Again, coming to the next set of greens, look right, and it's the middle one and I want you to do that all the way around, for round number seven. So please do that, and I'll see you at the end of this round. Make sure you just ah, stick with me to the very end, so I can show you what to do again with this straggler, or with the starting strands that we did with the purple. I'm now coming around to the end. I wanna take the loop and the yarn leading to the ball, put it in front of your work. If you leave it in behind, you're going to be in trouble. You still need to chain your four, and attach it to the top of the first Front Post Treble. So now your, one right in the front here is going to be ready for you when you're ready to go. I want you to fasten off the yellow. Use your tapestry needle, and then join me back here and then we'll continue with the purple, one last time. So let's just pull our loop back up, and this strand here in the loop should be in front of the project. You can't move it um, if it's not in the front now, you can't move it once this has been secured. So that's why we moved in in front. So let's ah, continue along. So what I wantcha to do, we're in the top of the first stitch, and then there's the second, you see this overlay and then there's another one in behind, and another one. Okay, so there's a total of four them. So if you turn it over you can see all four of those here. So what we have to do, the cruisers that are working on this, this is where, if any place their screwing up, this is where it is. You're going to chain three which counts as a double crochet. You are going to double crochet in the next purple one. Okay, now, remember how we shifted the green? You need just to shift this yellow out of the way closest to your hook, and I want you to double crochet in the other two stitches that are left in that same section. So you're essentially just skipping over the yellow so that it gets into position. So now we have four stitches complete. The fifth stitch, is right in the space where these two groups meet, so go right into that space, and that's a double crochet. So let's begin again. So the first two are double crochet right into the purple. So one, and go to the next stitch for two, shift that yellow, so that you can see the other two stitches that are in that same group. It's being sandwiched in between. Do you see that? And then, you're going to double crochet into this gapping space that is in between the two groups. So you're essentially pushing this yellow in behind. Let's just review one more time. So the first two stitches, are in this purple. One, and two. Shift the yellow closest to your hook, so that you can see the other two, and double crochet into those two as well, and then go into the gapping space that is resting in between the two groups. And I want you to continue that all the way around, and you're going to notice that you have your two strings, or your two bands of color all the way around, and you'll see that the bursting is happening before your very own eyes. So without further ado continue that, and I'll see you at the end of this round. So let's take a quick measurement now. I've gone further in the tutorial than i should of, but um, I just put this right back in the tutorial where it should be. So after you get the three done, it is approximately four inches. Now if it's three and, uh, 3.75 inches, I wouldn't worry about it. If it's 4.25, I wouldn't worry about it so much. But if you're seeing a considerable difference. If your square, if your circle at this point is more than four inches, like say it's five, you're going to have to adjust your hook to make it smaller to compensate for the uh, size, and then just do the three rounds again, and see if you've gotten closer to the four. Now if your circle is much smaller like a three, then what you wanna do, is that you want to increase your hook size and then just redo these three rounds once again, and try to get as close to the four as possible. And I'm only telling you that, because on the ship, people that don't pay attention to that, you end up with squares that are significantly smaller and squares that are way too big. So just take a time, and just do your first one to get your size crochet hook that is going to match this particular moment. So now that I'm coming all the way back around, do not forget that you have a gapping space, when you started you were in the very first one. So you have to finish off by putting a double crochet in that gapping space, and then just join it to the top of the first chain three that you started with. Now take your time. Get rid of the loose end, and fasten this off. Because now we're going to then um, continue along and we're still going to do one more circle, and then we're going to start transitioning into a square. So please do this now. Let's move along to round number nine. Let's create a slip knot and, the written instruction has it stated differently, but the result is still the same. So this is where the tutorial comes into play. You can attach to any one of these particular stitches, any ones good. Here's what I'm gonna recommend. Just for simplicity, and I wrote it a certain way, so that you can keep in track with the pattern. But because this is a tutorial, I can show you how to cheat. So, I want you to attach to any stitch, and I want you to chain three, which counts as a double crochet. In the same one I want you to double crochet one more time. So you have two into that same one. So the repeat pattern, going all the way around, is that the next four will be by themselves. So one, and two. See how I'm going up over top of the stitch work as well? Keep it out of the way, and underneath the stitches. So four in a row are by themselves. Once you get those four done, the next one will be two into the same one. So the repeat pattern going all the way around, is gonna be two into the first one, and then one into the next four, two into the first one, and one into the next four. Please do that all the way around for round number nine. So we're coming up near to the end. I got my two in here. That means that there's four left. Now I'm going to show you something. If, you do not have, and you've accidentally missed a stitch ah, along the way. Don't frog. You don't need to. Just try to make it work. Like just make a work. (\"work\", said in soprano voice) Um, just try to do your very best to be able to make sure it does work. If you're left with an extra stitch, just put two stitches together. So let's just say that these, I had, I have an extra stitch. How you do that is that you just wrap the hook going in pull through, and then wrap the hook again, go into the next one pull through, and then pull through all three. So you just created a together stitch. My case my stitch count happens to be right. I will be very transparent with you, when I was doing this, I wasn't always right, and so therefore I, I kind of fudged it along the way. And that's what creators do. Right? We just make it work and we have a really good time in doing it. Right? So that's the story I'm sticking with it today my friends. So we're going to um, just slip stitch then, the very final one, to the top of the first chain three, and this gold is done. So what I want you to do is fasten off again, and we're gonna start transitioning to a square next. It's really not hard to transition to a square, but you really you've got to keep an eye on your counts. So I'm going to weave in my ends, and let's begin doing the square. So don't have fear. Let's jump on this together next. So, let's begin round number ten.  Gonna start off with a slip knot.  Now the, the transition to a square is over three rounds.  So it can't be be just one. The counts that I did make sense, and they're actually easy to remember. So when you're working on this, maybe the first few, maybe be harder for you to remember, but once you get pounding these out, actually it becomes very simple, and then actually I was on the plane doing it, without actually looking at the instructions. And I'm not sure how many times that would, I can use the word actually in one sentence, but I'm doing a really damn good job of it. (Mikeys giggle) Just ask Jeanne, she hates it. Okay, so let's continue. So, I'm sticking my hook into any one of the stitches, and we're gonna start off with the corner. So we're just gonna attach, and I want you to chain a total of five. So when you do a total of five, that counts as a double crochet and chain two.  So let's just do that. So one, two, three, there's your double crochet. Four and five, and that is your double crochet and chain two. In the same stitch, I want you to place another double crochet. So each one of the corner stitches, on this one here, comprise of one double crochet, chain two, one double crochet. So we're now going to move along this side. So, you're going to notice, that it's going to start changing it to a square, but it's not immediate. So you just have to be patient with it, and keep an eye on those counts. So let's begin. We're gonna double crochet in the next four. So let's just do that together. So one, two, three and four. Now, we're gonna double, we're goinna half double crochet in the next six. So let's do the next six together. The reason why we're changing the heights, is that we have to compensate for the radius of a circle. So the next six are going to be half double crochets. So let's count those out together. So one, two, three, four, five and six. And now we're going to single crochet for six. So I try to keep it simple. So six half double crochets, the next six are singles. So one, two and three. We're now halfway through, the side of the square. So let's continue. So four, five and six. The next six, is gonna be a mirror of what we just did. So the next six, is six half doubles. So one, two, three, four, five and six. And now the next four are double crochets. So let's do that. So one, two, three and four. And to finish this off we have a corner. So the corner is going to be a double crochet, chain two, double crochet into the same stitch. So when you push this down, do you see? You've gotten wider here, where the corners are. In, and you see why it's going to take a few rounds in order to get back to the square. I'm going to show you one more side. And then you can reverse the video back, for the other two sides that are remaining. So let's carry on into the next one. Watch this slip stitching. I just happen to land there. Make sure that you don't accidentally, add another stitch. So the first four are double crochets. One two, three and four. The next six, are half double crochets. So one, two, three, four, five and six. The next six, are your singles again. So let's do that do that. So you have one, two, three. This is the halfway point, of the side. Four, five and six. And now we're going back to half doubles for six. So we're going to do one, two, three, four five and six. And then, the next four, are double crochets. So one, two, three and four. And the next one is your corner again. So it's going to be a double crochet, chain two, double crochet into the same one. So you can reverse the video back to where we were right here, and begin all again, to do the next one. So you're going to notice it's gonna start looking more square. It's not quite there. And I want you to continue the rest of this round and meet me back here in just a moment. So coming all the way back around, I've got my six half double crochets in.The final four stitches are here, and those are going to be double crochets. So one, two, three and four. And I want you to slip stitch to the third chain up, on your corner. Pull through, and through. And that's what it looks like. So if it's a little bit buckling on you, it will settle down, and uh, you're gonna see it's starting to come out with your little points. So let's move along then, to round number eleven, as we continue. So we have two more rounds, to make this square, all the way to the end. So let's move along to round number eleven. In round number eleven, we're going to start ourselves in the corner, but in the corner, we're not there yet. So we have to slip stitch there first. So slip stitch to your first corner, so just pull through and through, and now you're ready to go. So we're going to start off then, in the corners, for this time around. Is that, in corners, it'll be two double crochet, chain two ,two, two double crochet. So let's chain up three which counts as a double crochet, and then you're gonna double crochet one more time, and then chain two, and two more double crochets, all into that same chain two corner space. So the counts of the stitch heights are going to change as we move along. So let's uh, follow along. So the first three are going to be double crochets. So one, two and three. Okay, the next six are going to be half doubles. So you got one, two, three, four, five and six. And then the next ten are single crochets. I know that's a lot, right? But we're getting closer and closer to being a flat space. So where, we have to take our time. So let's do ten single crochets. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Okay? The next three are half doubles. So one, two, three, four, five and six are half doubles. The remaining three that you see, you see that? Is a double crochet. So one, two and three. Now we're moving to the corner. So the corners are always going to be the same, of two double crochets. So one and two, chain two, and two double crochet into the corner. I'm going to go one more side with you. So when you push it down like so. You see that you're getting more and more flatter, along the sides of the edge, to create that square. Let's just do one more side together, and then you can reverse the tutorial back, if you haven't picked it up yet. So the first three in a row, are going to be double crochets. So one, two and three. The next six, are going to be half double crochets. So we have one, two, three, four, five and six. Now we're back to the singles for ten. So let's do that. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and ten. Okay, the next six are half doubles. So one, two, three, four, five and six. And then the final three, are each a double crochets. So one, two and three, and then your corners. Do you remember what those corners are? They're  two double crochet. So one and two, chain two, and two double crochet again. So one and two. So you can reverse back this video to get yourself back to this starting, to figure this out again, if you haven't picked it up yet, and then meet me back here at the end of this round and I'll show you what to do. We have one more transitional to do. To a do, to get to a final square. and then we're going to do our final border together. So I'm coming up all the way back around the final three stitches is your double crochets. You already have the first corner start uh, done, and then you're just gonna slip stitch to the first one of the chain three. We're now going to then go on into round number twelve. So round number twelve, is again another transition. So if you put this down you see that it's almost a square. Now when I was designing this I was gonna say, okay this is good enough, but it's not. You need to get a little bit more height on these edges, in order for you to have the square look that you have in the final assembly. Okay, so don't be cheap. Maybe that's not the right word. But don't be uh, don't be lazy about it. That was, I'm more saying that for myself because I was going to do that. So we're going to slip stitch to ourselves to a corner. So one, and go right into a corner chain two space and then begin again. So we're going to chain up three counts as a double crochet and this corners like it's going to be for the remaining. So it's going to be a total of another double crochet. So you got to chain two, and two more double crochet into the same one. So the stitch count is going to change once again, so what we have, is that we have double crochet for the first three. So one, two and three. The half double crochet is going to change to only doing five of them. So we have one, two, three, four and five. Now, we're very close to getting it a nice flat space. So the next sixteen are single crochet. So let's count it together. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen and sixteen. So you can see that it kind of went flat, on the top. See? Isn't that a miracle, not really. it's mathematics. So the next five are half double crochets. So one, two, three, four and five. And then the final three are double crochets. So one, two and three. And now your corner. The corners are always going to be the same. So it's going to be two double crochet. So one and two, chain two, and two double crochet. So I'm going to take you through one more side, and then you can reverse back the video if you haven't picked it up yet. So the first three are double crochets. So one, two and three. The next five are halves. So we have one, two, three, four and five. The next sixteen are singles. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen and sixteen. The next five are half double crochets. So one, two, three, four and five. And the final three that you have left, is one double crochets. So one, two and three, and then your corners next. The same as always. So chain, ah sorry, two double crochets, chain two, and two double crochet. Please do the other two remaining sides. Just reverse back this um, this to right here. So go back, and then you're gonna see that your square is pretty much, your circle has gone to a square. So please do that for the remaining two sides and meet back here, and we'll do the final round together. Which will complete off your celebration square and we can celebrate good times together. So returning back around the final three stitches, or double crochets, no extra math done here, this is just the way the stitch count works out. So everything should be good. So you're going to finish off your green here, fasten in those loose ends. And I want you then to do one more round, which is the border round, in order to complete off your square together. So let's uh, do that next, and  fasten off, and let's do our final round, for round number thirteen. So let's do our final round. Lucky number thirteen. And it's now time to celebrate good times, because this is it for the final for you, you and then you're bring these here on the ship. Now you'll find in the instructions that I will attach the final border. For those that are not attending the cruise. You can figure out how to do that. Just a very simple way, of a simple border, At the very end. You're just going to insert your hook with your yarn into the chain two gapping space of a corner, and chain a total of three, which counts as your double crochet, you know that by now, in this part of the tutorial. So you're going to chain two, to turn the corner, and two more double crochet. So, you really don't have to count other than the corners at this moment. So each stitch going all the way across, is going to be one double crochet in each. The first stitch is just ah, right there. Just go right up over top of your stragglers. The best way that you can handle this project, is to deal with the stragglers. I call them stragglers, but it's the loose ends, right off the bat, so you don't have a million tails to be able to get rid of at the very end. One thing you're going to notice. Is that as you transition from double crochet to um, half double, which is the next one. The stitch doesn't always look right, and that's just because it's just switching stitches. So just make sure you still stick your hook in the right stitch, in order to get that to work. So it's one double crochet in each of the stitches going all the way across, and then in the next corner it's two double crochet, chain two, two double crochet, and carry on. Please do that all the way around, and I'll see you at the end of this round. Ans we'll celebrate good times, and finish this tutorial off together today. So I'm now just coming all the way back around. I'm double crocheting myself to where it started, and that's it. So my cruise friends this is where your journey ends. You're going to get your nine done, and make sure you bring them to the ship with you. (Mikeys giggle) You don't ever want to pack your luggage and forget this, especially if you're going to put time into it. And for those that would like to continue, if you go to the more information of this video, there's going to be a link, and the link will have more instruction on how to assemble and uh, just a really quick easy border to be able to do.The cruisers on the ship will be assigned an idea,of being able to go and do more extra fun things with their border. You're the creator. You're the artist. You can decide what works for you. I kind of left it an open free-for-all, in the sense that you have a choice on what you want to do. One thing with creativity is that you never want to be forced to feel like you have to do something. Um, creativity comes to you when, when sparks of inspiration just hit you, and you have to listen to what is in your heart, and what you prefer to do. So I'm just weaving in those final ah, tails, right at the very end. Please do that, especially if you're a crochet cruiser bringing it on board. So that when somebody grabs your square from the community table, then your square will be completely done. Please just make sure that you just go through your project once again. If you want to block it, so if you can do a wet blocking. Let me just zoom out right now. If you want to wet block it, just damp it a little bit, and lay it out, and it will sit flat on you. Just go through, make sure there's no tails left within your project in order to just secure, and that's good to go. So for my crochet cruiser friends, we'll see you in February of 2019, there on the cruise ship in New Orleans, and uh, we are going to have a good time. We also um, make sure that you do sign up for the corporate hotel, if you need the hotel, and sign up for anything else, and be paying attention to our private crochet group, too. So on behalf of my friends at Joann.com, I'm Mikey from the Crochet Crowd. Thank you so much for joining me today. We hope that you've enjoyed this project. Until next time, have a good one, bye bye.", "IKFU22igmA4": "[Music] good morning everyone so today I wanted to try something different so you know a while ago about these purple eyeshadows from Anastasio about the gemstone enchanted and this is more of a burgundy pair for wedgies not today and I still haven't tried them still haven't done purple look I've pulled out some other ones that I've notice I have purple shadows in so this is the sleek palette called a vintage romance and I have few Purple's here some use these and also the tablet one because I thought am I used some of those matte ones in my crease because the other ones are all shimmer eyeshadows so I really don't have a clue I'm going to do it is it's going to be quite a cool look so he's probably I'm sure purple store beautiful and brown eyes I think I'm going to use first whimsical from makeup geek which is this gorgeous he said they afford eyeshadow that is like a cool pink so let's do that on a mobile lid or maybe more like here in the corner because I want to incorporate some of those purple ones on my mobile lid as well this one almost looks white it's got just very very slight tinge of pink to it okay I think now I'm going to take their gemstone from Anastasia it looks gorgeous but I'm a bit it is very very powerful I'm going to use some sort of flood breasteses bare essentials wet dry eye shadow brush and I'm going to put it here in the middle oh my god that's so gorgeous but a gorgeous eye shadow or blended later I remember I have not done this look before I'm just making it up as I go and now I think I'm going to take that anastasiya enchant it and I will try to work it out in any corner I'm not starting with my crease shadow because I will have to decide afterwards if to warm it up a bit with like a more brown eyeshadow or use a coal shadow some not sure yet let's take this makeup revolution e-102 because that will help me with my seven hmm Anastasio sideshow that also really really nice blend it a bit that is purple I'm going to build it up the same colors so they are nice and intense I've got now make Real Techniques shading brush now on a brush like this sort of liner eyebrow brush this one is unidentified one I'm going to go to this enchanted and put it closely so to my eyelashes defuse it a bit a bit of fallout here I'm going to go to that whimsical from makeup geek and put it here in my inner corner got a bit of Fallout have to be careful with pair for eyeshadows because maybe do ice first then then eyeshadow because you look like you're a black ice when you get fallout from that now I'm thinking to blended it blend it out with something and I don't have to warm it up a bit with like a brown eyeshadow I have to go to the Titan natural beauty which is sort of hope Braun lets try that yeah that works it's not so cool I'm going to go to my sleek palette into this purple this is beautiful palette he's so inexpensive Afghan long time tutorials with this palette and these purples in here are really good they are not to read and not to blow purple so now let's do a bit of of go purple eyeliner here from Kiko but I think I wonder the purple so much purple I will stay with my Maybelline black one I just scrub it into my luscious lash line hanging my waterline and mascara mikeycal fall 2.0 okay so that's the eyes done don't know what you think very purple but actually I quite like it now the challenge with that is lipstick because obviously I feel like I should have something nude but it can't be too peachy because you won't go with the purple if you make it too pink you will just look too much so I'm going to think a bit about the lipstick and applying that and that sort of stuff and I will see I have to think about it so I'll be back in the mouth okay so what I've decided to go for is the your ma veil lip liner the Smashbox lipstick in pretty social and the Revlon gloss in pink diamond it might be too pink but you know I'm sure some sort of pale nude would go with it but I can't be bothered sitting and trying them all on so let's try this so this is ma veil and it is sort of pink with like a movi undertone it's very light okay I love this lipstick this color this is very pale pink but it's a coping so that's the pretty social okay and then let's top it up with pink diamonds there okay so does the finish look let me know what you think it is very very powerful it's not something they are I often wear I do incorporate the darker purples like just marking my outer corner but I never go that purple so yeah quite like it oh I would say it's not a everyday look oh it is okay I hope you enjoyed it thank you so much for watching and stay fabulous bye", "7QlXTRX3AaM": "[Music] welcome back to another edition of

you know not putting up enough strain reviews and you know satisfying your need to find some good weed I'll just use my special getting half hours one more time anyway today we're lighting up the purple alien OG this [ __ ] is supposedly on some other planetary ship somewhere out in the universe somebody went and grew some [ __ ] and it's called purple alien og heavy indica body hi cush aroma and the flavor you know it's very reminiscent of some some OG but it's mixed with something and it gives it a slightly different flavor you know not necessarily sweeter and not any less just sort of sort of right in the middle it's very neutral you know like Switzerland there's something [Music] anyway um it's got big crystals on the buds very fat huge [ __ ] very sticky on the break up you'll need a grinder or some scissors and [ __ ] you don't want to be breaking it up what you think is you know I'm saying but you know you will have green tips if you do break it up with your fingers it's

what more can you ask for I mean you know hey we've smoked many 5s here you know rarely do we smoke threes and fours but this is a good floor right here it didn't quite reach the five range but I

examined it last week and i wrote a pattern for a braid that's a little bit different and let me show you hers amber is going to model my mom's beret this is you've probably seen this before if you watch my show i showed this a long time ago and i found this in her belongings after she died this is her design she designed this herself and she was always coming up with new things and she ended up making a lot of chemo caps if you know what those are the crocheted hats for ladies and men who are experiencing chemo and they lose their hair of course and so she designed uh several little hats but this one was a cute one this is a beret and you wear it to the side a little bit to the side but it still covers up your scalp in case you've lost your hair and the band around the bottom is a little bit thick for me i took this apart i didn't take it apart but i examined it and i wrote a pattern that would be a little bit less bulkier around the edge now she may have done that on purpose which she probably did but i wanted to make a braid that was a little bit flatter right here and fit a little bit closer to the head but i think that mom had the right idea she was using a motif pattern or granny pattern up here the three double crochets and one chain and i changed that to make my beret a little bit more drapey it's a little drapier and the transition between the band and the beret itself is a little bit smoother hers is a little bit rough right in here where she decreased i saved the decreases for the band and i decreased all around on the band so mine's just a different design uh hers is just fine but i wanted to make it a little bit different so amber thank you very much amber is my head model for mom's beret but i wanted to show you this i don't know if you can see it i'm hoping you can see that the back is just a little bit flat right here there's plenty of room to fit your hair under this beret it's got plenty of room in here i just like the way it fit a little bit better and of course i have a much larger head than my mother did so when i put that other beret on it's really quite small on me and it fits amber fine because her head is smaller but i have a 23 inch head and so i have to accommodate that with my patterns but in the pattern that i've released i have a way that you measure your head so it fits everybody just perfectly fine you can make it for a little girl or you can make it for a woman a teenager anybody you want to make it for and then this cowl that i have on is the ribbed cowl it is a rib stitch that stretches very very nicely i like the way it stretches and i designed it so that it would be very loose around your neck but warm and thick so it's also in a pyramid shape which is this shape and that way it fits your shoulders a little bit looser around the bottom and a little bit tighter up here around the neck but you can um certainly not do it that way you can use the optional directions that i wrote in the pattern and it's you can make it in the stove pipe shape which is just straight up and down a little bit easier to make a little bit faster because you don't have to keep up with decreases or increases so i wanted to bring this to you and show it to you i really like it it's nice and warm and i made it from malabrigo which is now my very favorite yarn for right now making a lot of things from malibrillo and i've also been sent a lot of malabrigo from knitcrate and it's sitting over there in my stash and i want to be sure that i use it up it's really nice this is called hypnotique that is the color of this particular yarn i have not been able to find this particular color on the malabrigo side on the eat sleep knit side on the knit crate side i can't find it i can't find this color but there are 30 colors of this that would be very beautiful there's some purples in there as well and they may have the same color just named it something different i don't know why they would do that but it could be that this was a specific color just for knitcrate that would be my guess so i've not been able to find this particular one but it's malabrigo rios or ios and you can find it on several sites and i'll put at least one link down here i'm not sponsored love malabrigo though because it's a very affordable luxury yarn and i call it that because it's about 15 a hank and on each hank is 210 yards of worsted weight very very nice it's very soft this is a washable yarn so you can make it for a child make something for a child out of it you can still wash it which is kind of nice it's not extremely delicate they're hand painted looking i mean they're very very beautiful hand-dyed i feel like they're hand-dyed yarns they're they're just gorgeous and you can always buy them in dye lots if you need to this particular one says no dye lot i made my archangel sweater from malabrigo and it actually used dye lots and when i went back to look there were two different dialogues and i just kept crocheting and then i started on the next hank and i can see a very subtle difference in the two pieces of the sweater and you may have been able to see that yourself but i'm not going to point it out to me it doesn't matter one bit now that the sweater is finished and if you're knitting a sweater it might show up more but nice crochet i really didn't notice that it showed up all that all that much but anyway this is a really nice yarn i'm going to order some more of it i i just really feel like the price at fifteen dollars a hank is very reasonable most hand-dyed yarns are approaching twenty dollars a hank plus shipping and all that so um i've found a supplier for beautiful yarns that i like to use and they just crochet up so beautifully and are easy to crochet with and if you'll notice they're just i love the deep colors that they have especially the rios there's some gorgeous colors there so you might try it just for one article it only took me two hanks to make this cowl and this beret and i had plenty left look i had plenty of that left i just used a little bit off of this particular ball of yarn but so it doesn't take all that much i just wanted to bring these to you i think i'm going to keep them on oh no i want to show you a finished object that i've made so let me slip that on and i'll show it to you another finished object that i completed this week was the purple party beret and i used a different malabrigo that knitcrate had sent i had two hanks of it and actually i only had one hang what am i saying i only had one hank and i had made the kimberly cow sideways with the first hank a long time ago probably three or four months ago i made this and it has actually let's see one two three four pattern repeats across you can make the kimberly cal sideways in several different ways and you can choose how wide you want to make it this one i made extremely wide it's really nice and warm and it's made from malabrigo worsted and this is another line of yarns by malabrigo i'm not sponsored this is called rosalinda that's the color i believe they still have this one out there is so beautiful and pink a tiny bit of purple in this not very much but i made the purple party beret in this let me show it to you i think it turned around a little bit so you can see it it's so comfortable i really like it and of course mostly that's the yarn but i do like the pattern that i designed for the beret so i made it again and only took me one evening and i'm serious i think i finished the the band the next morning but most of it was completed in one evening and it's very very warm and it matches the scarf that i already made but it's not the same stitch pattern and i like that this is a shell stitch pattern with windows see that and the beret is more of a three double crochet motif and some single crochet for the band so it makes the whole outfit a little bit more interesting to look at even though now that it's made with the same yarn so that really brings the two pieces together so you can mix and match my patterns any way you want and you can make them out of the same yarn and they look really really nice together nice for a gift to give to somebody if you have a couple of hanks lying around of some kind of yarn that you really like you can make a beret and a cow or a beret and a scarf or somebody for christmas it's a very very nice gift to give and if you use a nice yarn a nice soft yarn they'll really appreciate that so much a couple of weeks ago i released a pattern called a snood and cow pattern and love that snood that was something uh unusual it's sort of like a beret only wear it on the back of your head and it holds your hair in a kind of a little pouch very very popular back in the 40s and i really enjoyed making it i made it it's called the pamela cow and snood and i modeled this on a video a couple of weeks ago and it was so warm on my head just about like that beret only it covers your whole head and it's another uh item that you can make if you're losing your hair or if you know a friend that's going through chemo you can make her a snood and it's just beautiful on i love it and you can make it out of a really nice yarn as i was saying before like i did with the um the other beret that i made but i wanted to show you this this is a readily available yarn called hometown it's by lion brand you've seen it probably at joann's or michael's i'm not sure who carries this i think it's joanne that carries the hometown i think i saw it in there just the other day when i was there joanne so hometown is a size 681 yards on the hank now i had a full hank and a partial hank and i started this with a partial hank and i finished up that and then i started in these aren't hanks these are skeins sorry i i started on this one had quite a bit left i'm not sure if i have enough for a snood on this one i i may not try that but i wanted to make the cowl because um it's a super bulky cow and you can make this literally in one evening for a friend and it only probably just takes one skein of yarn of hometown and if you have a coupon for joanne's you can get this at a very reasonable price and make these for a really nice gift for christmas for your friends i'm probably going to do that myself i'm sort of getting up a little collection and i'll be giving these to my girlfriends that i exchange presents with every christmas and i hope they're not watching i don't think they do they're not crocheters but i'm the only lonely there that crochets in that group but it allows me to give them a nice gift at christmas and i can talk about it and i'll never know so this is the pamela cowl and very easy to make it's just different stitch patterns throughout and a very simple project and you make it in the flat so you just make a big rectangle and then you flip it together and i sewed this one with a needle and yarn even though it's this huge yarn i have a needle with the big enough eye that i put that through and i sewed up the back and it really looks better than trying to do a slip stitch slip stitch with this yarn is very very bulky so i would suggest using a needle and yarn to sew this up and it takes literally one evening it just goes so fast and all you really need is a very large hook now i believe i use this one the pq on this um you have to invest in one they're about ten dollars or more i'm not really sure how much they are i think i don't know if you can even get these at joann's she may carry these now or they may carry these now joanne's may carry these now but you can buy them on amazon and i'll put a link down in the description box you can use my link because i'm an amazon affiliate and that helps me out a little bit it doesn't cost you any more or you can go straight to amazon and shop for your own but this is the pq it's a 15 millimeter hook very very easy to work with i like this because it's ergonomically shaped see how it's shaped it's easy to grab and i never have hand paint when i'm using this particular hook because it's just so easy to maneuver so you might consider that using the home town this is a color called washington denim very pretty goes with blue jeans tan red any color you can wear this with and it it and it looks really really nice and a gift is a beautiful gift to give to somebody it's not hard to make and you don't have to do a lot of measuring you can you know make it a little bit bigger if you think somebody is taller or larger and needs a bigger cow you just chain up a little bit more there are no stitch counts in my patterns now onto some whips i want to show you this it's the city tweed dk weight obsidian is the color and it's the city tweed from knit picks you can get this yarn from knit picks they have lots and lots of colors in the city tweed it is gorgeous let me show this to you on the ball this is the dark gray it's called obsidian it has little bits of tweed in there i really like it because there's plenty of other color in there it's really beautiful and i'm coming up with a pattern that i wanted to have lots and lots of texture in the sweater i didn't want it to just be plain i wanted to have plenty of texture and i felt like with a tweed a ribbed texture might be nice you can see what i've done with this so far this is the first few inches of my sweater it is using a back loop process and if you all know what that is you'll know exactly how to do this but this is a very stretchy fabric it makes it look how stretchy that is it's almost like a knitted fabric and it's similar to the ribbed cowl that is in my newest pattern i really like it because it just stretches so well it's not tight at all and so this is the beginnings of a new sweater and i really love it i'm going to use a contrasting color on here in a couple of places and just got inspired one day and decided i was looking at my stash and i saw that i had all that city tweed up there have several colors a couple of colors in sweater quantities and so i thought well i just really need to do that i bought some other colors that i can use for contrast so i'm going to do that with this i might even use a green or a red just as a tiny little piece of contrast around the sleeves maybe or the neck and or the neck so that's where i'm going with that i just wanted to show you that this is the beginnings of a new sweater i love it i i will work on this while i'm on the phone because it's just straight back and forth for right now i'm not going to shape the sweater i'm just going to make it straight and it might be a little bit cropped and a little bit boxy so we'll see how that goes now on to my yarn review i saw several youtubers that were working with the new yarn and it is so odd it is just a strange yarn it's called bernat plentiful if you've seen this in joanne's it's a real odd looking yarn and it is an odd yarn to work with and i decided that i would make one of my existing patterns with it and see if i could get it to come out i'm using the cardi vest pattern and this i made with the karen latte cake and so soft but very stretchy very furry i thought well this might be a good one to try with the burnette plentiful yarn so i had seen crystal on bag of day and one other pamela's adora adoring crochet i saw that she had been to the store and bought this i think she went to the store and bought it anyway i found two colors that i really liked and so i ordered them online and picked them up at my joanne's over by the mall and i wanted to show you this one it's called mystical and it is a multi-colored stripy but not oddball stripes it's really nice colors in this kind of blue and a little bit of burgundy some gray all kinds of colors and the the yarn is actually i'm going to hold this up there so you can see it these are as big as my head i mean when i saw them i thought wow that is a big ball of yarn this is a five bulky weight yarn and it is made from 60 acrylic 20 wool and 14 polyester so it's all kinds of things mixed together 952 yards and it says on here that you can actually machine wash and dry this i'm not sure i would ever ever do that i might send it to the dry cleaners if i needed to clean something i guess it'd be worth a shot now i have done quite a bit of crocheting and this is all that i've used up i'm pulling from the center it had a really nice center pull i didn't have to hunt for it or anything it was very nice now let me show you the yarn itself if you haven't seen this this is the lightest weight yarn you can imagine it's just like a air and there's a center uh piece of yarn in there or string i don't know what it's made from but it has a huge halo on it and i'm gonna put my hand behind it see if you can see this there's a huge see all that fur on there it's very very furry and has a huge halo on it and it's uneven so every now and then you see that kind of the little ball of yarn there you that little ball of fuzz that you get and then some places there isn't much fuzz at all and then there's a whole bunch so in order to make something from this and i was just challenged by it i just wanted to do something with it because it's so odd and i didn't know what to do with it at first and i thought well this yarn is so furry i like this color too this is a blue that was in there see sometimes it's really really furry sort of like homespun by lion brand but it's not even and homespun's a little bit more even than that so i had to figure out what i was going to do with it so i decided on the cardi vest because it's a very easy pattern to make it's not full of decreases and increases you don't have to see your stitches as much so i'm making the cardi vest out of this and i've gotten quite a ways with it i'm going to make it a little bit shorter than my other one it's not quite as long and this is what it looks like so far i'm going to just roll this across so you can see it there's some green in there there's some cranberry color kind of a cranberry color and some blue there's a lot of nice beautiful blues in this i like the blue and there's a little bit of brown right there as well now if you'll notice the stitches that i'm using are very wide and apart so what i'm doing here is i'm using this from my cardi vest pattern the way i measured it and everything where it's going to be structured but when i'm you i'm using double crochet to make this i think the cardi this is made from half double crochet but this is made with double crochets and to make each double crochet i went into between the stitches on the previous row there are no chains between these stitches it's just stitches made and i'm using an l hook with this so the stitches are made by going into in between the stitches in the row below can you see that right there see where my thumb is you're going into that hole there to place your stitch so that way you're not trying to find the top of the stitch below this is an impossible yarn i think to work with on any kind of a detailed scale so that's how i'm actually working with this i'm using a double crochet into the two stitches below on that particular row now the first row you chain up your length that you need and then you do have to find the the stitches in order to put your first row in order to crochet your first row you have to find your stitches along the the chain and i stitched a half double crochet in each chain to start and the next row i did an another row of half double crochet and then i switched to double crochet um inserting between the two half double crochets in the row below all the way to the end and of course chain two at the end and uh putting your first stitch into that opening below the chain two and that'll get you to the other side of your piece now i've already started the split where i split from the back to the front and it will be fairly easy to finish i'll probably have that finished by monday i'd like to be wearing it on my video on monday now the other color i i purchased is called blood orange and it is gorgeous i wish i had started out with this one i might have to make another cardi vest in this color is so beautiful and i really don't want to try to make anything difficult the ball band actually has a pattern on one of the ball bands there was a pattern for a knitted sweater now those of you who knit knock yourself out but there's no way i would knit or crochet a sweater with this because it would just have too many opportunities to make mistakes and especially if you're a beginning crocheter you might make a straight up and down scarf pattern with this or something like that and a large large hook like you might use a an mn hook even a pq hook to use with this being a number five bulky it lends itself to very large projects straight up and down projects like my cardi vest that's an easy one to make and i just i just had to try it because i had seen some people using it and i thought you know that's an unusual yarn i think i'm going to try that so that's what i'm working on this weekend hopefully i can finish my cardi vest and be wearing it monday if all goes well i'll be doing that now if you have small children or children in school or grandchildren in school sometimes they'll come home with a magazine promotion and they want you to buy a magazine subscription and i do that when my grandsons approach me with one of those i usually try to find things that i like and there were two crochet magazines on this particular september's order and i ordered those two and then i decided i wanted one more magazine i was trying to help the little fellow out so i bought another magazine called just cross stitch and this came the other day i was just really surprised i had forgotten that i had ordered it and this is a magazine that is absolutely full of great cross stitch patterns and the patterns are all in the book actually here is a page that shows all the different cross stitch patterns and this is a beautiful one with cardinals in it i love cardinals they're my favorite bird and that's really something that would tempt me if i was wanting to start a cross stitch project unfortunately i have several already in the works but i'm not been working on them very diligently because i'm crocheting but i wanted to show you this particular magazine if you are a cross stitch fan and you like that hobby this is an awesome magazine i really like it it's called just cross stitch and on the front is the cardinal cross stitch pattern it's in the book you can the patterns in there with all the colors that you need to make this and even the name of the fabric which i find sometimes is lacking in some cross stitch patterns they don't really tell you exactly which fabric to use and where to buy it and so i hate to spend time trying to find the right fabric i'm just not as patient as i should be with cross stitch but there's some really cute patterns here for christmas as well i'm sure there are lots of christmas patterns out there for everybody to use in different hobbies but these are really really exquisitely nice they are very beautifully done there's nothing cheap looking with this is so nice i really like these i really like these patterns and you know me i like a good crochet magazine but cross i read every every page in this even though i'm not actively cross stitching right now i'm looking at every page and when i go back to it for some small projects i might like to pick up some of these and work on them i did like this harvest sampler i thought that was really pretty this is has words on it and also the colors are just beautiful and for thanksgiving you can put that next to your thanksgiving table and it would just be a very nice addition or hang it on the wall during thanksgiving in your kitchen or in your dining room very very beautiful i wanted to bring that magazine to you because um eventually in the future i might be giving one or two of these away i like to keep this one because it's the christmas version of the magazine and if i was cross stitching that might be the time of year when i i am more active with it but right now i'm not able to start any more projects as you can see i have 25 whips going right now and i'm going to have to prioritize again which i do every so often i'll go through my whips and i'll say you know do i really need that or should i really work on that or should i put that in time out and i might start doing that actually in the next week or two and what i've been trying to bring you is some good ideas for christmas gifts that you can give to your family and friends and that they would be very appreciative of i think even people who are not totally crochet worthy would appreciate a nice cowl or a beret or a hat there are lots of beanie hats on the web that you can crochet i prefer not to so i've already put out my snoot and my beret those are the two that i'm offering this year and if you're interested in using those you can certainly buy my patterns but there are lots of others out there that you can use and combine them with all different kinds of cows as well with the beret made in this stitch pattern and the cow made in this stitch pattern they go beautifully together look at that because you made them out of the same yarn so i know that's kind of a no-brainer but i wanted to bring that to you because it's a great way to use your favorite patterns like if you really like a certain scarf pattern or a certain hat pattern you can make that with the same yarn so i hope you've enjoyed the video please hit the like button because that tells youtube that you're interested in what i'm talking about and

how to make this cozy crochet Afghan in under 8 hours so this crochet Afghan is really simple requiring only two basic stitches which are the chain stitch and the single crochet stitch so if you can do those two stitches you can make this Afghan the only thing that makes it a little more complicated is the fact that I used different colors to create the pattern but again I'll show you how I change those colors it's really simple and that's why this Afghan can really be completed in under 8 hours because it is such a simple stitch that you could basically I just satin crocheted it while I was watching TV really without thinking about it the yarn that I used is the Burnett blanket yarn buy your inspirations it's a very thick yarn so it helps you to be able to finish the Afghan a lot sooner than you would with a thinner yarn for this Afghan I used three skeins of the cream one skein of the maroon and one skein of the brown but please know that there was definitely quite a bit of maroon and brown left and you will also need a nine millimeter crochet hook a small pair of scissors and a yarn needle and last but not least if you'd like a written copy of this free pattern please check out the description below I'll link to a written pattern on my website okay let's get started create your loop and crochet ninety three chain stitches single crochet into the third chain from the hook then chain one then skip one chain and single crochet into the next one then you're going to do a chain again skip a stitch single crochet into the next one so what you're doing is you're creating sets of single crochets and chains and every time you have a chain stitch you're skipping a stitch on the bottom that's creating a gap now this stitch I believe is either called the moss crochet stitch or the granite crochet stitch so you can look those up if you're not sure of what I'm telling you to do okay so you're going to continue that stitch all the way to the end of the row at the end of the row you should end with a single crochet do not add a chain at the end of the row you'll end with a single crochet then you will chain two to make your turn that's your base row now for all future rows you're going to single crochet into the gap or the space that you created with the chains then chain one then single crochet into the gap chain one single crochet into the gap and repeat that all the way across that's what you're going to do for every row from now on at the end of every row you should always end with a single crochet chain two and turn now to change colors what I do is they take the color that I want to switch to and I line the yarn up with the yarn I was previously using so you can see here in this picture I'm lining up the maroon yarn with the white yarn and then I'm pulling both of the yarns through the next loop at the end be sure to leave a little bit of a tail of the new color yarn then pull just the new color yarn through to create a chain pull those all nice and snug and tight and then cut off the old color yarn then you'll just chain two and continue on with the same stitch that you've been doing all along you'll chain your two you'll turn your work you'll a single crochet into the gap then you'll chain then you'll single crochet into the gap and you'll continue on later on we'll worry about weaving in all those extra ends and you can see that depending on how many rows of a color you do the stitch comes out looking kind of like a weave which i think is pretty cool so as to not make this video too long I will write down in the description how many rows of each color I am doing in this Afghan to make it easy for you but again don't forget that I'll put a copy of this written free pattern on my blog so there'll be a link in the description below to that as well [Music] when you finish all 105 rows we will use the yarn needle and the scissors and we will begin weaving in all the little loose ends what's really great about this yarn is that you can just weave it in and out a few times and clip it off and it'll be lost forever they really it'll really never come undone it really weaves in well and it's really hard to find the ends so don't ever plan on taking these blankets out once you've made them and as you can see I'll weave in in one direction and then come back almost like it's creating a knot so that it really doesn't it really is permanent once it's done you can see how many times I go in and out it's worth the extra effort to go back and forth like that so you'll continue around the entire edge of the blanket weaving in all the loose ends you'll also make sure that you weave in any loose ends that where you had to change over to a new skein of yarn that might be throughout the blanket somewhere and once we're done weaving in all the ends then we're going to crochet our border around the edge the border is just as simple as the rest of the blanket you're going to do your loop and you'll connect somewhere in the middle on one of the two ends I like to do it in the middle so that you can't see where you started or ended to connect you'll just do a slip stitch and chain two you'll go into the gaps that you created from your stitches like you did on every other row and you're simply going to do the same exact stitch single crochet into the gap and then chain one single crochet into the gap and chain one you're gonna do that all the way around the blanket the only difference is that in each of the corners you're going to do two soyou'll single crochet chain single crochet chain in every corner now when you're going down the sides you want to do your single crochets into the gap that's created between the row changes and it's pretty apparent when you start crocheting it you should be able to see it there'll be a little bit of a gap there so it's going to be if it's really easy to see when it's a color change like if it's between a cream and a brown row it's pretty easy to see that gap but you'll get the hang of it once you start doing it and especially if you're a somewhat advanced share [Music] and last but not least when you get around the end you'll simply slip stitch to connect and you'll not it all up and leave all those extra loose ends in and enjoy your Cosi crochet thanks so much for watching please like and subscribe great [Music]", "q0GpF9BPkCc":

that the segment is finishing up press stop and crochet the instructions and then press play again to continue along in your project so this is a 48 inch diameter Afghan and this is more meant for home decor for your holiday gift-giving it could also be done as a cute little toddler little blanket as well it's big enough for that so it's really kind of a neat idea and it's using the art form our tapestry crochet where we hide one yarn strand use the other and then keep switching it back and forth it's really quite an easy design and this is called the peppermint pinwheel Afghan now the nice thing about this particular Afghan is that you can make it bigger so 48 inches isn't going to do it for you you can also do a much bigger design the way that I've designed it will continually grow and stay flat just like this so you're going to be using a 6 millimeter size J crochet hook and in order to play for this particular pattern that we're working on you only need two balls of Karen one-pound yarn there's so much yarn on those things that you only need one ball of one color and one ball of another but if you want to change the design to make it bigger then you obviously have to get more yarn because I've designed it so that you don't run out of yarn so I'm going to be giving some options let's talk about that quick so in today's video I'm going to be giving you some options this will not be written anywhere so unless you're watching this video you won't even know about it so you see how that I have a solid color right in the center if that bothers you I'm going to be showing you how to do this but I'm going to also show you how to make it so that you can transition the color so it it starts right from the middle so this purple can go right to the middle like so so I'm going to have to starts to show you how to do this one and then I'll show you how this one this one's a little more fiddly it's harder to describe so I'm going to just show it to you on camera and you won't use any less yarn really as a result of doing that so it's only like one extra stitch it's like 6 extra stitches of the purple in order to make that out so we're going to be doing that we're also going to be giving you an option here is if you would like to have the spiral completely go out without changing so I have it changing every three rows if you want the spiral to go all the way out just like so you just have to do 28 rows right from the start one here so that include this one and go out 28 rows all together and then you will then stay in line with this pattern so I'm going to be teaching it with the tapestry crochet in the sense of changing these colors surgically as you see it now if you're doing the tapestry crocheted there is nine groups of these colors so for example this is one group okay this is number two okay and then number three and etc so there's a total group of nine of those that go all the way out and then that's going to be the end of week number one so for those that think that know what they're doing you can fast forward now and go to this set of instructions as we begin for those that would like tips on tapestry crochet on how to manipulate the yarn and things to look for then just stay tuned and we're going to cover that next but everybody else that knows what they're doing they just fast forward now and then we'll start then at that time so let's begin talking about the tips of using tapestry crochet so tapestry crochet is the art of carrying one yarn so I call it the travel yarn and so for example when we're using the purple here the pink is underneath just traveling underneath the stitches it's not directly behind the project it's right underneath the stitch right here so what we have to do is that we have to then switch out those yarns every time that we want to change the color so as we finish off the purple then we drop the purple then add the pink and then we do the pink and then etc so it's the art of just manipulating this so the neat thing about it is that you can actually see if you have the colors here you can actually see it carrying up underneath the back of a project on something like this looks completely different you can actually see that this is just a tail and that's hanging but you can actually see it more on the back side of the where it's caring so you can see it's not behind the project it's right underneath the stitches like so so it's one of those projects that it's more of a one-sided item when you're being able to go so we're using two different color colors you yarn so how do you prevent tangling we'll talk about that next so we have two strands of yarn that we're going to be playing with and the trick is is that you don't want to tangle yourself so that coming all twisted and all like this there's actually a really quick simple solution to this I kind of finally figured it out after all these years so what I realized is that if I put one yarn ball straight ahead of me probably about look at where I am okay and I put it there okay just right up I may put it on a coffee table or I may put it on an ottoman footstool etc and I'll put the first ball there then what I'll do is the second color I will put here okay right beside me on this side so when it's coming to the hands you'll notice that the yarn strands when they're coming so if the purple is up over there right now so the purple is up like so the purple will be coming from this direction okay and the pink will then be coming from this direction so whenever I need to switch the yarns out all I just need to do is just completely drop the work grab the yarn strand one and then continue if they're coming from the exact same spot it is so difficult it is a pain so think about where you want to position yourself and where your Garn is going to go and this will make your life so much easier and you'll be able to get this done much faster too about all the fuss so another thing to consider is counting oh my goodness do you not want to counter do you not want to count don't worry about it this is why I design this is so awesome so there's 12 pieces to the pipe so let's have an apple pie here and we can see that there's 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 12 so what we have here is that there's 12 pieces of pie and because there's 12 pieces of pie is that we can grow it out incremental II it's no different than a hat or anything like that that's round so what I did is that every time there's a color change it's whenever you're starting the next piece of the pie so when you're growing things out usually it's in sets of maybe six or it could be eight but in this case it's twelve so because there's twelve sections here that help it to grow the first stitch of the new slice of pie will always have to in the beginning and then the next one's are all single so there's two in the beginning and then the next one is our signal our single so as you grow this out even bigger see the first one is always going to have two whenever you have this and then the rest are all single until you get to the next group over here and then the first one is to again and the next ones are all single and you will do that continually all the way out until you get to your nine changes so there's B remember these are one two three four and I'm coming off camera now so there will be all the way to nine so there's three rounds that make up one group okay and there will be nine groups of that by the time you get there in the end of week number one so really you're not having an account you just have to look and every time you're going to switch the colors that the first one will always have two into the beginning so later on in this tutorial is but what I want to show it to you and I've already actually filmed this already once before you up today but I'm refilling again today because what was happening is that because I've become so used to it I actually bearing the yarn in behind without actually showing you so I'm just going to begin another new round and the first one because it's in the first section will always have to into the first one and see I'm not even telling you so you see this is the travel string the travel string stays right up underneath the project like up underneath the stitches so you when you go to wrap you're going to go into the stitch but you're going to let the traveling yarn just stay on top of the hook and when you go and pull it through it traps it underneath just like so and then you pull through and finish now as I go along see it's just resting so it's my travel yarn is just resting as I go so I just want to keep on going so here's the thing when I am doing this off-camera without anybody looking at me I just naturally kind of just rest the yarn in behind the work without even looking at it so see it's kind of just sitting there but I'm not really paying attention I'm just going right up over top of it so because I'm in a longer section right now bearing this yarn is that it can create this travel yarn to be loose and that's because you're kind of manipulating everything right so every now and then and what I'm going to do is I'm going to pinch here and watch look at the difference so what you want to do is that you want to continually just once in a while just give it a tug and what I've been doing is that I usually tug halfway across then I tug again want to get all the way and like all the way through a section just like this so you can see I'm just kind of having this other yarn just kind of coming up from the base of my hand just like so and it's just resting into position as I go across so you can see there's not a lot of thought process to like you know having to reposition it every time you're doing a stitch it's basically holding in a position and then every now and then so let's give it a tug again and look how it looks on the back okay so you don't really see so you kind of see it those stitches are kind of coming out so watch as a tug on the back side like the back so here we go see it just makes it nice and snug and then I continue along so I don't easily turn it over like that to take a look at that as I do it I'm just doing it for you so what we have to do is that tapestry crochet is always about the next stitch when it comes to changing so let me show you how to change so I'm about to come to the next section so tapestry crochet is always thinking about the stitch ahead is this ditch ahead ready to change yes or no so I'm still in the in this color here I still want to make it opposite I'm changing the colors out now I've done my three rounds of this and now I'm switching back to purple so what I have to do is that I have to look at what's underneath and determine when it's going to switch so you can tell that it's going to switch in the first one of this purple color back to pink so what I have to do is that in tapestry crochet I have to think about the stitch ahead so I know that this is my last stitch of using this purple before I switch to pink so watch how you have to do this so because you have to think ahead you have to finish this stitch like you're thinking ahead so you're going to wrap the hook and then going into the stitch pull through pull through two and hold it this is just like changing a color midway through a row with when you or when you're running out of yarn - it's the same process so you're going to just let the yarn go and because the other yarn is positioned to my side see if they were coming from the same spot it's so much harder but it's coming from beside me the other one I just just pick it up and grab it and then I finish it remember that with crochet the last pull through of a stitch is always the top of the next so the top of this stitch here was originated here so you got to think ahead right so now I'm ready with the pink so as I do the pink I just lay down the purple on top of the line and then I just crochet right over top of it and because it's a new section there will be two into this position because I'm growing it to be bigger so you can go as big as you need to go for these particular Afghans as long as the first section of each section has two and so now you can see that the purple is pulled through so what happens is sometimes you can be a little bit loose so you can just pull on that and it will just strengthen that last purple there and then you just carry on so you always have to think about the stitch ahead when it comes to tapestry crochet in this format and then you just carry on with what you know so what I like to do is that because this ball of the purple is in front of me what I'd like to do is that I like to pull this yarn so I give it a little bit of slack so it's just in front so I can just rest it on top of the project and just bury it and as I go as a travel yarn and you will get your own rhythm on how you think it should go and all of that jazz as you're you're working across so this is kind of how you complete tapestry crochet and so if you're thinking ahead and then again just tug it once in a while just to get rid of the slack and then you're good to go so on camera is a stitch diagram this particular diagram does not go with this particular Afghan it's very very similar to it just ignore the single crochets that you see here this is for another project I've done so what we're going to do is that we're going to start off with a solid color but I am going to give you an option to change the color every other one to get that spot to go all the way to the center like to get these all the way to the center if you wish and then what we're going to do is that we build out so you can see that each section when you go to start it always has two double crochets in the very big one so when you're reading this you go in a counterclockwise position so when we get the first one we're going to just chain three and then double crochet eleven more times because the chain three counts as 12 and then you just use the same color chain up three which counts as a double crochet and double crochet back into there but we have to think ahead because we the next one will be a new color and then we have to think ahead because the next one is this color coming back into play and then we then bring up the other color so in the very beginning of tapestry crochet in the center it's a little bit fiddly because you're switching out your yarns but as your project gets a larger and larger what happens is that it gets further and further so the changes are not so frequent so it's not such a pain so it's actually really quite an easy way to do and to do it and as I've highlighted here every three rows is it is it color so when you did these three done then it'll be purple back on top of here and then etc so I'm going to give you an option in this particular project you can either do just like you see here as per the written instruction or you won't use any extra yarn at all if you want to keep the pinwheel going all the way out to row number 20 or round number 28 so stop at round 28 if you want a solid pinwheel and if you want to break it up and really have like something really quite cool then you'll just continue along and you'll have nine sets so this here of the pink the three is considered one set these three arts a set so this is one and two and then you keep on going out like that until you hit number nine so let me show you another picture so here's the picture of the original we're going to start off just like so so when I say I need you to get nine sets done remember that each set is made up of three rounds so you can see that here so this is one and this is two three four five six seven eight and nine and then that's where you stop then and maybe on week number two so without further ado we're going to use a J size six millimeter crochet hook and Kara 1-pound yarn today and then we're going to get started and we'll take our time and then we'll let you be so let's get started today we're going to use Karen one pound six millimeter size crochet hook I'm going to show you two ways to get started we're going to do the way that it's shown in the pattern and then I'm going to give you an alternate and you can choose which one you like the best so it does start the first one you're going to create a slip knot just like this and you going to insert your hook this is classified as an intermediate pattern but you know it's just because they're switching out your arms that makes it that it's really not that hard so we're going to chain a total of 4 so 1 2 3 & 4 and insert the hook into the beginning chain to form a ring and then just yarn over and pull through and you have the center ring of your entire project it's easier to first round that we're about to do is a solid color but either it is not always more fabulous so to begin round number one you just chain three so one two and three and go all the way around with the same color use this strand now to trap it around the ring as you go right up over top of it it's very much like tapestry but really not and we're going to double crochet eleven more times so with the chaining three and eleven double crochets that gives you a total of twelve so it's so important to get your numbers off and started right away and so we're going to just do that all the way around so in round number one is just a solid color and then we begin using the secondary color then in round number two as we go all the way around so let's count our rounds so it's counter postal 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 so if you're running out of space just it's around the ring so just move move space over and this is 10 11 and 12 and that was including that that round that chain 3 so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 12 once satisfied then just join it to the beginning top of chain 3 and pull through to finish and that is around number 1 so now I'm going to show you an alternative just in case you would like to have the middle also aligned with the rest of the Afghan it's completely up to you so the alternative starting is having both of your strands ready at the same time so just for kicks I'll start off with pink this time and we're going to start off with the slipknot this is not written in the pattern this is something here in video format you'll only know about this in video format unless somebody says something to you socially in our networks so we're going to then chain 4 so 1 2 3 and 4 so we can use the same color to do the chain and then we insert into the beginning one just like this and we are going to just pull through and you'll have your your main center ring and again we want the straggler to go around the outside of the ring to make it easier so now this is going to get a little bit it's going to get a little complicated but if you're up for the challenge this is the whole point of the mystery so putting down my project for a second I'm just going to create a slipknot for my own self and it's just easier so remember what I talked about in the beginning of this is that whenever you do tapestry the last part of a stitch is the roof or thus the top of the next so in this case what we want to do is that we want to chain a total of of two so one and two but stop for a second and get that other chain here and put art that other strand here and pull it through so this is the roof this purple one is the roof of your next stitch and that's what exactly you need so what I need you to do is that the purple now is going to be the next stitch in so the first one that's a double crochet is a chain three it's the same thing and what we're going to do is that we're going to drop all the strands into position around the ring and let's just put it down like so and go into the center and pull through and - and you got to just hold so let's pull all of our strands nice and tight just like that and then what you have to just do is then just grab your pink and finish it so this is why it takes a little bit longer to do the center so let's do the pink now we've dropped everything back down so in behind everything's underneath so we're going to just wrap the hook going in to the center with the pink and we're going to pull through it gets easier just trust me it's just this is why I'd never designed it this way so pull through two and you're going to drop that and grab the purple and finish it so how many of these do you think you got to do you got to do total 12 so you have one two and three so far so now that you kind of got everything more stabilized in your hand you can kind of look at it so remember tapestry crochet is always thinking about the stitch ahead so this here is the top of the next stitch when I go to finish it so I used the pink and then I drop it and then bring up the purple and finish it see that so it lines all the way to the top so we just got to keep an eye make sure everything stays nice and balanced as you go and what are we going to do we're going to switch so this is an alternative starting if I really had my way I'd probably start this way to be honest with you I think it might look better is if it goes right to the center and it's always thinking about how to do it so I kind of had an issue about how to write the pattern like that it's kind of why never learn it that way but really once you see it it's really not that big a deal and we keep switching the yarns and that need so the idea is to keep yourself organized and if your balls are in the right place you should just be able to drop the yarn and pick up the other one without it tangling too much I'm looking see the other one the the purple is coming from the top this one's coming from behind me from the floor and the trick is to make sure you keep bearing those unused yarn so you want a total of 12 posts going all the way around let's just count so we got a pink so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 so I got one more to Google one more to go so it was 11 and 12 and that you know what that makes sense because the first one was actual paint so the last one should be there so here's the trick so we're now at the top and we've got this going because we're going to join it here's the thing you need to move this other traveling yarn up at the same time too so when you go to slip stitch it normally you go to the top of the chain 3 which is good but you have to get this other strand up there too and just put it and so that is sitting on top and when you go to slip stitch it it's on top and coming out at the same spot so that it's ready for you to go next time so this is how you do the first round it's a little more complicated but it looks just as good so let's move up to round number 2 for those that are just joining us and did not want to do the alternative round this is what you're seeing is the alternative round of every other post change in color so in round number 2 it's just like I showed you before we're just going to get that yarn strand up so that we can see it okay we're going to start off with the pink and we are going to then just chain up 3 which counts as a double crochet and in the same stitch at the join you want to double crochet again make sure that this purple is resting on top of that and getting into position but wait this round here there's going to be two stitches in each one and they have to match the color that's in there so I cannot finish using this pink I have to drop it okay and then pick up my purple to finish it and then the next two in the purple here are going to still be purple okay so you get two in there but wait you can't finish that one because the next one is going to be pink so you just pick it up and drop the purple on top of the row and you can't finish the last one so it's just a matter remembering that the last stitch you can never finish all the way because it has to be prepared for the next you see that so what I wanted to do is that I want you to complete this kintyre round there's two stitches in every stitch that are the same color of the stitch underneath so please do that all the way around through round number two so I'm coming up all the way around and I have to do my last one I can tell there's a last one because every other section should be a different color right so you can see I still have a purple left down here so I'm just going to finish off with my purple and I have to think about how I'm finishing the round don't forget about that so this here is about to join here the problem is is that I need this color to be ready for me right off the hop so I have to drop this yarn and I have to finish it with the pink so it's ready and now I'm going to lay this strand has a slip stitch to the top of the chain 3 so I capture that so I can just drag it up one more level with me behind the work ok so everything is into position and behind so now I'm ready to start round number 3 so for those that did the alternative round I don't want you to include that as a group of 3 so ignore this one so we have to do two more rounds like this and then we're going to switch and make the colors opposite so this is group number one as you're going making this project so we're just going to start and chain three and this purple is now in the proper position to continue to travel it the first one will always get to whenever you're starting a new section like this so every like even when Purple's new section new section a new section all the way around and so then the next one is purple ours are pink and that's it you run out of pink you can see the next stitch of the purple to drop it and finish it with purple and the first stitch is going to be two purples so you can see as this gets bigger you don't have to switch the yarn as often and that's really what people get all uptight about when it comes to tapestry okay so I'm going to drop that and getting it ready for the next section so the next section is pink so there's going to be two in that one is two as well and in behind see how I just naturally just doing it without saying much it's just traveling within my fingertips and behind and I'm trapping it into position as I go so this kind of like my second time trying to do this video and the reason for it is that when I was doing it the first time I wasn't explaining that it's just sitting behind because it looked like I was just dropping it completely but it's actually just in behind just resting on my fingertips just to make sure that I capture it and you can see you can get in a habit so it makes it a lot easier in the ball positions of where the yarn is coming from on how quick you can change your your hands and the yarn so this is going to be round number three I wanted to do this same pattern going all the way around just continuing to add and drop your yarns as you go so please do round number three so I'm coming to the end of round number three purple is going to finish this round over the first section always we'll have two into the first one and then you carry on and make the arrest of them just one double crochet by itself now we have to join it again so we have to drop this yarn and get the pink ready for the third are for the next round so we're just going to pull it up like so get it ready and we're going to lay this over top here and then we're going to slip stitch on the top of the beginning chain three with the pink to get it ready and the purple is now trapped in a position to be ready as well so we're just J&H in of three and then just double crochet into the same one that you did to join with keeping that pink or purple just on top and sew the remaining then it's just going to be one crochet by itself so we can see that the next one is about to turn purple as we hit it so we're going to drop this one bring up the purple finish it and then just start the next section and there's always going to be two in the beginning one and then the remaining is all going to be purple as well so this is it for the purple as we finish off drop it get your pink back up and then use your pink and the first one has always got two so please do this all the way around and so you can see that we are this is round number one so this doesn't Naughton count as part of that group of three so we have this is going to be the final group of three and then we're going to switch it and make the pink over top of the purple and purple over top of the pink the next way around but as an alternative suggestion I'm going to a lot of people that want to do a full pinwheel all the way out if they don't want to switch it like that and that's going to be up to you and that will be here available and again you just follow the same concept if that's what you want and you just have to make sure that there's 28 rounds which includes the very beginning sorry which includes the very beginning in order to be aligned with week number two so let's continue this round I'll see you back here in just a moment so do my last section here and it's really quite easy so in this section here we're about to switch the positions of the colors for the next round so here's your choice if you would like just a regular pinwheel of no changes of colors then you just keep on going exactly so if you want to do that option then all you just have to do is just kind of shop here get the pink ready finish it and then just join it making sure you get that in position as well just join it and then you just carry on doing the pink okay so that's not how the pattern is written but I'm going to give that as an option if that's easier for you and etc so then if you would like to change the colors just like it shows in the pattern which is more interesting to my point of view then you have to think about this last stitch more carefully I may go through that so as we finish up the last round I want to switch the colors as time so my purples are on top of the pinks and the Pink's then are on top of the Purple's so look where I am right now I got purples here so what do you think I need to do in order to get purple to start here I need to finish this section completely in purple so I just finish off I make this yarn come up as normal and I just join it what purple and then purple is now ready to go to stand on top of the pink so then you just change three like so and then you're just coming in and then putting your your second one in there and then you just carry on then and your Purple's are now going to be on top of your Pink's so you use the Pink's as your guide for when your Purple's need to end so this is the last time that the pink is before it switches to purple so I want to drop this yarn bring up my pink to get it ready and then the first section of purple will now be pink just like that and I wouldn't draw my would be easier so again this is kind of how you do it so you're switching out the colors and then making sure each one of the beginnings always always has two in there in order to begin so you'll do then three rounds that look like this and then you'll switch it back to like the pink on top of the purple again and then you keep doing that and there should be nine sets of that there will be a total of 28 rounds so let me take you back to a photograph I want to show you one more thing and then I'm going to leave you to do your homework and then we'll be back next week in order to complete so when we go back to the pattern you're going to notice that it has a curvature look and you're looking at the pattern where you are right now and you're sticking you don't have that you will have it it's just not happening yet it's just a little too early so what happens is that because you're putting two double crochets every time in the first section of each one of these sections you're growing it out and it's kind of like wanting to lean outward so as this gets bigger you're going to notice that this pinwheel is going to start leaning out just like this and it's the double crochets that start around in order to make that happen so when we see it here okay you see that it's starting here and it's starting to curve outward right there and it's the double crochets that create that motion to happen so what I want you to do now is I want you to get your homework done get me nine sets of these colors here or 28 rows if you're going to do a solid pinwheel and see me back here next week and we'll complete the quick and merry crochet Afghan with you till next time", "lsIJny8VAnA": "hi there everybody I've been working on this hexagon Afghan and I've had a lot of questions about how I sew it together so I thought I'd do a quick little video to show you all so here is half of my Afghan and I want to talk about how I put the colors together if you look at it you could just let's start with this one with the orange outer orange Center I pick one of the colors in one of the pieces to sew together so you can see here's the orange orange orange and here I started sewing with this purple that's over here so it sort of disappears into the the whole effect of the thing you don't really notice what color it's sewed together because the whole thing is so colorful people crochet them together I just like to sew so I sew them together and I can do it pretty fast so when I'm planning it it actually it isn't really planned at all I have my pile of hexagons and I just begin by starting with one and I'm going to be sewing with this teal color so let's start with one of those that has the teal on the outside um let's see okay so this one has got teal on the outside so I just pull them out of my basket one by one but what I want to do is I this is teal so I don't want to put any kind of teal around the outside of this one so for instance this is a blue tone and there's not enough contrast between these two colors so I wouldn't want to use this one this orange would work great because the colors bouncing off of it this yellow would be nice too let's see we could use this dark magenta color that looks good next to that or it would also look good next to this let's see what else I've got I could use this purple over here and that's pretty nice because you can see this is the same color here and this is the same color here so they're sort of bouncing together with your eye and now let's this is a pretty orange one it's a little darker too dark here not enough contrast what else do I have hmm I don't want to use the green because the green is too close and tone to that you see that running out of choices here okay how about this that's pretty cool maybe a little too close there ah I've got it this lovely magenta you can put here so it's not if it were here these two colors would be too close but because they're opposite that's all right and this purple is darker than this one so it'll work out okay it'll bounce okay and we need one last one and I'm thinking hmm what do I have oh I got this kind of topi kind of color that would probably work good because it's got the turquoise here the red here those are two different Reds so that's kind of how I do it and a lot of times I will start sewing and then I'll rip it out because I don't really like it but let's get to the sewing part so I'm gonna start with mine in the center which is this turquoise now I do this all spontaneously what I'm sitting at nighttime watching TV so I don't really think about it all too much I pretty much just grab it as I go so I'll try to keep some order for you guys here okay so we've got our turquoise and this is how I thread my needle I love these kind of neat it's just a big yarn needle metal needle and I fold it over like that and with the fold I push that through and thread it through and I usually take a piece that's probably about a yard long and I usually have to rethread it as I go around so we're going to start in the back here and I'll show you how I started so I'm going to just whip the needle through here and I'm going to take a stitch right there and that will anchor it over two of the little legs of the crochet and then I thread it up through this is not very scientific okay so I like to start at this at one of the Centers of the hexagons so it's where where the corner is what I mean okay so we've got six corners one two three four five six and so I'm gonna thread my needle so I'm over towards the center okay and I'm gonna come up to the front and I do pretty much all the sewing on the front side of the work so let's for fun let's join it with the pig okay so this is the point where did my end my round ended and it gets a little lumpy looking so we'll just start right there you can see it usually shows up on each one like on this one it's over here so this is one that's worked all the way around and so what we're gonna do is we're just going to stitch these two pieces together and I will usually when I'm joining my corners I usually give it two or three stitches overhand stitches just like that and that joins it and now I'm going to where each double crochet is so there's one two and there's to here I'm going to stitch through those top loops so I'm going to stitch through this one and this one and join and I pull it pretty tight and then here's the top of this one we're where you join it is always a little funky so we'll stitch through there and you can see right there you can see the stitches but once it gets done you won't even notice them so here is my opening and I'm just gonna stitch right through there so you can see it see the opening there and now I've got two double crochets to sew together so one here and one here pull it tight and another and then we're going we've got our opening there I'm gonna stitch all the way through there now no one taught me this I just kind of figured it out on my own and maybe I'm doing it all wrong but it works for me and that's what I like about crochet because I don't really know too much about it and I just sort of wing it okay so we've done our whole side now we're at the corner point and we're going to stitch that together and it's so twice here okay and we need to join another piece so let's join I think I'm gonna I like this across from that so let's join this piece so here we go we're gonna all we do is pick up this point we're going to go into one of the corners and we're going to stitch it twice in that corner and work our way around see matching up the double crochets and there's a little extra piece of thread that needs to be cut and so here's my opening and I'm going to stitch into that and then the tops of my double crochets and that's it just keep going now to end it off I'm not at the end of my thread I'll serve for it I'll just throw another one on here you can see you can get pretty fast at this so we're gonna do two stitches here one two and we're gonna join another piece so let's join this pretty gold okay so Matt a corner two stitches and join it up and so on all the way around okay to end it off I'm gonna go to the back this is if I were out of yarn and all I do is stitch into those sewing stitches a couple times on two and then I will sew through the rest of them and I usually leave a little bit of a tail I do a tug and a little bit of a tail I don't mind those and so you can see that you don't even see the stitches really on the front here's another piece let's see I finished one earlier well I can't seem to find that we'll just look at this one again so you can see the overall effect and the fun thing about this Afghan is I when I ran out of yarn I just added another color so you can see this this one's got magenta and then there's a little purple there in this one here there's two different blues here so I think the person that's gonna be using it whoever that is might look there's another one right here with two different colors it just makes it a little bit of fun and I'm gonna keep sewing this together I've got two large pieces right now and then I have to sew those together so I hope this helpful and we'll see you all again", "LnHAtQlXlY0": "In this tutorial I'm going to show you how to\u00a0\nmake this super easy beginner friendly baby\u00a0\u00a0 blankets so this is super quick and easy to make I\u00a0\nactually made this in around three hours obviously\u00a0\u00a0 if you're a beginner it might take a little bit\u00a0\nlonger but even so this is a really good place to\u00a0\u00a0 start when it comes to crochet if you're looking\u00a0\nfor a quick gift this is absolutely perfect so\u00a0\u00a0 I have used Bernat baby blanket and I've used the\u00a0\nbig 300 gram ball I've actually used two of these\u00a0\u00a0 and I do have some left over so if I show you\u00a0\nthis I have around 100 grams left so for this\u00a0\u00a0 particular blanket I've used approximately 200\u00a0\ngrams of each colour so you could quite easily\u00a0\u00a0 make this blanket bigger if you wanted to but as\u00a0\nI say I've used Bernat Baby Blanket in 300 grams\u00a0\u00a0 this is baby lilac and then this colour is vanilla\u00a0\nso with this yarn I'm going to use an 8 millimetre\u00a0\u00a0 crochet hook you could go up or down depending on\u00a0\nyour tension it's totally up to you but I found\u00a0\u00a0 the 8 millimetre absolutely perfect for this yarn\u00a0\nbefore we get started I'm just going to point out\u00a0\u00a0 that underneath this video where it says show\u00a0\nmore you'll find the written instructions on my\u00a0\u00a0 website bellacococrochet.com I'll give you all\u00a0\nthe details that you need on there including\u00a0\u00a0 details for where to change colours and also some\u00a0\nextra ideas for layouts as well and then as always\u00a0\u00a0 if you like this video don't forget to give it a\u00a0\nthumbs up leave me a comment if you've made it let\u00a0\u00a0 me know how you found it and also don't forget to\u00a0\nsubscribe to keep up to date with all of my latest\u00a0\u00a0 videos ok let's get started so for demonstration\u00a0\npurposes I'm going to start with the baby lilac\u00a0\u00a0 colour yarn just because it will be easier for\u00a0\nyou to see rather than the vanilla however I did\u00a0\u00a0 actually start with the vanilla coloured yarn but\u00a0\nI'm going to use this one to begin with so we're\u00a0\u00a0 going to start off by creating a slipknot and to\u00a0\ndo this you want to wrap your yarn so the tail\u00a0\u00a0 end which is this part here around your finger\u00a0\nand make across like so you then want to bring\u00a0\u00a0 the working yarn which is the yarn still attached\u00a0\nto the ball and bring it over your finger like so\u00a0\u00a0 you'll bring that back loop over the front loop\u00a0\nand there you have created your slipknot you then\u00a0\u00a0 want to go ahead and take your crochet hook and\u00a0\npull that nice and tight onto your crochet hook\u00a0\u00a0 so you now have your slipknot and we're going\u00a0\nto start by creating the foundation chain so the\u00a0\u00a0 foundation chain for the blanket that I have made\u00a0\nconsists of fifty three chains and then we add an\u00a0\u00a0 additional two for turning so for this you're\u00a0\ngoing to grab the yarn so that's called yarn\u00a0\u00a0 over and pull through the loop that's on the hook\u00a0\nyarn over and pull through the loop that's on the\u00a0\u00a0 hook yarn over and pull through the loop that's\u00a0\non the hook make sure that you're not pulling too\u00a0\u00a0 tightly here and make sure that you're using as\u00a0\nmuch of the crochet hook as possible just because\u00a0\u00a0 if you're only using the very tip of the crochet\u00a0\nhook that's when it starts to become too tight\u00a0\u00a0 so that's yarn over pull through and then yarn\u00a0\nover pull through so now we have one two three\u00a0\u00a0 four five chains on the hook if you feel that you\u00a0\nneed a little bit more instruction for the basics\u00a0\u00a0 of crochet I do have a beginner series which is\u00a0\na really good place to start I'll leave a link\u00a0\u00a0 in the description box below and I'll leave a\u00a0\nlittle card on the video just here so we've now\u00a0\u00a0 just chained five you want to go ahead and pause\u00a0\nthe video and chain fifty three chains and then\u00a0\u00a0 meet me back once you are ready okay so I have\u00a0\njust done a chain I've done a smaller chain for\u00a0\u00a0 demonstration purposes so I've just changed 15\u00a0\nand as I mentioned we're going to add two more\u00a0\u00a0 chains to the end of this foundation chain that's\u00a0\none and two the reason we add an additional two is\u00a0\u00a0 to account for when we turn so this is classed\u00a0\nas a turning chain so this chain two here is\u00a0\u00a0 not going to class as a stitch for this particular\u00a0\npattern but it may very well do for other patterns\u00a0\u00a0 so along this chain we're going to work a stitch\u00a0\ncalled a half treble crochet now please be aware\u00a0\u00a0 that I'm talking in UK terms in the US this is\u00a0\nknown as a half double crochet it's the same\u00a0\u00a0 stitch we just use different terms so we're going\u00a0\nto work into the third chain from the hook not\u00a0\u00a0 the one that's on the hook here we don't count\u00a0\nthat one this is the first chain and then this\u00a0\u00a0 is the second chain so we're going to be working\u00a0\ninto the third chain so if I just insert my hook\u00a0\u00a0 here you see this is the chain so we're going to\u00a0\nyarn over the hook so wrap your yarn around the\u00a0\u00a0 hook like this which is called yarn over insert\u00a0\ninto that third chain and then yarn over and then\u00a0\u00a0 pull through that chain what you'll find is you'll\u00a0\nhave three loops on the hook you're going to yarn\u00a0\u00a0 over and pull through gently all three loops\u00a0\non that hook and you'll be left with one now\u00a0\u00a0 the foundation chain is actually one of the more\u00a0\ntricky of the rows to do so once you have done\u00a0\u00a0 this you'll be well on your way to building your\u00a0\nblanket we now want to feel across the chain and\u00a0\u00a0 find the next chain available and you're going to\u00a0\nyarn over again go into that chain yarn over and\u00a0\u00a0 pull through you'll have three loops on the hook\u00a0\nand then yarn over pull through all three loops\u00a0\u00a0 on the hook you'll then yarn over move over into\u00a0\nthe next stitch yarn over pull through and then\u00a0\u00a0 yarn over pull through all three loops on the hook\u00a0\nyou're going to work your way to the very end of\u00a0\u00a0 your chain and if you've done the same amount of\u00a0\nstitches which I've done for the blanket pattern\u00a0\u00a0 you'll have 53 of these stitches all together so\u00a0\nremember we don't count turning chain here this\u00a0\u00a0 is the first stitch the second the third and\u00a0\nthe fourth so as I say you'll have 53 stitches\u00a0\u00a0 all the way along pause the video work those a\u00a0\nhalf treble crochets or half double if you're in\u00a0\u00a0 the US all the way along the chain and I'll meet\u00a0\nyou back in just a moment so I have now completed\u00a0\u00a0 this first row and now we're going to move onto\u00a0\nthe second row so for the second row we're going\u00a0\u00a0 to chain two this just gets us up to the height of\u00a0\nthe stitch and then you're going to turn your work\u00a0\u00a0 so from now on this chain two is going to class\u00a0\nas a stitch so this is our first stitch which\u00a0\u00a0 sits above the one just below we're now going to\u00a0\nwork into the next stitch so if you feel up from\u00a0\u00a0 this stitch you'll see that you have a chain at\u00a0\nthe top there and it will actually look like if\u00a0\u00a0 you pull it apart that it has two strands going\u00a0\nacross so that's where we're going to be working\u00a0\u00a0 into so we're going to do that half treble again\u00a0\nso yarn over you want to go into the top of that\u00a0\u00a0 stitch yarn over and pull through you'll have\u00a0\nthree loops on the hook and then yarn over pull\u00a0\u00a0 through all three loops on the hook so that's\u00a0\nour second stitch of the row yarn over into the\u00a0\u00a0 top of the next stitch yarn over pull through\u00a0\nyarn over pull through all three loops on the\u00a0\u00a0 hook and then again yarn over insert into the next\u00a0\nstitch yarn over pull through and then yarn over\u00a0\u00a0 pull through all three loops on the hook you're\u00a0\ngoing to do that all the way along and I want\u00a0\u00a0 you to stop once you get to this second to last\u00a0\nstitch so this is the turning chain so technically\u00a0\u00a0 the last stitch but before we get to the turning\u00a0\nchain because we're going to do something slightly\u00a0\u00a0 different at the end here so pause the video work\u00a0\nthose stitches all the way along until you get to\u00a0\u00a0 just before the very end and meet me back in\u00a0\njust a moment so I have just nearly completed\u00a0\u00a0 this row and now we're left with this very last\u00a0\nturning chain here we're actually going to work\u00a0\u00a0 into that turning chain because this will keep\u00a0\nour edges nice and neat so you're going to yarn\u00a0\u00a0 over and just go into the very top of that chain\u00a0\njust treating it as if it was a stitch and then\u00a0\u00a0 you're going to yarn over and pull through and\u00a0\nyarn over pull through all three so we have now\u00a0\u00a0 completed our second row we're going to repeat\u00a0\nthis all the way up the blanket so this is pretty\u00a0\u00a0 much going to be the blanket pattern other than\u00a0\nwhen we change colours so I'll just repeat again\u00a0\u00a0 you're going to chain two which will class as\u00a0\na stitch and turn the work we're not going to\u00a0\u00a0 work into the base of this chain just here we're\u00a0\ngoing to work into the top of the next stitch so\u00a0\u00a0 yarn over insert into the stitch yarn over pull\u00a0\nthrough yarn over pull through all three loops on\u00a0\u00a0 the hook yarn over into the next stitch yarn over\u00a0\npull through and then yarn over pull through all\u00a0\u00a0 three loops on the hook as you're working and\u00a0\nbe sure to make sure that you have enough yarn\u00a0\u00a0 that is off the ball otherwise you might find\u00a0\nthat it pulls too tightly on your stitches so\u00a0\u00a0 you're simply going to work all the way along\u00a0\nthis row and you're going to make sure that\u00a0\u00a0 you're counting your stitches so that you have\u00a0\nthe same amount of stitches in each row and you\u00a0\u00a0 don't accidentally increase or decrease because\u00a0\nyou will cause the sides of your blankets that\u00a0\u00a0 either go in or out so what you're actually going\u00a0\nto do is build 12 rows with this colour and then\u00a0\u00a0 you'll be changing colours so I'm going to finish\u00a0\noff this row and then come back and show you how\u00a0\u00a0 you can change your colours once you've done your\u00a0\ntwelve rows so I shall see you in just a moment\u00a0\u00a0 okay so I've just come to the end of this row\u00a0\nif you've paused the video you should have done\u00a0\u00a0 twelve rows of this colour however this is just my\u00a0\ndemonstration piece I have come to the very last\u00a0\u00a0 stitch so I'm going to half treble crochet into\u00a0\nthe top of this chain 3 from the previous row just\u00a0\u00a0 to make sure that our ends are correct however\u00a0\nI'm going to do something a slightly different\u00a0\u00a0 here so instead of having my three loops on the\u00a0\nhook and yarning over and pulling through all of\u00a0\u00a0 those three loops I'm actually going to change\u00a0\ncolour here so I'm going to pick up my vanilla\u00a0\u00a0 yarn and I'm going to make a loop like so you want\u00a0\nto make sure that you've got a good tail end just\u00a0\u00a0 there and instead of holding this yarn I'm going\u00a0\nto bring through the new colour like so and that\u00a0\u00a0 just changes colour you're then going to bring\u00a0\nthat tail end behind and then you're just going\u00a0\u00a0 to continue with this colour just as you have\u00a0\ndone your other colour so you would chain two\u00a0\u00a0 and then you want to snip off the working yarn of\u00a0\nthe baby lilac you're going to turn your work and\u00a0\u00a0 then you're going to work as you have done your\u00a0\nprevious row so exactly the same as before so\u00a0\u00a0 into the next stitch yarn over pull through and\u00a0\nthen yarn over pull through all three loops on\u00a0\u00a0 the hook yarn over into the next stitch and do\u00a0\nyour half treble crochet so this is your basic\u00a0\u00a0 principles of this blanket it's super super easy\u00a0\nand because the yarn is just really nice and thick\u00a0\u00a0 it builds up so easy and quickly what you want\u00a0\nto do is make sure you go across to that blog\u00a0\u00a0 post because it will tell you how many rows to do\u00a0\nof each colour before you need to change back and\u00a0\u00a0 the change is always going to be exactly the same\u00a0\nas what I've demonstrated just there so I'm going\u00a0\u00a0 to build a few more rows and then show you what\u00a0\nyou would do once you've finished the blanket and\u00a0\u00a0 you need to tie off and sew in your ends okay so\u00a0\nI've just built a few more rows and now I'm ready\u00a0\u00a0 to finish off my blankets as I mentioned make sure\u00a0\nthat you are counting every single row that you do\u00a0\u00a0 to make sure that you just stay nice and neat so\u00a0\nonce you've finish your blanket and you've done\u00a0\u00a0 your very last stitch you want to yarn over and\u00a0\npull through leaving your crochet hook attached\u00a0\u00a0 to the work you're going to take your scissors\u00a0\nand snip off your yarn and then you're going\u00a0\u00a0 to pull the yarn out and that creates a knot in\u00a0\nyour work and finishes off that end now all we\u00a0\u00a0 have left to do is to sew in our ends now because\u00a0\nthis is a blanket we want to make sure that our\u00a0\u00a0 ends are nice and secure because this will be\u00a0\nwashed and used quite regularly in this section\u00a0\u00a0 here where there are where there is the colour\u00a0\nchange you have an option if you wanted to put\u00a0\u00a0 a knot in your work you could do however some\u00a0\npeople don't like that it's totally up to you\u00a0\u00a0 totally your preference you know you choose whether\u00a0\nyou do or don't want to do that we're then going\u00a0\u00a0 to take our yarn so the tail end and you want to\u00a0\nattach your darning needle so you want to make\u00a0\u00a0 sure that you've got quite a large darning needle\u00a0\nand what we're going to do here is do the rule of\u00a0\u00a0 three so the rule of three basically means we're\u00a0\ngoing to have three passes with this yarn you're\u00a0\u00a0 going to take your darning needle and you want\u00a0\nto weave this through your work you want to go\u00a0\u00a0 to about an inch to an inch and a half one way\u00a0\nyou'll pull that through don't pull too tight\u00a0\u00a0 on the yarn because it distorts the side so if you\u00a0\nfeel that you've pulled too tight just gently pull\u00a0\u00a0 that backwards we're now going to go back the\u00a0\nother way or even down another direction so I'm\u00a0\u00a0 just going to come down round here there is really\u00a0\nno set rules with this other than you want to be\u00a0\u00a0 working back and forth in different directions so\u00a0\nthere we have have our second pass and then we're\u00a0\u00a0 going to go back the opposite way you're going\u00a0\nto need to make sure that you are going under\u00a0\u00a0 slightly different loops as to what you did last time\u00a0\notherwise it will come undone and then I'm going\u00a0\u00a0 to pull that backwards so as you can see I've\u00a0\ngone down and then I've gone this way and then\u00a0\u00a0 back you can actually go this way back and then\u00a0\nthis way if you wanted to it's totally up to you\u00a0\u00a0 the most important thing is that you're going\u00a0\nin and out different parts of the yarn so once\u00a0\u00a0 you've done that you can then go ahead and snip\u00a0\noff that yarn and then you just want to tuck in\u00a0\u00a0 that end into your work and then you would do the\u00a0\nsame with the other yarn now because this is over\u00a0\u00a0 here I would be tempted to pull this into the\u00a0\nsame colour yarn and run it through this way so\u00a0\u00a0 that it's nice and disguised otherwise if you're\u00a0\ngoing through the purple you're going to be able\u00a0\u00a0 to see that so exactly the same with every single\u00a0\nend you're going to weave those in and there you\u00a0\u00a0 would have your finished blanket so now you should\u00a0\nhave your quick and easy baby blanket it's such a\u00a0\u00a0 stunning result I absolutely love this one I just\u00a0\nthink it's really fun and it feels beautiful and\u00a0\u00a0 it's really quick and easy to do don't forget\u00a0\nto check out the blog post that goes with this\u00a0\u00a0 video to give you all the information you need\u00a0\nincluding extra tips and the information on\u00a0\u00a0 changing colours

yarnspirations.com. I'm your host Mikey. Today is the Quick and Merry week number one of the crochet mystery. Today we're going to be doing part of the mystery and then next week you'll join me back here again and we'll complete this mystery together. So this is what we're gonna be working on. This video has sound alerts added. When you hear this sound [\ud83c\udfb6] it will be your signal that the segment is finishing up. Press stop and crochet the instructions and then press play again to continue along in your project. So this is a 48\" diameter afghan and this is more meant for home decor for your holiday gift giving. It could also be done as a cute little toddler little blanket as well. It's big enough for that. So it's really kind of a neat idea and it's using the art form of tapestry crochet where we hide one yarn strand use the other and then keep switching it back and forth. It's really quite an easy design and this is called the Peppermint Pinwheel Afghan. Now the nice thing about this particular afghan is that you can make it bigger. So if 48\" isn't gonna do it for you you can also do a much bigger design. The way that I've designed it will continually grow and stay flat just like this. So you're gonna be using a 6 mm, size, J' crochet hook and in order to play for this particular pattern that we're working on, you only need two balls of Caron One Pound yarn. There's so much yarn on those things that you only need one ball of one color and one ball of another. But if you want to change the design to make it bigger, then you obviously have to get more yarn because I've designed it so that you don't run out of yarn. So I'm gonna be giving some options. Let's talk about that quick. So in today's video I'm going to be giving you some options. This will not be written anywhere. So unless you're watching this video you won't even know about it. So you see how that I have a solid color right in the center? If that bothers you I'm going to be showing you how to do this but I'm gonna also show you how to make it so that you can transition the color so it starts right in the middle. So this purple can go right to the middle like so. So I'm gonna have two starts to show you how to do this one and then I'll show you how this one. This one's a little more fiddly. It's harder to describe, so I'm gonna just show it to you on camera and you won't use any less yarn really as a result of doing that so it's only like one extra stitch um, it's like six extra stitches of the purple in order to make that out. So we're gonna be doing that. We're also going to be giving you an option here is if you would like to have the spiral completely go out without changing. So I have it changing every three rows. If you want the spiral to go all the way out just like so you just have to do 28 rows right from the start one here so include this one and go out 28 rows all together and then you will then stay in line with this pattern. So I'm going to be teaching it with the tapestry crochet in the sense of changing these colors strategically as you see it. Now if you're doing the tapestry crocheted there is nine groups of these colors. So for example this is one group. Okay, this is number two okay, and then number three and et cetera. So there's a total group of nine of those that go all the way out and then that's gonna be the end of week number one. So for those that think that know what they're doing you can fast forward now and go to this set of instructions as we begin. For those that would like tips on tapestry crochet on how to manipulate the yarn and things to look for then just stay tuned and we're gonna cover that next but everybody else that knows what they're doing like is just fast forward now. And then we'll start then at that time. So let's begin talking about the tips of using tapestry crochet. So tapestry crochet is the art of carrying one yarn. So I call it the travel yarn and so for example when we're using the purple here the pink is underneath just traveling underneath the stitches. It's not directly behind the project. It's right underneath the stitch right here. So what we have to do is that we have to then switch out those yarns every time that we want to change the color. So as we finish off the, the purple then we drop the purple then add the pink and then we do the pink and then et cetera. So it's the art of just manipulating this. So the neat thing about it is that you can actually see if you have the colors here you can actually see it carrying up underneath. The back of a project on something like this looks completely different. You can actually see that. This is just a tail end and that's hanging, but you can actually see it more on the back side of the where it's carrying. So you can see it's not behind the project it's right underneath the stitches like so. So it's one of those projects that it's more of a one-sided item when you're being able to go. So we're using two different colors of yarn. So how do you prevent tangling? We'll talk about that next. So we have two strands of yarn that we're gonna be playing with and the trick is is that you don't wanna tangle yourself so that they end up coming all twisted and all like this. There's actually a really quick simple solution to this. I kinda finally figured it out after all these years. So what I realize is that if I put one yarn ball straight ahead of me probably but look where I am okay, and I put it there okay, just right up. I may put it on a coffee table, or I may put it on an ottoman, footstool, et cetera and I'll put the first ball there. Then what I'll do the second color I will put here okay right beside me on this side. So when it's coming to the hands you'll notice that the yarn strands when they're coming so the purple is up over there right now, so if the purple is up like so the purple will be coming from this direction. Okay, and the pink will then be coming from this direction. So whenever I need to switch the yarns out all I just need to do is just completely drop the work, grab the yarn strand and then continue. If they're coming from the exact same spot it is so difficult, it is a pain. So think about where you want to position yourself and where your yarn is gonna go and this will make your life so much easier and you'll be able to get this done much faster too without all the fuss. So another thing to consider is counting. Oh my goodness. Do you not wanna count or do you not wanna count. Don't worry about it. This is why I design this. This is so awesome. So there's 12 pieces to the pie. So let's have an apple pie here and we can see that there's twelve, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. So what we have here. Is that there's 12 pieces of pie and because there's 12 pieces of pie is that we can grow it out incrementally. It's no different than a hat or anything like that that's round. So at what I did is that every time there's a color change it's whenever you're starting the next piece of the pie. So when you're growing things out usually it's in sets of maybe six or it could be eight, but in this case it's 12. So because there's 12 sections here that help it to grow the first stitch of the new slice of pie will always have two in the beginning and then the next ones are all single. So there's two in the beginning and then the next one's are signal or single. So as you grow this out even bigger see the first one is always gonna have two whenever you have this and then the rest are all single until you get to the next group over here and then the first one's two again and the next ones are all single. And you will do that continually all the way out until you get to your nine um, changes so there's be, remember these are 1, 2, 3, 4 and I'm coming off camera now. So there will be all the way to nine. So there's three rounds the make up one group, okay and there will be nine groups of that by the time you get there in the end of week number one. So really you're not having to count you just have to look and every time you're gonna switch the colors that their first one will always have to into the beginning. So later on in this tutorial I'm gonna show you how to do this, but what I wanna show it to you and I've already actually filmed this already once before yesterday, but I'm refilming again today because what was happening is that because I've become so used to it I'm naturally burying the yarn in behind without actually showing you. So I'm just going to begin another new round and the first one because it's in the first section will always have two into the first one. And see I'm not even telling you. So you see this is the travel string. The travel string stays right up underneath the project like up underneath the stitches. So you when you go to wrap you're going to go into this ditch but you're gonna let the travel yarn just stay on top of the hook and when you go and pull it through it traps it underneath just like so and then you pull through and finish. Now as I go along, see it's just resting so it's my travel yarn is just resting as I go. So I just wanna keep on going. So here's the thing. When I am doing this off camera without anybody looking at me. I just naturally kinda just rest the yarn in behind the work without even looking at it. So see it's kinda just sitting there, but I'm not really paying attention I'm just going right up over top of it. So because I'm in a longer section right now of burying this yarn is that it can create um, this travel yarn to be loose. And that's because you're kind of manipulating everything right. So every now and then and what I'm gonna do I'm gonna pinch here and watch. Look at the difference. So what you wanna do is that you want to continually just once in a while just uh, give it a tug and what I've been doing. Is that I use a tug halfway across and then I tug again when I get all the way and like all the way through a section just like this. So you can see I'm just kind of having this other yarn just kind of coming up from the base of my hand just like so and it's just resting into position as I go across. So you can see there's not a lot of thought process to like you know having to reposition it every time you're doing a stitch. It's basically holding into position and then every now and then so let's give it a tug again and look how it looks in the back Okay? So you don't really see, see you kinda see it. The stitches are kinda coming out so watch as a tug on the back side, like the back so here we go. See, it just makes it nice and snug and then I continue along. So I don't usually turn it over like that to take a look at that as I do it I'm just doing it for you. So what we have to do is that tapestry crochet is always about the next stitch when it comes to changing. So let me show you how to change. So I'm about to come to the next section. So tapestry crochet is I'll be thinking about the stitch ahead. Is this stitch ahead ready to change yes or no. So I'm still in the in this color here I still want to make it opposite. I'm changing the colors out now, I've done my three rounds of this and now I'm switching back to purple. So what I have to do is that I have to look at what's underneath and determine when it's gonna switch. So you can tell that it's gonna switch in the first one of this purple color back to pink. So what I have to do is that in tapestry crochet I have to think about the stitch ahead. So I know that this is my last stitch of using this purple before I switch to pink. So watch how you have to do this. So because you have to think ahead you have to finish this stitch like you're thinking ahead. So you're gonna wrap the hook and then going into the stitch pull through, pull through two and hold it. This is just like changing a color midway through a row with when you or when you're running out of yarn too. It's the same process. So you're gonna  just let the yarn go and because the other yarn is positioned to my side see, if they were coming from the same spot it's so much harder, but because it's coming from beside me at the other one I just pick it up and grab it and then I finish it. Remember that with crochet the last pull through of the stitch is always the top of the next. So the top of this stitch here was originated here. So you gotta think ahead right? So now I'm ready with the pink, so as I do the pink I just lay down the purple on top of the line and then I just crochet right over top of it and because it's a new section there will be two into this position because I'm growing it to be bigger. So you can go as big as you need to go for these particular afghans as long as the first section of each section has two and so now you can see that the purple's pulled through. So what happens is sometimes you can be a little bit loose. So you can just pull on that, and it will just strengthen that last purple there, and then you just carry on. So you always have to think about the stitch ahead when it comes to tapestry crochet in this format and then you just carry on with what you know. So what I like to do is that because this ball of the purple is in front of me what I'd like to do is that I like to pull this yarn, so I give it a little bit of slack so it's just in front so I can just rest it on top of the project and just bury it in as I go as a travel yarn, and you will get your own rhythm on how you think it should go and all of that jazz as you're working across. So this is kind of how you complete tapestry crochet and so if you're thinking ahead and then again just tug it once in a while just to get rid of the slack, and then you're good to go. So on camera is a stitch diagram. This particular diagram does not go with this particular afghan. It's very, very similar to it just ignore the single crochets that you see here. This is for another project I've done. So what we're going to do is that we're going to start off with a solid color but I am gonna give you an option to change the color every other one to get that spot to go all the way to the center like to get these all the way to the center if you wish. And then what we're going to do is that we build out. So you can see that each section when you go to start it always has two double crochets in the very big one. So when you're reading this you go in a counterclockwise position. So when we get the first one we're gonna just chain three and then double crochet 11 more times because the chain three counts as 12 and then you just use the same color, chain up three which counts as a double crochet and double crochet back into there. But we have to think ahead because we are, the next one will be a new color and then we have to think ahead because the next one is this color coming back into play and then we then bring up the other color. So in the very beginning of tapestry crochet in the center it's a little bit fiddly because you're switching out your yarns, but as your project gets larger and larger what happens is that it gets further and further so the changes are not so frequent so it's not such a pain. So it's actually really quite an easy way to do, to do it and as I've highlighted here every three rows is a, is a color. So when you get these three done, then it will be purple back on top of here and then et cetera. So I'm going to give you an option. In this particular project you can either do just like you see here as per the written instruction or you won't use any extra yarn at all if you want to keep the pinwheel going all the way out to row number 20 or round number 28. So stop at round 28 if you wanna solid pinwheel and if you wanna break it up and really have like something really quite cool, then you'll just continue along and you'll have nine sets. So this here of the pink of three is considered one set. These three are a set so this is one and two and then you keep on going out like that until you hit number nine. Let me show you another picture. So here's the picture of the original. We're gonna start off just like so. So when I say I need you to get nine sets done, remember that each set is made up of three rounds, so you can see that here. So this is 1 and this is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 and then that's where you stop then and meet me on week number two. So without further ado, we're gonna use a 'J', size 6 mm crochet hook and Caron One-Pound yarn today and then we're gonna get started and we'll take our time and then we'll let you be. So let's get started today. We're going to use Caron One Pound, 6 mm size crochet hook. I'm going to show you two ways to get started. We're gonna do the way that it's shown in the pattern and then I'm gonna give you an alternate and you can choose which one you like the best. So does start the first one you're going to create a slipknot just like this, and you're gonna insert your hook. This is classified as an intermediate pattern but you know it's just because they're switching out yarns that makes it that. It's really not that hard. So we're going to chain a total of four, so 1, 2, 3 and 4 and insert the hook into the beginning chain to form a ring and then just yarn over and pull through and you have the center ring of your entire project. It's easier if the first round that we're about to do is a solid color but easier it is not always more fabulous. So to begin round number one you just chain three, so 1, 2 and 3 and go all the way around with the same color. Use this strand now to trap it around the ring as you go right up over top of it. It's very much like tapestry but really not and we're going to double crochet 11 more times. So with the chaining three and 11 double crochets that gives you a total of 12. So it's so important to get your numbers off and started right away, and so we're gonna just do that all the way around. So in round number one it's just a solid color and then we begin using the secondary color then in round number two as we go all the way around. So let's count our rounds. So let's count our posts so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, so if you're running out of space just it's around the ring so just move move space over and this is 10, 11 and 12. And that was including that, that round that chain three. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. Once satisfied then just join it to the beginning top of chain three and pull through to finish and that is around number one. So now I'm gonna show you an alternative just in case you would like to have the middle also aligned with the rest of the afghan. That's completely up to you. So the alternative starting is having both of your strands ready at the same time. So just for kicks I'll start off with pink this time and we're going to start off with a slipknot. This is not written in the pattern this is something here in video format. You'll only know about this in video format unless somebody says something to you socially in our networks. So we're going to then chain four. So 1, 2, 3 and 4. So we can use the same color to do the chain and then we insert into the beginning one just like this and we are going to just pull through and you'll have your, your main center ring and again we want the straggler to go around the outside of the ring to make it easier. So now this is gonna get a little bit uh,[chuckles] it's gonna get a little complicated, but if you're up for the challenge this is the whole point of the mystery. So putting down my project for a second I'm just gonna create a slipknot for my own self and it's just easier. So remember what I talked about in the beginning of this is that whenever you do tapestry the last part of a stitch is the roof or the is the top of the next. So in this case what we want to do is that we want to chain a total of of two. So 1 and 2 but stop for a second and get that other chain here and put or that other strand here and pull it through. So this is the roof, this purple one is the roof of your next stitch and that's what exactly you need. So what I need you to do is that the purple now is gonna be the next stitch in. So the first one that's a double crochet is a chain three it's the same thing and what we're going to do is that we're gonna drop all the strands into position around the ring and let's just put it down like so and go into the center and pull through and two and you gotta just hold. So let's pull all of our strands nice and tight just like that, and then what you have to just do is then just grab your pink and finish it. So this is why it takes a little bit longer to do the center. So let's do the pink now. We've dropped everything back down so in behind everything's underneath so we're gonna just wrap the hook going into the center with the pink and we're gonna pull through, it gets easier. Just trust me. It's just this is why had never designed it this way. So pull through two and you're gonna drop that and grab the purple and finish it. So how many of these do you think you gotta do? You gotta do a total 12. So you have 1, 2 and 3 so far. So now that you kinda got everything more stabilized in your hand you can kind of look at it. So remember tapestry crochet is always thinking about the stitch ahead. So this here is the top of the next stitch when I go to finish it, so I use the pink and then I drop it and then bring up the purple and finish it. See that, so it lines all the way to the top. So we just gotta keep an eye and make sure everything stays nice and balanced as you go. And what are we gonna do? We're gonna switch. So this is an alternative starting. If I really had my way, I'd probably start this way to be honest with you. I think it might look better is if it goes right to the center. And it's always thinking about how to do it, so I kinda had an issue about how to write the pattern like that. It's kind of why I never designed it that way, but really once you see it. It's really not that big a deal. And we keep switching the yarns. Isn't that neat? So the idea is to keep yourself organized and if your balls in the right place you should just be able to drop the yarn and pick up the other one without it tangling too much. So I'm looking, see the other one the the purple is coming from the top this one's coming from behind me from the floor and he trick is to make sure you keep burying those unused yarn. So you wanna total of 12 posts going all the way around. Let's just count so we got a pink so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. So I got one more to go, one more to go. So that was 11 and 12 and then you know what that makes sense because the first one was actual pink so the last one should be there. So here's the trick. So we're now at the top and we've got this going because we're gonna join it. Here's the thing. You need to move this other traveling yarn up at the same time, too. So when you go to slip stitch it normally you go to the top of the chain thee which is good but you have to get this other strand up there too and just put it and so that is sitting on top and when you go to slip stitch it it's on top and coming out at the same spot so that it's ready for you to go next time. So this is how you do the first round. It's a little more complicated, but it looks just as good. So let's move up to round number two. For those that are just joining us and did not wanna do the alternative round this is what you're seeing is the alternative round of every other post changing color. So in round number two it's just like I showed you before. We're just gonna get that yarn strand up so that we can see it. Okay, we're gonna start off with the pink and we are going to then just chain up three which counts as a double crochet and in the same stitch at the join you want to double crochet again. Make sure that this purple is resting on top of that and getting into position. But wait! This round here there's gonna be two stitches in each one and they have to match the color that's in there so I cannot finish using this pink. I have to drop it, okay, and then pick up my purple to finish it and then the next two in the purple here are going to still be purple. Okay, so you get two in there, but wait you can't finish that one because the next one is gonna be pink. So you just pick it up and drop the purple on top of the row and you can't finish the last one so it's just a matter of remembering that the last stitch you can never finish all the way because it has to be prepared for the next. Do you see that? So what I want you to do is that I want you to complete this entire round. There's two stitches in every [\ud83c\udfb6] stitch that are the same color of the stitch underneath. So please do that all the way around for round number two. So I'm coming up all the way around and I have to do my last one. I can tell there's a last one because every other section should be a different color right. So you can see I still have a purple left down here. So I'm just gonna finish off with my purple and I have to think about how I'm finishing the round. don't forget about that. So this here is about to join here. The problem is is that I need this color to be ready for me right off the hop. So I have to drop this yarn and I have to finish it with the pink so it's ready and now I'm going to lay this strand as I slip stitch to the top of the chain three. So I capture that so I can just drag it up one more level with me behind the work, okay so everything is into position in behind. So now I'm ready to start round number three. So for those that it did the alternative round I don't want you to include that as that group of three, so ignore this one. So we have to do two more rounds like this and then we're gonna switch and make the colors opposite. So this is group number one as you're going uh, making this project. So we're just gonna start and chain three and this purple is now in the proper position to continue to travel it. The first one will always get two whenever you're starting a new section like this. So every like even when purple's new section, new section, new section all the way around and so then the next one is purple or sorry, pink and that's it you run out of pink. You can see the next stitch is a purple to drop it and finish it purple and the first stitch is going to be two purples. So you can see as this gets bigger you don't have to switch the yarn as often and that's really what people get all uptight about when it comes to tapestry. Okay, so I'm gonna drop that getting it ready for the next section. So the next section is pink. So there's gonna be two in that one as well and in behind see how I just naturally just doing it um, without it's saying much it's just traveling within my fingertips in behind and I'm trapping it into position as I go. So this kinda like my second time trying to do this video and the reason for it is that when I was doing it the first time I wasn't explaining that it's just sitting behind because it looked like I was just dropping it completely. But it's actually just in behind just resting on my fingertips just to make sure that I capture it and you can see you can get in a habit. So it makes it a lot easier in the ball positions of where the yarn is coming from on how quick you can change out your hands and the yarn. So this is gonna be round number three. I want you to do this same pattern [\ud83c\udfb6] going all the way around just continuing to add and drop your yarns as you go. So please do round number three. So I'm coming to the end of round number three, purple is gonna finish this round. Remember the first section always will have two into the first one and then you carry on and make the rest of them just one double crochet by itself. Now we have to join it again so we have to drop this yarn you get the pink ready for the third or for the next round. So we're just going to pull it up like so, get it ready and we're going to lay this over top here and then we're gonna slip stitch on the top of the beginning chain three with the pink to get it ready and the purple is now trapped into position to be ready as well. So we're just chaining up three and then just double crochet into the same one that you did to join with keeping that pink or purple just on top and so the remaining then is just gonna be one double crochet by itself. So we see that the next one is about to turn purple as we hit it. So we're gonna drop this one bring up the purple, finish it and then just start the next section and there's always gonna be two in the beginning one and then the remaining is all gonna be purple as well. So this is it for the purple as we finish off drop it, get your pink back up and then use your pink and the first one's always got two. So please do this all the way around and so you can see that we are uh, this is round number one, so this doesn't not count as part of that group of three. So we have, this is gonna be the final group of three and then we're gonna switch it and make the pink over top of the purple and purple over top of the pink the next way around but as an alternative suggestion I'm going to allow people that wanna do a full pinwheel all the way out if they don't wanna switch it like that and that's gonna be up to you and that will be here um, available and again, you just follow the same concept if that's what you want and you just have to make sure that there's 28 rounds which includes the very beginning [\ud83c\udfb6] uh, sorry, which includes the very beginning in order to be aligned with week number two. So let's continue this round. I'll see you back here in just a moment. So do my last section here and it's really quite easy. So in this section here we're about to switch the positions of the colors for the next round. So here's your choice. If you would like just a regular pinwheel of no changes of colors then you just keep on going exactly. So if you wanna do that option, then all you just have to do is just finish off here, get the pink ready, finish it and then just join it making sure you get that into position as well. Just join it and then you just carry on doing the pink okay. So that's not how the pattern is written, but I'm gonna give that as an option if that's easier for you and et cetera. So then if you would like to change the colors just like it shows in the pattern which is more interesting to my point of view then you have to think about this last stitch more carefully. Let me go through that. So as we finish up the last round I wanna switch the colors as time so that my purples are on top of the pinks and the pinks then are on top purples. So look where I am right now. I got purples here. So what do you think I need to do in order to get purple to start here? I need to finish this section completely in purple. So I just finish off, I make this yarn come up as normal and I just join it with purple and then purple is now ready to go to stand on top of the pink. So then you just chain three like so and then you're just coming in and then putting your, your second one in there and then you just carry on then and your purples are now gonna be on top of your pinks. So you use the pinks as your guide for when your purples need to end. So this is the last time that the pink is before it switches to purple. So I wanna drop this yarn, bring up my pink to get it ready and then the first section of purple will now be pink. Just like that. If I wouldn't draw my stitches would be easier. So again, this is kinda how you do it. So you're switching out the colors and then making sure each one of the beginnings always has two in there in order to begin. So you'll do then three rounds that look like this and then you'll switch it back to like the pink on top of the purple again and then you keep doing that and there should be nine sets of that. There will be a total of 28 rounds. [\ud83c\udfb6] So let me take you back to a photograph. I wanna show you one more thing and then I'm gonna leave you to do your homework and then we'll be back next week in order to complete. So when we go back to the pattern you're going to notice that it has a curvature look and you're looking at the pattern where you are right now, and you're thinking you don't have that. You will have it. It's just not happening yet. It's just a little too early. So what happens is that because you're putting two double crochets every time in the first section of each one of these sections you're growing it out, and it's kinda like wanting to lean outward. So as this gets bigger you're going to notice that this pinwheel is going to start leaning out just like this, and it's the double crochets that start a round in order to make that happen. So when we see it here okay, you see that it's starting here and it's starting to curve outward like there. And it's the double crochets that create that motion in order to happen. So what I want you to do now is that I want you to get your homework done. Get me nine sets of these colors here or 28 rows if you're gonna do a solid pinwheel and see me back here next week and we'll complete the Quick and Merry Crochet Afghan with you until next time. Hey, and welcome back to The Crochet Crowd as well as my friends over at yarnspiration.com. We're going to do the Quick and Merry Crochet Along together and today is part two and the final part as we continue our mystery together and we're going to just finish off the final stages of this which includes a few more revolutions of what we already know and then we're gonna include a border. So let me tell you a little bit about this and we're also doing some giveaways. I'm gonna talk about that in a second too. This video has sound alerts added when you hear this sound [\ud83c\udfb6] it will be your signal that the segment is finishing up. Press stop and crochet the instructions and then press play again to continue along in your project. So continuing along in our pattern right now we're at the end of this red strip right here. Or the pink strip and what we're going to do is that we're gonna continue just a few more revolutions of what we already know and then you're gonna move to the border. So we're gonna have some giveaways as well for this and the giveaways are about this size. So you have to in order to qualify you have to make it a minimum of what you see but you core course can make it much bigger, and I'm gonna tell you some tips to making it bigger as well. So you're gonna see that the next section that we're gonna do is only gonna be two rounds of the same and then we switch off to a solid green. So if you wanna make it bigger you can go as big as you wanna go. The way that I did the math is that the final border is in sets of four and because it's increasing by twelve stitches every revolution you're always be in an increment of four. So you can go as big or as little as you want to. So at time of filming this is already in progress and I have to tell ya, I am so blown away by the amount of options that people decided to do. Some people did solid pin was going out, some people changed the increments of where it changed colors you can do that as well, and it was just really awesome. The only thing you cannot do is use a solid color for the whole thing because then it doesn't look like a pinwheel then and it really defeats the purpose of learning how to do tapestry crochet. So it's really neat. I have to tell you though the Caron Cakes and the Caro, and the Bernat Pop that people are using instead what they're doing is that they're just using the same color and then it's transitioning. I will put a picture right now on screen with you and it looks absolutely amazing when you let the yarn change on its own too. I'm just blown away! So this is a really cool option. So let's get started and getting this in mystery all solved and finished for you today. So as mentioned you're at the end of this section right here. It's the pink section. We're gonna do two more rounds of what we already know and let's get started in doing that and then we're gonna do 1, 2, 3 and 4 of just solid color and then we're gonna do one more of the pink and then we're going to then do the border after that. So it's really quite simple. We're almost done and let's get this thing done. So currently my project right now is on round number 28, exactly where I should be and I'm just going to switch the colors one more time and do two rows or two rounds only of this switch. So we're just gonna do two rounds of what we already know and then what we're gonna do is then we're gonna eliminate one of the colors out and then we're just do solid. So again like always the first one in each of the sections will have two and then it's just one into each after that. Um, people really got the uh, hold of the concept. I don't even know how many people are participating in this. There's so many great ideas going on. So please do two more rounds on what you already know and then meet me back here and then we're gonna eliminate one color out, and then do four rounds then of a solid color. So now I'm back, and I'm just finishing up my final two rounds of doing the pinwheel. So I'm gonna give you some options if you would like to continue and some advice and I want you to have as much creativity as possible. So what I want to do is that I wanna stop here and let's talk about what we're gonna do next. So here are some options for you. So right now I have you stopping right now at the edge of this pink one here and now we have four rounds, 1, 2, 3 and 4 of this solid color. So this is kind of like the dominant color once you decide. So you have used both of your yarns equally at this time so whatever color you decide to make this right now will be the dominant color of the whole thing. So if I'm doing this one here if I do it pink of this this will be the dominant and if I do this one it'll be that one. Here are some options for you. If you would like to continue your pinwheel you have to consider what you're using for the border. So the border takes up more yarn. So if you are going to do your pinwheel you can continue to do it in sets of three. So there's one left here and then there's another four and then you can do your border and after that. So whatever your border color is you'll need an extra yarn for that in order to keep that color going. So that's completely up to you if you would like to do that. As you can see here you can do the green all the way around easily in order to finish off. So it's more this color here that matches um, is that you need extra. So I'm gonna leave that for you on your creativity on what you wanna do but right now we're going to come back to the project and I'm gonna drop one of the colors and do my final four rounds of just doing solid and I'll show you some tips on that too. So I come to the end and I want to have the pink as my dominant color. So I'm going to finish this completely and I'm going to then just attach and my pink is ready to go next time around. So that means that my purple is done. So what I wanna do is that I wanna trim this yarn here and I want to bury that underneath the strands as I go but I'm completely done with my purple at this time and we'll bring back to purple then at the end of the project in order to do the border. So just like before so here's the thing is that you could tell before every time you hit a peak, right? So let me just back out the camera for you there, you can tell when there's a peak like a section, right? So what you have to do is that you're still gonna do it the same way that you know adding two into the beginning and then solid like one in each and then turning. So what you have to do is that when you go forward now when every time you see there's a double the first one will always have two into it in order to maintain it okay. So you're just not gonna see the color transitions any more if you're doing, it solid like I'm about to. So when I go to start I'm chaining three and I wanna bury it in this purple as I go to get that out of the way and then one double crochet in each and then I'm gonna one double crochet in each of these and then two into the first one here. So the next time I come around on this project you're, it's all gonna be a solid pink. So I'm just gonna look where the doubles are in the first one of each double will have two in order to continue to grow out. So I'm gonna have four rows of the solid color now and then we're gonna come back and then do two rows of the border at the end. So again it's up to you on how you wanna do it as far as keeping your pinwheels all the way to the border. I designed this in a way that you can do that. You can make any size of this if you wish. It will all balance out because it's always gonna be growing in multiples of 12 as you're continuing in each round and because I have done the, the final border in sets of four then that means that no matter what size that you do the border will always work out for you. So continue now four rows of solid color if you wish or just choose your own way that you're doing it and then I'll see you back here, and we'll do the border together. Okay, so now I'm back and I have my four rows 1, 2, 3 and 4 of solid color in this area here you see it's more open again that was up to might your own creativity if you wanted to keep your pinwheel going or not. So what you have to just do is then you just have to slip stitch to the final just like so, I just gotta tighten myself up a little bit a little bit loose and just do that, and then what we can just do is fasten this off. So I've already trimmed my yarn so I'm just gonna pull through and I'm just gonna weave it through a few of these. If you wanna use a darning needle you can do so and I will be using a darning needle at the end of today's tutorial to hide in the final loose end so that you don't have it falling out afterward. So now the next two rounds one round is exactly what you already know but it's now using the purple. So the the border is kind of looking thick but it's actually two, and I'm just gonna bring this back, create a slipknot, join it to the start, see how you had two into the same one as you're doing that so you just join it to the first one of the two, join it with a slip stitch, chain up three and then double crochet in the same one to keep the growth and then one into each and I'm just burying in the loose and as I go just right underneath and you already know how to do that here in today's tutorial. So as I get to the next section here there will be two into the very first one. Just look where its double. See where you have the two there and it'll be the first one and then keep on going. So do this round exactly what you already know but using a new color so you can make a nice thick border. So I'm coming up all the way back around. I'm in the last one and I'm going to join. So for those that are gonna inquire because I know I'm gonna get a few emails on this is that no matter which round you finished on the border will always work. Because it was in multiples of 12, in 12 sections it's always divisible by 4 and I designed the border that can be done at any time within the project. So if you wanna, if you're not happy with the size and want to make it bigger you can do so. You will not ruin the border. So let's begin final round now. So we're gonna chain up one and we're gonna do one single crochet into the first one. So we're no longer gonna make any growth when you hit like a between to play uh, two pieces here. So then the next one is gonna be a double crochet into the same into that one and then a treble into the same one. Okay, and this will give a, uh opened up look and then in the next one you wanna do reverse of what you just did. So you wanna do a treble and then a double into the next one, so there's two stitches in each and then the next one is a single. So now you just get end up like a flower petal kind of idea. So let's review that again. So the next one is gonna be a single. Then the next one is a double to start followed by a treble into the same one and then the next one is a treble into the next one and followed by a double into the same one. So just remember that the two middle ones that make it up big are into the same one. So two here and two here and then single. Do you get it? So you end up with a really kind of neat look like that. Okay, so just review again. So single crochet then the next and then move on. The next one is a double treble, the next one is a treble double and then single crochet. So then the next one's single crochet, double treble, treble um, double and then single crochet. So when I said double treble don't make it a double treble that's actually a stitch when I think about it. So it's do a double crochet and treble and then the next one is a treble and then a double crochet. So do that all the way around for your final boarder. I'll see at the end of this to conclude. So I'm now coming up to the end I have three stitches left. If you have four or two, fake it or make it right you're not gonna frog the whole thing at this point nobody in they're right mind would. So just do the last few stitches as you know it. So it's a double treble into the next one and then the next one after that is a treble and then a double to the next one and then the final one is a single and you're just going to join it to the top of the first single crochet that you started with. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna take this yarn and I'm gonna show you how to weave in your ends. Now I've been taking care of my ends as I've been going along because there really hasn't been that many because you've been burying the yarn in the tapestry kind of concept anyway. So using a darning needle just feed your leftover yarn into the darning needle and what I want you to do is just glide this underneath. So don't go around the outside of the, of the stitch work. So don't impede on the outside. Just go on the inside, drag it through some fibers. So go 1, just pull it snug, and then go back in the other direction for 2 and then finally you're gonna do 3. So that's all there is to this particular blanket. It's really kind of a neat concept. I've designed this for simplicity for easy success rate. Whether you liked it or not that's up to you. So we have now giveaways and stuff and you have until the date that is on screen of August 18th to be able to submit your afghans to um, Yarnspirations through you can do it through Instagram or just update it to their website. I you go in the link in the more information of this video I'll post you a link there is also to submit. So now it's done, it's great, and that's it. So until next time I will post a photo of the final photo. So this is my second one because the original one on the camera um, main bed was actually mine as well. So now I have two. So until next time have a great day. We'll see you again real soon and thanks for joining me on this mystery. \ud83e\uddf6", "PampclqLyY8": "and last but not least we have II Barney's farm Afghans hash Clinton she's a monster she is

time bye", "N9D9e1aWFSU": "[Music] hey everyone and welcome to my Channel today we're going to be crocheting the beautiful 3d textured rose square by Lisa from cute crochet makes for her unicorn dreams blanket crochet along now you don't need to be taking part in the crochet along to do this square it would look absolutely stunning if you made a blanket just of these squares can you imagine

expand the box there you'll find all the yarn information hook sizes brand colors and a downloadable free pdf written pattern for this rose square so I thoroughly encourage you to just take a moment pop on over there grab your FREE copy of the written pattern so we can crochet it along together there are also timestamps in the description box below so if there is anything in particular with a written pattern that you're struggling with and you only needed help on a certain row then that is the place for you there are numbers which you click which take you immediately to that section of the video so if you only require help with row 3 then you can click immediately to row 3 and cut out anything that you don't necessarily need alright enough of the general housekeeping let's just crack straight on and jump into the row Square tutorial so to begin the rows square we're going to start with a Magic Circle now if you don't know how to use a Magic Circle I do have a video on how to do just that a little card will have popped up over here somewhere or there'll be a link in the description box below so with your Magic Circle you're going to go ahead and chain 2 which does not count as a stitch then into the magic ring you're going to place 16 double crochet just straight into the ring now if any point I'm going too fast for you feel free to slow the speed of the video with the three little dots are in the top right of your video under settings so once you have 16 double crochet in the magic ring you're going to ignore that chain 2 and slip stitch to the very first double crochet that you made finish the round then you're good to go ahead and pull that magic ring closed that was a dramatic rip from my hung that magic Center is certainly well and truly closed ok round 2 you're going to chain 1 and single crochet into that same place or you just slip stitched then chain 3 skip a stitch and put a single crochet in the very next stitch chain 3 skip a stitch single crochet in the next now you're going to do this all the way around chain 3 skip a stitch single crochet in the next when you reach the end of the round chain three and join it with a slip stitch to your first single crochet that you made so ignore the chain one and pop a slip stitch straight into the top of that very first single crochet and you should have eight chain three spaces all the way around okay round three you're going to slip stitch into the chain three space chain one which does not count as a stitch and single crochet into that chain three space now into the next chain three space you're going to put six double crochet all into the same chain three space single crochet into the next chain three space and you're going to repeat that all the way around six double crochet in the next chain three space single crochet and the one after that six double crochet single crochet six double crochet I'll meet you back here to finish the round so to finish the round you're going to pop a slip stitch into the top of that single crochet that you made in the chain three space at the beginning of the rounds that skip that chain one pop a slip stitch straight into the top of the single crochet and you will have four petals made with single crochets in between four roof fall you get to chain one and turn your work now we're going to be working around the single crochets of row two so these ones down here so ignore the single crochets that you just made and we're working into these ones from round two so we're going to single crochet around the single crochet of Row two chain 3 and single crochet around the next single crochet of round two so you're working below the round you've just done which will push these petals forward chain three single crochet around the next single crochet chain three single crochet around the next single crochet now what I'm doing I'm kind of folding these down putting my hook around that single crochet so keep doing that all the way around and you'll end with eight chain three spaces to finish you're going to slip stitch into this very first single crochet that you made of the round and then you just want to take a moment to double check you have eight chain three spaces and that you haven't missed any of these single crochets crocheting around them because they're quite tricky to see when you're using the same color yarn so just take a second to count your chain three spaces to make sure that you have eight for round five chain one and turn the flower around so you've now got the right side of the work facing you working into this chain three space here you're going to place four double crochet so I came to the chain three spaces you've just made so you have four double crochet then we're going to do a picot which is chain three and then slip stitch back into that very first chain of your three such a slip stitch in there which gives you a little picot and then put four more double crochet into the same chain three space that's your first petal formed single crochet into the next chain three space and we're going to repeat this working around into the chain three spaces so pestle which is four double crochet chain three picot four double crochet will interchange three space then a single crochet petal single crochet keep going and I'll meet you back here in just a second so to end the round you should have four petals with single crochets in between and you're going to slip stitch to the top of the very first double crochet that you did for the first petal for round six chain two and turn your work around now we're going to be working around the single crochets of Round four so just like you did for round four for round six single crochet around the single crochet of round four chain three single crochet around that single crochet chain three keep doing that until you have eight single crochets and eight chain three spaces it's a bit tricky to find them so you can lift up this petal round so you can find them okay to finish the round you're going to slip stitch to that first single crochet that you made does take a moment to double check you have eight chain three spaces with single crochets in between for round seven chain one and turn your work now just like before we're going to be working into the chain spaces that you just made in round six so in each and every one of your eight chain spaces we're going to make a petal so there'll be eight petals by the end of this round so a petal is formed with a single crochet three double crochets a Pico which is chain 3 and slip stitch into the first chain three double crochet an end with a single crochet all into the same chain three space so in each chain three space single crochet three double crochet chain three picot three double crochet single crochet all into the same space okay so you should have eight petals by the end of round seven so to finish you're going to slip stitch to that very first single crochet you made of petal number one and now we're done with clematis for a little while it's a chain one grab your scissors cut your yarn leaving a decent length to weave in later pull it through pull it up pull it tight sort your petals out so for anything like mine you've been shoving them around get them to all line nicely and now grab spring-green okay with spring green for round eight make a slipknot and we're going to be working into these top of these pecos that you've made sort of in between them now the pecos space is hard to find I'm not going to lie it's it's where do you put your hook so just shove it on in there aim for the middle shove it in you don't need to worry too much as long as you're going into the picot consistently in the same place for every petal so pop that slip knot on your hook and bring the yarn to the front of your work so to start round eight you're going to chain three now don't worry if that knot comes through because when you weave in your ends you can pull it to the back and into the same space where you've put your hook we're going to do a double crochet two together so yarn over go into the same space don't over come back through you don't over pull through to stop and again yarn over go into the same space you don't over come back through yarn over pull through two stop and then yarn over and pull through all three loops chain five and then working back into this same space we're going to do a double crochet 3 together that's yarn over go into the same space come back through three loops yarn over pull through two stop and again your neighbor pull through two stop and one more time you'll never pull through two you have four loops on your hook yarn over and pull through all four loops so that is your first little leaf corner formed chain five and put a single crochet in the top of the next picot chain five and then in the top of the next picot double crochet 3 together chain five double crochet 3 together so you're going to repeat this little sequence all the way round chain five single crochet chain five three double crochet together chain five three double crochet together chain five single crochet so you are forming a side and a corner in green all the way around to finish the round you're going to slip stitch to the top of this initial leaf that you made just go straight into the top and we're done with green for a minute it's a chain one leave a yarn tail to weave in pull it up pull it through pull it tight and then you can fold out give it a little stretching a tug you'll have four corner sections with four side sections in between now grab white okay for round nine with your white you're going to join into any one of those corner petal chain five spaces got stopped over here because I ended up in that bit so pick one of these corners with the double leaf pop the slip knot on your hook and bring that loop through to the front now you're going to chain three which counts as the first double crochet and put two more double crochet into the same chain five space chain two three double crochet into that same corner section so that's your first corner formed then in this next chain five space four double crochet for double crochet in the next chain five space and then in the corner 3 double-crochet chain 2 3 double-crochet all into that same space so you're going to repeat this around for double crochet for double crochet and then in the corners 3 double crochet chain 2 3 double-crochet 4 double crochet 4 double crochet 3 double crochet chain 2 3 double-crochet foot up crochet 4 double crochet and I will meet you back at this point to finish the round you're going to slip stitch to the top of your original chain 3 of the round now don't worry if it's coming up like mine it will all sort itself out if you just give it a little pull and a tug into shape ok for round 10 you're going to chain 3 which counts as your first double crochet and you're going to place a double crochet in the next two double crochet stitches from the round below then in the corner you're going to place 3 double crochet chain 2 3 double-crochet all into this same corner space now you're going to place a double crochet in every double crochet stitch of the round and in the corners 3 double crochet chain 2 3 double-crochet it's a double crochet in every stitch and then these four corners 3 double crochet chain 2 3 double-crochet to end this round you're going to join with a slip stitch to your very first chain three of the round so hopefully your square I'm running out of getting too big for the shot is flattening itself out sorting itself out nicely now you're not having to pull it around too much your hook falls out when you're chatting and you're ready for round 11 it's around 11 you're going to chain 4 which counts as a double crochet and a chain 1 skip a stitch and pop a double crochet in the next stitch chain 1 skip a stitch double crochet in the next chain 1 skip a stitch and then into the corner you're going to work straight away because obviously you're skipping this stitch here 3 double crochet chain 2 3 double-crochet all into that same chain 2 space to form a corner then we're going to chain one and for the very first stitch after a corner section you're going to skip first two double crochet and work into this third one here it's a double crochet into the third stitch from your corner and then continue down the row chain one skip a stitch double crochet in the next then you'll be back to a corner just skip that stitch with the corners 3 double-crochet chain 2 3 double-crochet and you're going to repeat this all the way around just remember that very first double crochet after your corner goes into the third double crochet stitch at the end of the round don't forget to chain one and you're going to join to the third of these four initial starting chains there 1 2 3 join with a slip stitch and then we're done with the white it's a finish off and grab the same color that you made your Center rows with alright so we're going to be joining this color for round 12 into any corner space so I finished off over here so I'm going to join in an opposite corner so just as before make a slipknot pop your hook through the space slip knot on your hook pull it tight and pull that loop through to the front preferably not stray off your hook like I just did so we're going to chain one which does not count as a stitch and in this corner space you're going to place one single crochet chain2 1 single crochet we're into the same corner space now you're going to single crochet into every single double crochet and chain 1 space of this round below and in the corners place one single crochet chain2 1 single crochet all into the same corner space so don't forget you're putting a single crochet in the stitches and in the chain spaces themselves so keep going and I'll meet you at the end of the round here to finish off round 12 alrighty so to end round 12 you're going to pop a slip stitch into that very first single crochet that you did cut your yarn pull it up finish off weave in all your ends and admire your beautiful rose square which no longer fits in shorter so as always I hope you enjoyed this crochet tutorial if you have any questions please feel free to shout in the comment section below and I will do my best to get back to you don't forget to pop on over to Lisa's website cute crochet makes to grab the downloadable free pdf version of the written pattern for this rose square and it would be amazing if you

square because I think this would be lovely as a standalone blanket on its own so until next time I will see you again very very soon happy crocheting bye [Music]", "a7RoP1LKMeM": "Michael: All right, everybody.  There has been a lot of name-calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring.  Much of it coming from one of you. Who claims that prison is better... ...than here.  And none of us can say \"Boo\", because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, There's somebody I'd like you to meet.  Somebody else who has been to prison. Who can tell you what it is really like.... I'm Prison Mike! You know why they call me Prison Mike? Angela: Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else? Michael: Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, biatch? Everyone: Woah, woah, woah Michael: Ay, ay, ay! That's just the way we talk in the clink.  But a lot of fun talk about prison today. But I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIGHT!!! In prison you are somebody's bitch! Oh and you, you, my friend, would be the bell of the ball. Don't drop the soap! Don't drop the soap! Ryan: Michael, please. *kissing sounds* Jim: Where did you learn all of this? Michael: Internet. Jim: So not the prison? Michael: And prison...it's 50/50. But, look.  Prison stinks, is what I'm saying!  It's not like you can go home and... ....recharge your batteries and come back in the morning and be with your friends having fun in the office. Jim: What'd you do, Prison Mike? Michael: I stole. And I robbed. And I kidnapped the president's son and held him for ransom. Jim: That is quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike. Michael: And I never got caught neither! Jim: Well, you are in prison... Pam: Prison Mike, what was the food like in prison? Michael: Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelets.  Nothing but gruel, plus you can eat your own hair. Andy: Wow... Prison sounds horrible! Michael: Yeah, yeah. Well, thank you Andy. Danks! Dwight: Prison Mike, what's the very, very worst thing about prison? Angela: Don't encourage him, Dwight... Michael: The worst thing about prison was the Dementors!  They... ...were flying all over the place and they were scary and then they come down and they sucked the soul out of your body!  And... it hoight! Karen: Dementors like in Harry Potter. Michael: No, not Harry Potter. There were no movies in prison. This is my point!  You guys got it soft and cushy! This place is freakin' awesome!  The people are awesome!  Your boss is nice! Everybody seems to get along!  People are tolerant!  People who have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves. Nobody's, nobody's bitch!  I hope that this scared you!  And from me, Prison Mike, to you. I just want to thank you for listening to me. And letting me be a part of your life today. 'Cause you got a good life! You got a good life! A good life... Michael: So, what do you think, it doesn't sound so great, does it? Pam: Wow. Thank you. Um....that must been hard for you to relive that.  Both of you. Martin: Yeah, that. Wasn't really at all my experience... There's certain elements of what you've performed, I've seen on television. But it didn't remind me of my time in prison... Michael: Okay, okay, fine.  You guys think prison is so great, all right. Well, here you go... Jim: Okay, Michael.  C'mon, let us out. Michael: No, if you think prison is so wonderful, then enjoy prison! They are such babies! I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom. And if this doesn't bother them, then I'm out of ideas. *theme plays*", "l1U0riyZuts": "[Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] so oh [Music] so so so so so interesting valley", "xocD1ri9iA0": "what I would it okay good my first day back just got out the House bill yesterday stop Biden or leave was my first stop we got cotton candy cush Afghan number one and purple article ain't seen no purple open round here since it's been legalized but uh I think purple Sparkle me my favorite out of the three but we'll be your number two that I began they all pretty good but I like that Afghan and that for a particle you to come work with us know when you could take office with you y'all know why I'm mr.

you yes you can you", "vFB_kma2-Wc": "hi I wanted to show you a hundred and sixty-five are on the hook I think it's actually one hundred and sixty four once you've changed your chained the 165 and gotten going this stick is about 16 inches long and all of the stitches do fit it's best to have your ends tucked into your notch and then they don't tend to fall off another rule is it's best to always get them all back on the hook not to end in the middle of a row because then when you pick it up it's hard to decide whether you were taking off or putting on but right now you've got blue on the hook so you need to take off with purple so here's my purple and I'll just it's going to take awhile for me to get across but you yarn over take off too and you do that all the way across my mother-in-law used to make these in two sections so she would put half of the loops on at a time and make two panels and then join them up the middle and you can do that if you want to but later she decided just putting them all on the hook at the same time seemed easy enough and as you go along I forget exactly how many rows are in an Afghan but it gets heavy to work with and sometimes your arms will hurt just the weight of the Afghan as you're doing this but I have made probably fifty of these and redheart I wanted to show you the package they make your color for years so you don't have to buy all your yarn at once it seems that there's fewer ounces in the variegated than the solid so you probably need more variegated than the solid if you'd go that or you can choose two solids it's best to choose two different colors although I have made Afghans in a solid color as you're learning it's just so much easier to do the two different colors and you can see that one side is going to be purple and the other side is going to be variegated so they're very attractive Afghans I don't generally put the fringe on anymore I usually have pets and I don't like the pet hair getting in the fringe and it's a lot of work and a lot of yarn to make fringe I will probably just single crochet a couple of rows on either end of this Afghan and call it done and I'll make another video when I get to well maybe where I've got it half done and then all the way done um what else was I going to say they are washable because you're making it with this redheart yarn and although redheart is a cheap yarn it's a really good one for this Afghan they stay quite attractive for a long time and then if you really feel that they're worn on you can just knit a new one okay we're getting there we're getting there so you can see I just keep pushing my yarn towards this tip and yarn over and take two off all the way across in one color and then you'll turn the stick do the same thing with your other color and I think that's how much I'll do in this video is back and forth in one color and back go forth in the other color just keep going in it does take a fair amount of time to complete an Afghan but it's an easy stitch and you just pick it up whenever you've got spare time you can take it with you you have to guard against breaking the tips off from your hook and if that happens you can superglue them back on and do a little bit of sanding with an emery board and just keep going there's a lot of stitches per row you're a beginner you might want to count how many are in your row so you know that you're not losing stitches because if you lose stitches you'll probably end up with a shell rather than an Afghan because it will start going in you want it to stay square or eventually rectangular I was watching YouTube videos and there's a lot of people who do this crow hooking but they kind of do it a different way and I'm teaching you the way that I was taught this the way that my mother-in-law made hundreds of these Afghans I think we all make them for everybody that we know and sometimes make them for people we don't know I think all my family members have at least one and they're so comfortable the way that they you know cling to your body as you're watching TV in the wintertime okay we're getting to the end I'm going to show you that important part and I'll probably stand behind the camera so that you get it looking right you can see how long this is and all of that fit right on let's see if you can see this oh boy oh here we are I've got to hold it about here you're going in the same loop you pass a vertical bar and go in your same loop yarn over and then take it out leave it on the hook now before whoops before crossing that blue vertical I will go in this purple trying to figure out where the camera is go in the purple horizontal over and out and leave it on the hook oK you've got three on and you've only crossed one blue vertical then you're crossing the next blue vertical and going in the purple horizontal yarn over and then pull out okay so that's what you need to do on that end to keep it square now we go back across in over out in over out and there probably are 164 stitches I never did count but you can see that this is square I'm not losing any stitches as you do this your hook will get smoother and it'll the would kind of turns to glass as you make pull I don't know maybe ten Afghans with the same stick this is not my best stick but it's a good one I gave the best one to my sister as a beginner it's kind of nice to have one that slides easily this one the tips are pretty nice and then as I'm pushing down the stitches don't slide as easily as they probably should but that comes with time and you keep a nice even tension my tension right now is even that it's seeming a little tight and you'll see as I get to the end it's getting more of a struggle to push and to fit them all on the hook but it is very possible and I wanted you to see how you can put them all on and work your Afghan all at once we've got I haven't measured but you can see that a crossed it's going to fit across your body quite nicely because it is quite wide it's so very yard it's easy to talk to people while you're doing this or watch TV or wait for your tires to be rotated or oil change or whatever mmm maybe a soccer game if you have kids doing that all right so you see as I'm getting to this end I'm going to catch it in that match and then as I'm loading the hook they should stay on rather than come off the end wish I had more to tell you about this Afghan assign doing this but it is pretty simple can't remember I've knitted a few Afghans too but I think for Afghans I do like this the best I should have put some music on at least you could listen to music while you watch me another thing you could do well your crow hooking is just listen to your favorite music they were almost to the end now since why the training video with 10 stitches was nice you could see the whole process but I wanted you to see what it's really like if you do an Afghan with the first chain of 165 stitches and how you operate how they do fit on your hook came to the last purple one on the end and if you wanted to leave now you could you've got your stitches safely embedded in the crease of your hook and they're all on and I haven't counted there probably 164 so now that you've got the purple on you turn the hook and take off with your blue and you just it just ready all right yarn over and take off - the first time you do it there - purple then the next time it's one of each yarn over and I'm taking off a blue and a purple so yarn over and take off - all the way across and you'll just repeat what you saw me do with a purple I think I'll end this video now and I'll come back when maybe this is halfway or so thanks a lot bye-bye", "ZzfTaCsjKAA": "hey guys today we're making a purple cauliflower quesadilla with some vegan

"2tZcSVX_phY": "[Music] hi everyone i finally got my first month excuse me kit for annie's club the crochet uh striped afghan where you do three they send you fat uh fabrics my sewing machines here well they send you yarn enough yarn to do three strips each month and i'll have a link below um for for how to how to order it and so forth excuse me if you're interested so i already cut the top because i i didn't want to have to um fumble with that i'm fumbling enough as it is here it's it's bubble wrap on the inside so the the the plastic of the of the things uh are sticking to it so there's the yarn pretty isn't it and that's a um it may look kind of gray but it's actually a very dusty uh purple let's see if you can can you see it does it show better yeah maybe it shows a little better here and that's the actual um afghan that i'll be making you have to check and see what size it is now let me see so that's all that's in there so we have a um crochet hook it's in a little pocket on the side so there's a crochet hook and the tapestry i call it a tapestry needle the needle you use for sewing in your ends and sewing knitting or um crocheting together that's a big eye we can handle that and then so let's see what else is here so the rest is just uh paperwork so a pack of um a pack of stitch um markers and i think this will be a good idea in the other kind of color color coordinated them and this will be a good idea when i cast on because if i'm casting on across this entire row that i'll never remember what not what number stitch i'm on by time i get to the other end and then this is general information of um of your regular crochet stitches and it's got some special crochet stitches so let me just put that like that and i don't see where there's an end to open so i'm just gonna cut be careful when you cut across anything even when you open up the actual package to make sure that you don't uh cut into your beer yarn by mistakes i'm not sure if you can see the purple of that it's just barely a purple it's really pretty purple gray i guess it would be and then here's the next one and it's um i believe it's annie's own um yarn and then the last one and then the pattern i'm not going to show the inside of the pattern because that's not right for you know fair to annie's but that's the afghan i was looking to see what size it is i'll have to go on the website and find out what the actual size is because if it's right here i'm missing it so this is going gonna be stripes one through three and here's a picture of the whole thing so you can see that some strips are different colors some a little airier than airier that's air like air area than others like the one here i can see um and and it's in its label sorry i keep pulling it back and forth it's labeled stripe one stripe two stripe three so i figured i could handle getting that much done each month should be good for that so um let me look at the uh instructions for each um stripe and um do a little bit i think they're i think they're three different colors so i could start a little bit of each one or i'll start one today and then i'll come back on and do a little quick video to do another one um just in case you want to stitch along with me kind of keep you going and i'll put pictures on the on my blog and the blog is not www there's no www it's laureen l-o-r-e-e-n dot type pad t y t-y-p-e-p-a-d dot com and i'll also put that link in there because i'll put some pictures of my progress there and on this laureen schoolhouse facebook page in case you want to stitch along with me kind of help we'll help each other keep going so that's what's in the kit you have everything you need you've got your the proper size hook your tapestry needle in the um stitch markers so i'm good to go just need a little pair of scissors and a little practice and i will let you know um what size this is and um i'll do another little part and add it on to this video i just remembered in miss laurene schoolhouse saturday so on we made these i called it a busket a week or two ago so i think that's going to hold every all my supplies let's see let's put it that way so whichever one i'm working on i can have that one sticking up and my pattern can go right in beside it and all my little extra stuff and i'm ready ready to go so i can keep my project right in my my basket as i'm working on it and when i'm not working on it until it gets bigger then i may have to make a bigger basket so if you're a sewer this is a really simple pattern and i want to say it was two saturdays ago so this is february 20th 2021 so two weeks back 14 days was that about february 6th or so and it'll say right on it uh fabric basket so let me go ahead and get started on my strips okay i read the pattern for the first strip and um it's a single crochet and a double crochet and then again i'm not going to do the actual pattern because um that to me it wouldn't be fair to annie's uh to to display the pattern so i'm just gonna show the single crochet double crochet and i will say i'm not an expert crochet by any stretch of the imagination um but i just thought you know for those of you that might want to try it um you know if i struggle it'll be something you would struggle over so first thing is i took the tools in um let's see today is february 20th 21 and so in the miss laureen schoolhouse saturday so along for the last saturday so that seven day so that would be the 13th sec i believe it was last week um we made this scissor case and i thought well you know it goes with my basket so i just put the tools that that came with it plus a couple more so i needed a pair of scissors and my double eye needle let me bring everything out so you can see around here here's the tapestry needle the stitch stitch markers and i always have a clip in the in case i need to clip a pattern or whatever the scissors and the crochet hook so i'm going to just bring one of these out put everything else away and i have to chain quite a few as you can imagine because it's uh i believe i forgot to check it's i know it's 45 inches wide and um and i'll check later to um see what the length is i'm sure it shows on the excuse me on the pattern so i leave a little bit longer tail maybe than most people do but and this yarn is very very soft this is going to be really nice so i do a slip knot let me move in a little bit closer and again i'm sure there's a you know 100 people on youtube can can probably you know that crochet all the time so i just make a circle let me see if i stop and think about it it's hard to do so i circle around and then i just bring that yarn up so you can see and the slipknot is made so you can be tighter or loose or whatever you would whatever you prefer so i don't like to make it too tight i find that that we tend to or i tend to when i'm making my first um my slip knot i make it too tight so just gonna remember you have to have room enough for that for your crochet hook to move in and out and i know people hold their yarn differently but you got to have a little tension on this yarn and i'm going to move i'm just going to hold this tail is in my other hand maybe i'm a little too close yeah um because i don't i don't want to grab the tail i'm sure there's plenty of us that have done that and you grab the tail and you start chaining that and then you run out because you grab the wrong the wrong end so i just got it right here and i kind of used my finger as my little table and all i'm doing is [Music] grabbing the yarn and you want your hook to go downwards as it comes through the loop and i'm trying to do this slow and see it makes a little let me do a couple it makes a little v or a little heart and again you don't want to do them too tight um with time you'll start to make them more consistent so i'm looping it and i'm just all i'm doing is just pulling that yarn through the loop and see how it makes this little group of um v's or hearts so i would go ahead and i'm just going to chain a few more i'm not going to chain the 100 and whatever it is 100 million stitches that i have to do but i think if i've got quite a few stitches i'm just going to stick stick a marker in in that v when i get to 20 stitches so every 20 stitches i'll put one of these in because i know very well that if i if i wait and count it out the end every time i count it it'll be a different it'll be a different size a different count from the first cup so um so i get to the end of the row so say i needed i don't know let me just say i need 20 stitches i'm going to chain 20 but then i need one more so i'm going to chain one more so um and a lot of times instructions will include that one more in in the chain amount and then what i want to do and i think i'll come in closer again i just got to make sure i keep my hand where you can see it so now i'm going to start my first row and i'm going to show you how i do a single crochet so the loop that's on the hook is not it's not a stitch yet it's just a loop on the hook so i want to here's my first my first stitch you see it right there looks like the little v are a little hard so i'm going to skip it and go to the next one and i'm going to i'm going to stick my hook in so you can see so i'm going at the top a point with this i'm going in like that okay and and i'm just gonna and i'm holding on to the tail and i'm just gonna grab the thread that thread the yarn pull it through the first hoop the first hoop the first loop and then i'm going to grab the thread the yarn again i'm going to say thread a million times and then i pull it through two and that's a single crochet so i'm going to go right to the next loop and see how if you look at the if you look at the chain i'm just going through the top side well it's actually just right through the middle of the of the heart and i'm going to go slow and i just want to show you and i want to make sure i have a little yarn out here so i'm not i don't want any tension from the from the ball yarn so let's see if i can i'll turn as if i go see where i need to be okay i'm going to turn as if my fingers like are in front of me so i'm going to grab the little loop pull it through the first one and then pull it through grab it pull it through two and i'm gonna go to the next one and go to the next one and it's a little hard when you first start because you don't have a whole lot to hang on to so so say i'm going right through that top and you'll find over time your fingers will especially for this hand will work however however it works for you and then i want to make sure i go in the last one which is just before that that's the little knot of the um slip knot so that that slip knot loop was a was a stitch okay now i do my i i i don't turn and then chain i chain and then turn so what we need to do is we need to because we're doing a single crochet we need to we finished our stitches so if you count across here each one of these v's or hearts would be a stitch so if you needed 20 stitches when you're done you count across here this is not the one on the on the hook is not a stitch yet just count them and you should have your 20. then i'm going to just do a chain because this is a single crochet i'm going to chain and turn and i think of that chain as is making the the edge or the turn in the corner and now i want to look at it again because i think if you look at it from the top it's much easier excuse me so we want to skip the first one so i'm going to take my loop out my hook out a second so that's the loop that's going to be on my hook there's the first one i'm coming in the second one and i'm coming straight across both hearts or both parts of the heart okay so let me just make this smaller so i'm skipping the first one which is way see it's right over here it's almost natural to go to the second one because otherwise you'd be coming back in the one you just came out of and it you know just fall back out so i'm gonna put my hook through and see it's going through both sides of the heart pull my yarn through and once and then pull my yarn through two it's easier when you go a little faster so i'm going to go through my next one and see you can see see how my hook is through those two pull the yarn through and then pull the yarn through two loops okay and we continue on make that chain at the end so when you're at the end your last one if you hold it up see it's very easy to see it when you hold it up sometimes if you're looking from this angle it's a little harder so if it's hard for you to see where your stitches are there they are right there and and that would be my last one right there down there so that's a single crochet so i'm back at the end of my row now if i have to do a double crochet i need to have three chains because i need it to be taller to match a double crochet so i'm going to do one two three and i'm gonna do the same thing so there's my there's my three up there i'm gonna come down with a double crochet you want to yarn over first so i've got two loops on there then come through and you're coming through the stitch the same way there's the whole part right there and i'm going to pull it through once and then pull it through oh run run did that run let's try that again pull it through pull it through two pull it through two so now that chain today oh let me do one more so yarn over to begin with pull it through pull it through two pull it through two and so now you can see see how much taller those are and so see here's the first one that was the three chains that made the first double crochet and then you can continue on so you can see along the top again your stitches so when you're doing a single crochet at the end of the row you do one chain if you're doing a double crochet you do three chains and then continue on you you're putting it through the exact same way no matter which one it is it depends on the single crochet you're gonna you're gonna go through the loops grab your yarn get the make a loop and go through the two loops and the double crochet you're going to um put the yarn over up a little more yarn go through the same way so you're going through both sides of that heart or v pull the yarn through go through two loops grab the yarn again go through two loops and continue across so these are the two types of stitches that are in the first strip of the afghan so i hope you you stitch along with me i'll do another little video when i get to the to the next strip or the next two strips but i just wanted to get that that started and again if you want to join the club i'll put a link below and i do get a small commission um if you go through use my link it helps

wonder why order this house is no suspended order the house is no suspended", "R6hEVHpDFX4": "hey guys so this is gonna be a cooking video I'm going to be making a roasted cauliflower so I'm gonna be using purple cauliflower for this one and I'm going to be seasoning it with Old Bay which you see here and with red pepper flakes in garlic powder and also some sea salt which is there in the back and some red wine vinegar and olive oil and then I'm gonna add some red pearl onions this is a very simple video so let's go ahead and jump right into it [Music] okay so I've already washed my cauliflower so we're going to actually just take this green part off and then I'm gonna slice it and I'll show you how to do that this I actually just tear it off maybe that's not the proper way but the way I do it is I just tear the green portion off okay and then I'm just gonna take my knife I'm gonna cut away Stan and then I'm just going to make slices so like so so and one more okay so you should have four slices then I'll get rid of that green part and I'll throw that part away so won't keep getting in the way okay so I've cut away the green parts we're not going to use and I have it in four slices isn't that pretty I really like the purple cauliflower and you guys know purple is my favorite color anyway so let's go ahead and put it into the pot I'm going to be using this it's just a brazier it's really large that's why I'm using it but I'm gonna go ahead and put it in there and then I'm going to show you how to season it okay so I have the cauliflower in my brazier doesn't it look pretty in there and cauliflower is such a clean slate for absorbing flavors you can make it taste however you want so I'm gonna start with just putting a little bit of olive oil and a red wine vinegar and then I'm gonna put my seasonings and then I'll put the pearl onions okay so the first thing I'm gonna do is sprinkle on a little olive oil not that much but brush it over just to make sure that it's coating the surface doesn't have to coat the whole surface but you just want to get as much as possible okay and then I'm going to sprinkle a little bit of red wine vinegar it looks like a lot but I'm really not putting a lot at all and then here are the pearl onions I actually took the skin off a few of the pearl onions I'm not going to put a lot I'm going to add these okay and now I'm gonna go ahead and put my garlic powder a generous amount of garlic power powder that gives it really good flavors and then I'm gonna sprinkle a little bit of my Old Bay seasoning you don't be afraid to use your seasonings nice and then I'm gonna go ahead and put red pepper flakes and that'll give it a little kick and I love my red pepper flakes anyway you know that I put these on pretty much everything that I'm making you're my last thing I'm going to do is put a little bit of sea salt I don't put that much because we already put so much other seasoning so I put like maybe three and a half I guess you call it turns I don't know and that's it okay so this is what it looks like and then I'm gonna go ahead and put this in the oven I already preheated my oven I have it on for 25 and I'm gonna go ahead and put this in the oven okay so we're all done I'm actually gonna go ahead and put this in the oven I'm not gonna put the lid on I'm gonna go ahead and let it cook I don't know how long I'm gonna leave it in there probably about 30 minutes but I'll keep checking on it every 10 minutes and we will go from there since that pretty okay guy so it is in the oven we're gonna let that go ahead and cook and we'll check back shortly this is the progress after about 10 minutes so it is all done this is what it looks like I just took it out of the oven and add it a little bit more of the red wine vinegar but doesn't that look delicious and you can serve this as a side dish or you can eat it all along with a little bit of melted cheese on top but yeah it's definitely delicious give it a try okay so I just melted some mozzarella on top of this and call it a day this is so awesome you guys have to try this it's pretty and it's delicious [Music]", "3vGrta9IKeY": "what's going on

so moving them in them out is moving them in and out is easy so here we got the first one just perfect no spacing so the buds are gonna be nice and big as you guys can see really nice note spacing all the way along the plant so they're going to fill out have really really nice big colas might clean the bottoms might leave them leaning towards just letting it grow just defoliating the bigger leaves but we're in an absolute jungle here guys i have the white cobs out right now but i'm just running the bloom lights but yeah guys look at the growth on these things absolutely massive look at the

"9C2e2gMHya8": "my name is Connie and I am going to try to show you how to accomplish this beautiful plaid pattern I'm actually going to make this into a poncho but it's really a very neat way to crochet in double crochet carrying your yarns so that you get this very neat plaid look to your to your work so the first thing you've done and I've got the written directions on the website is you have already did your chain of 50 chains and that's one more than you need and then you went back and single crochet to end the second chain from the hook and went across with one single crochet row first before you actually get started doing this and the directions are fairly simple to follow I'm just going to give you some tips and show you how the carrying goes along and how you change when you change rose there's a couple of tips that I've found in working this that would help you out okay so I'm hoping this is close enough that you can see I have three colors of yarn I have this this purple color fanis choice of the see this important I guess really dusty purple then it's this grayish color for the light color and then I have a darker color and I have them all sitting in front of me with the yarn strands coming out because there's also an eagle trick I do keep your yarns from getting all tangled up so where we're at now is we're at the end because what we have to do is we have to do 2 double crochet rows in and when you're on a rut a row you're either going to be crocheting with the lighter color and i'm going to call this this dusty purple or this medium purple color my main color because that's the youngest you need the most so you're probably need two schemes of that yarn and one skein each of the other two colors which is that lighter color in that darker purple and so usually what works well is a pick your color choice and then a darker color choice and then a lighter color white gray tan beige to go and this is like I said it's just a great when I had on hand and then for these two rows I'm going between the main color which is that medium purple and that grade which is lighter color and carrying the whole time and then when I do these two rows I'm only carrying the main color and the darker purple but I'll get to that later now i'm at the end of a row where I've done the medium purple and the grayish color and at the end of every rose you're going to chain three now i'm using a size a hook and i'll check the gauge on my stitches to let you know what the jays would be for that mine it ends up with 49 stitches the width is not the whole width and i can't show you in the camera that it won't go cuz i've got it close up the width of mine is about 17 inches wide and the piece is 26 inches long and I mean to pieces and I'm going to send them together to make the poncho and when the projects sort of cat a corner you know and on the body with the neck opening from the middle of your neck to the tip of the poncho the point of the poncho is going to be about 23 inches for this particular one but I'm doing I'm not even really sure exactly what size child that is going to fit I'm thinking that it's going to fit maybe maybe five to seven year old a little girl but I'll really have to see and check my measurements to be sure on that because the gauge is not really important you just need to get your pieces the size that you need to make it the size of the punch of it or whatever i'll grow you're doing it for so I've just turned and I'm going to chain 3 and then the way this is set up and you can set that however you want to but lay off set it up if I've got to play nor main color stitches on each end and then I've got three double crochets of the light and then three double crochets of the medium purple and that's throughout the whole thing so it sort of gives you a border on both edges of just two double crochets so that chain three at the beginning of the road is always going to count as your first double crochet so now when I get ready to do this this double crochet the next one you can see that there's a place to go in right here and then right there so you would think you maybe would go in right here but really you don't because that chain 3 is taken up is count as that double crochet since that part right there so really you go in this very next play which is right beside of the lighter color stitch and that's always where you're going to go in to do your first double crochet so in this row with the lighter color it's just too so it's that chain three that counts as one and then the double crochet that I just did and that's too now what you do is you don't and I've completed to show you that but when you change colors what you do is you you really don't complete your double crochet that's the third the second one on the ends and then the third one throughout you leave those two loops on your hook that's when I'm going to bring in my next color and so my next color let's see for this one okay so for this one it's going to be purple and I was wrong on the purple section and if I move this up you can see on the purple sections you actually do your chain 3 and then you do one two three four more so it's those two at the end and then the 32 count as your first little square so i apologize i was wrong the next one is purple so I'm going to go ahead and do three more double crochets on top of this base square because I've already done my two rows before of the other now when I get to this third one I'm just going to stop halfway leave my main color yarn attached that will stay attached the whole time that you do this but you are going to cut your other corresponding or court colors at the end of every two rows because it wouldn't look neat to carry up that dark purple or the or the beige that grayish color up the sides it would just look tapping and messy so you don't you just cut it in it's really not that much trouble so now I'm supposed to bring him this my purple and I'm going to grab my end of my purple I can hear it's sort of hard because I'm trying to get far enough out to get him camera range and I'm just going to pull that purple up through those two loops to complete and of course my yarn is love them to be mean and split on me like crazy get that back in there pull that through a little bit neater and at first when you do this it's going to seem a little fiddly but um once you do it up a little bit it'll get easier so I'm going to take my tail yarn and just sort of let it hang out there in the front pick this up because that's going to be the color that I'm crocheting with but then as I'm going along i am going to be carrying my strand of the purple the medium purple of main color along with me the whole time this is a tapestry crochet method and you won't even notice that that's being carried along throughout the whole work and it'll look really really neat so I'm just going to lay that sort of toward the front with my other son and sort of hold it so that I know when I do this next crochet that I'm actually crocheting over top so I'm actually going in to make my crochet but I'm also going around and catching that purple strand and carrying it as I go and then I like to just I mean you can go ahead and put this over here and crochet / that at the same time if you want to or you can just choose to run it under later I'm just gonna let that hang out running under later since I didn't hold it and crochet over it so that I'm just going to go ahead and do my second crochet and then do my third now when i do my third again i stopped because it's time to change colors and I've got my two colors of yarn right here that I need for this road so because you can see to stay with the pattern that's what we need to do so what I'm going to do is just get used to because this purple yarn out in front of me is to the right of me and then this lighter or the main color is to the left of me the scheme is laying over here to the list so what I'll do is the scheme that's to the left I always drop that yarn to the front and then I always drop this one to the back as I go so they don't get all twisted up and as you do it alone you'll you would see what I mean so because I need to start working with this color I'm just going to sort of drop that darker purple to the back pick up this around my finger so I start crocheting with it and then with my thumb and my middle finger grab and pull that a realm because now I need to start crocheting it over top of the darker color now the reason I left my two loops on my hook is so that it looks really neat across the top because that Luke that's left on my hook is the top of that third croche crochet so that's going to be there and when I bring this next color in you can see when i move my crochet hook that it looks really neat it's got I've got my 1 2 3 crochets and then right here this one's ready to be that top of that of that next crochet I guess the easiest way to show you really would to be to do it the other the wrong way so you would see the difference so let me just do it the wrong way okay so if I was just to complete that third crochet and then drop my yarn and bring around to work over it and start doing my crochet okay like this you can see me go ahead and do another one just so it's really obvious okay so you can see that that looks really weird because I've got this the three in this color but then because I didn't pull my purple in when I had the last two loops on there it took another purple strand out here sort of hanging out over there halfway which looks sort of weird it makes your work sort of those sideways so you don't want to do that because that that really doesn't look neat so what we're going to do is just want to pull that out and pull this back out to that second or the half of the double crochet like I said leave those two loops on the hook I dropped my dark color to the back because it's to the right and then I picked up my my purple and holding the other with my son to the front go ahead and finish that double crochet in that dark purple section with my medium purple and they are ready to do three more double crochets and you can't hold this right at the top of the road or to the back where is my life because we're to hold it to the front is because then that way you can really see it you can tell that you are going over top of it and catching it in as you do your double crochets so I'm just going to do three double crochet and then always on my third one I have to stop halfway through so now my purple yarn like I said is to the left so I'm just going to sort of pull that sort of to the front to let it drop pick up my other yarn from the back because that purple student that dark purple yarn is to the right in front of me and and then I'm just going to be ready to complete and be my next one so then I haven't finished that double crochet now I've got this purple yarn meet our main color here ready to go I'm just going to go start doing my three double crochets and I'm a pretty loose crochet", "fmcFNQJwGdU": "hi I'm Maggie Weldon from Maggie's crochet need a working crafts and in this video I'm going to show you pattern number he a 850 which is available at Maggie's crochet calm this is an adorable little girls dress outfit and it's called Isabella purple dress and it's a three pattern in one set and it was worked in light worsted weight yarn and the sizes are 0 to 6 months and 6 to 12 months and the skill is easy and the dress was started from the top and worked out and then when you get to the arm holes you skip some stitches to leave a space to come back and put the little sleeve in and then you continue on with the rest of the body and the body and you increase here and you have an eyelet row here and then you increase so it has a little flair to it so it drapes really cute it ends in these adorable little drop shells at the bottom that's so cute and then the little bloomers let me finish showing you this one it's got the little buttons down the back and then you tie it in the back so that is adorable and then it's got little matching bloomers that help to flare the dress out and they hang low they have the same lace edge on the bottom of the the pant legs as the dress and it hangs lower than the then that dress when they when you put it on them on the child and then this bonnet is so so cute look at this and this is easy because it's just double crochet stitch and then once you get out to a certain diameter then you just crochet even you come down here there's a little eyelet row for the you weave the ribbon through this one of the rounds of double crochet and then it's got the same beautiful little shell border on the outside I think that's one of the things that makes this dress is that are the shells but then especially the the edging how it finishes up sounds really awesome so the link to this video the link to this

twofer we're gonna do uh kind of a big flower haul my wreck was up and i just read it up today so i got a nice big flower haul and i'm gonna review some crumble from cure leaf let's start okay so first of all um i went and i got in this crumble this is afghani name set so i actually have two of them i'm explaining what so this is afghani crumble this is an indica from cure leaf and i don't understand how this goes but clocking in at 79.5 thc point four cbg i don't know for a total of 8.5 cbd for a total of 96 okay so here's what it happened was i picked up the crumble uh it was actually delivered and it was really dry it's it's very like it looks like a ball of keefe was pressed together like it's very crumbly like sometimes like that thca you'll get like it's a little powdery it's it was like that i'm gonna just because i got a bunch of stuff here to look i'm gonna put some in my box and we'll vape it all right so we got some in there oh [ __ ] i just dropped some oh [ __ ] oops so let's take a couple hits and then talk about it and yada yada it really does taste good let me tell you what all y'all puffco people this vivant dab box and i am not affiliated with the brand this thing hits so [ __ ] good and you can buy separate coils and i i literally have the same coils in it since i've gotten it so and that was in december this thing hits like a beast especially if you're on the go on the no all right so before we talk about it i want to look at this one because like i said it was super powdery the last time i got a crumble from them it was layer cake it was really good it was very like rosin like so they did replace this and they did completely replace it so shout out to them let's see i get scared wearing these little things because i i'm afraid i'm gonna like open it up and it's gonna spill everywhere okay see now this looks completely different there we go all righty then holy [ __ ] that's what we're talking about hang on a minute guys i need to weigh this thing this [ __ ] thing looks big this is the crumble that they replaced it with as you can see it is a nice big hunker that's not break there's two big hunks in there and this was like very powdery see see how it's very powdery and this one's not so they absolutely replace it good job on them oh my it smells so good it reminds me of the uh the rosin from truly because it has like that naturally terpe stuff you know go with your natural terpenes by the way this is the second time i'm shooting this video sorry about my lighting i don't know what's going on mainly because i was going to do this haul and i didn't know what was going to happen when i uh you know i they replaced it so i wanted to you know redo the video so and my thoughts on this by the way that one looks great if it has the effects i love their crumble they're the the layer cake that i had and this one's the afghani it's [ __ ] off off the chain it tastes good it smells good this one was questionable but like i said they replaced it and that one looks great so i'm not mad at that shout out to curie for their crumble it's badass i in my opinion it's good [ __ ] i also got some flour i got some afghani we'll do a separate review on that and let's just go over i went to truly and i got some flowers okay here we go wow why does that feel so big i got some mandarin dreams member berry space bomb look the minis look at the new mini jars i ordered this last night but i was able to get that hold it a bunch of mandarin oops whatever it's okay nope i ordered a lot of flour okay oh we've got i got some super silver haze it's a mini um northern hash plant which is one of my favorite indicas more northern hash plant i got some lemon um oh geez that lemon og kush minis member berry as always and a bunch of mandarin dreams i don't know what i want him for on the mandarin dreams but i guess i did and then some space bomb mini so um i like the little new lids it kind of huh nope it looks like a

what you live in a small place oh i'm sorry you know i don't mean to laugh at you because i know you'd probably be hungry and want that too um and don't want to cook all the time sometimes you just don't want to do it but i wanted all the things for breakfast you guys i wanted everything i wanted pancakes i wanted buttermilk pancakes i wanted everything and so i looked on my phone i was like look at her doordash and i was like hey what if we got cracker barrel honey we go order cracker barrel y'all i got breakfast for like three days i don't have to cook for three days i don't have to cook for their names i got breakfast for tomorrow i got breakfast for monday i we ate breakfast today um and i'm sure i have some left over for tuesday listen i was craving some really good buttermilk

crafts or crafts at all what's on your hook or something hmm that's the only thing that delivers here is pizza hut and dominoes cracker barrel came from my hometown oh wow that's cool yeah i love cracker bell yummy yeah oh um yes let me tell you their pancakes cracker barrels pancakes are the best buttermilk pancakes that i've tried from a restaurant perspective okay um bob evans um uh i don't even order i don't even order a pancakes from bob evans because i was like um ihop did i do that out loud if you like ihop go ahead and try it that's just not my preference i prefer cracker barrel buttermilk pancakes try them if you have not they are amazing and that syrup they go with honey please child yes it's all of that and more okay um thank you i'm mostly crochet that's what's up dawn as a show but i just started making cards this year nice that's what's up yeah let's see they are the bomb i always get their pancakes you better come on in here robin wrote robin yes honey yeah no i have no no i don't i know i i don't want it i don't want it i don't want it yeah yeah not a fan me either child me and my husband went one time sadly um it was it was really disappointing i was mad not like on fire mad about it but i was like dang i i thought these was going to be good and this is it's not no so yeah i have pancakes are two films yeah yeah yeah no thank you to i have hey man no thank you no ma'am no ma'am no ma'am no ma'am i don't want it i don't want it but honey yes we would have a nice time yeah yeah um crackle barrel absolutely absolutely i love love their buttermilk pancakes period and that is on period yes so um yeah that's what we did and i ordered enough so i ordered i'm so crazy i ordered the family you know uh meal situation um and so it was a whole lot so i knew that's what was going it was cheaper to do it that way than just you know piecemeal and stuff together it was just cheaper and it was oh it was good now uh some of y'all know we don't eat meat i did get the bacon with it but i don't eat bacon so what i do with the bacon is i break off little pieces and crunch it up real small and put it in my dog's food and it's a little treat for them so everybody gets to eat cracker barrel in its house yes ma'am okay waffle house has better pancakes than ihop that's bad yeah and i'm good on that as well um waffle houses one in places that you go and ain't nothing else open it it's like what you want white castle or or waffle house okay yeah yeah i haven't been in waffle house in years years we have a uh marie scramblers here do you guys have that marie scramblers they're all right they better i would perform read scramblers over bob evans and i prefer cracker barrel over marie scrambler if that makes sense so it just depends it's just whatever your preference you know what i mean oh cute what kind of dog do you have honey i got three of them right now you don't see them because they look number one they look a hot mess they need to be sheered ever since the panorama nonsense the rona came in our lives uh we haven't really been out much and my dogs pop things need to be sheared um so i finally got some medicine that's a lot another story i have to tell you robin it's crazy uh but my dogs they need to be cut and so they look a hot potato mess maybe i might let raven come up here you guys can see her but i have three havanese they are the cuban cousin to the bichon um some people call it rejoin freeze free john free freeze freeze a or whatever um i'll just say bijan because that's easy that last part i can never get right because i don't know what the proper way to say it is nobody really told me and i never really asked so anyway they need to be sheared my dog was put on punishment from the groomers because my dog was like look i ain't having it y'all cut me way too many times and that buzzing all that y'all is for the birds so they told me she could not come back unless she was on medication and i was like she just she the youngest one lord what in the world and she had been going she wasn't um bad or anything let's see yeah let's see i have never eaten that waffle house you're all right robin you good but if you want to try it don't try it you might like it i don't know i don't know everybody's taste i just i'm good on cracker barrel and i'm good on a marie uh scrambler um bob evans is the third and if i had to go between waffle house and ihop i think i would choose waffle house let's see i did such a terrible job grooming my toy poodle but he's happy as long as he happy mm-hmm oh how precious i have four dogs and we just lost our last dog except oh so we are looking for some puppies oh i used to breed my dogs i'm not breeding them no more because it's a lot of work but i certainly would be like girl i'ma have some puppies but nah and you would like them too they're smart like uh they're smart like uh border collies they are and um something groomers should be prepared for set behavior because pups are a a bit high one yeah you know what christo catnip agreed i'm just thinking because of the ownership changes or whatever with this one particular one i like to go to that they got some new people in there and they real super sensitive be like i ain't doing that dogs here because he ain't gonna be biting at me he ain't gonna be nipping on me i'm thinking this so yeah yeah dogs are great pets so yeah we had a dog that had to be medicated before haircut really brenda okay well all that to say i got the medicine maybe about a couple weeks ago so now i just got to call the groomer and say hey we got meds i'm gonna need you to share all of them cause i'm thinking i'm gonna have to put all of them on meds because they all need to be sure they look a hot mess y'all pray for me and my dogs and my hubby they look a hot mess and it's gonna be expensive i already know but i want them to shear them because that is how bad their hair is and they're so sweet they are but so it is what it is it is a pleasure to see you all what y'all working on i know we got somebody working on a shawl in here and a butterfly anybody else working on anything cool that i missed in the chat um let's see thank you so much rob and prayers for us all i appreciate it me too uh brenda but she was a child and a child our most most breeders feared dogs to grow yeah most breed that yeah yeah they are they are but you know i don't know what's wrong with my dogs they just gizmo just said forget it she said i've had enough of you people we're done oh and working on a hat okay cool my sister named rena has to medicate her or the vet won't see him lord have mercy drug your dog and kitty up so that they can come and be in the presence of people yeah that's what yep so i'm gonna put them all on drugs when we go because i don't want numb give them nobody no problems in there uh even though the pills are for the uh one the other two are pretty much fine but because they i think they're in such bad shape i'm not like horrible they just need they just got some mats on them and i just don't want them giving them any trouble and they need their nails clipped and raven she don't like nobody touching her paws so so our girl grab her paw like just a regular she'd be like no my like girl high five um uh give me five hi she was like [Music] no no none of that she does not like anyone touching her apology guys and i was like her front post now her back pause she don't care she could care less you guys for real she could care less she don't care but then front paws yeah bada gets

pleasure to see you too i'm glad you're here what y'all working on what you got on your hook so let me tell you uh i was on tick tock just me randoring around on tick tock and um this dude his dog escapes all the time obviously and the dog's name is gucci and he'd be yelling at that dog and it'd be funny that dog look at him like what he's a shih tzu i think that's what it's called shitsu and he'd be like gucci gucci he's like he's like i'll be daggong he don't say daggone but he's saying some other stuff but it is so funny to me and he'd be running after him he would like get back here get back here go chad and he always can find him at the at the same spot he always go see his neighbors other dogs in the neighborhood gucci just be rolling he'll be leaving and it is so funny that dog it is he's so cute he's so little it's to see this grown man chasing after this little dog first he's yelling at him like gucci go jay i'll be doggone well he don't say dog but you know he said

little grass in the bottom of a mason jar and cut holes in the lid we would keep them overnight and they would light up the jar and then release them the next day yep that's another way to do it too ain't eating no bugs on purpose that's right i feel like i'm so behind i am moving slow today are you kidding me auntie danny you're slow is probably my fast oh dang are you talking about crocheting or just walking around yeah i eat no burgers on purpose either i remember i had this and i'll tell you this is crazy i had this since uh uh my one of my professors and my social uh what class was it social science class in college um and she was making this case about bugs and this and that and she had a bag of cricket y'all and asked us if we wanted to eat them first she was like um they're a source of protein and blah blah blah and this that other i was looking at her like nope no ma'am no ma'am ain't nobody eating those and then of course we have at least one adventurous student in the classroom i'll try some go on bro eat you some crickets i don't care i'm not no i know what i'm gonna do i know i'm not eating no crickets i'll tell you that right now that that's a that's a no i'm only eating crickets if i have to that's the truth ain't nobody eat no bugs on purpose but she made this huge case of how their protein and this and that you can hear them popping in his mouth yep you could and i just looked at him like okay um what's next what are we doing what are we doing because my biology teacher in college grabbed a handful of mealworms and popped them into his mouth and started chopping them like they were candy jesus um you could hear them popping in his mouth yeah yeah i remember ben and jerry's made uh cicada yeah i heard about that cicada ice cream and i was like no ice cream from from them till the flavor that flavor is gone you better come on in here crystal catnip i agree ain't nobody eating no cicada ice cream that don't even sound right okay enough of the buggy stuff huh you guys but that's what happened you know some people eat stuff like that i don't know why yeah i'm good i wasn't going either yep i'd be done i'm good ain't nobody showing uh go

start like 15 minutes to see how it goes and then go from there i have like latch hooks that i want to get done and i'm like what a perfect opportunity to show a work that i have that i can do like i have diamond art painting i want to show i'm just working on those in kind of an asmr fashion with some nice calming either music or sounds like an ocean or something like that i just have all these little tiny baby ideas in my head so what y'all think what y'all think about my craziness i just i don't know i don't know if you would watch it or not but i i just thought i would do some along with my crocheting of course but you know i just wanted to do show other yarny projects that we have not so much to diamond all right even though that is not a yarny product but a lot project but the latch hook and stuff i got some latch hooks that i got to get done i have the central over here where i can make hats quietly and make you know other items on it and i just want to utilize um all the things

i can't wait to put it all together so i finished that one so i'm working on the white one once i get that one all um together lovely um then i'm going to join that one with the orange one and then keep it what stitch is that oh the orange it's a single crochet and double crochet cluster so single crochet double crochet in the same stitch skip a stitch single crochet double crochet in the same stitch skip a stitch and on and on that's what that is yep that's what i did yeah and so then when you start your next row what you're going to do you'll start in the um um in the double crochet

everyone random Randi here this is yarn Talk episode 48 and this is my second time recording this because my tech-savvy three-year-old accidentally deleted my video files that I had recorded a few days ago yay but it should go a lot quicker this time around with a lot less coming and a lot less things to edit out so that's always good my voice may sound kind of scratchy mm-hmm and I will try my best not to start hacking up a lung but as in typical fashion my husband will be leaving for training soon and he brought home the plague for all of us Hunter was the first one to succumb Killian has a pretty hefty cough now and I'm starting to get the beginnings of a tickle so yeah anyway since it's that super fun time of year where it seems like everybody in our young community right now is sick this is not acceptable oh we all need to get over it we shouldn't be transferring germs digitally across continents and I know it's not really happening but it's weird that everybody seems to be sick all at the same time so I only have a few things to show I have three Finnish objects and a few whips I have been bitten by the blanket making bug this week I'm not quite sure why I really don't have a reason to be but I guess it's just something that I can do to get rid of a lot of yarn all at once one project send it off and be done with it and have some more space so maybe that's what it's really all about because I've been decluttering a lot and if you saw my craft room confessional video that I posted the other day which is my second time lapse video of me rearranging everything in here eventually I'll get the configuration of this room the way that I like it and then we'll probably be moving out of it shortly thereafter because that's how my luck works but I've actually shifted more things in the room since I took that video so I'm going to start with my finished object which apparently I have buried there we go so the first one since Hunter's birthday's in a few days is the monster on the groomy that I was making for my son will be turning five on Thursday the 25th and he drew a picture of a monster and asked if I could make it into a toy for him so this is the end result as you can see it is far from perfect however I think he will like it I made a point of giving it a smiley face even though usually on Alman groomy and dolls I try not to give it a mouth because that gives it a bit more expression and it seems like kids don't play as freely when it already has something plastered on its face for instance if there was no mouth then it could be sad it could be angry it could be you know all those emotions that kids need to work out usually through imaginative play as opposed to punching the snot out of something we're breaking things or throwing things or kicking things or all the fun things that frustrated tiny human beings do but this guy looked super super creepy with no face so he has a smiley mouth do not look creepy I did back loop only on the hands here to kind of emulate the lines that he had drawn on the arms even waffle stitch body gave it the one eye and it does actually have a brown I am not sure if you can see on the safety eye or not if you can see the color but it's actually brown like in his picture and I gave a little rag doll leg so it can sit I hope he'll like it he's not feeling well and he's pretty grumpy so fingers crossed there's one thing done second thing done I actually just finished a few minutes ago and I didn't have this last time I film - this is a new thing yay this is a purple newborn 0 to 3 month sized hat this is made in red heart Super Saver purple tones why is this purple hat one of my fetish objects you might ask well that's a good question I was looking through some of the other small yarn creators channels just a few days ago and came across one from adventures with Anna and she was talking about making purple caps for click for babies click for babies essentially is talking about the sound that knitting needles make when they go together but you can also create objects for it and they are to promote awareness of and be a visual reminder to parents about the period of purple crying which usually goes on anywhere from two weeks to five or six months of age and you're perfectly healthy baby who does not have colic can scream and cry and carry on and look like they're in pain and there is nothing you can do to assume them for up to five or more hours in the day I experienced this with Hunter when he was a baby and being a new mom with no other parents anywhere near me that I was in contact with you know you internalize all of that I can't call my baby down there's something wrong with me bla bla bla bla bla all the fun things that go along with postpartum depression and just all sorts of negative self thoughts all of them moving beyond that unfortunately it is perfectly normal for a completely healthy baby to cry excessively for seemingly no reason and it can be very frustrating very stressful and the whole purpose of the purple caps is to help prevent people shaking babies because they are frustrated and exhausted and sleep-deprived and overwhelmed so because this really hits home for me I'm going to be making a lot of these with any and all of my purple scrap yarn that I have kicking around and possibly even some of the full skeins because I never really use purple and projects but I've got some here that's purple I've got this purple tones which I have enough left from this in the ball still to probably do one more I have some left over Deborah Norville but the whole point is to remind you you're not a failure as a parent your baby loves you they just don't have any way of expressing it right now please don't shake your baby there are only a few states that have local places you can send these caps to I will leave a link in the description box down below the video that will give you all the information for that if you do not have one near you so you can physically drop them off you can always mail them if that's something anybody's interested in doing as far as I know it's only a thing that's in the US but it's it's a good charity thing to get behind in my opinion so that's something that you'll probably be seeing a lot more of little purple hats for me in the coming weeks they will be accepting them starting in April and they distribute them to newborn families of newborns in November and December so this will be something that I'll probably be working on up until maybe end of the summer and then call it quits on that and send in whatever I've amassed for that by the end of the summer so there is a finished object to finish to object 3 I actually have a video clip that I will show you and it is my tank top that I was free handing the racer backed one and I guess I'm mostly happy with the way that it turned out this one in particular is very obviously a prototype one of the joys of working with striping yarn is that when you work in a smaller space you get big chunks of color as opposed to long pretty stripes so I'm calling this particular version of it my Frankenstein racer back top simply because you can tell where I had to add in portions gonna show you the clip of that and I'm gonna be working on the math for it to get it so that it won't end up so blocky and will fit slightly better the next time around and as I said it is a recipe that I'm working on so it will be a top that people of any size can make for someone of any size as long as you have certain measurements and enough yarn so here's that clip [Music] you so that's how it turned out like I said I'm fairly happy with it I think in the next version of it I will use half double crochet and the bodice portion I am wearing a black tank up under it it does show a little bit through this region because it is all in double crochet however if I switch it to half doubles because I hate I just hate using singles maybe I can even do an extended single I'll have to all have to work on it one of the joys of designing things is that you get to make it up there should go but long story short it is definitely a prototype is it still wearable absolutely is it my best work oh oh heck no no no no it's alright I think the next one I do I'm going to just use a solid color so if I do have to patch in parts it won't be as noticeable as it is on this one so that is my third finished object and now moving on to the two works in progress that I have as I said I have been bitten by the blanket bug this week and I don't know why it is very strange to me I don't I don't know what's going on so this I feel like is just an attempt to get rid of some of the weird odd balls of yarn that I have there are two different types of yarn in here and I will explain what they are and how I am combining them after I show you how it's turning out where's the front that is the front so this is what I've got so far as you can see it is lots of shades of pink and this is going to be a baby blanket when I measure to this I believe it was about 36 or 38 inches this way so pretty much I'm just going to use up what I've got for these yarns and see what size it is when I get done with it and then I'm probably gonna call it good I don't think I'm gonna even bother with a border because I like the way that this edge works up on the granny stripe and I found the pattern for this from attic 24 I believe it's a really simple stitch it works up super quick I did all of this in an evening we're talking from probably 4 o'clock until maybe maybe 10 ish and that's not working all the way through obviously you know dinner and kids getting ready for bed and dishes and everything else it's not like I sat down for six or eight hours in crochet because my fingers would fall off so as you can see here there are obviously two different types of yarn this is big twist baby yarn and strawberry stripes colorway I only have three balls of this and it has a light purple a light pink it has a grey and a creamy white color to it this is what it looks like still in sk\u00e5ne form he said it's big twist it is worsted weight it's all acrylic each ball is an 80 gram ball with a hundred and forty seven yards of yarn I knew that the three of these alone would not be enough for anything substantial and I didn't feel like making hats or something like that with it so these I'm combining with as you can see there's this bright pink and white and this almost graham cracker oatmeal tan color it is my miscellaneous sale I see arms the pink and white and tan there are several different shades of pink the white there's this tan color there were eight balls of this I am into the second one the way that I'm using the yarn so the colors will be quasi evenly distributed as I'm using up a whole ball of the big twist two balls of the ice yarns one involves the big twist two iced yarns one big twist and then we'll see where it goes from there all depends on how big it is at that point because I have eight balls of the ice yarn and I'm not sure I don't think I'm gonna end up using all of it I considered maybe doing a border with the leftover but with the way it stripes it would be probably 2 or 3 different colors I don't think I'd like the way that looks so there is that which I am working on and for this I am using an eye hook 5.5 millimeter Susan Bates because that is my favorite this second work-in-progress is kind of a weird one now these two pieces that I have I did not make and I will explain why in just a moment alright so if I can lean back far enough to get it in here is one rectangle here is rectangle number two as you can see they are done in the granny stitch they are not the same size they are made out of an acrylic yarn and they were made by my great aunt Margaret I believe for hunter when he was a baby and it's something that with how much moving around we did when he was younger they stayed in a bag so that they wouldn't get stained or dirty or anything and just got forgotten about I suppose I found them and decided that because they are not the same size I couldn't just join them together to make them into a larger piece that would be more usable since you know my kids are very large toddlers at this point and hunter is going to be five in a few days as I mentioned before so I went through this stuff and found a few colors of yarn to make squares to add together not quite sure how I'm going to configure it yet but I figured out how big I want the blanket to be figured out how much space is already covered by these two squares rectangles and I'm going to take the squares that I'm making and join them to these two pieces and possibly do a border around them but I plan to make a fairly sizable blanket with a probably decent throw size close to twin bed sized almost and I'm thinking of sending it to my father the thing that is super cool about these little cuddly blankets in particular is that my aunt Margaret thanks to macular degeneration that even several rounds of LASIK couldn't fix mostly crocheted these probably by feel not by sight which is why although they are imperfect I don't think that they are beautiful and excellent work and I would like them to be part of something that will be in my family and be appreciated by people in my family and our house because my husband is such a prolific blanket maker is so overloaded with crochet blankets I could cry so I want to make this and the squares I'm working on into a blanket to send to my dad because he lives in New York and it is much colder there than it will ever ever be in Washington so I'm gonna show you the fact that I have the squares halfway done now when I film this two days ago I had all of the circles done now I've got the squared parts at it as well so this is a skwerkel pattern granny square which means a squared circle and it starts off round and then you add stitches just so to make it square and then do one more round when I did the math I wanted them to be five and a half inches they turned out to be six which is fine I think it's better to have a blanket be slightly bigger than way too small so I'm going to show you how these looks so far and what the yarn is and what I've got left to do with them so this is just the stack of the center parts that I still need to add the squared rim around the edge to there are three six there are nine of these left and I figured I'd need sixteen of them all together like I said I'm not quite sure how I'm going to configure them around the rectangles I'll figure it out so just to show you the ones that are finished here's one two three four five six seven so the way that I'm doing the edges I made four centers of each of the colors and I'm going to do the borders on them and every color except the color that's in the center so as you saw since none of the centers are gray I do have four that have the grey on the border and I've got three that are bordered in the tan these ones will be bordered by black these will have the blue white and black variegated and these will be bordered by blue now to show you what the yarns are the gray is red heart Super Saver soapstone and I had never seen any colors like this from them before but it's they have a few different color ways that are similar to this now if that gray looks familiar it should because it's the same gray that the body of hunters Monster is made out of I still trying to use up yarn the light brown is red heart with love tan the black is also red heart with love just black I'm assuming this doesn't have a ball the end anymore and it is a mess messy messy cake don't look blue is also red heart with love and I do not know this particular colorway because the ball band for this has been gone for quite some time now and be blue white and black variegated is I love this yarn print aqua black this yarn is super super pretty I really like it there are a lot of things about Hobby Lobby that I disagree with but I do really enjoy this yarn however I will not be buying any more of it once it is gone because reasons and I'm not gonna go political but reasons so I still have nine of those to finish and honestly I did them so quickly that I'll probably have them done and be joining some of them together by the time I do another video so that is all I have for my barista for now I know a lot of other people are doing entire videos to shout out a very long list of small yarn creators and rather than doing that since I am planning on doing February which will be a vlog every day in February funny how I always seem to coincide those daily vlogs with what my husband's not here kind of weird how that works out but rather than doing a hugely hugely long list I have actually compiled a list of 62 fiber-based channels on YouTube that I follow and that I found through everybody else's shoutout videos so at the end of each one of my videos from now until I have gone through the list and I may potentially get more of them as we go along I am going to mention a few channels from the list and I'm gonna start right at the top because I made it alphabetical because unreasonable order is how I roll so I'm going to just name them off and I will have links to their channels in the description box below the video so you can check them out subscribe if you like them I'm sure that everybody by now heard more about the D monetization fear that has struck all of us and I finally actually just finished the approval process for getting paid through Adsense and I have a lot more money accumulated from the last few months than I thought I did which is totally awesome so I'd like to keep that going and in order to do that I have to reach 1,000 subscribers before February 20th which I'm doing okay for I estimated approximately 10 subscribers per day until then and I've been doing that or more so now my number is only to get 8 per day still gonna aim for 10 so that on slower days I have a little bit of padding but yeah I'm fine for watch hours I think I had 6,800 watch hours when I checked today so that's that's not a problem anyway just gonna name off a few of these channels that I enjoy and that you might enjoy too if you're stuck waiting in between your favorites uploading and you're wondering what the heck you're gonna watch or listen to while you are crafting or doing chores around the house like I frequently do here are those channels starting with the A's the first one on the list is a cracking crochet er second on the list is addicted to yarn next is adventures with Anna which is where I found the link to click for babies next is Amy's woolly world of creations next is Blue Chair of 82 blue heart crafts Britney Morris kamme cab 1 4 7 candy goth creations and CD Aki and I will stop there because that is 10 and I will continue to do that until I've gone through the list so now that all the yard stuff is completely done and my shoutouts for the day are done life stuff I'm pretty much just operating in damage control mode right now I went out and got some groceries today because Adam is sick the kids are sick I'm just starting to get sick and I'm going to me leaving before the week is out so I am trying to get as much into the house as need be because honestly if I get as sick as they are we're gonna be quarantined stuck in the house for about a week so I want to have everything amassed and compiled beforehand so that I don't have to try to run out of the house when I'm hacking up a lung sneezing everywhere and both of my kids are dying and cranky because they're sick because everybody knows how fun it is to try to go to the store when you have two sick kids even once that kid is a nightmare who sick kids forget about it so preparing for that preparing for him leaving I washed five loads of laundry today folded everything but the last baskets worth got everything else put away I did the dishes did dinner it's just oh so this is the Randi did housework all day look isn't this awesome the flat hair the no-face yeah it's it's it's a hot look so this is the casual chore accomplishing look isn't it great I think we should make it a thing maybe we can make it into a trend there isn't really a lot out going on just trying to kind of plot ahead and get everything planned because this is going to be pretty much the longest Adam has been away from us he's going to be gone for 30 days come home for two weeks go back out for 45 more days so he's gonna be gone pretty much until the end of spring unless something changes and I'm not holding my breath on him coming home for those two weeks because he things have changed before where he was supposed to end up having a break somewhere and it didn't happen so I'm not gonna get the kids super excited about it just in case it doesn't happen really hoping to get Killian completely potty trained by the time the Adam comes home from his for his two-week break though because that would be nice Killians about the same age that I completely potty trained hunter at and he's having a lot of the signs that he isn't ready to because I don't believe in trying to shove your child into potty training when they're not ready when I potty-trained Hunter it took me less than a week and I did it while Adam was deployed for a month last year wasn't last year almost two years ago now no two years ago now we've been here forever anyway but I did it when Adam was gone and I got Killian off the pacifier and had hunter potty trained all in the same week so I'm going to be working on potty training Killian and getting hunter should be able to read a little bit more than he does now gonna work on writing I'm planning to add in a little more structured schooling time still trying to convince my husband at least trying out home school for a year isn't going to harm anything because they don't really do a lot in kindergarten and Hunter already knows all the shapes and his colors and he can count to 100 he can write his name but with his attitude and how active he is I really don't feel like he's ready to sit for that long and he's kind of displaying class clown behavioral tendencies which I really don't like and I'm going to do my damnedest to break him off as gently as possible because he's he's a people pleaser in the first place and he likes to make people laugh that he will go out of his way to do really brainless things to get a laugh and I don't like that I don't want him to think that that's how you get people to like you that that's how you make friends so that's something that I'm gonna be working on with him lots more reading I have figured out a system for getting library books that works much better than actually getting them physically we have a lot of really good opportunities through our on post library that are completely digital there are actually quite a few programs some of them actually have the cool little videos with the pictures in the book kind of moving like you would have seen on Reading Rainbow way back in the day Classic Reading Rainbow just a lot of really cool things through the on-post library I'm not sure how many things like that are available in an off-post library I know that a lot of people can access things to overdrive I know I've seen Kendra from hooked by happenstance does a lot of audio book listening and ebooks through her local library which is pretty cool I think it's so crazy that you can do things like that now because I went to our on-post library and was actually really disappointed in their horrendously small selection their kids section they actually have a separate room that's all the children's books and they do storytime and they have like LEGO building afternoons and stuff I Nergal but their kids section has more books than pretty much the whole rest of the library combined unless you count because it's a military library that there is a row with that stretches the entire length of the building that is just military history books which if you're into that that's cool but not my thing to say the least so I feel like I have rambled long enough this is gonna be lengthier than I was planning on hopefully I can edit some of it out oh can you tell I grew up near Canada I can tell I grew up it's very very close to Canada but anyway like I said if you're interested in finding some more yarn channels that you may not have seen before check out the ones that I mentioned I will leave all the links in the description box below the video and thank you to everybody who has subscribed to me in the past few weeks all of you new people are really really helping with the numbers if you know anybody who might enjoy the sort of content feel free to send them this way and with this small yarn creators tag there's no pressure for you guys to subscribe to everybody we mention it would be cool if you liked their content and you want to but I feel like we're trying to build more lasting connections with people like the livestream the other day that I did that was so cool to be talking to that many people it was kind of hard for me to keep up with what was happening in the chat because at one point there were 23 people and like I said that kind of freaked me out a little bit but anyway thank you so much to everybody for tuning in and watching and then mr. kitty and I will catch you all in the next video bye [Music] you", "h7ezLradBxg": "um john from the afghan wigs here with my buddy greg my

have everything done with my face because this is not a true tutorial I am going to try to put all these shades on my eyeballs so I can give you a real opinion on how I feel about the palette but yeah these are the shapes I didn't really think this out these are really bold okay anyways I'm gonna swatch them real quick okay these are the colors swatched let me hold up the palette next to it there you go you can see very bold colors very pigmented I didn't have to wipe it multiple times but those are the colors very very bold loving it I wish I would have thought about this more because I'm going to work afterwards so we'll see how this goes umm yeah so I think the first color I'm going to stick with is High Times which is this really bright green right here [Music] now I'm going to go in with Oh G right here alright so now that I am looking ridiculous let's go and with these matte purples here I'm not really sure how I'm gonna do this I think I'm gonna go with swisher this one right here and then won't actually know I'm camera that one looks lighter so I'm going to go a strain and this one right here [Music] all right so now that is done we've got two shimmery purples here and I'm gonna use these two here now [Music] okay so I'm gonna use this Bubba under the eyes and see how that works real quick I'm gonna go back in with some sparkly colors in a minute [Music] okay so now I'm gonna go in with euphoria under the eyes too [Music] [Applause] okay so I think I'm going to take that euphoria and dab it in the center of the eyelids with my finger [Music] okay I really like this glitter it's really nice okay so there's one color I haven't used and that is Northern Lights right here and I'm gonna use that in the corner of my eye light here at the bottom okay so that is literally the nine eyeshadows right there so now I am going to go in with liner and I was debating whether I wanted to do purple or black on the top I think I'm gonna go with blacks on the bottom I'm gonna go on the outer waterline with this color pop gel color here and piggy bank and then the top eyes and the Hank and Harry will Lickety black [Music] okay eyeliner is done now I'm gonna go in with mascara and I think I'm gonna use my favorite ones that would be the Thrive one and the big lash eco bite was a big ego by Tarte so those are the two I'm going to use and you can tell this one's gotten a lot of love because the name is coming off [Music] [Music] okay so there's the finished look um so yeah probably I'm going to have to change the lip color before I go out of the house but I mean I do like this look these colors let's talk about the palette here now these shimmer ones here they did kind of there was a little fallout it's a little grainy but that's typical with a glitter for the most part as a glitter they were very fine and very pretty and I really did like it whereas in some glitters you know really chunky these are fine so that I really do enjoy all of these went on smooth nothing patchy not a lot of fallout other than the glitter and that's pretty much it I really do like this palette I think it's wonderful and I do recommend it that's all I have to say about that and if you liked this video don't forget to Like and subscribe and if you would like to see other things with these this palette just comment below and let me know otherwise I will see you in the

offers a chance to learn a new new stitch pattern i have offered up stitch patterns for a knit version and four crochet version both are finished off with crocheting edging okay mix and match the patterns to your liking make the panels long enough for an afghan or smaller for a lap gan or child size cover-up others have suggested making a tote bag or a pillow so let me tell you the materials um that was suggested for this for knitting needles you would need a size nine for crochet hook you would need a size g or h for both versions um a cable hook for knit yarn needle for both and one skein each color in red heart or i love this yarn and so i already talked about the colors which were black orange red gold um purple blue white and green so today um we are looking at we are gonna

hopefully you can see all of that and let me go back here all right just hanging out that's cool it is awesome to see you all here i'm telling you so this is what we're starting with we're starting with the color orange that's what i have right here and so this is the um that is let me see this is the pattern of the crocheted version the knit version is beautiful two is down here but um being that we starting with the crochet i haven't heard anybody say that they were interested in doing the knit version we can go ahead and get started with the uh orange gates of hell let me read what it says about that so basically each panel represents a part of the salvation story so orange represents the fire of hell we are condemned to life in hell romans 6 23 says for the wages of sin is death not the physical death but the spiritual second death life eternally separated from god it is further described in revelation 21 verse 8 but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters in all life shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone which is the second death are you anywhere on that list listen all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god that's romans 3 23 and so basically this is what we doing we are going to crochet on ourselves off the train but we are going to crochet the the fire was it the fire gates of and yeah gates of hell is what this is called i if i would have looked up i'd have seen it there it is right there on the screen lord you know me i'm special okay so we're gonna go ahead and start with that [Music] um all right so i'm using it says use a g or h hook i like h g is rather small for me so i am going to be using the h hook here is my orange yarn let's see if i can find what is this oh shoot this makes it easy i appreciate big twist it was like right on just stuck right here it's like hey just pull me i'm good this is it so we are going to loosely chain 23. let me see can y'all see that okay just hang out i can't see any of those tiny words okay um do i need to make it bigger it's a free pattern gee and jen and i also included the link in this in this uh uh in the chat so if you scroll up some you'll see the actual address if you copy that and paste it you'll be able to get it it is a free pattern offered by the wonderful author terry ann porter we so love and appreciate her so much yeah i like big twist yarn yeah it's soft it's actually softer than um red heart you know so i'm gonna be trading 23 let me see if i can make this bigger i'm going to play have to play ketchup i have four of the colors in my stash and of course orange isn't one of them oh that's okay um oh okay yeah i'm just gonna be doing them by color but yeah um make sure felicia how you doing honey um if you want grab the pattern so you can have it honey um it's in i put the link in the chat so if you scroll up you'll see the link in there that i put in there for it let me see if i can how do you know how people put um stuff in and then they lock it down i don't know how to do it let me see if i can pin it so it'll stay no don't put me in timeout um let me hit show that's it right there i don't know how to make it stay up there you know where you can pin it to your you know what i think i do have to do a banner let me see [Music] um i'm looking to see i'm still learning these uh youtube streets in the stream yards you guys there's got to be a way i can do it i'm not going to do it now but i don't want to be labor the time but that is it so if you find that in the chat yeah hey marky mark okay it's in the description box under the your video too yeah i put it in there i think i did yeah i did okay so we're just gonna chain loosely 23. i guess i can make it bigger but then i won't be able to see your comments oh that makes me so mad i like to see comments lord okay i'll just look for my book but i'll show this from here so jane loosely um 23 so let me go ahead y'all know our crochet slow so it's gonna be a minute get my chain done oh lord [Music] so let me go ahead and get started on it two sit loosely right okay that's a little tight oh okay three we got 10 there [Music] what 19 20 21 22 and 23. so i change mine so some of it is loose some of it is not i'll stretch it out so make it even yeah and then basically in the first row we are going to single crochet in the second chain from the hook and in each stitch across we should have a total of 22 so in the second chain that's what we are going to do let me make this smaller here hey let me know if you guys want to come up and hang out i mean you can come up on this screen and hang out with me it's fine it's fine for real i can tell you what we're doing i don't have to show the pattern because it's very hard to see obviously um because they they tiny up here and you have to make your screen full screen to actually see it and so i'm just going to remove the pattern now so if you were able to download it amen oh you have the book i purchased it the other day i came across it all right that's what's up felicia yeah honey just don't worry about you know being you know a little bit you know behind you you're really never behind in crochet i don't think okay let me stop sharing my screen there we go yeah so 23 and then we are going to do a single crochet in the second stitch from the hook yeah i like to um i'm one of them people who like to crochet in the back ridges you know the bumps and this is why it takes me so long to to get the first row done i'll be taking forever y'all it's it's i'll get it i don't get you know my groove on until i get to like the uh third row third row is like is a that's it right there that third row i can uh call it on in bring it on it i'm just slow with him even though you guys i believe i'm getting a little bit faster because it's like if you crochet every day you can't help but to get a little bit more speed in your life not that i've been crocheting every day but at least every other day but so far getting these trying to get these scarves done it's pretty man pretty much every day so yeah let me see just well i got a few of them done lord y'all know y'all know i'm slow oh good gracious yeah so why are we doing it and people are like just chilling and hanging out which i appreciate you guys immensely what did you and find enjoyable about the study or has it really um how has it impacted your life that's what i want to say have you grown from it have you seen some things like oh i need to improve in this area or you know what i mean i know i have i'm like lord there's so many spaces i need to improve on you know and always keeping you know the lord and on my mind and like what would the lord do in this situation because you know because i know what my flesh want to do sometimes that's why i got that cup that's a punching people's frowned upon that was funny but that's a real message that's why i crochet because um so this is row one it takes me a minute you guys i'm ooh i'm a little bit slower than most [Music] so let me not oh my goodness they just want to tell the whole world about it probably the ups man is out there let's see that's raven she has a big gigantic bark but teddy being a little he has a big bark too he's like ain't nothing going on she she barks at everything she barks at everything that people can't see and i appreciate that if you know what i mean she real sensitive that dog is a sensitive girl [Music] yeah so that is my raven hey susan how you doing we are crocheting today my love so we'll be crocheting today um at from 1 i'm sorry from 12 30 to 1 30 and then again at six i'll be back on here to uh share in this space if you guys want

perspective about it if it was helpful or if you didn't get a chance i mean even just one one lesson alone was really good or one devotional was really good so i'm skipping the first um i'm skipping the first uh single crochet and i'm going to the next single crochet and i'm going to single crochet in this one and double crochet in this as well [Music] i'm telling you i'll be getting messages

let me show you i will read from this here and it is a knit and crochet bible study devotional journal and it is it is isn't it denise it's wonderful and um it relates what we do in crochet and or knit to uh the word of god and how it is it impacts our life both ways yeah it's really good so yeah so if anybody wants to come up and hang out and crochet what a sister please that would be great oh i didn't finish reading this part um the s second row which is on what i'm working on we chain one we turn we skip the first single crochet and we single crochet double crochet in the next one then it says skip the next and then basically it's a repeat of skip next dc i mean single crochet and then single crochet double crochet in the next all the way around so you skip one put two stitches in one skip one put two stitches all the way across until you get to the end so that's what i'm doing here oh single and double skip this one single then double oh get in there skip this one single let's see yeah i hope yeah i'm back to working on the last black sweater oh nice i'm okay denisha i love i appreciate you asking look at that i love when y'all chat in the chat it makes me happy because i'm like we're family yes yeah so i will drop the link again if you want to come please do um it's always fun to chat to actually talk to a person even though i'm talking to you guys here but it's nice to like have somebody like when you working on stuff it's hard to chat and do um get stuff done at the same time but it makes it easier when somebody is in the chat with you or on the panel with you is what i want to say yes it just makes it easier to do it for sure [Music] so this is what we're doing today just for an hour and then again i'll be on live again today at six doing the same thing you guys and it's only gonna be for an hour i think um two i'm not i wanna go over to pink motivations today because i know that she is gonna be learning how to crochet and i wanna show as much support as i can because i know once you get started sometimes it's nice to know that you have a level of support all around you know crochet like a foreign language for me oh it's like a foreign language well that's all right you know once you get the hang of it it gets really simple and don't get me started on crochet and foreign language how about this tasha that the way we uh look at stitches or how we name our stitches they do it differently in the uk when you think you doing a double crochet honey it's not a double crochet and you know what's crazy i understand why they did it i understand why they don't use our methods so for instance you know how like for us our math system is so crazy but for them it's like we just do you know what does lb stand for to us we know that stands for pound but what does it really stand for um really we doing that today no we're doing that today so you know and it's the same with the crochet like for instance i'm gonna do a single crochet this is a single but to them this is a double crochet and i understand why they say that i understand why they would say that um our double crochet is uh a triple crochet to them it's crazy so you can get you can get caught up or turned around if you're doing a pattern that use utilizes the uk's um translation which i have look y'all i'm so crazy i love crochet so much i ended up buying this crochet bible i was like oh this would be so cool you know it's all in uk if the whole thing is uk which is cool i think it's awesome but i was like i'mma be sitting here i better not get confused when i use that book that's all i have to say about it don't get confused so they're single they don't have a um slip stitch i don't think they call it slip stitch no i think they call that a single cro yeah uk yeah yeah it's easy once you start looking at it denise it gets easier um it's like speak for myself right um just looking at it i was like but i understand why they did it though i can look at stitches and i see why they call this a triple crochet it's like uh okay i see why y'all did that or um a triple treble crochet and all that they just but they don't have do they have a slip they don't have a slip stitch so the half double crochet is the double crochet yeah i think that's what it is it's crazy anyway when i do it i when i'm working with items that's related in that respect i i understand i understand i'm gonna show you real quick this is so crazy i think i have it do i have it here i don't know i might show you guys i have um uh let me see yes y'all i love this pattern so much i didn't even realize this whole book this one is all uk [Music] i'm not kidding i am not kidding you i'ma tell you real quick i love it though it's yeah so their single crochet is considered a double crochet oh my gosh it is all like yes good night you guys their half double crochet is considered a half treble crochet uh crochet and their double crochet is a triple is a treble crochet this whole book but this is why i uh listen these are the bomb and i'm gonna show you the scarf i'm gonna make out of this this one's gonna be for me eventually i bought the exact same yarn too but i'm going to show you real quick i'll show it to you see that can you that scarf is the bomb anyway i just wanted to share that with you but this entire book is that so i understand them i just don't understand why they use those terms yeah i get it it makes sense we don't want to be switching stuff up we may switching stuff up indonesia we do okay let me do this one single crochet and then double crochet in the same stitch let's see now wait a minute i don't know if i need to end i ended with 202 so maybe i need to and with a single crochet it doesn't say it doesn't say that but i think i'm am going to do that let me see what the actual the free pattern says as well make sure i am on the right page chain one skip first yep and see yep skip next yep do that and next repeat from [Music] across okay i did that all the way across until i get to the end and i'm wondering if i need to just put a crow single crochet in that end and that's what i'm going to do because it doesn't tell me one way or the other so i'm going to put a single crochet in the last stitch because i don't see where i need to oh no i'll single crochet double crochet i don't know it doesn't say that yeah yeah yeah let me see make sure i'm doing this right you guys i will single crochet in the last stitch hmm oh that's interesting so i am how am i this is uh 22. okay you know what did i miss something i could have missed a spot let me go back this is where i frog at you guys because i think i missed the spot i don't even know how i did it yeah okay hey i'm glad you're back really i'm glad we have differences i embrace that have a so solution am i saying that right a mother that spoke broken english she would use the wrong words for things that's all right though susan i think that's awesome i do too honey i embrace every i love different um cultures and i do i've always been that way ever since i remember being in like what grade was i in i was a little kid and i was like i want to um i want to speak spanish i i got a spanish book i got a spanish speaking book i got an italian speak uh book and i was like i'm gonna do it and uh yeah i just love different languages i love different cultures i love different foods that is just what i love okay let me try this again i might have done it wrong i don't know i'm glad i'm just on the first panel y'all mm-hmm skip oh yeah skip that one and go to the next single

crochet in every other yeah that's what you do but when i got to the last stitch i had a stitch open and i'm like why i believe i'm doing it right i skip a stitch and then i put yeah let me try again that's why i took it out and make sure i got this right i counted my stitches i have 22 and so i should still have let me skip one yeah single crochet double crochet and then skip that stitch and do

in the chat i'll put it up so you can see that's the um oh my goodness left is right crochet with sandy is in the building how are you doing it has been a minute since i have seen you my dear that is the pattern that we are working on so either whether you knit or whether you crochet you can participate in this fun uh activity creating a the colors of salvation um afghan and or lapkin there we go single crochet here we are and then double okay you guys well at least i got down to let's see where am i row three row three is what's happening and what happens with this is you do row three until desired length is achieved so whether you're making a lap game or an afghan i need to look up what i didn't see is the actual i know there's a sizing chart i will have that for the next um live i'll have that sizing chart for the next live so yeah but i'm getting ready to let you guys go it has been a pleasure i'm going to leave my this is my work you guys i did is the crochet version of that so yeah so basically it's a series of single single crochet double crochet in um a stitch either it's a single uh crochet stitch and you go to the next uh you skip one of the single crochets to go into the next one and do the cluster of the single and double and you keep doing that until you get to the end and i did it i did it so i will see you guys thank you good job i'll see you guys if you can come at six please do if not it's fine i'll see you next time because maybe next time we'll we'll work on the next panel whether we're done with this panel or not we're going to work on the next one we're going to keep it moving keep it flowing yeah so good job thank you so much so this is the gates of hell we're working on you guys all right god bless every last one of y'all kelly the pattern is beautiful thank you if you get a chance um if you can go to that site there and uh that pattern is free um compliments of terry ann porter the author and creator author of the book and the creator of that pattern so please please please i hope to see you guys at six if not i will see you next time god bless y'all or i'll see you in these youtube streets somewhere right dusty cat what's up i didn't

okay oh dusty cat all right you guys listen it has been i'm going to switch to a larger hook i was trying to use the hook that was suggested yeah so i'm using h my oh you've been lurking and working that's all right the crafty nomad is in the building too vivienne i thought about you know using a k because that's one k is my go-to i might do that i don't know i do like this if i do a k um i'm gonna keep it with the h i'm gonna see what because but i do love the k hooker i don't know i might switch it up i might switch it up only because i like the way a k feels in my hand when i'm working stopped in at the end that's all right crafty nomad i'm going to go have me some soup and get back to my actual job my job yep i'm show up a little bit late to my job but that's all right i love what

are absolutely amazing all right god bless y'all oh you too kristen campbell i love you girl i'll see you later god bless you all right", "LK5-OnzZqpY": "today we're going to focus on making the large flower motif it consists of four colors all of the motifs the large flower motifs are made identically the center the petal color and then the inner background color and the outer edge so let's start because my petal color on this particular sample is going to be orchid i am choosing a soft yellow for the center i made a slip knot as i've shown you before leaving about a five or six inch tail i'm going to chain five and then i'm going to grab enough down on the first chain so that i can slip stitch into it to form a ring here's my ring then i'm going to chain three more because this round is going to be done in double crochets and we need three to reach the height of a double crochet that will count as the first double crochet and then i'm going to put 14 more double crochets into the ring so we have a total of 15 double crochets in the ring so that's number four five six seven eight nine ten at about ten i like to pull it over because that ring gets kind of tight i have five more to go 11 twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen we slip stitch to the top of the chain three at the beginning to end off we've just completed the center for our large flower and now we're going to work and do the petals now you start by inserting your hook under the top two loops of any of the stitches on the flower center and pull up a loop chain one using both the feeder yarn and the yarn tail now hold the yarn tail back for just a second we'll weave it in as we go insert our hook under the top two loops of the next stitch and complete a single crochet now we're going to tighten that loop by pulling on the yarn tail and then i'm returning the yarn tail to work double with the feeder yarn so i'm going to now chain using both strands until it runs out eleven one two three four five now i'm just pull that through that's fine 6 7 8 9 10 11. now we want to make sure that our chains are not too tight because we're going to roll this over and work in the third loop on the back of each of these stitches now actually we're going to start in the fifth stitch so let's count them that's one two three four five five little humps indicates the back loops of the stitches so this is the one this one here is where we're going to insert our hook but we're going to make treble crochet this time and how you do a treble crochet sometimes called a triple crochet is you yarn over twice and then you insert your hook in to the stitch you want to go and in this case it's the back loop of the fifth stitch pull up a loop now you have four loops on your hook now note i'm grabbing up tight here with my fingers so that i don't elongate the loop that we went in because it will tighten up the stitches surrounding it we don't want those stitches stitches to get tighter so then we're going to yarn over pull through two yarn over pull through two and yarn over pull through two that completes a treble crochet now let's do it again in the next stitch two yarn overs the hook insert the hook in the next back loop of the next stitch pull up a loop pull through two yarn over pull through two and yarn over pull through two now we have the chain up the first treble and the second treble the next stitch we're going to do is also in the back loop and it's a double crochet and that's just regular now note i'm still holding it down here because i don't want to pull these loops tight now i'm going to do another double crochet in the next one and since this is a is where the yarn has worked double i'm going under both those strands of that back loop okay we have two trebles two doubles now two half doubles okay so to do a half double you yarn over just like you were doing a double you insert your hook oops in this case that's kind of tight pull up a loop you have three loops on the hook yarn over and pull through all three and in the last back loop we're going to do one single crochet and that's not the back loop the back loop is right here i want to catch both of them one single crochet now that forms the core of that first petal okay it's very important to get your counts right going around your center so that you have the petals evenly distributed around the flower center now if you notice this is where we did our first single crochet we're going to return to that exact stitch and work a second single crochet in there and then we're going to work into the next one single crochet into the next three stitches when we get to the third that's the first half of the next petal when you get back there so we're going to chain 11 at this point 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ten eleven roll it over one two three four five in the fifth we're going to work a treble crochet again in the next one we're going to work a treble crochet again in the next one we're going to work a double crochet in the next one a double crochet a half double crochet and then a second half double crochet in the next stitch and in the final stitch we're going to put a single crochet when we get back to the flower center we're going to put another single crochet in the last time the last stitch that was worked on the flower center so that puts one more single crochet in there and that ties down the petal coming out of that stitch then we work a single crochet in each of the next three one two three and that's the first half of the next petal and then chain 11 with by working a single crochet in the exact same stitch that was last worked on the center and then we work one and then we work another one into the same stitch where we slip stitched and chained the reason we do that is because that closes it off so in reality if you look at this particular the first row of petals you'll notice that you have for each petal you have two single crochets in one stitch at the base of the petal and then there's two single crochets in between and then you have the first one of the next petal so that's how you know that you worked it worked out perfectly now that we've finished our first round of the petal let's look at what we have remember here this is the edge that we chained up and so these are actually the bases of the stitches as we work them back this is the base and this is the top of the stitch and on the next round we're actually going to to go all the way up and around now notice how nice and smooth that edge is it looks like they're just double the both like the top and the bottom of the stitch but that's caused by by making that chain and then working in the back loop it makes a very perfect edge and so it's easy to count for the next part of the petal so what we're going to do here this is a little bit different but we're going to be looking for that first single crochet we're not going to look for the first single crochet that tie it down that were worked in the flower center but we are going to look for the first single crochet that was the first stitch that was sideways up through the petal so if you can see this this is a single crochet half double crochet half double crochet double crochet double crochet treble crochet treble crochet and the four chains at the tip that we we didn't work in the back loop it makes a space at the end and we'll show you what to do with that so in the very first single crochet here just skip over to it because you're right there you don't need to put a slip stitch in to tie this down it's not necessary insert your hook in the base of that single crochet and work two single crochets one two then from the for the next few stitches we're going to work only one stitch in each of these stitches yarn over and work a half double crochet this is kind of tight only because we wove that end in we're going to work a half double crochet in the hat first half double crochet we're going to work a half double crochet in the second half double crochet now we're to the double crochet we're going to do a double crochet in the base of the next double crochet the next stitch is also a double crochet so we're going to do a double crochet in that one too now to the treble crochet we're still going to do a double crochet in each of the trebles because we don't want the petal to get really wide at the end and notice how that yarn tail that we was sticking out just kind of got lost now we're to this space and in this case we're going to work nine double crochets into that space how easy is that that brings us all the way around the tip of the petal to the first treble now you've got to be careful here because once again these this here are the these are the two loops of the treble crochet they sometimes get buried and mixed up with the space on this side we're going to work a double crochet in this treble a double crochet in the second treble a double crochet in each of the double crochets and then a half double in the half double crochets and then lastly we're going to work two single crochets in the single crochet so let's do it a double crochet in the first treble a double crochet in the second treble a double crochet in the first double crochet a double crochet in the next double crochet a half double crochet in the first half double crochet a double crochet in the next double crochet and that brings us to the top of the single crochet you can see that and we're going to put two single crochets in that stitch now you want to skip this one you can pick this one or this one to slip in whatever you feel is the center just slip stitch it in place and that ties the pedal down and by varying it it just gives different angles to the pedal itself so let's do another petal once it's slip stitched in jump over here to the next petal and find that's the base of that single crochet because remember this side is the chain so the bottom of the single crochet is in that chain in the back loop of that chain okay one more time two single crochets in the one single crochet that exists on the petal a half double in each of the half doubles it's kind of fun it helps you learn what your stitches look like too we're doing double crochets in the double crochets and in the treble crochets and nine of them in the petal the tip of the petal in the space at the tip of the petal am i there let's see one two three four five six seven and one double crochet in the top of the treble top of the second treble the top of the double crochet the top of the double crochet half double in the half double crochet and two single crochets in that single crochet then skip to the center slip stitch go to the next petal and do the same thing the petals are all the same so work around and i'll meet you over here we have we have slip stitch to tie down our last petal now i want you to chain one and turn your work to the back because i want you to see what we're going to be doing on the completed one so you get the idea we have to right now there are five petals but when we finish the motif there are only four sides now there are 20 stitches around the very first row of the petal color that that touch the flower center and so what we're going to be dividing this into fourths so just imagine a little box and how you what you would do then is once you've done your chain one that gives you enough space to do your slip stitch you're going to insert your hook around the post of the single crochet that is directly below where your yarn is coming out and all we're going to do is do a slip stitch there that just brings us toward the back now we are going to chain five one two three four five and then we are going to make the first side of a little box so if we have 20 stitches and we want to divide it by four we would want to go in the fifth stitch from where we are every fifth stitch would be dividing it into four one two three four five so we're going to insert our hook around that post now if you get it a little bit wrong it's okay because it's kind of hard to see but we just made our first side of the little box chain five one two three four five after you do a few of these you just kind of lay it out and say oh let's see where's the next one it should be right here and that's fine whichever way you can count out the stitches or you can just lay it out and make it into a little square it's not that important that it is it's not one of those things that you have to be super accurate about so i just chained five again i lay out my little square and that's about it right there one two three four five and to complete the square we just have to tie it down to here so now we have four loops of five chains each that represent the sides of the little square now as i said it doesn't have to be perfect because it just needs to look sort of like a square the next row will correct everything that you ever dreamed of wrong with this one so we're going to break our yarn off and i'll meet you back when we've woven in our end okay we're about to start making the background the last four rows i'm going to flip this one over to show you because this is how it look from the back we'll be doing this row then followed by this one and this one and then the final row okay so let's start you want to hold your flower so the right side is facing you the petals will curl toward the right side so you'll be able to see that very easily now fold the petals forward toward you because what we're going to do is we're going to be working in these loops on the back so insert your hook into one of the loops pull up a loop and chain three using your double strand so that you weave your end in as you go pull that through and we'll finish that later now we're going to work two more double crochets chain two to form a corner and three more double crochets into the very same loop now we're going to chain one going into the next loop we're going to work three double crochets chain two and three double crochets chain one to span our little um space here chain or three double crochets in the next loop chain two to form the corner space and three double crochets in the very next loop chain one to span the distance going to the next loop three double crochets chain two to form the corner space and three double crochets chain one once again to span the distance between the two loops slip stitch into the top of the chain three at the beginning of the round to finish off that round now let's let's take a look at what we have from the back we have four corner spaces and we have four side spaces and we have the double crochets that make that form the sides all right so now we're ready we're going to weave this end in and then we're ready to start the next round okay so now we're going on to the next round so this is how you work it chain three which counts as the first double crochet and then work one double crochet in each double crochet each stitch of the row below until you get to the corner space in the corner space you're going to work two double crochets chain two to form the corner space and then two more double crochets and just like we've been talking before when we did the background motif you want to make sure that on this side you work one double crochet in each of the stitches so let's work it together so i yarned over the very first one sometimes gets lost in that space so make sure you get it so that would be one then the next one and the next now you've come to the sides the chain one side space we're just going to work one double crochet into that space and then we're going to work one in one double crochet in each of the next three double crochets on along the side and that takes us to the corner space again so we're going to work two double crochets in the corner space chain two to form the corner space on this round and then two more double crochets in the next corners in the same corner space and then just as we did before we're going to work one double crochet in each of these stitches along the side including one in that side space now let's look at what we have on the side we have two in the corner space and then seven along the side and two in the corner space that's a total of eleven which means that we're starting to pick up just like we did when we did the background motif so we have the same number of stitches on this round so we have 11 on this side and then when we go over here we do two more double crochets in the space seven along the side including that space there and then two more here which puts us at eleven so let's continue three and finally one in the final space now just like we did on the background motif we want to make sure that we have 11 on this closing side we have one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven okay time to close it up slip stitch to join now oh now you can start seeing the background forming and it's funny how the petals lay out on this on the next round we're on this round now just like on the background motif there'll be 15 double crochets on each side so we're going to chain 3 to start now on the next two rounds you have to be kind of careful because we are going to start doing something different on this round we are going to start attaching the pedal in with little tailor tacks and i'll show you how to do that but the reason we want to do that is if if you didn't tack down the flowers like we did in this one see these are tacked down on the last two rounds of the background if you didn't do that when you wash it it will curl up like this and you'll never see the flower so you want to make sure that you tack it down and it's a real simple process and you don't have to be real perfect at it but i'll give you a couple of tips along the way first off you want to lay the petal out and see if you're ready to do one now do you see the top of this stitch here it's right in line with this edge this would be a good great place to do a tailor tack how i'm going to do that is i'm going to take the loop off the hook i'm going to lay this out neatly and i'm going to say yeah it's about there now what i'm going to do how you insert your hook into the pedal to tack it down is very important if you can see that we have two edge loops along the outer on the top edge of the pedal what you want to do is you want to leave undisturbed the inner one and you want to go in to the this loop and then there's a cross loop on the back that you want to pick up because by keeping this inner edge loop the one that's closest to you the front loop of the top edge undisturbed what that does it gives you a visual line so that so that when you finish it here's a taylor tech it's only picking up it only appears to be picking up the back loop and this keeps a visual line so that your pedal shape is not disturbed so that's why it's important how you pick this up now the reason i pick up the back loop on the back of the uh petal is because if i just picked up the front loop that will tend to pull up this way and stretch out and this way it it you grab a little bit more and it stays secure it's more secure so i'm going to just pull that stitch through that loop now i'm going to fold over my petal forward again and i'm going to work just like we had done i'm going to work one double crochet in each stitch along the way each one double crochet in each stitch of the row below until i get to the corner now the only thing you have to watch out for is every so often you want to push up your pedal and lay it out to make sure that you don't you have don't have another opportunity to do a tack so now that we're at the corner space we're to work two double crochets in the corner space chain two to form the corner space now because i'm working on this i probably won't need to do anything until i get to about this stitch here which is about there so i did my chain two for my corner i'm going to do another chain uh two double excuse me i'm going to do another two double crochets in the same corner space and this is about where that petal is going to be yep that's a good place to put it at a tack so i'm going to take the loop off my hook i'm going to not go under the front loop i'm going to go under the back loop and the one that's just behind it on the back can you see that i'm going to pull that loop up and then i'm going to proceed on making sure that i put my next double crochet in the very first double crochet of that side so now i'm going to go about one two three four maybe four or five more stitches and then perhaps i'll be ready to tack down the next petal now that's the fourth one that i just did let's see if we're ready um i think we can go one more okay take the loop off the hook go to the adjacent stitch on the petal insert it under the back loop and the one that's way on the back pick up the loop and pull it up and see how nice that lays out so now i can proceed to the other side which is somewhere right around here so push the pedal forward and continue along this way now we are going to double check our work in just a minute now remember what i was saying you had 11 double crochets on the on each side on the row below you add two two double crochets in each of the corners on that side here's the first one here's the second one so 11 plus two plus two is fifteen oh and that looks like a perfect time to do another tack now i'm going to chain my two for the corner but we're going to turn our work over because that's our first side we're going to check our work we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 a perfect side between the corners turn it back to the right side and continue on we're going to do two more double crochets in the corner and you're going to proceed going around the entire flower or the entire square this way so we probably have one or two more stitches let's check it here and once again you want to lay it out and see yes that's a great place to do a tailor tack get that back loop and the front loop and the back loop and the the one that's below it on the back and you see the front loop is free so you never disturb the full line of vision around that pedal okay now we fold it forward and we continue on working one double crochet in each stitch along the side continue to tailor tech as we've shown you and i'll meet you when we get over here okay we're getting down to the end so let's see yep right here i did my last taylor tack oops i split the yarn there we'll get that again there we go and you want to slip stitch to the top of the chain up at the beginning of the round pull through all right let's turn it over and let's just double check our last side because that's one of the more critical ones one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen we're good to go we can cut our yarn i'll weave the ended and i'll return in just a minute we're about to do the final row on the outside edge of the background for the large flower motif and this happens to be done all in half double crochets so what i like to do is i like to find the middle i like to hide my chain up behind the petal so i'm just going to find a stitch behind a petal and with both the feeder yarn and the yarn tail i'm going to chain two because that's the height as you recall that we need for a half double crochet so now i'm going to pull that end loop through and we'll weave that in later let that go off to the back and we're going to proceed to work one half double crochet in each of the double crochets in the row below now i'm still watching because see this petal still extends beyond the edge of the motif i will tack it down if i can so we'll keep going i'm not to an edge yet i'm getting close ah there we go i'm going to pull up the loop once again slip the hook under the back loop of the stitch and the and the horizontal loop that is right behind it pick up the loop and pull through and then proceed to do your half double crochets continuing on until you get to the corner space at the corner space we're going to do just as we did before a two half double crochets chain two and two more half double crochets all in that corner space now i'm going to continue to work one half double crochet on each of the stitches on this side now when you have it tack down you've got to be careful you don't pick up an extra stitch so we're going to get this one here and let's just see hmm that does look like it'd be a good place to tack it down so i'm going to pick up that back loop or insert my hook under the back loop and the loop that the horizontal loop behind it and just tack it in place now you can if you're not comfortable tacking it as you go you can tack the flowers down after the fact but it'll take a lot more hand work and by doing it the way i'm showing you you get you get practiced but by doing it this way you're done you don't have to worry about any more um finishing after the fact i'm going to continue to work half double crochets all the way to the corner and we're going to check our work and i have to confess because it's very important that you have the right number of stitches on each side on this final row that i usually check my stitches after each side and as always we want to make sure oops i should tailor tack that so i'm taking those out just to do it so there's a little bit of flexibility on this and we have two more there's a little bit of flexibility but i don't want to ever miss out and put too many stitches in or not enough stitches 17 18 19. that's it so we can return to the back here slip stitch into the top of the chain up which is two chains and cut our yarn off so now we've just finished the large flower motif and see how neatly those are tucked down and so those won't those won't get interrupted when the afghan is washed later on weave our ends in before we move on okay thank you for

campbell you're doing some cool things over there let's see oh see sorry i'm listening while watching tv with my mom and knitting a specialty scarf for someone that's all right just frog it is a pleasure to see you how are you doing kelly what y'all hop in your car today girl and even tell you i went i wasn't even gonna share that with nobody i wasn't gonna do it but you know i did and let me tell you why okay let me tell you why um i am doing a scarf um that jonah han jonah's hands he pretty much demonstrated this beautiful cross stitch scarf with this specific type of yarn that i do have the problem was i did not have enough of that yarn so i had to go and get some so and the color that i had they didn't have anymore so i had to get two of a color i didn't even want but that's all right i'ma bless somebody with it it's gonna be nice it's pretty i was working on it for a while but i also i was also working on a poncho for my granddaughter so i don't know the exact time frame oh okay all right yeah everybody greeting everybody in here that is so nice i know you knew it girl but that's what happened that's exactly what happened and you will see that yarn in the scarf video that i'm gonna do i had to do it i had to do it okay um i'm sorry what i'm reading the pattern off screen is to paint for a pattern so i don't want to show it on camera yeah don't show the pattern do not show the pattern absolutely not yeah okay i'm looking at the decrease this is what it says skip one stitch single crochet in next two stitches yeah that's how they decrease yeah and then again skip so skip one stitch single crochet in next two stitches and repeat that six times round okay that's how they're having you decrease right and i've never seen that and then i'm sitting here this is how it has you start cast on single sing six single crochet with circular cast on okay that's a magic ring right okay this is i'm i'm this is like a weird pattern it sounded strange but i think so after you go around and then you you decrease it like this right yeah and so you decrease oh yeah it sounds like skips once did yeah skip one and uh single crochet into that sounds like yeah girl i got attacked by yarn today i certainly did let me see doing great i'm glad you're doing great let's see poor kelly she is minding her own business and you get attacked by yarn for sure and that's what happened lemon cake hi girl there you go making me hungry let me get lemon cake off the screen because i'm thinking i want some lemon cake how are you doing lemon cake you know we love you honey you know it's all in fun and love that will leave holes if you skip those stitches i'm a pretty tight crocheter so it probably won't make a difference and yeah i'm pulling really hard once i you know finish the single crochet yeah cast-on sounds like nit yeah it does i'll be frogging the cape i made my mom for christmas she decided she wants the collar different well all right okay mama guess what mama wants hey there actually tonight is drop biscuit and roasted potatoes that sounds great so does it say to decrease or is it just a single crochet in next two it says decrease i think right yeah it says decrease [Music] lemon cake made me happy yes [Music] then i'll have 12 stitches at the end of row 10. so that's it that'd be a decrease yeah that's right it just sounded weird a little bit but it's all good yep so i am working on these puff stitches um um for the um colors of salvation afghan i'm making and i'm on the color white and so this is what it looks like yay let's see what are

heartbreaking yeah i'm so sorry about that yes in nashville oh cameron can you show your cacti let's see this is the start of it i haven't done one one full one yet you have a picture and that picture on your the pattern you can show the picture this as long as you don't show the pattern you're good so it's going to end up like that in that cute those are adorable that is so cool let's see yes in nashville there was a body found in the rv that the bomb was in what oh my god oh geez so sad to do that on christmas day too some people are just i don't know from my perspective people around my family are getting weirder what you said around your family people around my family are getting weirder for real we gonna have to pray for everybody you guys this is too cute that is too cute yeah it is cute isn't it cute oh my goodness oh my goodness let's see too that is just crazy it this everything's been just so insane i literally just watched something that had the um like it was called um what was called how it ends or something like that i don't even know why we were watching that it was crazy but um that cactus is adorable that's what ts says let's see oh huh can you share the sock pattern uh tracy oak wants to know uh if my mama jayway can share it and the rv had a recording telling everyone that could hear it to get out because it was going to blow up in 15 minutes oh they meant to do that they warn people and they meant to do it they're like hey get out of here and we taking out that's so sad good night yes i read that just so sad oh my goodness oh that you know what people do that that they're crazy yeah people they'll announce it and say get out because i'm gonna i'm fitting to blow this up yeah you know they're crazy when they do that kind of crap yeah that's insane let's see heather that's exactly not weird a lot of people actually do that and it's good practice if you don't want your children to become materialistic what you talking about oh see how my my chat jumps i'm sorry i missed that my hubby took some food and gifts to a family that doesn't have a lot and the grandpa was saying they would re-gift the stuff instead of accepting it letting the kids have one or two things okay oh i see and i see what denise is saying some people yeah are you kidding me heather yeah this was after i got reamed out by my neighbor about the same stuff coming to his house by someone he didn't know so we had it delivered to ours what i don't know if people are getting scared if they're fearful to accept things i don't know i don't know heather that's let's see these kids just moved to a new house and nothing is in their refrigerator really wow wow wow wow this is a lot to pray for you guys y'all see that we got a lot to pray for wow i mean this is a time of giving and this is when giving you know is very um accepted you know what i mean yeah so yeah that's that's kind of um strange a little bit so i understand why you say it's getting weirder fear and pride let me put that on here kelly this is the circular cast on they were talking about oh oh okay yeah oh that's what they call it a circular castle and why they just say make a magic ring i know i'm sitting there at first i'm i'm on the opposite side of the diagram and i'm like what god's name already talked about circular cast on so i open up the whole pattern and it's got a little freaking diagram and i'm like that's magic circle yeah they could have just said that fear and pride play a part of it and not wanting to look needy true that is true but yeah pride is a big thing have mercy lord have mercy i feel so bad for all this hurt yeah i'm exhausted with the level of hate and devastation when will it end hey mama j way i agree i know you heard about the um gentleman that got um that lost his life to um another uh officer here in ohio here in columbus actually up the street around the court not up street but on the east side of town and um it was just heartbreaking um it's like they they shoot and then they ask questions later and people assume just because you see me standing in the garage i'm doing something ain't got no business no no no no it is so sad yeah pride is a big thing yeah you're right you're right and fear fear is is a big thing too fear and pride his pride came before the fall i didn't take any of it to him my daughter is going to wrap some of the stuff and give it from her oh okay that's cool i still cannot make magic ring i try and try brenda d max says that's all right as long as you can get a little circle going if you got to just do a chain you got you know it took me a while before i could actually do it yeah yeah yeah it's yeah wow it's just crazy you guys so yeah so um somebody said um something about the guy um that happened heather then pray for them and let the lord touch their heart yeah for sure yes i did i'm so over oh my gosh mama j way i felt so sad i'm so tired i am tired of it it's like and i i'm concerned because you know what if my husband goes to the store and they just look at him and they just want to you know instead of i don't even let's not talk about it okay my parents are retired ministers and we've seen so many times where pride kept needy families from accepting help wow that's crazy it makes my heart hurt all of it but i can't make it better unless i lift my head up and try yeah we trying to make it better you know that's why i you know i love coming on these wonderful youtube streets and meeting so many wonderful people like yourselves and you know i've been praying for this man most of my life his kids have started going to church with us sometimes oh that's a blessing yeah that's the enemy that's all that's all we just continue to pray for him but yeah so that's what it's been about you guys it's been crazy and so you know and it's like i feel like i can't do nothing but what can i do you know and if the powers of that be don't realize that this is a problem there's something really wrong with them this i mean right it's like walking around with a target on your back every day yes not even safe in your own home either that's true that's true but we gonna be all right we gonna be all right we're gonna keep praying we're gonna keep lifting up the name of the lord jesus and we just we're just gonna keep moving honey we gonna keep moving forward in love we we're going to be the kindness that we want the world to see right we we are going to be the kindness we're going to be the compassion right and so if people don't want to accept them just be like god bless you we're going to keep praying yes we gonna keep praying okay um big brother brian all right we gonna keep praying because sometimes it can get it can get a little burdensome you know so you said i like i like the magic ring better than the chain four way yeah yeah i do too but you know if you can't do it sometimes you gotta go to chain four away but i do the magic ring it yeah so that's actually how i do my granny squares down and i do my blankets yeah i don't even once i did that way to you know do the blankets i never went i've never gone back to doing the chain four yeah

the other day and they had the premiere yarn it's the first time i've been since they've had the yarn yeah um um and it's pretty soft oh yeah is it going to check out is it premier cotton or what um i believe it's 100 acrylic but honestly i didn't read it yeah okay let's see let's see what she say hold up you can also get a smile a mask with a smiley face on it too yeah but that's it they'll be creepy though i ain't gonna kid you don't be creepy jessica i'll be like lord you need one that like opens up to a smile [Music] i have a mess with a goofy smile on it i've had lots of compliments okay maybe it'll make somebody laugh because i'll be cracking up i sure do i'll be rolling when i see i'll be like lord yeah that fell out too joker-like yes joker-like it's like huh i have all these materials to make masks like fabric masks um from the start of the pandemic yeah and then it just like blew up so fast that like i couldn't keep up yeah for a while and now like everyone has like well i know a couple people who have like 15 masks or something like that yeah i guess it's just a fashion statement people want a variety that's what i'm saying see anybody you can make my my cousin was making them too she was making them um on her sewing machine she got this little sewing machine and she started making masks honey she couldn't get him out fast enough she asked for people to be patient and all this stuff it was it was like whoa go cousin yeah but she saw a problem and she solved it and so but she's not the only one there are so many people that's what i'm saying if you see something that you'd like to do and you'd be like ah i don't know if there's any money in that honey there's money in it you make it because it's coming from you it's it's different it's different so yeah you do it you do it find out what you're passionate about and put it out there find a problem and solve it and put it out there that's the answer to a question i need a mask do you know how to make a mess yes uh will you make one yes you just solve the problem put it out there on facebook i make masks guess what somebody coming to your house to get a mask my mask has a pitbull with a huge smile most people laugh at it yes i would be that one laughing starlo that would be me girl i'll be over there crack it up yes there are louis vuitton ass now see what i'm talking about yeah that's awesome it's just know they're everywhere you know you go to the grocery store you see mass you go to target you see plenty of math so yes there there are companies paying money just to get information and opinions from folks i've been trying to share with folks it's called current really so you just go there see that's so they're paying money just to get information and opinion from people they want to know your opinion see that solves a problem and they will pay you for it here's my mask that makes sense um yeah i mean i think i mean they're always doing focus groups and stuff like that like at corporations and smaller businesses too just to get the opinions of the buyer yeah now now cameron did you make that mask no um my sister gave it to me oh see yeah there's some

um we introduced the white panel this past wednesday so the um wednesday coming up it's going to be another panel and grandma anna 1962 is ahead of the game money she on a mission hey auntie dana triple c there she is y'all triple c and joe show that's my auntie dana whose favorite color is blue there she is y'all how you doing how was y'all you know i'm tired i was on y'all's live last night had me cracking up well i was in the chat i was working i was i was able to get some stuff done but you know i still got a couple of scarves i'm working on so when i leave here from doing this i'll be going down in my living room watching a movie or something with my husband and making a scarf and i gotta release those videos yeah there she is yes hello hello oh the go panel is going to be hard for you okay why is that what's next i didn't see what was next let me see i'ma see what's next is that next are you crocheting are you knitting that oh heaven the treble stitch why did you practice the travel stitch yeah uh grandma anna 1962 okay i see what you saying let's see row four is that what you talking about you gonna repeat row four so you're gonna have to kind of get used to row five repeat uh rows two so you at row five if you repeat row four and then for pattern your repeat is going to be rows two and through five is going to be the repeat so you do wait a minute um don't mind me guys yes row four i see that um all right that's something that just i never did that stitch and i had a hard time reading okay okay yeah so i'm looking at it now and it seems all right so your chain three is going to count as the first dc we cool with that we understand that then you're going to dc in the next two stitches so then the two stitches after that you're going to those two stitches after the the um chain three you're going to do dc's we understand that right so you're going to skip the next two stitches and you're going to in the next two so this treble stitch is already given to you the instruction on how to do it there so my suggestion is before you start practice the treble stitch just practice it and um find a youtube video on the treble stitch in us terms not in nobody else's terms because that'll get you caught up you'll be like what that's a uk term no in u.s terms honey okay so try that practice that i think if you practice it a little bit you'll be fine i don't think you'll have any problems with it hello i can oh you can travel okay so you know what that is and then it says in the next two stitches okay treble in the next two stitches okay then it says working behind two trebles just made then you're going to travel in the next to in two skipped stitches let's see skip next two stitches treble in the next two then work in the front okay so you're going to be alternating it's going to work out we're going to be our it's the behind stuff okay i got you it's going to work out we'll we'll do it together if you if you want to um on wednesday or um you might have it all together by the end i don't know patty wheat has entered the building patty how you doing honey like an x yeah yeah it's what it's going to be like an x that's what i see in my mind yeah so it's gonna be all right you welcome sweetheart listen we in this together we go look if we don't get it we gon we gonna get it eventually we gonna get this thing together one happy family honey we gonna have this stitch it ain't gonna it ain't gonna beat us we gonna beat it our project is not gonna be on punishment no ma'am it'll be fine we'll be all right yeah i'm glad you said something so we know we gotta look if it's a hurdle we can work on it before we get to the uh wednesday huh so i may i may do that mess around with it but it seems it seems like we can do it we got

if you feel uh like it feel uh free to uh thumbs up the live it would be a blessing i promise if you just take one row and one stitch at a time that's the best way to learn and i just did exactly that yeah exactly what they say in the pattern and it's a lot easier than you think that's right you take one is just one step at a time take your time with it honey and you'll get it it just takes a

the presses distinctive crochet is here honey that is my beautiful beautiful beautiful crochet cousin priscilla honey how you doing letting this play in the background i'm helping this with schoolwork oh god bless you love thank you so much for coming i appreciate you being here yeah you better come on in here babies crafty plants manifesting dreams bigger than me yes i love to see it honey come on with it yeah yes yes yes so your plan is just to follow a pattern i'm spoiled by videos okay yes hook hook sandy honey yes i got to keep my skills up honey i read patterns and the only time i'm coming to the video is if i do not understand what i'm seeing in the pattern that's the only time i'm coming if i have questions i'm coming to the video i watch the video uh as a guide but i don't let that be my complete guide so if it tells me row one i'm supposed to do this this and this and this i'm going to look at the pattern and do it that way now if there is an issue or if i'm struggling i am definitely coming online and checking out the tutorials so yes some tutorials i do watch because there is not a pattern for it but for some reason because i'm old school child how do you think i learned how to crochet i learned how to crochet by somebody telling me what to do me actually writing down what she said to do and then doing what she said to do so i did see it she said it i saw it and i then repeated it so that's how i learned i'm like you know how some people are visual learners and some people are um uh what do they call them analytical where you have to read it and you can get it just from reading that's not me always i but for the most part i can get it from reading it but a lot of times i do have to go and see it so i can see what they're saying as it's written in the pattern yes absolutely now there's something i am working on that there is no written pattern that i've seen for it and it's going to be completely from youtube and i will be sharing that when i get that project completed it's something i've never done before y'all i've never made baby booties you guys so i'm gonna be making baby booties i'm excited to make them i've never ever made them so this is gonna be fun for me um and i'm glad it's a small enough project to where i'm going to take my time with it make sure i do it right y'all because i'm messing up there's some patterns that i read that i love and do over and over again that i don't need a pattern you can just say it and i'll do it that's like um sandrine said the houndstooth she just said it and i could see it in my mind and i just did it right so that's how when she was talking about the houndstooth that's how i learned that how soon there was no video to show me she said what it was she said what they were and she told me what the stitches was and told me how and so just from that i didn't write it down i heard her and i was like okay i can do that and so that's how i and i love the houndstooth now i'm going to be making a few uh this claws with the houndstooth mm-hmm so you're playing yeah mm-hmm that's it that's it that's all i looked in these youtube streets for tutorial on the phoenix afghan i dropped a

least the ink did for a minute good gracious uh let me go back up i missed some comments uh okay i know how to recursive writing it um depends on who writes it in cursive if i can read it i also know how to write okay i know how to read cursive okay and it depends on who's writing it whether you can read it or not i also know how to write cursive okay that's cool cameron that's good to know my granddaughter is in second grade and they're um starting to learn curses so maybe they're bringing it back that's great michelle i hope so oh i remember we had a subject on how to write me and that teacher was so strict so i can't imagine not writing in cursive i know right let's see they was allowing students to abbreviate and use lol in english essays 10 years ago what do you know how many red marks my english teacher would have made on those essays tell me about it you could you had to write me they don't do cursive no more child that's ridiculous my dad was proud of my handwriting my

granny squares hello my yarny friends oh my goodness it is a pleasure to see all y'all here danine horrible from saskatchewan canada how you doing i have told i write like a doctor oh lord that mess me we can't read your hand writing cameron because most doctors they write and i can't understand what they i can't read their writing um sometimes i can but for the most part i can't you know who are who is amazing that can read their writing the pharmacist the pharmacist can read their writing yeah i love writing cursive hubby's writing is beautiful yes linda that's what i'm talking about you can write you love reading it my dad he was great at it he was great at it let's see no see that's so right about the pharmacist those are the only ones they can because they got to give those prescriptions when you get a prescription they put it on there in their scribble scratch and then you take the scribble scratch to the pharmacist and they like oh of course it'll be ready in 15 20 minutes have a seat like okay i can't even read my own writing half the time yeah that's kind of yeah when you can't read your own handwriting i would recommend that you slow down writing so you can't

i worked in the health service secretary to consultants i could read their writing with lots of practice yeah i know it would take a lot of practice because their scribble scratch is like woo lord what they talking mm-hmm they must take a course in reading doctor's writings yeah yeah because you don't want to give somebody the wrong prescription based on some scribble scratch that is for sure i've been through a horrible week so i had to encourage myself in the word yeah just leave social media sit and read the word yes god's daily devotional proverbs and be encouraged yes absolutely om

great day hope to see you soon you", "i6pY2A8j9GY": "hello today I want to show you the large oval Afghan loom that Cindy would makes now this one that I have is the half inch gauge it has whatever 116 pegs on it and you can use it just as a you can keep going in the round on it and make you can make body pillows and stuff like that out of it or you can do it and as a flat panel which will make flat panels roughly fifty inches wide so that's a pretty good sized flat panel now they do the oval panel looms and some other sizes too and the nice thing about the oval panel is is I will compare it to the circular Afghan looms here is the small circle Afghan loom and here's the large circle Afghan loom solve all three of these which one is going to be easier to travel with so that's a big plus to these oval looms is they're easy to travel with if you're using sometimes when you're using long limbs if you're doing something that's really really really chunky it doesn't really want to fit down in between so you don't have that issue with this it will all fit down in there just fine another thing that I really like about Cindi woods looms is that the gauge is accurate all the way around there are enough what any names there are some looms on the market that the edges the end piece is going around these corners it's not the gauges and accurate so when you are done and you take it off the loom you're gonna notice these stripes in it which is less than satisfactory you don't really want that when you're making a big blanket so that's another really nice thing about and it's sturdy so with this you can do a a good size blanket in this little thing well it's not that little it's a pretty big one but you can do just a nice size blanket and it fits right on your lap and it's easy to it's easier to travel within some of these bigger looms I typically don't travel with my large looms I always have so many projects going always have something smaller they could throw my bag and travel with but while I have the circle Afghan looms here I'll go ahead and talk about them as well this is the small Afghan Lima has 90 pegs on this is the half inch gauge and this one is the large Afghan loom it has a hundred Pagal it's the five-eighths inch gauge so this one was half inch gauge has 116 pegs on it so it only has 16 more pegs than this but it's a smaller gauge - that was yeah cousin I'm head under okay alrighty that's really all I have to say about those of course any of these looms you can get in a variety of gauges you can get the pegs and a variety of colours as well they do have pink pegs now which is awesome but that's all I have for this one I hope this was informative and helped you if you had any questions about these looms any questions or comments please

reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable will of god yes so that rings on the inside

one this represents heaven and it is um let me see i want to make sure i'm telling you yeah it represents heaven so check it out it took me a minute but i got this together honey and those are crosses and stuff in there i just love it right and then the blue one represents um the water baptism now i'm not done with this one but i always have two petals because i crochet slow so i'm always like starting one getting ready to finish another eventually this represents um this represents uh the water baptism the blue so yeah so when i get this done it is going to be awesome and i have i didn't

um i usually teach at uh recreation centers um charitable events i would do that um and so that's that's what i'm i do oh marcel you're so sweet and who knows i may be pulling out my guitar sometimes in my in my exclusives for sure yes i play the guitar let me tell you what happened with that let me tell y'all about that it's crazy haha you're so awesome oh yeah um let me tell you about it um so there are wonderful wonderful uh awesome musician friends and family and they're basically family they're my brothers from another mother and they're all wonderful gentlemen who are worshipers first and worshipers of the lord and and they are they're wonderful and um so the funny thing is i borrowed one of the guys um guitars somebody called it a get fiddle the get fiddle and um i borrowed it and because i had to go to jury duty y'all i had to go to jury duty and the thing is man i went in that jury duty and it was like they had puzzles and i'd be sitting there so that's how i ended up with the guitar and i started taking the guitar to the jury duty so here's the crazy thing if y'all know anything about me i'm really not an introvert just in case you didn't know what you see here right here this is me all day every day all day every day i'm listening just me sometimes i may be a little bit uh quieter but it don't stop me from being me you understand what i mean some days we have quieter days sometimes i'm not always like yay you know but you know anyway i mean so i take that guitar to the um i took my guitar to jury duty well my friend's guitar and i stand up in the middle of those wonderful people it was about i don't know it was a bunch of people in there we were all sitting down in there it was a lot of them hey be ready today how you doing that's my big brother brian y'all straighten up act right my big brother brian the sergeant of arms is in the building yeah yeah oh you heard him calling get fiddles too yeah so um i went there and i stood in the middle of jewelry duty i was like hey you guys anybody know how to play this i need to learn some chords can somebody show me how to play this honey three women stood up and said i know how to play and they came over to me i was so excited i said can y'all show me there was like yeah of course we go over in the corner somewhere because we want to disturb everybody found out that these three women they were um worship leaders at their prospective churches i was like get out ain't that something and they told me three chords they said you learn these three chords and you'll be good to go and the other lady said you know what i'm going to be bringing you some songs tomorrow and so i'm going to bring some and you just make a copy of them and you can take them she's like i play at my church i was like what so she brought him and honey it was a stack of i mean like this i was like oh lord i'm gonna be knowing a lot of songs on this guitar so um i learned the g chord the c chord and the d chord and i learned c9 that's a whole nother uh variation of c um and a a minor that was another chord i i learned yeah three chords is all you really need that's right hey if you got a capo you can take that thing and you move it down up and down the fret and you'll be in a different uh key every time so um yeah my god my pop always called guitars get fiddles i love to play the guitar but i haven't played in too long my son plays every day yes stitching ain't easy i don't play every day so i might be a little bit rusty but you know what once you learn to play you you'll get it you'll get it power chords were my best friend really power course yes i mean i am not a power kind of girl so i don't know all the i've seen them but i was like i don't know i don't have that muscle memory yet so there's you know there's a few things there's a few chords i like to play and um just play together and just be singing whatever's in my heart you know so it's like that yeah so yeah that that's what i did y'all that's how i learned how to play the guitar i had jewelry duty with three other people and so the reason why i wanted to play is because i know that i couldn't you know when you go out and you minister you can't always take all the musicians that you love so dearly with you um so i said well lord could you teach me how to play an instrument that i could put in my pocket and the only thing i could think of was a guitar so i ended up buying one so now i i'm on my second guitar my second one is purple it's the color of marcel's harley's name the m it's the color yo m honey and her name luna yeah that's the brand so i just left that as her name it's a luna but i had what did i have i had a mitchell i had a mitchell guitar and i um traded it in and upgraded to a luna and she is pretty and it fits my hands it's smaller it fits my hand the frets or better because guitar guitars or get fiddles you know are great for people who have hands that could really fit it but i'll be stretching i mean you'd be stretching your fingers lord and when i found something that could fit my hands i was like lord was luna made for me i'll take luna yeah so i have luna and she's downstairs yeah it's purple maybe a little bit darker than marcel hurley's name but definitely purple y'all know purple's my favorite color so when i saw that guitar i was like i gotta have her hers pray yeah hers is hurt so yeah i gotta get her so yeah all right so i did um the dc in i'm supposed to do one how many did i do i think i did one i did between first two so i did and then i'm supposed to do five in the space between the dc of the next group okay so i'm gonna do five here one two lord please let this work three four oh four five that's what's up marky mark you said your dad taught you how awesome is that bro you love that my guitar has a name oh yes for sure mine is named my lady she is black and red it is a daisy rock yeah guitar yeah daisy rockster for smaller hands absolutely yeah i've been checking out daisy rock she cute yeah honey then a normal and the frets are closer together yes helpful isn't it don't you like that it works better it feels like it works better with smaller hands yeah that was supposed to say the neck is smaller yeah than than normal yeah the neck is smaller for sure marky mark you a rock star that's awesome your dad taught you for sure so i did all right i did five there and then it says to um in between i did that and then it says to dc in between the second and third of the next five group see here's the problem i don't have a next five in this i don't i don't have an x5 in here and that's the problem you guys which makes me think um it should be here somewhere i'm thinking i'm missing a five so i'm thinking i need to just um pull it out all together i got five more minutes you guys before we get out of here and move on to the next i'm just going to pull it all out and i'm going to start it all over because i want to make sure that i have what i need because i feel like i'm missing what i need on the end and i'm thinking i needed five over here and i didn't have that but and and that's that's probably my problem but we're gonna see we're gonna see huh so i did five and then it says to put five so then it says okay i did five here so i'm restarting the second row i took it all the way out you guys and then it says to dc in space between first and second dc of the next five groups so here it is so i'm gonna go between two second and third i need to dc between second and third all right one two here's three i'm going to dc there yeah and then it says to um then it says to a next dc group and then go between the next dc uh the next let's see between third and fourth so let's see okay i'm here and that was three and so here's four so let me let me bring that in one two three and four in between there so i'm going to do that you see here and then i'm going to um repeat from the starting row again so from the start i'm going to 5 dc wait a minute it says between d7 next dc in space between 2nd and third dc of next five and and in next space between the dc group now i'm going to then it says to dc 5dc in next in space between dc of next 2 group so i don't have the 2 group here i just have the cluster of 5 so this is where i'm special and i get a little confused but i'm thinking it wants me to do let's see i'm still struggling with this one you guys i might have to um really see what i'm doing who is in here that has worked on the green one because i'm thinking i'm doing it right but then it doesn't i don't know 5 dc in the space and it says to in the group and in next so what i did was i went between dc second second and third dc of the five group which i did and in space between the third and fourth which i did so maybe if i don't know if i have to do it again that's the thing i'm trying i feel like sometimes if i think too long i think wrong hi privy how you doing honey irene we get ready to

building and taking a little chat seat so it is wonderful to see you all so with the colors of salvation the next color that's represented is blue and so that's what we will be working on next and blue is the color of the waters of baptism as a symbol of your commitment to the lord god you are asked to follow jesus in baptism baptism does not save a person any more than putting a ring makes you putting on a ring makes you married you must follow through in the action of commitment and he said unto them in mark chapter 16 verses 15 and 16 go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believes and is baptized shall be saved this is the first command given to a believer even jesus was baptized in luke chapter 3 verse 20 21 and that's it that's it for that yeah it is it is it is an awesome message hey marky mark glad you came to join us my dear brother yes donna it is i'm telling you this has been a blessing it's been such a joy and so today it looks like we are going to do is this is called um this is the color blue a water baptism but it's called lacy v that's the kind of stitches we're doing for this one and so with my phone being out of commission i won't be able to show you like you know what i'm all the way doing because my plan was to have the phone so you can see what i'm doing you know just in case somebody needs some help along the way um but this little phone i got honey i'm this is my old phone there's a reason why it's old okay it should not be at 97 i just pulled it off the charger at 100 that's why it's is old and sounds like a battery problem i have to just take it and let let them fix the battery in that one as well so i have a backup phone you know for situations like these i don't know but we're gonna see where what the battery life is at the um at 1 30 when we roll out of here today okay so it says to loosely chain 26 so that's what i'm gonna do i'm going to start with the chain loosely chaining 26 come on child get in there oh i normally don't i don't do um i don't do what do you call a slipknot i just let my hook do the slip knot i don't even yeah but i don't even get down yeah so what do you think about that how awesome is that how is our commitment that we make that we are saved and then we go into the world and we preach the gospel to every creature and he didn't say every preacher go preach the gospel he didn't say that he said all of us honey he said to every creature so i wonder if that's who is a creature to every person animal i don't know what y'all think i just wanna i just wanna know what y'all think because the way it reads i was like every creature every person hmm i don't know but you know we all take it as every every person so yeah that for sure but i always wonder you know what am i going to see my doggies in heaven you know people always wonder that too they do they do it is it just one it's people wonder i just want to know what y'all think what you think let's see all right let me go ahead and get started with this chain 26. don't mind me i have to count y'all y'all know how we are when we count like i ain't saying nothing i'm not counting right now because i'm talking but because i'm not at the market where i feel i need to but y'all know i'm getting ready to y'all know i'm special good lord let's see all right see where we are y'all know our crochet slow right absolutely let's see 18 already okay i got 18 on there i need 26. all right i got 26 on my hook and then it says to double crochet in the fifth chain from the hook so i'm gonna go ahead and do that let's see here is my fifth chain i turned to my husband and said it said every creature so i looked at my dog and told him jesus is coming you better get right no more chasing that cat you better come oh heather i've listened i'll do the same thing with my little dogs i'm like y'all know jesus is coming come on let's go on and worship the lord they'd be like all right they'd be sitting right there if i get my guitar out they they coming mm-hmm they just and they just lay there and they go to sleep then it says to skip the next two chains and then i'm gonna dc i'm gonna double crochet chain one double crochet in the next chain and i'm gonna repeat that going across so it looks like we're skipping two chains oh let's see cameron how you doing no no you're you're fine well listen look at here look let's see in mark 16 the word translated from the greek language okay i can't say that uh brother brian which means individuals okay also what is established okay that's cool but they don't hurt to tell a dog he need to get his life right it was like let's go and cast out that little crazy demon and uh y'all don't mind me my my little doggies okay yeah all right so i'm going to skip the next two one two and then in the next stitch i am going to double crochet oh man wait hold up all right here we go i'm a double crochet then i am going to chain one and double crochet in the same stitch yep and then we're going to repeat that all the way across yeah one two skipping two chains and then double crochet chain one now see this is where me and red heart have a slight um battle if you will likes to split on me sometimes i i don't know why it wants to split on me like that but uh yeah okay i got it so yeah so i may be like oh it's splitting you can't do that we're in the middle of doing great things what are you doing what are you doing okay me talking to yarn happens all right let's try this again all right there we go then we skip two one two and we double crochet chain one and double crochet in that same stitch brother brian brother my brother brian be ready today are you ready to start crocheting yet um are you ready i'm just asking let's see that's one dc and one hand and double crochet so it's like we're doing a v stitch let me show you this is what it's looking like right now you know the chain is always you know the first one is always a little special to get into and y'all know how this goes one two brother brian be ready today the question is on the floor sir you got your yarny goodness over there and you got some stuff going on are

doing like a lacy stitch so it's going to be a like a series of double crochet uh chain one double crochet in the same stitch so this is where i'm at so far see just how far it got all right and vida shanna shinha honey did i say that right i hope i did welcome and happy new year i'm glad you're here thanks for coming all right across i think i did it right let's see i don't know wait a minute gotta get back to work see y'all later okay no problem uh brother brian we'll chat later okay we will definitely chat later i'm not understanding so sometimes i get to a point in this wonderful crochet world and i'm wondering if i need to crochet let's see happy new year it's gonna be cute when it's all said and done it what happens is i get to the end of the row and i'm like what am i doing here so i got two left but that doesn't make sense because if i skip these two then i have an empty room i'm working on the scarf he showed us in one of the videos that's awesome yeah yeah try it out yeah so i'm looking at this and i'm like wait a minute now i know i had 26 i counted like i was supposed to and i feel like i'm off by one for some reason i'm going to rip this out because i want to make sure i'm doing this right you guys i'm glad i'm at the beginning do you see i'm not sure i wasn't sure about it because when the last stitch i thought about that but i wasn't sure sunita is that what you did are you on the blue my dear if you are i'm just going to go ahead and do it i just kind of wish it said you know i'm one of them people who i'm very i follow instructions to the tea that's what i said too the skip of five change is the one that makes the v so i'm wondering what it's going to look like on the end so do i just dc in the last because i feel like it's gonna be um because the four chain four in the front is counted as a dc okay y'all know i'm special okay let's see all right let me let me go ahead and i didn't rip her all the way out i ripped him out some but not all the way let's see two and we'll get back here i just i don't know y'all know i'll be wanting to see results like right now oh y'all know i'm special maybe just uh dc in the last yeah i'll dc in the last one but i feel like i don't know i'll be feeling like i'm missing something i'ma do it we'll get to the row two and see what it looks like how about that okay skip to have you guys seen um what's it called would you be my neighbor i want to say that's what it's called but it's actual it's the actual documentary um called um it's an actual documentary about mr rogers neighborhood not the

a blessing to see you here thanks for stopping by i really do appreciate it all right another mr rogers movie i'm talking about the actual documentary uh regarding uh mr rogers oh you didn't know yeah yeah i want to see the movie as well but um i just wondered if anybody seen it i saw it last night while i was um trying to get this phone situation together it has been crazy if i've ever seen crazy before yes it has been all right in the last stitch i am just going to double crochet we're going to see what this looks like all right see this is what it's looking like i feel like this is going to be off um you see where my last stitch is right here now the beginning stitches that so i feel like it should have been another i don't know is it on netflix no it's actually not it's um i don't know um it could be i don't know if it is i didn't see it there i seen it um on was it i am db that is a um all right let me chain three for this next row that's uh it's like a free app that i have a smart tv so i download this app where i can watch tv shows and um i am db i believe is what it's called has movies that you can see for free and then they have like commercials and stuff so yeah it is a blessed blessing to see oh yeah i forgot about it i watched wanted to watch the movie i had might have i watched something about him before the movie was released that might have been it heather that might have been it i just wondered this is inquiring mind over here yeah i'm such a baby man i'd be crying at movies my husband be like what's wrong with you i'll be like you always ask me the same thing there's nothing wrong this movie just touches my heart can you believe it you know and he's like yeah yeah yeah i was like just pass me the tissue bro you know i'm gonna be sitting over here crying like a fat baby eating onions yes i did okay uh yeah i saw both the movie and documentary love them both one tissue on both yeah yeah that's it uh imdb that's it it's like a app you can um i on my smart tv i downloaded that app and so i was able to see uh that particular documentary and i thought it was very interesting um denisha honey how you doing good afternoon good afternoon i had to explain that to my hubby a long long time ago yeah but here's the thing mom explained this to my husband he still do the same thing oh no absolutely not um donna nothing wrong with tender hearts that's right listen i'll be feeling i'll be feeling some kind of way sometimes i don't like people to be mistreated and then to notice somebody that has a heart for his fellow you know man man that just blesses me why i'm i'm looking over here because my my little doggy is in the corner i don't know what she's doing gizmo why are you hiding behind the box come here you can come over if you want to i got all my dogs are here today uh teddy and raven are at my feet and um lord have mercy uh cameron hocus pocus with bette midler i've i haven't seen that i haven't seen it yeah it sounds sounds cool though are you going to come over here gizmos over there i think if we all had tender hearts more we would really see some changes in this world the way we re in interact with the lord and one another you are so right denisia amen amen let's see yes maybe this is right i don't know let me see if this is right i hope i'm doing it right 2dc and first change space 3dc in each change space across so wait a minute so i might be doing it wrong kelly did you put a v-stitch in the fifth stitch from i don't know what you mean i did i put from the from hop or just what say that again honey listen i'm good got my 12 b shot oh good so i did my uh i did my from the hook oh from did you put a v-stitch in the fifth chain i was thinking that's where the first the two uh i was thinking that's where the two double crochet need to be in that first in this first space but it said it didn't say that we're counting that but i mean it's assumed i guess the fifth the fifth uh chain um the dc50 chain from the hook maybe that's what we need to do i don't know i'll try it and see i'll try both ways i mean if it don't work i could just rip it out and that right one let's do two and then okay let me let me try it and see and then i'm a uh in first chain one space so i didn't did i treat the first one as a basically is that the first um like chain one space is that what you mean i don't know i don't know tracy davis i don't know if i saw you come in the building but if i didn't forgot girl how you doing how are you let me see all right and i'm a three i'm gonna put three in the next yeah see the first one should probably be right okay i never seen that movie and then we're going to put three dc's all the way across in the chain spaces so that's what i'm doing we're going to see how this is going to turn out you guys then we'll take the creative liberty to do what we need to do at the end huh let's see yeah and the reason why i brought up why did i bring up mr rogers i was just thinking of just how kind you know the the message of love is just everywhere and how it was interesting to see how people wanted to turn it around to a space of hate which was like weird to me because i was like mr rogers had a big heart what are you talking about it wasn't hate speech hate speech isn't um god loves you right that's not hate that's that's love the world is wrong with folks i was like these people are something to behold yeah i'm glad you fine tracy it's an interesting movie yeah so i haven't seen the movie uh i've seen the documentary denisha and so that's what i'm talking about if you get a chance to check out the actual documentary be you know if you saw the movie that's great too because i want to see that too but i was just wondering if anybody's seen the documentary and just saying that just the message of love that he had in his heart for children and for children to know what that is and telling people that they're special because they are everybody special and how i did not know that he was going to go to school for seminary i did not know that but he chose not to um be a minister in that respect but he used his life as as the ministry right and so um mr rogers definitely lived his faith he preached more by his lifestyle than just preaching and that is what we're called to do and a lot of people would say that he was uh weird or whatever but he wasn't weird or they tried to say they asked some questions you know back in the day they asked some stuff like are you square what and you know are you square and he's like nah you know y'all tripping that man is not square so yeah to see here i'm at the end oh this is what you're talking about at the end am i going to put 3 and i'm going to put two in and i think i'm gonna put one in the hook oh you was talking about hocus pocus oh oh you wouldn't talk about mr rogers oh okay let me see what did he say i love bette miller hope she is absolutely funny we used to talk his brother hi and my fellow classmates put me in that medler's character oh okay okay so i guess um i did two stitches in there um sunita and then i'm going to do the last stitch in the top of the um last um the actual last stitch yeah so let me see i'm a chain one let me show you this is what i did this is how far it got so far does it look right let me move my fingers out the way so i chained up i did in top of that stitch i i wasn't sure how that would work out you see what i mean so we're gonna see we're just gonna see what happens oh and then i chain one and i turn it so now i'm on the third row you guys and this one is i am to single crochet in the first two dc's so single crochet here and single crochet here hopefully this is right and then it says to chain three one a two and a three and we're gonna skip wait a minute you said mice looks like yours yeah so okay see you later tracy be blessed honey god bless you may heaven smile upon you so okay so i'm at the end and i'm like i don't know if that was right so i am going to probably frog this in high entire thing and go ahead yeah so it's just trying to figure it out come here gizmo where are you going she loves to go under my bookshelf i have a bookshelf that's like raised a little in gizmo she loves being in like any place that's like dark she wants to go like when we're in the living room she is under the couch if we're in the bedroom she's under the bed if i'm like why she just loves being there i don't know what that's about but that's my little girl gizmo now her mama on the other hand is under my feet and her papa has moved him happy self to the couch i pray that he doesn't push my pillows on the floor like he likes to do he's like all these pillows will never do and he just pushes him on the floor and sometimes he'll scoot with his head like get out of here pillow i always say damn it's telling me make it a fresh okay that's kind of different cameron all right y'all talking about stuff y'all must be talking about stuff in that hocus pocus movie i have no idea what you're speaking of okay so yeah i might have to redo this and rethink this because um i don't know if sunita if you still here honey i am looking at it like i don't know if this is right i don't know if that uh something's not right with that one so what i'm going to do i'm going to take it apart because there's something i'm not getting right now let me pull it up maybe if i look at it i can probably get a better idea of what this stitch is supposed to really look like i just want to make sure that i have the ends right come on in the room [Music] come on okay here we go here's the blue now this blue looks more lilac than anything in this picture i can share it with you guys so y'all can see it see what i'm talking about it is a challenge to see um what's supposed to be happening here let me see if i can share this with you guys you feel the same way about those decorative pillows you just throw them on the floor denisha because my my dog teddy's like he's like oh if this will never do they have got to move out the way i'm like you're a little dog you're not going to take up the whole couch whatever for sir why shall you do that he's something okay let me see there's a tab let me grab it all right all right let me oh okay let's see yeah i just pull it apart honey listen look at here i ain't got time look i take my time with it because i'm one of people it's got to be right it's got to be right you know let me see if i can make this bigger so you can see not the word so much but the pattern so you can get an idea oh that was the knitted one sorry you guys that was a knit one that's kind of cool and here is the crocheted one yeah so and i and the crazy thing about me i will spend all day trying to figure out this stitch i'm not kidding i will do it i'm like i'll take it apart ain't no big thing ain't no thing but a chicken wing ain't that right heather okay let's see yeah i'll start it again absolutely i'm printing the pattern i'm still working on the scarf one ball uh only made it four feet so i added another okay all right yeah row three is bunching my work up it's messing it up okay so we got to take it apart let's let's start over um cameron that's not really kelly's type of movie no it is i um i mean i watch it but uh i have to see it i haven't i guess when it came out nothing

and it has been a little bit more frustrating than a training should be for me um the way they're doing it now you know with the zoom meeting and then they do virtual uh what i'm gonna say virtual labs so you're working inside a lab that's not on your computer it's the virtual spaces there so it's like you have a virtual desktop and not your real desktop and so that's where the problem has been i just did it there should be eight v in one row one okay all right i'ma check it out sunita and then i'll be back in these streets hopefully around six if not i'll post something in the community tab of letting you know what time i'm actually going to be able to come in because my plan is to be in these wonderful streets and working on the blue and also on saturday as well before you do row three

o'clock so we'll see how that works out so you guys be blessed y'all stay encouraged and hope to see you around six if not sometime a little later than six that's the plan though but i'll put it in the community tab so be on the lookout around 5 30 ish okay all right", "MjhhPCvpTyo": "[Music] today I am doing an unboxing and a review of the firls crochet hooks Odyssey in color purple these are retailed at $33 and sometimes you can find a coupon code as the hook milk has one that's hook hook 15 or other sales that they have going on their site but $33 is the retail price on their site so let's just jump straight into what you get when every day arrived in the mail they were really secured in the box a box wasn't way too big for what I was getting I got two crochet hooks and there was a lot of paper to protect them which I was really impressed with so these are what the hooks come in it's just a simple black box and it tells you what hook size you have and it says Odyssey purple and so opening it is really simple and then this is the beautiful crochet hook the camera does not do the color justice because not only does it sparkle but it's almost duochrome there's a different shade of purple kind of in there so these are truly truly beautiful hooks I wanted to share because I got two of the same color crochet hooks there is nothing to tell them apart except for there's a sticker on the bottom so I have an H and an eye which is a 5 and a 5 and a half millimeter the only thing that I really wasn't impressed with in these hooks is this sticker is not something that I see lasting for a long time I work a lot with my crochet hooks and I can see this getting bumped off or sweat sweat it off even with the amount I work they do suggest that you keep your hooks in the box or in the leather case that they sell on the site and in a stand um I definitely have been keeping mine in the box just because I don't want to ruin them because they are pricey so hopefully with good care these stickers will stay on I also plan on just never keeping them laying around my house which I do with my old crochet hooks so it'll definitely be interesting the learning curve of taking care of such a high-end crochet hook I also do don't want my hooks just laying around the house um and so I wanted a case for them but I didn't want to spend money on one of their $99 or up cases so I actually got this it's a lipstick organizer from Target 16 whole lipstick organizer I measured the circumference of the biggest part of the hook and it's just a little bit smaller than a typical lipstick so these fit in here great and if you ordered all of the firls crochet hooks I think it would be like fifteen or fourteen so they would all fit in here perfectly so this is where I'm keeping mine currently and this was only seven dollars at Target so I just wanted to share that also now I want to show a comparison between a couple different crochet hooks because I don't really think you can get the full of the firls crochet hook unless you see it against a regular and then another organ on the hook so I did some measurements and the firls crochet hook is six inches long compared to these two which are both five and a half inches long and then it at its widest part the Burroughs crochet hook is 2.25 inches wide that was really significant for me because whenever you work with a regular one it's really just as big as the hook size so this is only five millimeters wide and this one I have a set of ergonomic handled crochet hooks and the handle size varies with each hook so if you're working with a small hook you're still really not getting the hand support you need which I didn't realize until I started working with the smaller ones this is a five millimeter and it's decent I will say so this isn't a first impressions video as I've been working with the firls crochet hook for a bit I wanted to get my thoughts on it for this video I think that it is worth it over these other hooks because I crochet so much it is my favorite thing to do and previously I'd been working with this and was not getting any hand support and I bumped up to this and it was better but I recently started crocheting a lot as I'm getting ready for some fairs in the winter and my thumb right here just hurts so bad after a while and so that's what really piqued my interest in the firls crochet hooks because of their claims that it's perfectly organ amah cans and I have to say it really is just after working with it for about two weeks now the comfort is unreal it's gorgeous and it's feels really good in my hand now I just want to show my self crocheting with it because I do think that I work a little faster I work a little smoother with the firls crochet hook and I just want to demonstrate that on camera whenever I was researching these there was a lot of claims that you crochet faster and I being a little cocky was like well I think I already crochet pretty fast for just the average crochet and then I got this and it's almost not faster it's just so much smoother and I think it's because how wide the handle is the littlest turn rotates the tips so much so I I really don't have to work that hard it's easier on my thumb and not to mention the weight it's really nice it's about 2.5 it's excuse me it's about 1.5 to 2 ounces I waited on my home scale so I don't know the exact but it feels really really nice in my hand it's not too heavy it did take a while for me to get used to it coming from a regular organ Amish handle crochet hook um but once you get used to it oh my gosh I've had to go back to my other crochet hooks for projects I'm working on and I just don't want to do it because this is so nice to work with so as you can see my stitches look great my attention is better than it's ever been the firls crochet hook is truly a dream to work with my final thoughts on the firls crochet hook odyssey collection in purple is that yes they are worth it they're worth it for the price but I do think if you don't crochet a ton and you aren't experiencing the hand problems you don't need these I do really standby that they yes they are where that for me someone who crochets multiple hours daily because of the hand benefits I would recommend if you are gonna make the splurge try to do it whenever you can get them on sale I bought these with the hook nooks 15% off coupon which is hook nuke 15 which helped a lot and I previously just bought a lot more because they're doing a pre-sale of the blue Odysseys which I hopefully will do an unboxing for and I got 25% off so if you are gonna buy these be a little thrifty wait for a good deal and you didn't hopefully get a good price on these in conclusion I love my furls crochet hook I bought more and I'm a true believer but you do not need them and so I hope this helped a lot please keep an eye out for a good deal if you are gonna buy it and happy crocheting", "r61Y4HB0KwQ": "[Music] hey you guys

guys uh well this is the next one of the flower purses that I made I like the other one a lot and I'm glad that you guys did too so I decided I would start making some and maybe even sell some on it Etsy so this is my second attempt it's um purple and white and pink and I got a fastener on both of them now I see that the brown the white petals really show versus the darker ones so I don't know how that's going to work if you guys like this one or not I'd really like to know your opinion and I also thought about making a green one and a pink one so I'd appreciate you guys uh commenting letting me know what you think thanks bye", "Ptsf3zoPFd0": "so this is the roots do it as a combination of very good rice and Mayakoba beans rutabaga yams and a purple potato it's just plain delicious it's going to be the base for what we're gonna be doing today this is a purple cauliflower or any new from sprouts let's open it up now it's unique because of its color see a beautiful rich and vibrant now you need to get rid of these leaves there what we're gonna do is we're gonna cook this on the stove top so I can show you how to incorporate the two meals together or maybe cauliflower and roots to come and watch how we put this together welcome to LT vegan living alright so what I'm doing now is I'm washing the cauliflower and while I'm washing it I'm going to take it apart now I don't eat these leaves though some people do the next part points it's kind of washed like this is I'm going to separate it from the stem so the flower le'ts will fall into the string [Music] [Music] okay so now we have all this has to get back into the strainer it's clean and we're going to get our pot now you see this just debris I'm just simply gonna do this to it and put it in the pot there's nothing wrong with it let me get the pot alright so that setting is on high right now now what I've done is I've button this large two quart saucepan I've put in very little water at the bottom of it and what our plan is today is instead of boiling it in water like we did in some what some of us Brussels sports I do we're gonna steam this so we're gonna take our remains then we're gonna take our cauliflower and you see a little water there is I mean it's not even covering so we're gonna do is we're going to let this come to a boil with the cauliflower in it and those extra long pieces on this burner the glass one we're going to deep frost the roof base so that when this is ready which it would be ready fairly soon they will combine them together now all I'm waiting here for heaven is for it to boil so of this entire saucepan 1/4 of it is water okay alright now on this side is just going to open the envelope and I've learned from experience that I am NOT lucky at saving the envelopes so what I do is I just tore them off they've done their job keeping my food until I'm ready sometimes you can break chunks of it off now if I add vegetable stock right now I would put that inside of here and I'd have a good base for this stupid I've created but it said that I had a fairly F a cup of water into it and I'm going to show you I'm gonna turn up this stove on we're gonna put this on high and when it starts melting more than I'm gonna reduce it now because you're running two things at one time it's best if you stay in the kitchen [Music] just ahead oh nothing little bit faster this is already getting ready to boil when that happens and set the timer for 15 minutes and as soon as we see that then they'll be ready for this little piece down there that I'd made originally now it's been a few minutes since I last saw you and already what does happen is this is collapse upon on inside the that the saucepan so now we just have to wait for them now remember you're not read cooking this all you're doing is defrosting it the gas on high as soon as it starts nothing okay the cauliflower is now steaming now we're gonna put the cover on top we're gonna reduce the heat to to low and here on the other side right here where my hands at what we've done is which this is still on high and it is still defrosting this is frozen still ask for the cauliflower there's a lot of cauliflower so only a portion of that will be used for my lunch okay when you're using these glass type of saucepans you have to keep you have to stay in the kitchen and you have to keep stirring it because it works choy your food your food that you you're trying to defrost now I've already moved it from the mean or low because most of it is now be frosted and ready to be used we'd have 10 more minutes to go on the timer for their cauliflower the next step is to drain the cauliflower the timer just rung click your saucepan remove the cover carefully and just carefully push you can also see that the water that comes out of it is purple well alright so once it's drained now move your purple cauliflower to your plate and what we're gonna do with these store it release to container around before you put this away in the refrigerator little cool a little bit so we'll leave it there because you turned on the stove range the curvature do you turn it off of your your ranges off the next part of this is to put your delicious - and maybe that's too much for some of you but you know when you mostly vegetables this really helped so that's the plate so here you have the stupid rutabaga yams and purple potato Mayakoba beans and long grain rice over here we have today's feature which is the purple calif cauliflower and this is a does a plantain apple dessert of a complete and delicious meal for me thanks very much for watching me put this meal together I look forward to seeing you in my next video if you make this channel please subscribe if you like this video give us a thumbs up thank you for watching [Music]", "uaIlCiTP5E0": "hi there I'm working on my half can it's a scrap Afghan and I wanted to show you how I created it thus far it's about halfway done right now and I thought going over the whole thing would be just a lot so this is gonna be a part 1 video of the scrap can essentially and I'm gonna tell you step by step just what I did so that if you like a certain piece of it and want to add it to yours you can do so so I'm gonna get a little bit closer here and what I did was chained 200 and that'll give you 61 inches and that's unblocked this is not locked yet of course I'm gonna wait till it is completely locked or completely finished and then block it and so for the border I have just a half double crochet and then I did a front post back post double crochet to front post to back post I did do a video on that so you can find that it's probably right ahead of this video or right behind however you want to look at it so there is a video on the border then just two rows of a half double crochet then three rows of half double crochet that's in a burgundy then a variegated yarn of half double crochets a solid Brown a solid gray and then I moved into the v-stitch and did some orange pink brown and blue then a couple more rows of just half double crochet and that's in an avocado color or an olive color a red half double crochet and then I moved to an oatmeal and a purple this is just two rows of half double crochet on the third row I incorporated the purple and I drugged the oatmeal through and so this is about eight stitches of the purple and then stop did three stitches of the oatmeal and then continued that sequence turned continued it back and then did two more rows of just the oatmeal in the half double crochet then I did a half double crochet of the navy this is another variegated and this is front post and then when I turned I did back post so that's how you get that braided look and then this is just a double crochet four two four six seven rows and then I did the wave stitch which I like to call the tutu stitch because you did - single - half double - double - half double to single to make it go up and down and then I just did a single crochet and followed that with the oatmeal color and then I did the opposite to get the wave stitch so you're gonna do your single crochets at the tallest part where your doubles were and that'll straighten it out and then that is just a brown with the half double I'm gonna move this the tape measure I got the tape measure out second okay let's keep going here and now we're at the yellow with a couple half double and the green is just six half double and now this variegated is see how it's kind of Richie that is front loop back loop alternating all the way down the row front lift back row the front loop back loop and that's two rows of half double crochet and then just a black of half double crochet the gray is back loops only and then a couple rows of just the light blue and that's just a half double crochet and then I did another half double crochet of just a coral color and this is the Katherine's wheel and that's four rows of the Katherine's wheel so a red and orange and then an orange and a red if you there's some videos on the Katherine's wheel because that one is just too hard to explain I might do a Catherine's wheel video when I'm all done but I'm just trying to get this project done right now and then we've got two more rows of half double crochet and then we go into the V stitch so this is all V stitch and what I want to tell you about the V stitch guys if you start your V stitch and then start another color right behind it like I worked in threes okay so three colors going across the same way so I didn't flip my work your V stitch is going to be more pointed than if you go all the way down your work flip it and come back then it gets more mild like this and doesn't look so bead so that's a good thing to know you get more of a textured look and this one is just not so prominent in the vs the V's a lot more subtle when you flip your work so if you want a more pointy looking V keep starting from the same side of the row and you'll get that look so I hope that helps you was something to do with your scraps and if you have any questions I'll try to answer them I'm going to get ready and add a kelly green that I just found in my scrap pile thanks for watching guys happy crocheting", "Ku5C8q_Czp0": "[Music] hello everybody i hope you can hear me hmm see where are we later here we go hello hello hello hello hello let's see hi hey jennifer how's it going vivian how you doing let's see oh yeah isn't this cute this is the one that um irene from pyv does it all she made this for me and i'm like i love it i love it so yeah so i figured i'd wear it today it's a little chilly so i am wearing it honey yes let me um i need to share myself out oh good you can hear me vivian honey how are you doing you having a good morning are you sick what you got a mask on your face and a good morning like uh-huh you out and about what's going on i am y'all know i am slow when it comes to looking for my uh stuff on my phone let me see if i can find myself all right there i am let me go ahead and cheer myself [Music] out so hello helen j harris how you doing no i'm not sick i'm just saying if you go out mask up oh i said honey you know we masking up over here yes ma'am we doing it all right i found myself i did that all right you guys all right um let's see there's four people in the room i know we still have a lot to do um with a lot of people doing like christmas gifts me myself and i doing the same and just wanting to continue the stitched in christ the colors of salvation afghan if you need to have a copy of that and you do not have the actual pattern i can get the link i don't remember if i put it in here but i can get the link in and um drop it down in here so you can grab it if you need it let me see if i can do that real quick let me see the colors of salvation yes free pattern what a blessing it is to create it yeah so let me just and i'm going to drop it in the link just for anybody who may want to who who do not have it so this is it hold on a second my husband's talking to the dogs they always trying to tell him what to do he's like yo y'all not the boss of me lord so yes if you get a chance hit the thumbs up hit the like and share out if you'd like that would be cool so all right so we're doing the colors of salvation and today the colors of salvation uh afghan the next panel the first panel we worked on was in the is in the color orange and i'm not quite finished but i'm getting close to being complete with it but i will show you what it looks like this is one of the panels i'm almost i got a little ways to go but i'm almost there so i plan on having this completed tonight okay that's my goal that's my goal it's it's pretty it's beautiful isn't it but this represents the gates of hell as it relates to um let's see let me go back inside here as it relates to revelation 21 and 8 and um the main uh thing was romans 3 uh 23 where it says all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god and so that orange panel just represented that space and how but you know revelations 21 8 says but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars not some all shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone which is the second which is a second death so that was what that panel represented um so now we're moving on to white so the question was are you anywhere on that list all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god so now we move on to white and what white represents so white represents the purity of our hearts being washed whiter than snow we are condemned to death but because of the blood of jesus and the sacrifice made we are made pure um romans chapter 10 verse 13 says for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved that whosoever means you it means me it means anybody all you have to do is call upon him and trust him that cleansing is made possible because the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin according to first john chapter 1 verse 7 in the way of righteousness is life and in the pathway thereof there is no death proverbs 20 i'm sorry proverbs 12 and 28 when god looks at those who call on him he doesn't see the sin he sees the purity and so that's what we're going to be working on today so yes let's see i did 200 rows on my centro for the orange oh that's nice helen j harris that's awesome i'm i'm interested to see how beautiful that's going to turn out hi there uh minister of music terence trower sir it's a pleasure to see you i'm glad you're here um so let's go ahead and get started i don't know if um anyone is in this life who is actually beginning to uh do the or have outside of heath um helen i know helen is i can't remember vivian if you're doing it or not i think so i'm i wasn't sure but we're gonna we're moving on to white even though we're i'm almost done with with the orange but we're going to go ahead and get started with the white um color to at least get that started you get started with the white panel the white represents the purity and so it is a half double crochet puffs white puff of popcorn is the image this pattern brings to my mind what image do you see so it shows you how to do the uh puff stitch so um let me go ahead and show you what that would look like oh my goodness i'm pulling from the center lure and it gets that oh there it goes comes out in a little bit of a little bit of uh yarn-ishness man [Music] so we'll bring that out good morning tracy davis good morning how are you so the puff stitch is a let me go ahead and just do see if i can go ahead and create it so before i get started with it i'm just going to do a small a tiny sample of in order to do that i need to do a little bit of a change so i'm going to start with the little chain here i'm not doing the entire chain just going to show what the puff stitch looks like then i'm gonna take it out and actually begin the actual project so all right i did a chain here and so a puff stitch is let's see a yarn over i don't know if you can see it yarn over i wish i had my phone where you could actually see what i'm doing i'll probably have to do that next time yarn over insert hook i'm just going to insert here and then yarn over and then draw up a loop and then repeat two more times so i'm a yarn over yeah and insert my hook again in the same stitch yarn over and pull up the loop and i'm going to do the same thing yarn over and insert hook in the same stitch i'm going to yarn over and pull through and i should have a total of seven hoops on my hook i don't know let's see one two three four five six seven what do you know i got seven there and so after you do that you um you yarn over and you pull through all seven and it makes a little bit of a puff can you guys see it puff stitch oh no so that's what it does so that's what we're going to be doing so i'm going to take this out and i'm going to actually begin with a chain of 23. loosely change 23 it says oh you are that's great uh vivian i i knew you were but i wasn't sure if you started yet or not so yeah one two let's see three four five six seven eight all right i told you i crochet slow even the chain you guys i'm lord y'all know i'm slow with it let's see one two eight i have nine i have to do 23 so i'm just starting this 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 and 23 stitches so this is going to be the length of the next panel um so with row one the right side we work a puff stitch in the fifth chain from the hook then we chain one we skip the next chain and then we work a puff stitch in the next chain and we repeat this all the way across so it'll look like a c one two three four five fifteen from hook you insert your oh wait you yarn over and you insert your hook yarn over pull through yarn over insert your hook yarn over and pull through see one two three four five i gotta do it one more time i yarn over insert my hook wearing the same stitch now yarn over and pull up a loop so i should have seven two four five six seven which i do and then i yarn over and pull through all seven now after you do that you chain one so that kind of locks that in chain one over top of that hey marky mark i'm glad you're here and then you skip the next chain which is the one right beside it skip this one and i'm gonna do the same exact thing but i just did in this stitch here so yarn over insert my hook yarn over drop loop yarn over insert yarn over draw up a loop one more time for the road yarn over insert hook and i should have seven two four six seven which i do yarn over and pull through all seven and chain one skip the chain next to it and go to the next one so yarn over insert hook oh you guys oh my gosh you guys excuse me that's an interesting sneeze all right no no i'm good over here you guys you know i'm good over here sometimes i get up in the morning my sinuses can be a little special hey nana's hands how you doing how you doing so just a question how has this lesson really um spoke to your life have you seen any wonderful changes or or have you grown even in your relationship with christ during these times you know just a question for everybody it doesn't have to be based on this book just during these times where we are quarantined or quarantined or we're more or less you know staying in away from people's social distancing how has your relationship grown in the lord seven how has it grown in the lord spending more time in meditating or anything i mean just whatever right i know i'm you know really dissecting spending more time dissecting the word to where you know just applying it even more to my life i applied it before but really going back and reading the words slowly slowly and getting into specific you know chapters and things like that that's what i'm doing and just seeing where we are and making you know sure that i get an understanding and to be able to respond in all things in wisdom and just looking at how um the lord how the word is just so prevalent during these times you know how about you hey kristen kristen campbell two four six seven how are you doing i hope i can show you guys this before we get off line that i finished the whole row and then then i'll go back to finishing up my um oh well this is row one so row two is going to be definitely different and wrote well maybe not all the way different but somewhat different the first row is very uh is a bunch of puff stitches so we'll see if what what that looks like for the next one next row i'm sure it's going to be the same so y'all know i crochet slow so please feel free to hit the like and share me out that would be great yeah if you can if you can um oh yarn over insert hook yarn over draw a loop yarn over okay insert yarn over let's do it again one more time for the road and i should be good two four six seven yes oh get back on there where are you going junior you tried to leave me look at me talking to yarn vanessa honey how are you how are you doing i am working on you guys we're working on the second panel just at least getting it started for um the colors of salvation uh afghan and so last night i committed to making my afghan 48 by 60 inches long we'll see if it makes it there that is the goal um that i have in mind and over insert hook yarn over insert draw up same let's see do i have two four six seven yes i do yarn over and pull through all seven and then we chain one skip next stitch yarn over insert hook yarn over pull up and over insert and i'm going to pull up the loop yarn over insert and pull up i should have seven and see i'm good yes i feel closer to the lord it has been a tough time but seeing god's hand at work trusting him more yeah we're definitely living in that time very good thing yes um that we we need to really really lean and trust on in the lord because i'm telling you there's some interesting things going on in this world and um a lot of times you know let's try not to get caught up in in that and realizing you know because i know sometimes fear can overtake us it can and we we're not going to live fearful huh or anxious i love how the word says be anxious for nothing but and everything what um the prayer and supplication to the lord you know yeah i'm giving thanks to him always thinking him in all things in all situations we may not understand all this stuff that's going on it's the truth i know i don't be like lord this stuff is crazy it's crazy um keep my mind you know keep my mind stayed on him that's that's the thing you know i want to keep my mind stayed on the lord and uh yeah so you skip this one and we go to the next yarn over insert hook so that's what i'm doing today guys not really trying to get a scarf done today that's my plan to get one done i might be able to get two done a day what can i get two down yes there's a pattern that i found that i noticed though with the softer yarns it takes me longer and i'm like i need it to be a little bit more on the rougher side of things so uh and i know that red heart uh super saver is a little bit of um not as soft some of the super savers are not as soft right and so and i appreciate it i do because it helps me go a little bit faster as you know my goal is to crochet at least a little faster lord and um so you know i know i'm gonna probably have to do more with a red heart and i have some really cool um patterns from other content creators that i'll be able to do that some of these patterns kind of look similar to some of the other content creators i was trying to stay away from a lot of similarities but it's a challenge especially when you're looking at making scarves and um items that are quick and easy easy doesn't always mean that you'll get done quickly as i have found out with these scarves that i'm using the chunky yarn with i'm like good lord i know what to do next year you guys i'm i'm having better together next year but hey this year christmas is all year it's just that and i love it's i think it'll be a blessing to send someone a gift in the mail they're not expecting but when they get a scarf honey it doesn't not on christmas day but just to let them know you're thinking about them and you know the season is great and want them to know that they are loved to just send them homemade items i think that's that's a great uh way to um let people know hey you still hey i still got you we still cool even though it's been a little rough if i could just bless you with something real quick in the mail yeah and doesn't have to be on that day christmas day right well it wouldn't probably get there on christmas day exactly but yeah so let me see where am i skip this one move to this one yarn over i mean the last stitch you guys i believe let me yarn over so yeah that's what it's all about you know just being just being a giver being able to give love you know and let making christmas like every day one two three four five might i'm missing one all right should be seven there three four five six seven yes and two with me talking honey i just y'all know i'll be talking pull through also come on and go on through all set well you just going through all seven of them honey will you just make it on through large you don't want to make it through oh lord come on come on cletus all right let me just do this one over the fun part this is the fun part the do-over all right you're on over insert and that should be seven yeah let's see three tips seven yarn over and let's see and we chain one that's it so this is my first row you guys let me show you this is the first row oh can you see that of all of those puff stitches how awesome is that this is going to be so beautiful you guys so i'm using the h hook on this hey there butterfly dreams crochet with genie good morning good morning for those that is an hour ahead of me hey my beautiful kelly well hello there beautiful butterfly dreams grocery with genie how you doing so now i'm going to move on to my second row in this row i'm going to read it to you guys and it may sound kind of crazy let's see it says i am to chain three then turn my work work a puff stitch in the first chain one space and then chain one and then work puff stitch in the next chain one space so it looks like i'm going to be going in between each stitch that i made before where i did not include the stitch that is where i will be working my puff stitch so i'm going to go ahead and do that chain 3 1 2 3 i am starting my white today when i get home that's awesome jeannie and hey if you want to come back and hang out at six o'clock i'll be on here doing the same thing ciao yes i'll be back on here with this wonderful wonderful work so um genie have you decided to make a lap gan or afghan i have chosen to go with the afghan throw and so that's going to be 48 by 60 i believe we'll see how it goes um what it looks like when it's all said and done all right so i chained three and i turned my work and so now i'm going to work my first um in the first chain one space which is this little space in between the two here i'm going to work a puff stitch so yarn over drop a loop yarn over keep on doing this until i get to seven honey see okay and then one more and up come on precious and i believe that is seven let's see three four five six seven it is yarn over insert and pull all the way through and then chain one on top of that and then do the next the next so yarn over this is really a a blessing i really appreciate terry anne porter for this she doesn't know how much this means to me and i think i want to keep doing this so like maybe let's see i'm doing great i missed the one from last night no problem genie not not a problem whatsoever hon i'm doing the afghan also i was torn between the afghan or turning into a pocket show yeah so i think the next year the next time that um we do the colors of salvation i'm thinking maybe we can do whatever we want with it like we're gonna do the story the salvation story in a scarf or we're gonna do it in a pocket shawl and to make that happen um that i think would be so awesome i think what i'm gonna do with the yarn that i have left over that i'm actually gonna do a scarf with it but i want to do it as alive where we craft along and continue the salvation story uh through uh our wonderful crafts so yeah that's what i i believe i'm gonna go ahead and do share it with the world honey because i know we gonna have some yarn left over some yarny parts yeah so once you get the hang of it you can get going with it me i'm just still you know still a little slow with my stuff let's see one two three four five six seven yeah i think that's what i'm gonna do because we'll have some yarn left over so why not why not say hey listen we are on the south colors of salvation again and we're going to use these stitches from the the uh colors of salvation afghan honey and we gonna make scarves or pocket shops each row is going to be what it is i think that would be amazing and i'm thinking of it like the coat of many colors you know it's just a lot of things this comes to my mind what can we do to share christ and then when we wear these items we can actually you know bless people with the story of salvation this represents the salvation of our lord and savior and this is what we do based on our relationship with the lord we created these items to just share with um whoever and if we have enough to make two honey make one and give one right right so the one i'm making now the the afghan that i'm actually making um the salvation uh colors of salvation afghan i am going to be blessing this uh give this to my husband yes y'all yes and then you know i'm gonna keep i think i'm gonna keep purchasing more of this yarn to keep making these and coming up with other ways to bless somebody in this space with this wonderful wonderful wonderful uh afghan and it all started with terry ann porter and stitched in christ honey she don't understand how many people and how many souls can be reached by this message i mean she gets it right but don't even understand the depth of what she has produced and what the lord has laid on her heart to share with the world and how we are instrumental in really pushing the message message of christ and this is a lovely lovely way to do so and i'm just getting uh having so much joy and i can't wait till we start the other book too and the other one has the same pattern

see if they're going to be like the same length i always like to see what my my patterns go even though these are all separate patterns and it really don't matter if it's the same length tell you the truth um lengthwise uh am i saying it right you know no lengthwise it don't matter as long as we end you know as i'm making it i guess lengthwise it needs to be but widthwise is what i want to say the width of the beginning of the panel yeah one two three four five consuelo honey how are you doing i am so glad you are here thanks for coming and hanging out i love praising god and being with my sisters in christ honey and grandma and in 1962 yes yes consuelo is in the building crocheting and listening to the chat thank you so much honey if you get a chance please feel free to hit the thumbs up and and feel free to share us out that's cool too you know the more we share out i made um my orange panel 20 inches yes and i'm not done let me tell you something about my orange panel you ready it is not it's it's longer i think it's longer than um 20 inches i'm making it um i believe i'm doing 48 by 60 um so i'm going ahead and making a afghan throw out of it and i'm going to bless my husband with it it just makes me feel good to know that you know even though i'm making this and it's going to my husband who is saved who loves the lord as well yes thank you sweetheart you're so kind um that it just makes me feel good that i'm able to bless somebody with this and i'm excited about what next year is going to bring you know um i'm getting so excited about it i'm like trying to relax chill count you oh it makes me happy okay let's see two okay let me one more i think it is one more is it two four six seven yes yes i have to do it first or i'll forget i do the same to me too consuelo i'll be forgetting i'll be forgetting that is so awesome kelly yes yes and you know if you have someone in mind even if it's just for yourself i mean just starting there and then allow the lord to really speak to you about people that are not um maybe you don't have a lot of family members around maybe you do maybe you have neighbors maybe you have co-workers anybody you can think of there may be a child you know somebody you might see walking down the street you never know make a wonderful item and just bless them with it just be like you know what the lord put you on my heart and i want you to know and god wants you to know that you are loved and you know to for you to be reminded of that let me go ahead and bless you what he allow my hands to create just for you and to just bless that person with it yes honey i did i did my rose i looked i did it yeah so let me pull out my orange you got you said you have 20 inches on that panel ground anna 1962 let me see how long mine is i'm not quite sure but here's here's the one i'm gonna make it a little bit longer this panel let me see how long it is because i'm not really sure i got my trusty oak let's see where are we honey i am at 27 inches and i want to go just a little further i want to go 48 inches so that's gonna be a little ways to go but you know what i believe i can get that done you know we're taking our time with it but these are you know wednesdays are the days that we are going to start the new panel just so people can see there may be people that are way further along than we are you never know when you make anything you you must go thoughts go okay i think i know what you're saying yes absolutely when i make items so there's going to be a prayer shawl series of uh craft along to you guys that i'm doing also so i'm excited um you must have good thoughts not only good thoughts grandma i mean who who is oh consuelo you're gonna um okay um have thoughts of yeah good thoughts and um not only that just even prayers um praying while making it's like lord whoever receives this let them just be blessed so this is um the length of the white one it's about the same it's just a little bit it's a little bit shorter but that's okay it doesn't matter it doesn't matter it doesn't matter you guys this is gonna it's but i believe it's gonna end up being the same oh i can't wait i mean it's gonna be beautiful it doesn't have to be because what's gonna happen is when we put them all together they're gonna go lengthwise right um and so it's gonna be interesting just to see how that works out yeah so i am completely in love with this with this whole wonderful wonderful wonderful project let me see where are we we got 10 minutes ago i can do another row i can i can i can do another row after this i'm gonna go enjoy some soup let's see oh i think i'm going to increase my orange panel to 36. yeah so 36 would make it like a um what do they call them um it would be a lap gan more of a lap can i'm believing so um this one's going to be just a little longer because i know my husband when he's watching television sometimes he might fall asleep and might want a little bit of a beautiful blanket what are you making so right now consuelo we are making um the if you see the pattern up there the colors of salvation from this wonderful book stitched in christ it is a knit and crochet bible study devotional journal and in that is the pattern to um this see if i can show you so this is the and it tells you all the colors and stuff that you need here i try to include those in my life so that you know what colors we're going to be needing and so and they talk about use either red heart or i love this yarn and i'm really loving the red heart um i'm sorry the big twist i i couldn't find this color um in in a red heart for some reason yeah yeah it's great and so this big twist yarn is nice it's 100 acrylic perfect perfect for what we need and it's soft i like it i think i'm gonna start looking more into that and um even though i love the other yarns my only issue right now i'm having is with the big twist chunky i am not loving it 100 only because it's very it's very soft i love the softness of it i just don't like how slow is how long it's taken me to get projects done with it it shouldn't take me as long as it is but it is because it's so soft and trying to keep my you know hooks and yarn together sometimes can be a chore you understand what i mean let me see i got some i'm behind a little bit let's see i just ate and it's almost snap 30. yeah yeah grandma anna tyrone morgan hello sir how you doing let's see uh i love the idea of praying for the person who is receiving the project i am making hats while i am watching you and i said a prayer for the lady i am making the hat for now stitching ain't easy that is wonderful absolutely just lord bless them right where they are yes father and heal them absolutely and let them know you got them 100 mm-hmm yeah and that everything's going to be okay and when they receive this father let them know they don't have to be anxious for anything at all yes let's see good afternoon oh joyce cable honey good afternoon kelly i want to thank you again for my books i received them yesterday yeah you got them i'm so glad you got them girl yes i am i'm so glad that makes me happy okay happy you got him soft and price is good yes consuelo that it it is it is this the big twist you guys is is a can be a game changer for some okay this is just the regular big twist this isn't the big twist chunky that's the one that i'm kind of having a little um disagreement with we're having a little issues up so yeah it is it is that right now two three yes amen in jesus mighty name yes and his name is mighty i'll

bestselling author Jamie Brumfield and I'm coming to you with another unboxing from Annie's kit club this one is called Annie's crochet strike Afghan club so I'm super excited to share with you what came in the box doing on boxing and um a first impression review so let's get started [Music] um so we are gonna do we're gonna unbox the Annie's crochet striped Afghan Afghan club and I'm gonna show you what came in the box this is the first box so every month you get a new box or it actually comes in a priority envelope but this is the first one and this is my first impression of this club and what I think of the the pattern so let's get let's get into it so you get what is called seaside sampler Afghan you're gonna do stripes one through three and so this is what the Afghan is gonna look like when you finish it I think it's very pretty the colors are really great when I signed up for this club there were not and there wasn't an option for a color scheme unlike some of the other clubs there was an option for a color scheme this one didn't have a color scheme option it only had this one color scheme so this one color scheme is not in your color pattern or your pattern for your house or that kind of thing it may not be what you want to it may not be the right Club for you at least for now until they get more patterns but I do like the variety of all the stitches I also like the fact that it is a purple I don't know if you could see it through my camera so I'm going to tell you what kind of colors it is it's got like a purple blue color and then they call it because of course you get your colors you get your yarn so it's got like a purple blue blue color it's got a C green color um kind of a purplish blue name color is Harbor Porto port so that is the color it's kind of got a purple blue a sea green color this one is called spa it's called spa and then it's got a cream color those are your three first colors it does have like a brown a tan in there which can tie together the color so I was really happy to see that tan because my houses is white and brown um so it will actually go really nice with my patterns in my house and it is a summery blanket which is kind of nice because it's a summer you know summer pattern so I thought that was pretty cool too so you get your first three colors first three yarn and access video tutorials at Annie's Cape Club so you can actually access the video tutorials this is what the finished Afghan is gonna look like I just wished it up my camera was a little bit more defines you could see it but there's just so many different stitches in this so learn to crochet with this club because you definitely will and I have to wonder if you if you want to create a different color scheme for your blanket you can still get this pattern but the color scheme you can pick you just won't use the yarn that comes with it so that is one option as well skill level is easy for these and these are the stitches you're going to learn for this month for the first month so you got a good variety of stitches there I see that what it looks like to me yeah okay so what it looks like to me yeah those are the three stitches I was just looking here and they broken down here um you could literally try out the club and if you don't necessarily like you know just getting three stitches three Rose stitches is you know every month or however their processes um it gives you three different stitches that you can use on a different you know you could just complete it with that but I do like the whole pattern so it might just stick around just to get the whole pattern because I think it looks really cool and I have to wonder if Annie's online if you can actually buy the pattern I believe the I believe the club is $19 a month I used a coupon to get this so I do not remember off the top of my head I had to keep on that came to my inbox and I use my coupon so I'm not sure the exact price but I'll look it up and put it in the video description below also I when I get coupon codes I put them over in the community shop for you even if they're not something that my because I'm an affiliate of Annie's but even if they're not

binged out and we watched um for new year's eve we watched uh bridgeton am i saying that right it's on um bridgeton on netflix if you have netflix check out that mo um it's a series uh of episodes and um it was interesting it was it's a cute love story um it was good and i'm always up for a good love story sometimes i just need to watch a love story but you know sometimes they be doing too much y'all know what i'm talking about sometimes they be a little bit too sexy and i'm like lord have mercy why do we have to show all this and so i that's when i'll be looking down at my work like okay because i'll be crocheting and watching too so then i'll that's when i find stuff to do yeah let's see um i had a new year's eve live show with a couple of singers oh pacific that uh that started a better trend all right i watched that too oh sen sunita tell me girl what you think about it uh optimistic is my word this year that's what's up maybe i should post something like put something back i know i had nothing up here yet but i'm gonna be working on getting a nicer background so y'all gonna be looking at my gray walls because they are just gray and um i'll probably get my yarny bits hung up back here sooner than later sunita making blue hats honey talk to me what you think about it what did you think about that move uh that series oh and then yesterday me and my husband we finished watching cobra kai because we watched it if let's see after 20 plus years of boring new year's eves this turned the page oh right pacific that's what's up yeah good things came can come out of uh this space right here for sure i'm glad you had a wonderful time and it changed the trajectory of your space i hope i'm saying that right they'll say that right i hope so but you know what i'm saying i think that's great for real let's see i love watching um i like a love story let's see today is the first day of the best of my life you better come on in this room i was gifted a green screen but i'm not sure i will use it yeah i mean i was thinking about getting a green screen but then i thought i'm gonna probably get some extra lights but then back here i'm gonna probably put up some bookshelves that and have all my yarn in the bookshelves and stuff and then then little knickknacks if i got room because i got a lot of yarn that's all i'm saying it was okay it was i thought it was going to be more interesting yeah maybe there will be a part two much sexy time she was so clueless you get too much uh part yeah too much sexy uh yeah that's what i was saying it was a bit sexy for me that's when i say when i say that that's exactly what i mean i'm like really y'all that's what we doing lord have mercy lord lord lord can y'all not show anything lord yeah i feel you though sunita on that i need to be more optimistic this year it's been a rough couple of weeks but you're giving yarn and surprising people with gifts are my favorite things to do so i'll keep looking up yeah honey irene keep looking up mm-hmm one day at a time yeah i did too sunita i did two i was like it's it's that girl it's red girl i know it was pink yeah for sure uh my house and yarn is a hot mess oh consuelo that's all right get you some bookshelves honey and put that yarn in there mm-hmm let's see um they got um i'm gonna go to ikea and probably get some and probably build it up back here and get some more lighting and then then i'll it'll be probably what i want it to be instead of doing a green screen yeah yeah you know it was pinned the whole time yeah girl i was like what me at the end me and my husband like i knew it was that girl i know it was her yeah you should have marky mark paint your wall yeah that would be nice but i'm not gonna put no pain back here i'm gonna put bookshelf i mean yeah it's gonna be bookshelves over here filled with yarny bits that would be nice too but that's what i'm that's what i'm have happy yeah irene but that's a great idea girl that's a great idea my dear i'ma finish this roll and once i get this role done i may be rolling out these streets because i just i'm just in the mood to just watch a good clean wholesome romantic film and the only way i can kind of do that a good clean whole someone and what i mean is that is that it's not a lot of uh sexy parts to it you know i put a wallpaper mirror up in my in a room it's awesome that's nice you have um any picture you like you made into wallpaper you can oh wait you can have any picture you like made into wallpaper yeah yeah you can that is true but yeah so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna put up my um i'm gonna put some cute shelves up here and they're gonna have cute baskets and stuff where i can put my little uh notions and things and hooks so i won't be taking over the whole house with yarn every dad gonna wear y'all if y'all saw my ups i mean i got yarn over there over there i got yarn over here it needs somewhere to go i'm going to go in the basement and grab one of my toes and start putting this yarn in there i need something new to wash too okay i stopped watching outlander because of that too yeah it gets oh so what i have um sunita so what i did i purchased um what's it called family it's the up the up it's up family um i purchased that i think that's what it's called up family uh app i think i paid i wanna say i pay sixty dollars a year for it and it's all family movies it's all family oriented and i also have pure flicks pure flicks i think i paid 49 a year for that or was it 80 not i can't remember but they're all just wholesome so that that might be helpful so look into those two apps um see if you can get those on because i had discontinued uh netflix for a minute i did i shut it off and then when i found out chronicles 2 christmas chronicles 2 was coming out i was like let me go get netflix real quick and watch that and so that's how i ended up with it back because i normally honey child i'll be over it you understand you see i have shelves but every time i use yarn for a project i have to rearrange my stock again yeah yeah absolutely consuelo and that's the whole yep that's the point of it or what you could do you could put a picture in a space if you have an empty space until you ready to make it what you need to be i watch romance movies too not sexy movies on youtube for free oh okay consuelo that's a great idea too yeah that well the well behind you would be a great uh mural place yes i know but i'm not going to do nothing like that right now i'm going to put my i need a place for my yarn and what better way to utilize the space i mean i could put a mirror up here or maybe i'll put one over there um yes they did sunita netflix did go up they need to be ashamed they should not be doing that they know it's like we live in a special time right now and monies can be tight for a lot of people they should look at discounts i'm just saying you want to be about the people for the people and you know keep folks entertained i understand what they doing but yeah no empty chefs well you wouldn't have any empty shelves consuelo because what you would do honey you put a picture if you had an empty shell but you said you don't have any empty shelves at all okay so then you still put your yarny stuff in there that gives you a reason to touch your yarn and see what you got and see what you can come up with what you got yes ma'am me on the other hand i have yarn everywhere so i have to make use of the space i could put a picture up here i could put a mirror right here that'd be fine however i have so much yarn that i need a place to put it and i think it would be nice to put it in a bookshelf that like the box shelves and now put some baskets in there and you know y'all know what i'm saying and let the yarn stand out in in my space back here i'm trying to figure out how what big shelf i'm gonna get back here because i could probably make it go from one end to the next that's how much yarn i got or i might do two what i could do i could do a mirror uh pacific and put it like in the middle and maybe a bookshelf over here and a bookshelf over there and then fill it up like that i could do that as well so there's just so many different options i could do and have a nice big tree plant standing over here somewhere so yeah that'll work too either way it'll work out i'm gonna get it to work out some kind of way y'all yes i appreciate all y'alls wonderful uh comments though about my you know your suggestions for real let's see one two so y'all got any y'all eat already y'all have anything good to eat i got some leftover pizza from when i um have pizza on new year's day and i think i'm gonna eat eat it i'm gonna heat it up and that's what i'm gonna have yes pacific you are correct but the problem is pacific sir i crochet like a uh hey listen i i appreciate you throwing out the idea for for real i really do appreciate you so thank you for that because that i could do that too like i said i could i could put a mirror like i can make a mirror right here and then um in the middle you know like maybe empty like space right here but on the sides have two tall shelves of nothing but yarn have yarnage because you know when you're addicted to yarn this is what happens this is what happens you guys but i'm happy i bought the yarn that i did today because of all of the cool projects that are actually coming up there uh um i got going on so i'm excited to make stuff happen but then i'll be wanting more yarn so and then i'm gonna buy more yarn to give away i'm getting close to 2 000 subscribers so y'all know what i got to do i got to get more yarn to give away i'm going to get some more um i showing y'all for real i like the ice charm that i've been working with for real it's been nice but i'm also going to give it away i'm going to give some more away so i'm going to order some more yes sir yarn over top yes sir it is it is yeah you could make the shelving that what what you say uh irene i

redemption grow so every time I do a grow I make one of these videos and I use this time to talk about to grow you know look back at any mistakes I made or anything that I did really well just so people that are watching the grown trying to learn how I do my grows can you know learn what I would have done differently because if they try and copy exactly what I did you know maybe by watching this video it can help them not make the same mistake as me so this would be the final video for my house wat you know redemption Grove which was in actual is a follow up grow to my first eight thousand watt you dub purple grow the first one of course was fresh air just air exchange and open bulb hugs the second grow which was the redemption grow I sealed up the room through in 60,000 BTUs of AC and release co2 in the room by doing that it allowed me to keep a more consistent temperature the first grow it got really cold and my plants actually went into shock and didn't get very big buds instead they stayed pretty small or rock-hard and were awesome crystal production but I didn't have the yield that's looking for a still an acceptable yield I mean over a pound per light but you know if I want to get a pound for light or grow 600 watt lights not a thousand watt lights so this is the redemption to that and I I think I pulled it off I think I did a great job I haven't done a final weigh up on all the buds yet they've been drying for about seven days and I'm getting ready to put them into jars for the first time normally I like to put my buds into jars a little bit sooner than most people and pull them back out a couple days later and let them dry little bit longer but I've kind of been preoccupied and doing some other things in life so these buds are getting fun in jars right now and this is a more typical stage of drying when they would be put into into jars most people would wait until you know most people when they're putting into jars this would be the time they do it which is you know one or two days later than I would normally do it right now we're looking at just a little little nugge the u-dub purple obviously this stuff hasn't cured yet it hasn't completely dried I mean it's dry but you know we're not going a stem snap yet after they go into jars oh you know for a week or so they'll start snapping and I highly doubt I'm gonna have to pull these out of the jars again I can probably just go straight Nick here rather than having to pull the buds don't let him around a little bit more but overall let's just talk about the grow I had four to four plants in five gallon room acre pots in pure cocoa I was using the coco grow from bow Tanic err yeah that's what it was and really all that is is black gold cocoa in a different bag because when Coco first hit the scenes well when I first got popular enough to where growth stores started carrying it you know not the brick hook up with actual bags I was buying black gold cocoa and you know seven dollars a bag out the door and it caught on after that so obviously it got jacked up in price now and that was like a two cubic foot bag for seven dollars out the door now a lot of companies you know 1.5 cubic foot bag can be like up to $20 or something I know this next round I'm gonna do a third you double grow coming up soon I've got the plants transplanted now but I'll be trying out a new Coco actually house and garden coco which is like I think I paid I got a deal and I think there's a twenty couple dollars per bag which is ridiculously expensive but anyway so I was using the bow Tanic here Coco grow which is literally the same thing as the black gold it's just labeled differently it's in a different color bag different bag altogether distributed by the same company and everything so anyway I'm not too happy with that Koko I thought you know pretty much all koko is the same so I'd get that stuff because I can get you know a bag for 12 bucks you buy it by the pallet you get it for 12 bucks a bag which is a great deal but in my blue dream grow you know at first when i was vegging I thought I had some nutrient lock out but come to think of it I think the cocoa is leaching the nutrients really badly and locking stuff out I don't think it's the fact that I under fed my plants or anything like that I think it just bad cocoa I've had a few grows that that happened to and it pretty much makes you add a week of edge but of course there's been some gross words worked fine so now I'm trying out stuff that's more than double in price on this upcoming grow after this this round here and we'll see if it makes any difference but let's stick to this grow specifically so I venture plants for almost four weeks I think right about four weeks I started flushing these plants right after day 42 you'd are purple finishes really fast I was using all cyclone nutrients and because I was running a sealed room with co2 they even finished even faster so by day 49 I could have harvested I ended up taking them to day 56 though I just kept flushing them let him just keep purpling out so I chopped them all day 56 and well that was about a week ago you know because they've been drying over since then and now I'm gonna read for them in jars but really as far as any fuck-ups and the grow goes I don't think I had any I think it just went off perfectly the plants save water all the time I gave them plenty of nutrients never overfed never burnt them number never under fed everything was just great guys anticipating they'll have a much higher yield than I did the first round this strain doesn't yield very high but I I don't think I'll get 1.5 pounds per light but I think I'll get really close to it so you can see here on this but it's very chrisley stuff and some great purpling to it I have to still go through and do a final trim on all the buds just remove some duck feet and stuff like that but you know the strain just continues to prove how resilient it is never any Herms never you know any instability in the genetics it's just rock hard great strain I mean you can stress it all you want to and you'll never get any Herms I've got this tote filled up here I don't know how big this TARDIS but if you know it's one of those big ones that you store stuff in and I basically just put all the buds into it and I am now going to start drawing them up yeah once you guys like to have this big-ass tote full of you Doug purple I know I would well I do so it's great but you can see just all great buds if you liked this redemption girl which I'm sure you did of course I really liked it then you will be very excited about my upcoming u-dub girl guys it is going to be the most epic grow ever to happen on my channel but stay tuned for that but I'll go ahead and leave you with this now overall I really have no complaints about the grow nothing I would have done differently it's just awesome all the way around okay guys any questions or comments let me know otherwise I'll see you in the next u-dub grove peace", "MabrJt9SJqg": "[Music] you oh my gosh hey you guys how y'all doing can you hear me um let's see good afternoon okay all

on my green let me show you my green real quick i got the big twist green y'all i did oh this yarn is so soft i am not kidding it's the value this is the green that i have so what green represents in this wonderful afghan let's go and get into it says green represents growing in christ when you first accept jesus as lord and savior you are like a baby needing milk and nourishment but as you grow you learn more of him and walk in his ways you grow away from milk and on to meat then it says you grow in strength hebrews verse chapter 6 verse 1 says let us leave the elementary the elementary teachings about christ and go on to maturity are you growing in christ that is a question at the end of that wonderful uh color green so green represents growing in christ and so we're going to go ahead and get into it and let's see what we can do with this pattern lord how many of y'all worked on the um are working on it had just a little challenge with the uh blue the water of baptism blue thank you so much michelle yeah i love that color i just got my first big twist from irene it's not it is very nice listen if i can get some more of this big twist if it's on sale i'm coming i'm getting more this this big twist value and you know i gave uh gave a big twist classic a hard way to go until i started working with that yarn with my tulip hook my brand new tulip hook and honey i had to rescind and retract all of my disdain my disgust my disheartening for the classic of the big twist now y'all know like i said before um sometimes uh the big twist um i mean yarn you never try big twist get the big twist value it is amazing yes denisha loves a big twist and so do i raven i did not mean to step on you honey my dogs be all laying around here y'all want to say hi to raymond because she loves to be in the way come here girl oh my goodness now she need to be cut but i have not done that yet say hello raven say hi to everybody being that you was under my feet you just got to be here huh j hello hola como esta she is a havanese they are the uh cuban cousin to the bijan bijan freight they call it freeze freeze however you say it yeah so this is raven and she was under my feet honey don't don't sit under my feet no more okay i keep trying to tell you you can lay beside me honey you can even lay in front of me but not right by my feet you understand cause you know i got big feet girl okay anyway all right have a seat lay down somewhere behave don't be telling all the neighbors about what we doing up here she was barking a lot a little bit ago cause we got neighbors getting work done and so that happened okay yes my disdain my dislike disheartening honey yeah so it wasn't until denise i got my tulip hook and started working with it i had to retract i have to do a whole video about it's okay to love the big twist classic because i was like no i'm not messing with it but now my heart has changed i have grown in this space so i thank y'all for allowing me to grow in this space as i'm trying to crochet faster you know what i'm saying yeah uh oh raven is gorgeous oh yeah she is uh gizmo's mama teddy is gizmos papa and gizmo is honey is a little firecracker you so happy for me that i'm grown yes thank you so much denise it's because of you all y'all helped me to realize i need more tools in my life and in this space to make it happen so let's go on and get into it so we read about the green is growing in christ i am using a clover hook today this is a h now i am not sponsored by any of the hook companies any uh no brands no yarn none of that i'm just telling you you know sharing with you what i have and what i am going to be working with so yeah so just in case people think oh man she's sponsored by anybody no i'm sponsored by me myself and not okay don't mind me you're not special but really i'm here in in the name of the lord i'm here in the name of the lord y'all yes that's why i'm here okay so let's go on it says so for the crochet this is called growing in christ and they call this sweet pea and it says mama always said eat your peas so you can grow big and strong okay here's a note here it says note once the border row and first row are complete you will continue repeating only the row two instructions okay so that's what we're doing um so also note usually you single crochet or double crochet into the stitch this patterns call for making your stitch in the space between the stitches so you will go under the stitch and into the space that is for growing in christ so let me pull up the pattern so you guys can see what we are going to be doing today happy that your tulip hook is working out better yes with the big twist chunky absolutely absolutely mark are you going live at one eastern or what's your time zone that's a great question mark um if you're still here can you help us know that are you eastern or another time so all right let me show you what i am going to be doing now this is going to be interesting you guys oh i'm going to share my screen with you momentarily i'm just going to make this a little bit bigger so we can see what in the half sandwich i'm doing over here so we're well those who are working on green and some may have already reached this green level but i'm making it bigger so we can see the actual stitch so hopefully you'll be able to see this all right let me share my screen with y'all here okay all right let me see if i can make this bigger listen listen doggies we talked about that today we're not gonna be doing all that major barking for absolutely no reason i mean absolutely all right there it is um can y'all see that okay so that is what the pattern is going to look like this is the crocheted pattern um yeah so i'm going to be using this green to work that out all right so if anybody's in here doing it yeah that's this is beautiful it is pretty so go ahead and get started i am let's see going to start here yes thank you yeah it is isn't it beautiful terry and honey you did that that is beautiful i'm going ahead and it says for us to chain uh loosely chain which i have i'll try to loosely chain we'll see 19 so we're going to chain 19. let's see one two three five seven y'all see how i crochet slow eight nine ten i even crochet um my uh chain slow 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 and 18 19. all right there's my 19. now okay so beginning to let's see so row run so border row says um single crochet in second chain from hook across 18. so it sounds like i have to i'm doing a border row so i'm going to start kelly you go girl trying all these new stitches yeah i'm really praying about what i'm going to do with um i'm thinking about the um when i do become monetized and um i do have a a membership i'm thinking about doing all different kind of stitches in that membership space just kind of showing different things that you can do that are amazing but only through membership it would be kind of like exclusive because i'm not really i don't really do tutorials but i think it would be fun to just do you know new stitches and people can do what they want with them you know what i mean whether people want to make a show or a blanket you know please don't forget to thumbs up oh yes thank you so much patti wheat i appreciate the reminder my dear yeah if you want a thumbs up share out please feel free to do so so all right so the border row is saying that i am going to crochet a single crochet in the second chain from the hook and which i should have 18 stitches at the end of my border row so let me go ahead and do that so in the second chain from the hook i am single crocheting one two [Music] three four come on in here five six i'm telling you oh that's okay no need to apologize angie prescott welcome in how are you doing how are you doing love i'm glad you're here with all of our wonderful family over here so my neighbors are getting some work done so that's why my dogs want to bark every so often they'll hear a noise and

millions of comments and nobody saw you come in the room so yeah all right okay i have single crocheted this all right let me make this smaller we'll just bring her down here for now just in case i need to um get this going on so here's the [Music] yeah my single crochet in green i did it this is the border row so to begin the pattern on the right side okay um what other side would it be i don't know i guess it could be the wrong side so yeah um so we chain three one two and three okay and then we turn our work dc in the same stitch so i'm going to double crochet in the same stitch prayerfully this is going to turn out all right let's see yes and count and you felt weird or like i should run away now yeah or jump out the window like our friend great friend mark marky mark just not [Laughter] my that's funny murky mark just a he marches at the beat of his own drum if he wants to go he skedaddles and yes i guess it is the same it's like oh let me run out of this chat nobody even sees me i said something nobody cares and i want people to feel like and know that people legitimately care and that you know you can say what's up the people in here and we keeping it positive and all the crazy stuff that be going on on the outside in these youtube streets and in the world honey we we want a place where we can come where there is peace and there's joy and there is happiness yes just hanging out making a stormy water head okay using premiere everyday red ma tomorrow that i got at ollie's for 2.99 wow what a deal and i think i will make the stormy water scarf you go right on ahead angie prescott with your rockstar self honey do it do it layla harvey t i didn't even see you come in the room child well welcome in i'm so glad you're here i'm so glad you're here that is a great deal she's a rock star doing that too all right let me get back to this here pattern so i chained three and i deceived in the same stitch then it tells me skip next two stitches okay one and two and it says five double crochet in next next stitch this will be called the five dc group now it says 5dc in next next stitch so okay i'm going to go ahead and five double crochet in this stitch here you yes marcel absolutely you care about people too i do too i i love people i just do i love people and that's all i can say is that i love people and if they okay one two three four five okay so angie what state are you in ollie's is in georgia haven't had yarn in months okay so i did that but then it says next next stitch what does that really mean so y'all know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna pull up this picture so we can see it let me see if i can make this bigger huh i don't know let me try to make it bigger because it looks hmm all right let's see if we can look at this hey we talked about this earlier you guys leave the neighbors alone okay so it says to the i don't know if that's a um typo i can't call it so it wants me to 5dc in next next stitch not the next but the next like to go over like i mean in my mind i would think if it means like the next two stitches i would have thought to double crochet in the first one and then double crochet i mean do a five set one right there and then do another five group or i don't know this is where i'm going to put my face in my my chin in my hand um so i'm thinking it meant next two stitches so i'm going to try it we're going to do that that's what i'm believing that means so we're going to try it y'all we we just gonna try it let's try it okay so the next stitch beside it i'm gonna do five the cluster okay one more my stomach is growling please read it read it again please yeah no problem no no you didn't misunderstood me it is exactly what it said my dear i'll read up how about i read the whole row of what is supposed to be done and and i'll tell you why i made that decision to go ahead and do the next stitch so this is what it says how about i'll let you see it so we can see it together that'll be great huh let's look at it together oh i'm going to shrink this a little and bring the words on over so we can see it as a family now for some reason i want to make sure that this is okay this is it where it says beginning pattern let me pull it over so we can see okay i need to shrink it some more um all right that should be enough yeah yeah okay let's look at this together you guys ladies gentlemen so basically it's saying row one on right side and i'm chaining three which i did then i deceived in the same stitch which i did then it says skip next two chains i did that then 5 dc in next next stitch this will be called the 5dc group then it says skip next two stitches then dc in next two stitches so you see what i'm okay that's what made me think that they meant next two stitches this is called the dc to 2 dc group you see that then it says repeat across to last three stitches then you're gonna skip next two stitches and three dc in last stitch so um so we skip so i'm gonna at the skip next two stitch the two chains five dc so i'm thinking they meant five dc in next two stitches that's what i'm believing they meant okay so that's how i'm treating this right now so that's what i did so i'll show you i'll just remove that real quick so that's what i did okay um hey cameron greg you did i told you last night you just don't remember uh huh yeah you see what i mean now yeah yeah yeah you did bro i i was like i said i'm going live at 12 30 and at six so you know but you was up here lord that's why i think you but you might not have heard me you could have been eat i know you wasn't eating uh cake and ice cream like you'd like to do [Laughter] you was busy so it's i can see how it could easily get away from you but i definitely made it known so for sure but it's okay you here now so it don't matter it don't matter cameron what's up bro it don't matter so i'm going to skip the next two stitches and i'm going to dc in the next two stitches it didn't say uh do two it just said in the next two stitches i'm going to put a dc i'm not combining two i'm just going to do a dc and one and a dc in another stitch and so i'm skipping two stitches one two and i'm going to dc in this stitch and i'm going to dc in the next stitch and that is what is going to be called the dc the two dc group so that's a 2dc group all right we did that then it says repeat from across repeat from the asterisk and i'm going to go across to the last three stitches okay so now i'm gonna do looks like i need to skip two one two and dc 5 dc in the 1 and 5 dc in the next stitch if that makes sense i hope that makes sense to y'all so let me do that what's up raven she's over here she always loves to sit in this chair next to me or lay down in a chair next to me because i think being close to the window she she can protect me i was probably in cro a crochet fog that's okay yeah you was busy bro we was all busy doing stuff last night huh i was trying to crochet keep up with the chat and checking in on y'all seeing what y'all doing it's always fun though i i enjoy being with you guys for sure i enjoy it it's always fun y'all are fun one two three four and five then it says to skip next two stitches and then one two and then we're going to dc one two and the next two i don't know why this is being so my dc [Music] one and two now this is where i'm getting ready to get confused because i'm gonna tell you why it's telling me across two last three stitches now the problem i have with that is that i don't have three stitches left i have one i loosely chained 19. i did the instructions actually oh thanks hun i did it exactly like it told me to i'm at the end and it says in the last three stitches skip next two and three dc across oh wait across to last three stitches see i don't have last three i just have one left unless they're meaning across to last three stitches skip next two and three dc in the last stitch okay so i don't have that you guys i don't so am i off did i miss something i'm pretty sure i count it now i this this is the best part i'm at the beginning so i can frog frog frog to my heart's content i am going to frog it again and i'm going to do it all over again you guys well i'll i'll frog to the to the uh single crochet so i can go ahead the border okay because i want to see what's going on let me see if i can see what's going on from the border because i'm gonna get it's gonna get right we're gonna get right i'll take time to make sure it gets right that's one thing about me i will spend the time i tripping where i got to go except for work in about 20 minutes but other than that y'all know what i'm saying good gracious so we're gonna make sure that we have maybe you need to put two double crochet in one stitch instead of the one double crochet into no that's not what it's calling for i would do it if it wasn't part of the pattern i would do it if it wasn't part of the pattern um i don't know i said but you know what patterns can be tricky and there could be mistakes and patterns or uh a lot of um it could be some stuff left out right so i agree with you right there so you write kim's crochet honey hello julie at crochet and create by grandma j bug in his house she's in the house so you write kim's so what you're saying is maybe you need to put two double crochets in one stitch oh i see what you're saying instead of one double crochet and two stitches in in two stitches yeah but that's the thing but i see what you're saying let's try it hey nothing beats a failure but a try huh so let's let's try it let's try it okay i just took everything out i can start it again i'm putting this last stitch i'm going to count to make sure we have 18 because that could be you know we can see that there you know there are errors sometimes in patterns so or um missteps or whatnot right so let's make sure we have 18. let's do that first one two three four five six seven eight 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 and 18. so this would be the 18 stitches so like you said we're gonna we're gonna do kim's way today we and that makes sense to me now now that i think about it kim's crochet and knits that makes sense because i'm thinking a two group would be uh it would be a um cluster and if that is right i'm going to make that mark i'm going to mark it up in this here book and then i'm going to reach out to the author and see if we can get um an updated pattern also with with the um the pattern the pdf copy that we can update that see if you wouldn't mind updating that for the community at large huh one two three we're going to do that we're going to turn it and then we're going to dc because see to dc and same since you cam you listen honey i think you own something love you are then we go we skip um next to uh one two and then we go into this one and we're gonna make five we're going to do crochet five double crochets in this stitch one two three four and one more is five then in the next stitch we're going to do the same thing um two three four god rocks how you doing love and five it is a pleasure to see that you have come in the room as well all right so we got this is the do-over and so we're going to go in the next two stitches i mean next skip the next two stitches and we're going to dc in the next two stitches this is called the um dc group so we'll skip one two and in that stitch we will put we'll put two dc's in that we're going to see if this is going to work for us because it makes sense am i increasing then i i don't know what i'm doing right now i don't think so and it's not increasing i don't think i think we're just trying to fix something that was a little bit wonky to me and hopefully this will uh show what we got going on hi teddy bro i'm crocheting um he wants to say hi sorry okay you can say hello say hi to all the wonderful folks that you wanted to jump up here you just had to be here it's like yes say hello say hi everyone this is teddy everyone he's like i'm here now okay i'm i was working bro you just kind of came up here you think he look at his face he doesn't even care he's like ah anyway all right buddy say i'll see you later say it's been real people say all right all right teddy you greeted everyone you got to see you saw you came you've conquered say i'll see you later i'm gonna sit right here can you sit down for me okay buddy yeah right there yeah go ahead and stay right there there you go all right let me get back to business all right that was teddy is that what i'm doing i'll be increasing by two stitches which she needs at the end because she only ended with one stitch and she needs to end with three that's right you're right that is right so i did that so now that i did those two i am now going to he is a handsome boy he is he know it too he's like i i'm adorable i don't know what but he doesn't like looking at himself in the mirror he sees himself in the mirror he turns like this i'm like teddy look at yourself he's like no because i think he thinks he's human so he doesn't want to see himself as a dog he's like i am a i'm i'm a man not a man dog he thinks he's a dude but he he's a he teddy okay never mind that's my dog yeah raven loves to look at herself in the mirror teddy's not so much he's like or he might have thought he was bigger than what he actually is so raven is bigger than him so he thinks he's a big dog so he's like oh he's so disappointed like why you're so cute don't be disappointed okay let me go ahead and move it on this was the dc group now i'm gonna repeat across to the last three stitches so i'm gonna go back i'm gonna skip two one two and i am going to do five double crochets in the next two stitches so um hey he's the same as raven he's just a smaller one he is a havanese as well patty all my dogs are having these so hello janice uh eufer did i say that right uh did i say that right i don't know i'll be jacking up names child just forgive me hi janice how you doing love i'm glad you're here i'm glad you are here i'll be back on again today at six if anybody wants to come and hang out and um crochet this wonderful piece with me so that's one two three four

i'm so sorry my brain my husband he's like yo listen i'll be listening some stuff just just gets by me it it does it gets it just meandering it meanders on out of here where it goes i have no idea

there they are you right girl you was right and then it says to three dc in the last stitch so i'm going to skip these two and in the last stitch three times yay yes girl one two and three i'm gonna

talking janice so uh row one so um we skip two so instead of use dc in two dc in next stitch that's what it should say so instead of okay i will type it let's see if i can make it make sense so row one instead of dc replace with two b c in stitch and that would be to be dc oh this is the vc he's here okay okay replace with yeah there it is i hope that makes sense does it instead of dc in next

with me so god bless you may have a smile upon you today wednesday six o'clock eastern standard time i will be here all right see y'all later bye fam you", "3hq9B80KMMI": "good afternoon friends I'm gonna show you a new tutorial this one is on how to make a zig zag Afghan so first you want to start off with a loop that you always have to do when you're going to do any type of crocheting that don't involve or doesn't involve towels so you want to make a loop and then you put it on your on your needle while this needle is a boy size F USA so it is a bo ye boy needle size F it's my favorite needle I use it for everything so to start off with your Afghan you just want to start off with a chain so you just kind of go in you wrap it grab it pull it through I always pull it through like pointing down because it goes through the loops better grab it pull through grab it pull through and you just want to do a chain of em I don't know as long as your couch or maybe a little longer however long you prefer but if you're going to do a zigzag you definitely want to make it longer than your intentions the reason why is because the zigzag will draw up it will because of the zigzag it might draw up about four to five inches depending on how long you're making your Afghan but right now I'm just going to show you how to make a zigzag Afghan just the zigzag part the ends of it you'll just when you get to the end you'll want to do that loop at the end and then go in like into the second hole I guess and just do that every time because if you like I said before when I was making them towels you want to keep that consistency with that loop at the end and then going into the second hole and that'll keep your Afghan or your towels or whatever you're making the same size you don't want there to be inconsistencies all right so right now I'm just making my loops my chain is what it's called actually all right so I'm gonna stop about right there and I've got about almost a flick I might go up a couple more I want to make it right out of foot might be a little longer than a foot which is fine okay so I've got about a foot all right so what I want to do is to get started you're going to do you're going to take a seven so you're gonna you're gonna do seven double crochets so I'm here I am at the end I'm gonna go into the second one there so I've wrapped my yarn now I'm going into the second loop pull through now I have I I have three on the tree so I'm going to grab grab the thread go backwards upside down I mean drop two off grab the thread drop two more off that's my first one now I'm doing my second one this is to go into that hole grab the thread drop the two off drop two off that's two now I'm on number three and this is purple yarn just I just wanted to get something quick so I could show you how to do a zigzag blanket so this is number three drop two off drop two off excuse me so I'm on three here's number four grab your thread go through grab the thread through drop two off jump to us that's four there's number five that's really talked too long drop to us is number six go through grab the thread drop two off up to off and here's number and make sure number seven right here go through grab the thread pull it through turn it go up to go up to okay now I've done my seven so what I want to do is this eight hole I'm going to put three double crochets right in that hole and that will give it the lift that makes it go into the first M okay they'll give it the lift so we're doing we're going to go three double crochets in that one crochet and that one the one okay here's my second one - and my third one three but remember these take away from your your length because if they pull it up that causes it to lift so with that said it's going to take some of your length away so if you're going to make a very long Afghan make sure you add another maybe another foot on to it just because of the lift that's going to take alright so there's my three in the hole now I'm going to go down to the next one I'm gonna do seven again here's my first one one second one two my third one three four five six so men all right stop there if you see that you've made that all right so what I'm gonna do next is drop I'm gonna skip two loops because this causes the this is the valley so this is the mountain and this is the valley it's a zigzag so you have to skip those two you're gonna go right into the third one and you're going to do seven up one to to we oh it gets easier when you go to the next round five six seven okay so you've got a mountain in the valley there's a mountain there's a rally the next one is going to be a mountain so you're going to do three double crochets in this top hole right here one two and one more three so there it is now we're going to do seven coming back down here again three Oh five six and seven okay so where do we do here so far we've done a mountain and a valley mounted now we're going to do our next Valley you're skipping two loops going right into the third one and you're going to do seven up again three sighs six there's six and seven okay the next one is three in the hole and the reason why is you're making your mouth here this is your Mountain so the zig goes up one two three now you want to go seven down here we go one it's very time-consuming to disease five six and seven okay with this one I had already done so that was a mountain the next one is going to be skipped too so I skipped to going to the third one one hmm three mmm or and I don't have enough to do another one I might just do one more in there wait I have five five mm-hmm so let's look at it we've got a valley a mountain a valley a mountain so it does like to curl up a little bit but if you notice that's the start of your zigzag so what I like to do like it again just put one loop in the end just to sustain it now if you want to change colors I'm gonna go with a yellow so I'm going to I'm going to cut this off here pull that out I could just tie this on here I mean you could do it however you want like you could just start crocheting it on there this way I'm just gonna tie this guy on and at the end you could put excuse me fringe on there to allow for so okay here we go with the first one I'm probably going to have to just do just a chain up just to get it started so there's my one two three four and then I have to skip to for some reason I didn't get my five but that's okay so I'm going to skip to because that's where my Valley is and go right into the third one one two three four five six seven and if you notice you went right into the first one of the three that are there so now you're ready to do three and in that next loop ready and one two three now we're ready to go down on the mountain one two Oh [Music] five six seven then I stopped there skip to going to the third one one two three five six seven I'm at the top of the mountain I do three and a hole there one two three it seems hard at first but you can do it because those crochet loops will eventually they'll open up for you as you're working there's one two three six seven now I'm at the bottom of the mountain I skipped to going to the third one one dang it third one one two three four five six seven and then three and add one two three and then back down seven down the mountain one two we [Music] or five [Music] six seven and then one loop and then I cut it so there is the start to your zigzag let's look at it this way looks pretty good so let's put another color we're gonna try a how about a white this time let's do a white on there so I'm just gonna tie it on again I'm just this is the part that always is a little bit intimidating is like I'm not always sure how I want to do those ends sometimes I tie them on sometimes I don't so we're gonna try this out here I do chain three that's gonna be my first loop when I start one two three four for five six and seven this one did not come out right I'll show you why do you notice I'm not in this one right here that's makes the three it's the third one of the three that means I have to do one more loop there because if I don't this will draw it'll draw up and draw in so I need another loop there so with this one I'm going to put an eighth one so when you notice that it's not in the third loop that's okay so here's your one two three the three that go in that hole there make sure you your last loop going up is in that third hole I don't understand why but that's it works out best that way so now you're ready to do your three in the middle one ready one two three I'm going to take you all the way down to the end and I'm going to stop and that'll be the end of my tutorial but I just wanted to show you that just make sure you're always going in that you're three go in that third the middle hole of this so here we go one two just one moment two three four five six seven now we're going to skip to and there they are one two there perfect do you see how they're they're lined up right there in the center with the others that we've skipped you always want it to be that way when you get to that part so you just skip those two there's your one two three four five six seven let's check it out we're in the right one going three in this one now one two three now go down going down the mountain on two three that one didn't do right for me three [Music] four five six it's best to keep your count seven because that way you'll that way like if you're watching TV or something you're not going to get your counts off looky there we did it again perfect skip those two go into the third one one two three four five six seven and let's check and make sure we got into the third RAM the third yes it is it's perfect there's one two three so we're going to into that middle one with our three double crochets one two three now you're going to go down the mountain again one [Music] three five six seven skip to there they are one two degree kind of idea forth for I'm gonna do a 51:5 okay so there we go let's take a peek at it all right and I'm gonna stop there and I'll let you guys you know kind of try to figure out how you want to do those ends because they are just not doing right for me so there we go there's the mountain the valley the mountain the value hold it this way does that not look wonderful and you'll notice if you ever miss a stitch or something because it won't look right but if you figure out a better way to do the ends please let me know because like I said my ends are just not coming out the way I've I want them to I've never been very good with those wins but here we go that's a zigzag Afghan alright have a wonderful day", "MiJhTsAShdk": "[Music] although my little yarn Avars fiber spider back again with another tutorial although somewhat different tutorials in my usual for you today now this is actually going to be a crochet along and this is the first of many videos that I hope to do on this we shall see what happens now I had done a video some months ago called the kaleidoscope granny square blanket and it has received an enormous response and I'm so delighted and a lot of you have made sense of it and some of you haven't and I keep getting questions about what to do and I want to be clear you know I I want clarity I want to explain and I don't like having any loose ends so with that in mind we are going to do a step-by-step process throughout the whole blanket as it were and we're going to start from the very very beginning and we're going to keep going until you know either you know the blankets done or you get it and you know really whatever I just I want to be thorough and I thought it would be a fun series to do you know so without further ado let's get into your materials so obviously you're going to need a crochet hook and this is worsted weight yarn so I'm using a size I crochet hook and I went crazy today getting red heart Super Saver yarn and the last one that I did for the tutorial that I had done I thought it was about twelve skeins it was six different colors and it was two skeins each so I followed suit with this one and actually the only difference is that with the off light here the Aran that I had gotten it was a jumbo and it was actually just a little bit more yardage than if I bought two smaller skins so that worked out so I bought as you can see Erin was also great about using the super savers if you run out you can always get more without having to worry about dye Lots so can't stress that enough right so I bought Erin and I got Jade and dark orchid right over here and I got gold back here and karat back here and charcoal and you can use whatever colors you like and I want it to be a little bit more colorful with this one than the last one last one was more earth tones and autumnal but I want it to be a little bit more vibrant and aside from the basis of how to do the blanket I don't have a color scheme in mind as far as the pattern so we're going to see what happens all right so like I said about twelve skeins worth of yarn you know you can do however many or however few colors you want but if you want to follow along hey let's do it okay so grab your your coffee your hook your yarn of course also you'll need a trusty pair of schizos naturally and let's get into it shall we alright so to begin with we're going to do our granny square now if you already know how to do granny squares by all means you can skip ahead but I'm doing from the very beginning okay so start with a slipknot and then chain 4 1 2 3 4 and then slip stitch into the first chain to create a ring flip the tail over we have a ring already and then we are going to chain up three one two three and then we're going to do two double crochets within that center ring we're going to work over this Center tail as well while we do it so going into this center here to the double crochet and this chaining of the three is going to count as our first double crochet and see I'm catching the yarn back here as I do my stitches makes it a little bit easier in the long run let me tell you because the fewer ends to sew in later be easier so we have three double crochets then we chain two and then going into the center ring again we do three double crochets three chain two so we've got two sides of our center square down and then three more double crochets let me tell you this project is pretty much all about double crochets wait lots of chains lots of double crochets so we've got three sets of three double crochets chain two and then in the center three more double crochets okay and then to finish chain two and then slip stitch into this third chain up here to finish round one and there we are all right so then for round two I'm going to keep with this same yarn so I'm going to get into this corner over here makes it a little bit easier so I'm going to slip stitch into this next double crochet I'm going to slip stitch into there slip stitch into the next one and then slip stitch into this space here and then chain up of three one two three two more double crochets one and two all right and then we're going to finish this corner when we come around and out you'll see what I mean so what we're going to do it now is we have to cross over this top section here so to cross the bridge we chain one and then we do three double crochets into this corner so that's one two and three chain two and then three more double crochets into this corner space here it's one two and three chain one to cross the bridge over here three double crochets into that corner so that's one two and three chain two another set of three into that same space one two and three chain one two across the bridge as it were three double crochets into that corner space chain two and then another set of three into that same corner and three okay chain one and into this corner space three double crochets you all right and then chain two and then slip stitch into this top chain like so and so we now have two rounds of our first square or our center square and so what you're going to do now is going to cut your yarn and pull out your end and we're going to start in our next round already alright so we have the first two rounds of our square I sewed in my ends like a diligent little spider and so next color I'm going to use the charcoal and so what we're going to want to do is I'm going to start in the corner and we pull up a loop like so and then we chain up three one two three and our tail end up that right down there I'm going to do two more double crochets catching the tail of our yarn back there - and then three technically speaking because that chain three counts is our first double crochet and then we chain to because we're in the corner and then still crocheting over that tail two three more double crochets like so and then we chain one and well we're chaining one because we have to cross over the bridge here if you recall and then into this next chain one space we're doing three double crochets and then another chain one and then into the corner space two sets of three double crochets so I've got one set of three chain two and then another set of three double crochets okay so we have this corner finished get some more yarn going on here logic hmm all right and then we chain one going into that next chain one space with a cluster of three double crochets come on chain one go into the corner do two clusters of three double crochets check separated by a chain two space so that's one cluster of three chain two and then three more double crochets okay chain one because we're crossing the bridge into that space we do three double crochets chain one so you can see I mean I know that the colors bit dark but I do hope that you can see this alright you know we will get into the fun colors soon enough don't you worry about that so I change one and then into this corner two sets of three that's two and three double crochets chain two yes it's always two in the corners and then one along the sides when making granny squares at least that is how I personally learned how to do it and there are of course a million variations of granny squares out there and everybody is right because that's how they learned right and this is just how I learned and it's stuck with me through the years and if any of you have a different method by all means a more power to you know I say that whatever works for you do it you know and that's what makes this craft great because we're all in it together we're all individuals and we all bring something to the table so there's a lot of repetition in this pattern as you can see already so we have our two clusters here separated by a chain two chain one space three double crochets we're almost done with this round chain one space and then we need to connect this over so into the top chain which is right here we do a slip stitch if I can get into it there we go hey and be sure to get both loops on your hook there alright that's our third round done and then again going to slip stitch into that double crochet like so slip stitch into the next one like so and then slip stitch into that chain two space like so alright grab some more yarn okay whoo okay so chaining up of three one two three now when I did my last round my last with it with the white what I did was I did only one set of three and then I connected it another way that you can do it actually is after you chain three is to the rest of your cluster here like so and then do your next cluster by chaining two and then three more double crochets like this you know either way does work you know see so this corn is finished so then when I'm over here and I'm doing my cluster of three in this space here it's just a matter of chaining one and connecting so either way does work chaining one and then doing into the space a cluster of three oops come on get all tangled up here so it's two three chain one three double crochets into the next chain one space okay chain one we reached reached another corner so that's two sets of three double crochets separated by a chain two space chain two and then three double crochets chain one because we finished our corner so we're crossing over the bridge once n so it's got three more doubles chain one three double crochets into the chain one space chain one into that corner do our two clusters of three chain two and another cluster into this corner all right chain one go into the next chain one space with a double crochet cluster of three chain one another cluster gets more yarn chain one finish up our corner here well start and then finish so it's two clusters of three chain two to our second cluster chain one do another cluster into the chain one space chain 1 and do our last cluster of this round and of course I get a knot naturally dear got it ok sorry about that so that was one double and then two doubles and then three doubles chain one and then because we did our two clusters in the corner like I said chaining of one and then do a slip stitch into this top stitch right there and slit and there you are so we've done two rounds of the white and two rounds of the gray and you know what I think we're going to leave it at that because the fun stuff is really going to start now mm-hmm yes all right and you shall see be back in a flash alrighty so we have our first four rounds done and time to add some color finally mm-hmm love color you know me alright so we're going to start again in the eight corner by pulling up our yarn and this time yes I'm using carrot pulling up our yarn and then chaining of a three one two and three two more double crochets into that same space crocheting over our tail as we go and I do so in my ends yeah I do there are ways of crocheting over your ends and working them in as you go and there are videos for that me personally I like the old fashioned way of just sewing then figure it's my way of earning my Purple Heart all right so we're doing our two clusters in the corner separated by a chain two space come on don't be difficult I'm the one who's difficult around here hmm there we go there we are so we've got our two clusters in the corner and our tail has been crocheted over now granted you know it's pretty secure but I would not recommend cutting it off right there you know our end that's why I always sew them in further so that being said let me grab similar yarn and we will do our next couple of rows so it's a chain one and a cluster into the next chain one space two and three chain one cluster into the next chain one cluster into the next chain one and then two clusters in the corner it's one cluster chain too and then for our second cluster chain one another cluster going on here like so chain one another cluster of three chain one cluster of three chain one two clusters in the corner here chain two and another cluster because this is the corner all right chain one another cluster into the next chain-1 space needs more you learn story of my life okay finish this cluster chain one do another cluster okay chain one another cluster check one in the corner it's two clusters and of course yes I know this is the exact same thing that we've been chewing for a number of rounds but as this is a crochet along you can follow with me if you care to skip ahead you can and I will not take it personally because I know that everybody is on a different level and I respect that but we all have to learn how to crawl before we can walk let alone run so for those of you that wish to follow along at this perhaps arduous pace you're very welcome to the party all right so then we need just one more cluster right in here all right and that is going to finish up our round chain one and then slip stitch into that top chain there like so all right and then as we've done before we're going to slip stitch into those next two double crochets and into that chain to space slip stitch and then we're going to start our next row and before I keep going I'm going to adjust my camera because my piece is getting a little big and unruly for me already mm-hmm all right so they're with me a moment I'll be right back all right so I've adjusted my camera thank you for being patient all right so now going to start our next round by chaining up a three one two three two more double crochets to finish the cluster chain two you and do this cluster all right so we've got our two clusters in the corner and let's work our way along the edge always with a chain one and three double crochets into each chain space and after this round we will commence with the kaleidoscopic effects I believe let me see oh six rounds yes one two three four five and six yes so this will be the last of our rounds for the initial square now I'm more than sure more than short that you can do a different number of rounds for your initial granny square the only thing that I am sure of is that you need an even number of rows because you need the correct number of spaces alongside row because this is in essence one of our finished rows right well we need a center square a center hole excuse me see here is the exact center we've got a hole here a hole here and we have a hole right here and that comes about by having an even number of rows so you could make your initial square smaller or bigger but because on my initial tutorial I did six rounds and on my initial blanket I did six rounds that's what I'm doing right now I'm being consistent so I did my chain to three more double crochets into this corner space so if you saw that initial video on the Kaleidoscope granny and you wish to follow that video go right ahead but I do wish for this video to make sense in comparison to that video so that's why I'm doing six rounds for this blanket as well you know the initial square that is come on why is this one being tricky besides I like having you guys here with me through the whole process because sometimes we just need a little company here we are it's nice having you guys with me because even though I can't hear what you're saying whether you're grumbling or saying yep I hear what you're saying or whatever you know even though you're not able to speak to me right now your comments speak volumes and I love hearing from you guys I really do brightens my day and it gives me something to think about and so we're at the corner so we're doing another cluster of three into that same corner I love hearing from you guys there we are so we're just going to work our way along the other side here by chaining one cluster of three chaining one cluster of three etc yeah and I must say that the overwhelming majority of you who have commented on my videos and on my channel and so forth you've been so wonderful very inspirational and really motivational you know definitely keeps me going to keep making videos and I love trying to answer your questions as best I can sometimes it's not easy because sometimes you know I do a video and then months and months later I get a question and I'm like I did that video a long time ago and I kind of forget what it was that I did and then I actually look over my video footage and I realized oh this is where you are having a problem well I don't have a steel trap for memory but I do the best I can so we're in that corner so we're doing another chaining of two and our second cluster alright and I ultimately I just really am trying my best you know and I do understand the expression you know you can make some people happy but you can't make everybody happy I understand that I respect that my trouble is I want to make everybody happy it's in my nature and well one thing to be generous and caring and empathic it's another thing to drive yourself crazy trying to make everybody happy by yourself but that's just how I am alright and we're almost done with this row oh it's so fabulous just one more cluster and the chain 1 and a slip stitch and then this row will be done well round it's not a routes around alright so let me slip stitch into here so and but uh all right so we have a total of six rounds all completed and I'm just going to sew in my ends again and then we shall start in with the fun stuff all right alrighty so now we're going to get into the fun stuff so like I said we're going to need to work into the center hole so that you know where you're at so here is our actual Center so we've got a hole and then we have another hole and then we have another hole so this is our center hole now we're not going to be actually working into that center hole from the start no actually we're going to go three stitches to the right so we've got our first second and third it's the third double crochet or if we're going from right to left it's the first so it's this one right here so insert your hook into the top see other our middle hole that's the top of the stitch there okay now I'm picking out the gold color and so we're going to draw up a loop like so okay and then we chain one and then into that same stitch we're going to do a single crochet stitch and that is going to lock our stitches okay so then into this Center stitch we're going to do our clusters and because we're building out our side in this way this is actually a corner so we're going to do three double crochets chain two three double crochets into this center hole that's one and two and as I get there three and then we chain to one tool and then into that same space we do three more double crochets more yard it runs out so fast don't you go all right and three all right so that is the beginning of our corner so then what you're going to need to do is chain one like so and then we need to skip some stitches and going to the third yet again so this double crochet counts as our first second and third so into this third stitch right here alright we are going to do a slip stitch right into that stitch with a slip stitch like so and so underneath here we have a bit of a space and underneath here we have another space right there we're going to need those in the future I don't think for this round but we will need them alright so then chain two one tool okay and then we go into the third stitch again now this chain stitch counts as a stitch so that's one two and three so it's the middle stitch here that we're going into it's always in threes so into that middle stitch right there we're going to do a single crochet and turn our work do not do a chain right now so it's just the single crochet into that third stitch there then we turn our work okay and then into this space right here we're going to do two more double crochets right in there see I told you that we would need those spaces so we have a total of three double crochets so to speak right in here and then we chain one because we are crossing the bridge just as before and into this corner we're going to treat it like any other corner by doing three double crochets chain two and three more double crochets okay chain one and then into this space here that we created we are going to do three more double crochets right into here so that's one two and three okay then let's more yarn here okay so we get those and then we chain one again and then into the third stitch once more so again that chain stitch counts as a stitch so that's one two and three so again it's the middle of the double crochet stitches this one right here we are going to do a slip stitch like so and then we pull it up and we cut our yarn and we shall get started in on the next color alright so that is the end of our little triangle there and that's just two rows and then the next two rows is going to be our next color and that is going to be the first of our triangles alright alright so I grabbed my next color of yarn a purple and like we did before we're going to skip over to the third stitch so this Center one here is where we left off so it is one two because the chain stitch counts as a stitch and then into the third stitch right there okay we're going to grab our yarn and pull up a loop like so chain 1 and single crochet into that same stitch to anchor it okay then into this space that we have here we're going to do our cluster and so we're going to make sure that this is fairly taught this yellow one here and do our three double crochets and I'm working over that yellow yarn underneath these purple stitches here all right see so we're bridging gaps here and then we chain one and then go into the next chain one space with a cluster of three excuse me chain one and then to the corner we do our typical two clusters so it's three double crochets chain two and three double crochets chain one and then into this space we do another cluster chain one and then again into this space down here in between we're going to do another cluster okay now we go grab some more yarn to the nature of the beast alright and then we chain one okay and then as you can see where the yellow yarn is right there that's where we left off so that's one to being the chain space third okay into that stitch right there okay and we're going to slip stitch that stitch right there okay and now because we have reached our corner here because when we reach the when we reach the the corner right here where it's this stitch right here into the last of the clusters of the side of our square we can't go any further and you will see why if you follow along that right you know what we're going to need to do actually is we're going to need to chain up three one two three because this is going to be joined this this side over here it's going to be joined to this side which hasn't been made yet over on this side so we're chaining up of three okay and then we turn our work and then into this space here we do two more double crochets like so and then we continue along this side just as we have by chaining one three double crochets into the next chain one space chain one three double crochets into the next chain one space chain one and then this is the corner so we do two clusters so I've got one cluster here chain two and then our second cluster like so chain one go into the next chain-1 space with another cluster chain one go into the next chain one and then we're almost done here we need to go into this space here with another cluster okay now we have reached the end of the road now what we're going to do actually is we are going to chain one okay which you could either chain one now or later but I like to chain one and then I'm going to cut my yarn okay now I know this is going to sound a little weird but trust me on this one okay so I change my stitch there and of course can always fix it later and that's of course the beauty of crocheting so did that now I'm going to cut the yarn like so and actually so that it doesn't come undone I'm just going to pull it through but do not pull it tight otherwise you're going to be in for a headache later so that actually is the end of one of the sides actually looks much better if I put it right side facing okay so then what we're going to do is we're going to do the next three sides in the same exact fashion all right we'll get to it alright so for the next of the sides it's going to be really the exact same thing so again finding our Center space which is right here we go over three go into that third stitch and we're going to pull up a loop chain 1 and do a single crochet within that same stitch like so and then into the center here we do three double crochets one two and three chain two three more double crochets to that same space like that chain one and then go into the third stitch down here so that's one two and three right into here like so okay and that will be joined with a slip stitch like so and then we chain two and then into the third stitch that chain always counts as a stitch so that's one two and three so that's the middle stitch there like so okay so we're doing a single crochet because this is going to be the first double crochet so doing that single crochet stitch we turn our work and then do two more double crochets into this space here just like to make that a little bit tighter there we go all right so that's two double crochets making a total of three chain one two clusters into this corner space here chain to do another cluster chain one and then into this space down here we do another cluster like so chain one and then into the third stitch that's one two and three into the middle one here we do a slip stitch like so cut the yarn pull out and there we go all right and then back to the purple yarn so doing that going into the third stitch one two and three so it's the first one right there sing one two is the chain and then third is right there so we pull up our yard and we chain 1 and a single crochet into that same stitch to lock it in ok and again we pull the tail just a little bit and we're going to be working over it as we do our three double crochets into this space that we created down here so that's three double crochets right in there chain one three double crochets into the next chain one space like so and then into the corner we do two clusters separated by two chains okay and let me just grab some more yard okay all right let me finish up this cluster here okay and then we chain one go into the next chain one space with a cluster like so chain one and then going into this space down here we do our last cluster of this row like so and then we chain one and then again we're skipping over three so that's one two and three going into the top of this double crochet right in here like so did I get that I'm going to there we are and we do a slip stitch into there and then we chain up three because we have reached the end of the road so it's one blue hello two three okay we turn our works and then into the space down here we do two more double crochets and to chain one cluster into this chain space right here chain one another cluster chain one two clusters into the corner alright chain two because we're in the corner here and then three more double crochets chain one another cluster into the next chain one space chain one another cluster into the next chain one space like so chain one and then down here we're doing our last cluster all right now we have a joining opportunity right here okay so you know the reason why I did this triangle first and then went to the left and did this triangle is because now I can show you how to join up your triangles all right so this is the one that I was just working on okay so then you chain one and then you go across to your pre-existing triangle and into the top of that chain three that we did we do a slip stitch like so and this edge is almost done not quite almost it'll be done once all four of our corners are done and then we can do a round of clusters around the whole thing because we need to connect this across here to the one underneath here and personally I find that it works much better if we do it in one fell swoop on the next round across the whole thing and you'll see what I mean let's go ready sooo since our two triangles are now connected I'm going to cut the yarn and pull my loop through like so and we shall continue on with our next triangle alright alright so we've done two of our sides there so now we're going to do the next one going counterclockwise to the left just as we did before repetition makes the process a lot easier alright so again going into the third space from the center hole there so that's right over here like so because it's the third double crochet to the right of that center hole we draw up a loop give ourselves enough tail there all right chain 1 and a single crochet into that same space and then going across into the center chain space we do three double crochets two and three chain two three more double crochets like so chaining a1 and then into the third stitch one two three so it's the double crochet right here we do a slip stitch then we chain 2 because we need to do another row of the yellow just untangle my yarn here sorry bit of a mess just like me all right so I chain two and then going into the third stitch so the chain space is one two three so it's into the middle like so we do a single crochet then we turn the work and into this bottom space here we do two more double crochets one and two then we chain one into this corner space we do two clusters separated by two chains sir chains and another cluster like so chain one and then underneath here we're going to do our final cluster of three double crochets two and three okay then we chain one and then going into the third stitch so this one obviously is when I left off at so the chain is one two and three so into the middle there we do a slip stitch and then we cut our yarn hello then pull out the loop put your needle out of the way sorry alright okay and then we go back to our purple yarn let me get my yellow out of the way here okay back to the purple yarn s now of course what you can do naturally is in this instance you know I could have done all of the yellows first and then do all of the purples at the same time but I am going about it this way just just because because I said so alright so then into the third stitch so not this one because that's one that we just did so that's one two and three so it's the first of the three double crochets on this side here we insert the hook and we grab our purple yarn and we pull up a loop do a chain 1 and a single crochet into that same stitch to anchor it do I have enough of the tail yes I do okay alright and then into this space down here we're going to do our first cluster and as always make sure it's fairly taut and we're going to crochet over it with three double crochets in the purple it's one two and three tighten up my purple into there a bit okay chain one and work our way along with our clusters in the chain one spaces okay and since we're in the corner we chain two and do another cluster into that same space all right and then we work our way down the other side like so and then into this space down here we do the last cluster of this row like so chain 1 all right and then we skip along 3 so that's where we left off so 1 2 & 3 so that's in tallit first of that cluster we do a slip stitch there we are chained up 3 1 2 & 3 turn the work and into this space down here we do two more double crochets okay like so because again we reach the end of the road chain one and work our way along back over this row with clusters alrighty and then into the top here we through two clusters separated by two chains chain two okay - our second cluster here like so chain one okay and finish up our clusters on this row here okay keep this one into here and I need some more yarn but it keeps getting tangled on me the bane of my existence but hey I am a yarn abour I have lots of fiber in my diet mm-hmm okay there we go all right so let me finish up this cluster like so chain one and then finishing up down into the space here with three double crochets like so and then chaining one because again we have to connect to this pre-existing triangle so I change one after I did my cluster here and then going across to a pre-existing one into the third chain up we're going to do a slip stitch right into here and there we go well alright I snip this there we go alright coming along nicely and I sewed in some ends my yellow ends already and so we just need to do one more of our triangles and then we can do our final rounds for this section of the crochet log all right okay so we're on the fourth triangle of our initial square so again here is the center space and the third to the right going to use our yellow yarn once more all right and so we pulled up a loop chain 1 and do a single crochet into that same space once again 3 double crochets into this center space chain 2 3 double crochets that's 1 2 and of course I got my yarn called yes gotta love it ok so that was one and two and three chain two three more double crochets into that same space come on two and three all right and let me chain one and then into the third chain while the third stitch excuse me one two and three we do our slip stitch like so we chain two and then go into the next third so chain one space double crochet double crochet so into that middle one we do a single crochet like so we turn our work and then into that space down there we do two more double crochets that's one and two chain one into that Center space we do two two clusters separated by a chain two space like so just give me some more yarn all right so that's chain two and then three more double crochets like so chain one and then into the space down here we do three more double crochets okay and then we'll chain one and then so we got this one so we go over three one the chain is one two three so into the center one here we do a slip stitch okay and then we find our scissors and we cut our yarn plop the loop okay and then we grab our purple yarn once again going over three stitches so that's one two three so that's the first of that cluster there and we grab our purple yarn and we pull up a loop make sure we have enough tail chain one go into that same stitch with a single crochet stitch so we have a nice anchor and then we go underneath here with our three double crochets okay chain one it's more yarn going on here okay finish up this cluster chain one two clusters in the corner of course separated by a chain two space naturally all righty chain one okay go into the next space with another cluster chain one and then going underneath here with our final cluster of this row okay chain one skip across three stitches so this is the one two and three and yes we've hit the end of the road so doing our slip stitch we chain up three one two and three we turn our work two more double crochets into the space here okay chain one here we go and we are so close to being done with this a lot and it wasn't even sure that I was going to do this tutorial tonight but I figured strike while the iron is hot and go for it okay change to because we're in the corner next right now it's 258 in the morning and yes I am a night owl and I do my best work at night but it's late alright so I chained to and I've got another cluster in that same corner space okay chain one up come on there we are come on you can do it there we are okay and one all right and then this is my last right in here okay chain one and then we're going to slip stitch to the pre-existing triangle here into the top chain like so and slip stitch yay does not take much to make me happy let me tell you alright so I slip stitched and I cut my yarn alright and we if you've been following we are now done with our initial Square and the four corners built outwards and now I'm going to show you how to fix this up you know sort of like you about a little mouth but yes we shall fix this up with the next two rounds alright be right back alright so before we continue on we have to deal with the remaining joining that we began when we did our first triangle so the easiest way is to undo that bit of yarn there and then redo the chain stitch there and then as before with all the others we do a slip stitch into the top chain like so okay and just finish up our slip stitch and then we can get on into the border alright and so we turn our work this way now what I'm doing is going based on the configuration of the original square where this orange is here and this is the right side for the square although it's the wrong side for this triangle but I'm keeping with the configuration of the original square okay so keep that in mind all right so what we're going to do is with our boarder yarn we're going to begin just like we have with the changing of colors in the original granny square by pulling up your yarn in the corner and then chaining up a three one two three and then do two more double crochets to finish the cluster like so and then a chaining of two and then three more double crochets into this cluster well into this corner so that we have finished up our corner and then we are going to continue to do our clusters across until we reach the center and that is really the only point that we need to concern ourselves with for the rest of this video but I'm going to go through it with you because that's exactly the point of this crochet along is to be thorough because I want you guys to really understand what we're doing here because I care so we just continue right along and we're almost there yes indeed all right so we've reached the center point okay so we're going to go underneath not just the purple but underneath the orange as well we're going to catch both together so going through we're going to do our cluster okay I'm actually going to do it this time so we catch both layers as you can see and we finish up our cluster and there you go and that is going to be what we do across and around for the rest of this round so working our way across just as we always have with our clusters easy-peasy by this point right yeah and I'm having a bit of deja vu Groundhogs Day at the moment this is actually truth be told the third time that I'm filming this border sequence because due to technological difficulties I thought that I would do this segment using shorter clips because the app that I use as much as I loved it it was saying that the file that I was trying to upload was not going to work for whatever reason I don't know so we forge ahead and we keep trying because I was determined to do this as with most things so we work our way across and we are almost to that center point once more okay just make sure that the purple yarn is taut don't want it loosey-goosey on us so catching both the orange and the purple together and it really brings a nice finished look don't you think okay so just going to keep doing our clusters around like so okay I'm also really looking forward to this set being done because I cannot wait to start working with that Jade colored yarn very much looking forward to that I think that'll be fun okay so we've got our three two chains now something I'm not sure if I set it in the two previous times that I was filming this or not but no give it a go anyway now when you're doing your colors you could quite conceivably do a different color for every time that you know I've changed my colors here you could use a completely different color you know you don't have to follow this formula this is just what I'm doing and if you care to follow along okay great join the party you can of course use as many colors as you want however what I would strongly suggest is that if you're going to use a lot of different colors of yarn that at the very least try to have them be all of the same weight and the same brand otherwise you can run into trouble there we go so I went through both like that because if you have different weights of yarn you can end up with a warbled bacon-like mess and of course we don't want that naturally but yeah I mean if you want to go really psychedelic and crazy by all means go for it it could be an interesting Salvador Dali Doctor Strange Jackson Pollock kaleidoscope hallucinogenic kind of yarn creation which could be very interesting and also would be great for stash busting but keep in mind you need that you need to have the the weight of your yarn be consistent that I cannot stress enough because you're putting so much time and effort into this you don't want it to be for enough you know for for not for nothing you know you want a nice finished product something that you can keep nice and snuggly and also not agonize over it doesn't lay flat which I have had that problem myself with very early attempts at projects where I didn't know what I was doing but I learned from that and that's what I always say that as long as you learn from your quote-unquote mistakes then they're not really mistakes there are learning experiences and that my dears that's how we grow and I've done a lot of growing and a lot of learning over the years let me tell you alright so we are almost done with this round and then we're going to need to do just one more so we've reached the center over here no problem we got that licked don't we so just scoot our way across underneath both layers like so and then we are going to finish up this round and then do one more and then we will be done with this part of the crochet along and I'll explain why we need to do one more absolutely essential all right oops hello all right and do our chain and then we slip stitch into the top chain up here like so slip stitch yay and then of course we need to work our way into the corner so we need to slip stitch into that double crochet slip stitch into the next one and then slip stitch into the corner space and then we will begin our final round alright so before we continue on I'm going to explain why we desperately need to do one more round at the very least because now when we were doing our initial square we needed a center hole remember well we need another one here we don't have one it's blocked see Center hole going all the way up and right now it's blocked up so that being said we need to do another round so that this is filled and this is filled then this space is empty because we need that center hole so that is why we need to do one more round or two more rounds totally up to you but I would suggest follow along so that there's no confusion so we're going to start by doing our tuning of the three two more double crochets to finish the cluster chain two three more double crochets to finish up the corner yep chain one and then we're just going to work our way across as we have been and probably said this before and I'll say it again I do so love grannies because it's one of those stitch patterns where you really can just get lost in the meditative flow and as just as much as this is a kaleidoscope look it's also a bit of a mandala as well which of course are very much in the way of meditation and so when you're doing this stitch especially when you're doing the borders all the way around you can very much get into a mindful meditative Zen zone if you will which is very much what I need to more often than not you know some relaxation where I can just sort of get away from the worries of the day and that is by and large why I love doing this so much I have admittedly a lot of nervous energy and I always feel like I have to be doing something well this is a way for me to be doing something yet I don't have to freak out over it yeah sort of constructive meditation the idea of just sitting quietly with my eyes closed thinking about glowing light you know for those that are capable of doing it and quieting their minds more power to them I wish that I could but I don't think it's in my genetic makeup often I feel like I just I need to be doing something and this is a way for me to be doing something but also I'm creating something lovely something practical something decorative and expressing myself through color and texture so much fun also compared to some other hobbies and so forth this is relatively inexpensive when you think about it you know go to the movies on a Friday night and if you go with somebody else yeah you can quite easily spend you know good 40 50 some odd dollars and if you go crazy at the snack bar Oh heaven help you you know or if the movie is in 3d IMAX super duper you know it's like ya need a second mortgage just to see a movie that only lasts two hours and then of course you have to tell the person behind you to please get off their cell phone you know so I mean did this suits me much better you know so as I was saying before we need that Center space well see we've got one so when we're starting our next set of triangles we can do so very important it's all about the steps so yeah this is something this craft that has just brought me so much delight and joy over the years and that is why I do it too well excess I can admit to that but it's a good thing know as long as I can curb my appetite for buying new yarn no harm no foul completely I've gone a little bit crazy buying Karen cakes yarn because I do so love the colorways I'm trying to think of new patterns to use with them but I have to be careful that little imp thing buy me buy me keep screaming at me and I'm sure that little imp has visited quite a few of you as well alright so we are almost done oh can you feel it I can feel it oh I'm all tangled yeah okay fix that so I figure I'm going to do is well I mean hopefully those of you that have been watching do like and appreciate the lengths that I'm willing to go for you guys and you know if you guys like what you see and you would like me to continue on with this crochet along and I see no reason why not you know you know if you want me to continue on you know I'll do the next set of triangles along the sides and so forth and you know we will continue to have our blankets grow together and of course I would love absolutely love to see what you are all up to and for those of you that don't know I am on Facebook and I am on Instagram and on both sites I go by the handle of fibre spider just like I do here on Facebook it is a community page and I'm more than happy to see what you guys are up to and on Instagram I've been on there roughly about the same time that I've been doing this channel and a lot of fun posting things you know one thing that I have not gotten into is posting selfies or my dinner I try to keep it in the artistic line if I can alright and I'm not being dismissive of those that do take selfies or post pictures of their dinner because sometimes those meals look darn scrumptious but mostly I just have leftovers mmm all right so we are almost done so yeah as I was saying before you know if you want me to keep on doing this series by all means keep those comments and questions coming I love hearing from you guys I really do it brightens my day and gives me something to look forward to because this this is my passion this is what I do I love sharing with you guys because as I've said countless times that knowledge is power but sharing is caring and I care I care enough to share with you because knowledge kept to itself well it's not worth having there we go and also of course if you guys have any suggestions for future videos I'm all ears you know and I may not I may or may not actually fulfill your request but I may at a later point but I'm always I'm always open to suggestions now within a degree of reason of course same thing goes with the audiobooks that I do that my narrations I'm almost done reading through Alice in Wonderland upon a suggestion I started reading through Pride and Prejudice when I'm done with Wonderland I don't know I might do The Wind in the Willows I might do something else that somebody suggests you know let me know and we are just about done oh I'm so excited all right so listen we have finished our first major segment of our kaleidoscope granny absolutely loved it so here we are we've come a long way together I just love it reminds me of a pansy flower absolutely beautiful so I'm going to sew in my ends and you know hopefully you guys will see this and be like I think I'm going to give it a try so until next time what you guys just stay inspired stay caffeinated and above all stay stitching I love you guys to death and I will see you in the next video bye for now [Music]", "OzQUfv9nfw4": "[Music] greetings everybody many proper here [Music] today is day 21 of my 18,000 watt u-dub there well girl we have a full garden of you dark purple kush bless one plant which is Girl Scout cookies form cuts [Music] currently at day 21 everything is going great in the garden there's not a lot to report I've been feeding very aggressively on the next time I water I'm actually going to cut back a little bit because I have just the tiniest tiniest bit of tip firm on the plants I'm not even going to try and show you at the camera because it's so small you would not even be able to see but I'm just going to cut back a little bit this next feeding remember last week's videos day 14 we went ahead and lollipop the plants can see underneath here so I'll clear it out since then I have watered two times the canopy has filled back in very nicely just have a walk down and look at the whole thing there's really no gaps anywhere give it down here when I made the video the after video I just can just finish this part of the room and it was really sparse and looked pretty crappy but you can see they did come back just fine the very full canopy very happy plants so we have nice big leaves plants reaching for the light at this point the plants are pretty much done well I'd say they're definitely done growing tall they're not going to stretch anymore from here on out it's going to be crystal production and blood production I have noticed a couple plants that look kind of crappy kind of like these you Dubbs tend to look when they end up not filling out you can see in the way back corner there that plant way back here looks a little scraggly you see you gots it's got some of the Chloe's going on and also this one right underneath the fan right in the center of the screen [Music] I'm not quite sure this usually happens from the plants getting too cold or the roots getting too cold and it I'm noticing that this row well this plan here to see like this one has got some of the same stuff going on see this a little clutch and it's just kuroh belief so I'm gonna watch this closely but my theory is perhaps [Music] this side of the room being close to an exterior wall there might be a little bit of draught your leak of really cold air coming because you know there's snow on the ground right now well practically and it's very cold outside so you know there's a chance that these plants right next to the exterior wall just a little bit colder than the rest but in towards the side of the canopy here they're just beautiful still [Music] a lot of leaf sprains the light reaching up growing very well [Music] Oh that my res were throwing there and started making the video and forgot about it so I've got some overflow [Music] definitely matters Oh that'll all evaporate off very fast I've got great air circulation or a great ear movement here yeah I don't know what else really to talk about so far this has been the perfect grow to call the plants filling in perfectly you know they're all about four and a half feet off the ground all of them are you know eight to eight inches to one foot above the top rings the tomato cages you can't even really see the tomato cages in the canopy just filled out great I did add some more box fans here just to get more air blowing under the plants now that their lollipop ders it's a lot easier to move air across the top of the pot so you can see I just have box fan just kind of blowing air circulating air around the lights are raised to their final height they're all about two feet above the top of the canopy the temperature in here is I'd say right around 77 78 degrees the humidity is a little high I'd say it's around 60% 55 to 60% humidity I like it down more around 40 to 45 so I'm thinking about turning on the 8 inch fan back there just to get a little bit more air moving across and just having it stay on 24 hours a day haven't decided to do it yet but I've been thinking about it that'll help keep the the moist air moving along [Music] can see we do have some blood production starting [Music] still little buds but definitely growing next week you should be probably twice as big and have a lot more visible crystals on them there aren't crystals on these buds but you know not really anything to speak of at this time anyway guys I guess I'll cut the video here because there's not much else to talk about everything is great in the garden day 21 go ahead and give you another update in a week right around well--that's christmas is coming up soon so right around Christmas so I'll be doing you guys an update all right peace", "ejucgGmeJMA": "[Music] [Music] thank you for tuning in to the 2020 mineral symposium the pacific northwest chapter of friends of mineralogy this is our first virtual symposium due to the current health restrictions because of the ongoing global pandemic so we're glad that you're able to join us here today a finer final presentation for this year's symposium is a man who will challenge the way that you look at colored minerals as he addresses our 2020 theme aesthetic minerals color and crystallography i'm very pleased to introduce dr george rossmann george is professor of mineralogy in the division of geological and planetary sciences at california institute of technology in pasadena california he got his bachelor's degree in chemistry and and mathematics at from wisconsin state university in eau claire and his phd in chemistry at cal tech his principal research interests deal with the use of spectroscopic probes to study minerals this work addresses problems relating to the origin of color phenomenon and minerals phase identification and the special role of metal ions and minerals he and his students develop analytical methods for analysis of hydrous compounds and minerals and examine their role in modifying physical and chemical properties he is also interested in the long-term effects of minerals from exposure to background levels of natural radiation george was the recipient of the first dana medal from the meteorological society of america in 2001 the richard p feynman prize for excellence in teaching at cal tech in 2004 and the friedrich becky medal of the austrian mineralogical society in 2005. he was also honored by having a new mineral of the tourmaline group rossmonite named in his honor he has more than 360 publications in the mineralogical and chemical sciences and now dr george rossmann with his talk natural radiation a tale of two minerals well thank you very much it's my pleasure to be able to be here and to give you this presentation today i'm making this presentation from the california institute of technology in pasadena california i'm currently in the division of geological and planetary sciences i'm in a room where we have a small museum of various mineral crystals including a lot of the minerals from the california pegmatites that are behind me these will be part of the focus of my talk today trying to understand the origin of color in some of these minerals my talk today is about natural radiation it's a tale of two minerals it's a tale of the feldspar group minerals and it's a tale of the tourmaline group minerals in particular amazonite and pink albeit tourmaline we're going to start with the feldspars the sphall spars are a group of minerals in fact they are the most common minerals in the earth's crust there are three common chemical varieties potassium feldspars sodium feldspars and calcium feldspars they come in a variety of colors like you see here from colorless iridescent colors to pink for example the question i want to ask is what is the color of an ideal textbook perfect n member feldspar in particular the potassium aluminum silicate orthoclase microcline the sodium aluminum silicate albaite and the calcium aluminum silicate enerthite we can go around the world and we can collect these different minerals and we find very commonly that we can get them but we find also from a study of the chemical properties that potassium sodium calcium aluminum silicate and the oxide ion itself none of these can cause color in feldspar if these were the only components in the feldspars they would be absolutely colorless and the samples that we have collected around the world we can look at them and we find in fact that a lot of potassium feldspars are colorless same with the sodium and we can find colorless calcium feldspars so this is perfectly consistent with their understanding of their chemistry and even if we look at some of the less common varieties or should i say compositions of feldspars budding tonight halophane and celsius which are the ammonium the barium and the barium potassium feldspars we can also find that these can be colorless in nature but we also can find in nature feldspars that are not colorless we can certainly find pink feldspars from the midwest i grew up in wisconsin and i grew up believing that all potassium feldspars were pink because they were back there at least and if you collect the beautiful jimmy transparent feldspars from madagascar the sanitaines yes they have a faint yellow color to them almost inevitably and of course we have the colorless felt spars but that's not the real concern today if we take a look at the plagioclase feldspars labradorite bite and night antisene things like that we find that very commonly they have a distinct yellow tint to them and that is almost anywhere in the world where you collect them so we can analyze these we can do chemical analysis and we can do studies of the color we find that the yellow color which is so common in both potassium and plagioclase feldspars comes from iron in the plus three oxidation state this iron is replacing some of the aluminum in the tetrahedral framework and it's an essential component of these feldspars at least at this small weight percent compositional range of course we all know about feldspar that have beautiful iridescence like the labradorites from madagascar this is a color that comes from layering of compositional different layers kind of like the butterfly wing iridescent colors or a scale on an insect but that's not the topic of today's discussion and then we come to the red feldspars which are so common around the world the red color in these feldspars is the color of tiny micro to nanoparticles of hematite when these feldspars grow they naturally incorporate some iron that's in the aluminum site and over geologic time tens of millions hundreds of millions of years of time water can percolate through these feldspars very very slowly but it does go through and it can react with the iron and cause it to precipitate out as hematite and that is the common color that we see in many of these red feldspars little teeny particles of hematite and of course we can worry about the red feldspars in the northwest in particular the oregon sunstone feldspars the red color in these feldspars comes from copper copper in the elemental zero oxidation state small clusters of a few atoms of copper give rise to that transparent red color but if they grow into larger clusters you can actually see the metallic copper in the feldspars the schiller where i really want to go today however is with the amazonite variety these beautiful blue feldspars we find from the colorado area pikes peak area lake george area and also these beautiful blue feldspars for example from the cola peninsula in russia and many other localities around the world they are potassium feldspar potassium aluminum silicate but there's something special about them that gives the beautiful blue color we can also find green felt spars that are also called amazonite these are beautiful examples the one on the right is from broken hill new south wales australia these have been known for a long time and much more recently beautiful green amazonite feldspars have come out of look in vietnam and again these are potassium feldspars the material from vietnam can sometimes be so beautiful and so transparent that has actually entered the gem world these are examples of some of these beautiful transparent amazonite feldspars from that vietnamese locality so the question i need to ask is what is the origin of the color where does this blue color come from and certainly the pike's peak area of colorado is one of the more prominent localities that we know about for giving rise to beautiful blue amazonite so what do we do well we take three different colors of amazonite from specimens that we have we take the greenish material from broken hill new south wales australia we take the beautiful deep blue color from lake george colorado we take an intermediate somewhat bluish green or greenish blue color from the york mountains in san bernardino county california we're going to conduct a number of different tests on these to see if we can learn some insight into what is the origin of the color in these amazonite feldspars one of the first things we do is we take these crystals take off a piece and break off a piece and we polish it into a little slab that's doubly polished like it's a little window that we can use to examine the quantitative measurement of the optical absorption we find that there are really three types of amazonite color and we can see them in the three samples the lake george colorado the blue material absorbs sort of at the center of the orange region of the spectrum with tailing into the green and into the red and the maximum transmission of light is in the blue portion of the spectrum it's the area where we get the least absorption of light and that causes the blue color in the sample the material from broken hill australia has a similar looking spectrum but it shifted over to the right more into the red and here the peak absorption is very far into the deep red and the maximum transmission now lets a lot of the green wavelengths come through that accounts for the greenish color of these samples and interestingly the sample that we got from the san bernardino county york mountains that is a mixture of these two different types of spectroscopy occurring simultaneously in the sample that gives us an intermediate color the spectrum itself doesn't really tell us about the origin of the color atomistically but it gives us some insight into the difference between the green and the blue we got to look a little bit further now into the structure of feldspars to understand some of these differences the structure of feldspar is what we call a framework silicate it's made up of a framework of aluminum and silica tetrahedra the alumina tetrahedra are blue on my diagram and the silica tetrahedra are red we don't show the oxygens they occur at the intersection of the various tetrahedra there are two fundamentally different ways that we can get this aluminum and silicon in the feldspars on the right hand side we see an ordered version in for each of these ring of four tetrahedra the aluminum ion which is the blue color occurs at the bottom of the ring of four whereas in the disordered variety on the left the aluminum can change places in the different tetrahedral rings in the top one it's at the bottom of the ring of four in the center it's to the right hand side of the ring of four and in the bottom it's on the left hand side of the ring of four we call this a disordered arrangement of the aluminum and the silicon compared to the one in the right that has a perfect ordering all the aluminum at that bottom position we also can envision that this difference can cause a subtle difference in the color of the mineral if other atoms are present in the crystal that are interacting with the tetrahedral framework the aluminum has a little bit less positive charge than the silicon so we can envision that there's an atom closer to the aluminum it may have a slightly different behavior than an atom closer to the silicon and this could show up as subtle shifts in the wavelength at which these samples absorb light the difference is name the nomenclature the more disordered feldspar is called sanidine that forms at high temperatures typically in volcanoes the more completely ordered feldspar is called microcline and that typically is in bodies of rock that have had millions and millions and millions of years to cool slowly where the atoms of aluminum and silicon physically migrate and rearrange themselves into the more ordered environment and the intermediate amount of ordering is what we call orthoclase what we find in our studies is that all of the green feldspars have a disordered arrangement of the aluminum silicon ions and all of the blue feldspars that we have studied have an ordered arrangement of the silicon and the aluminum ions all of them are still potassium aluminum silicate but the ordering of the aluminum and the silicon can shift the color from blue when it's ordered to green when it's disordered this still doesn't explain why they're colored but it gives us some insight into why we can have this difference between the green and the blue feldspars the next thing that we have to do is chemical analysis we have to run complete chemical analyses on these feldspars we have to see if there are other small concentrations of other elements in the feldspars that could be responsible for the color and the chemical analysis is going to be one of our biggest clues into the origin of the color of these feldspars to do that we use an instrument known as an electron microprobe this is our instrument at caltech over on the left we see a column of the big wire on the top big thick wire that is the electron gun where electrons are coming down the column which is under vacuum and striking our sample which is located in the lower compartment when the electrons strike the sample they cause the sample to give off x-rays but every chemical element in the sample will give off a different wavelength of x-rays and the x-ray detectors that are surrounding the central column detect these x-rays and they can tell us how many counts from iron how many counts from aluminum how many counts from silicon and how many counts from any other element that might be in the sample with suitable calibration of the detectors which is what we do of course we can get a very good quantitative rigorous analysis of the chemical composition of these feldspars so what do we find well we find first of all that all blue feldspars contain lead in all green feldspars contain lead the arrow is pointing to a blue region in one of the colorado amazonites and there is lead the element lead chemical symbol pb in this blue region how much lead well we have done rigorous quantitative analyses and taking my test samples we find the one from broken hill has almost 1.8 percent lead the one from new lake george which is the dark blue sample has 0.05 percent much lower concentrations and the one from new york mountains has slightly more at 0.07 percent but the color on these is pretty much the same it seems like it's not just the amount of lead but something else must be going on too and on the right hand side i show you some analyses from other localities around the world just to show you that these are typical ranges of the lead content of the feldspars remember all blue feldspars contain lead and all green amazonite feldspars also contain lead and these are the typical concentrations we believe that the lead is going to enter the feldspar in the potassium site lead commonly is in the plus two oxidation state and that would substitute in the potassium site it would fit and it would go in there is something that we could expect this means of course that when the feldspar grows in nature from the original magma body there has to be lead available in the natural environment and the feldspar is going to incorporate this lead when it grows from the material that's feeding the growth of this feldspar now life unfortunately isn't quite totally simple we can find samples of feldspars that contain lead but are not colored like that white overgrowth on the pike's peak sample to which the arrow is pointing we find these in many localities around the world we find mixed white and blue feldspars inevitably the blue feldspar contains lead and the colorless white feldspar also contains lead this is kind of a puzzle because it somehow cast doubt on whether just lead per se is causing the color in the feldspar if there's lead in both regions why aren't both regions blue if lead alone is the cause of the color so we're going to have to dig dig deeper into the phelps bars and see if we can understand at a more fundamental level what else might be going on we put all of these feldspars through infrared spectroscopy and that is a technique that's sensitive to water and we find that all amazonite feldspars whether they're blue or whether they're green contain water molecules literally bound in the structure of the feldspar no exceptions whatsoever furthermore we find that if we have lead-containing feldspars that are not colored they do not contain water this was the thesis work of one of my students many years ago so now we have amazonite contains lead the green versus the blue depends upon the structural order of the aluminum and silicon framework we have to have water as well in the feldspar as well as lead if we have the blue or the green feldspar so here's what we think is going on we think that in normal potassium feldspar potassium ions enter in their normal structural positions but if the feldspar is growing where lead is available at some concentration occasionally a potassium site will be replaced by lead but lead comes in in the plus two oxidation state and that's more charged than the potassium so that means the potassium site immediately adjacent to the lead is going to have to be either vacant or contain a neutral molecule but it cannot contain potassium because that would be too much charge so this is the way we think both lead and water get into amazonite and we'll call this now the amsonite substitution does the lead cause the color well we're going to go to the chemical laboratory now and get bottles of lead chemicals lead nitrate lead phosphate lead sulfate lead chloride and we're going to find that all of these lead-containing chemicals are cutterless lead plus two it seems cannot be the cause of the color in the amazonite even though we have just demonstrated that all of the amazonites contain lead so it has to be more complicated than that we're going to do another experiment we're going to investigate the thermal stability of the color in the blue feldspar can we heat it up and make the color go away does the color stay the same does the color get darker maybe we'll learn something from a heating experiment so we take a piece of the feldspar like the one you see here and we put it in a furnace for a short period of time and we see what happens here is what happens we can easily remove the color the blue color of the amazonite feldspar by heating it at 800 degrees for just one minute so all it takes is one minute to completely remove the color what we know is there are many things called radiation damage centers that behave this way sometimes they're called color centers they're very easily removed by heating the material so that gives us a possibility that maybe this is a radiation damage center a color caused by radiation so we're going to ask another question can we take this blue feldspar and heat it and remove the color and then re-irradiate it in the lab take the colorless material and irradiate it and can we turn it back into a blue crystal we did this and here's what we found yes we can bring the color back if we irradiate it with gamma rays this is exactly what we would expect for a radiation damage center so let's take a look now and try to think if we come up with a model that might explain what's going on every feldspar that we have tested and heated if it's an amazonite has lost color when we heat it and everyone that we have tested when we irradiate it gains color returns to color or even becomes more intense than it was to begin with but that first of all raises the question where does the radiation come from in nature this is potassium aluminum silicate potassium feldspar typically it's microcline if it's ordered that's the blue color but where's the radiation coming from well the answer is that it comes from the feldspar itself feldspar contains potassium of course that's one of the major components in a very small fraction of all potassium is the isotope potassium-40 and that is naturally radioactive it has a very long half-life 1.2 billion years so it's feeble radiation but this feldspar has been sitting in the ground for possibly many tens of millions to hundreds of millions of years building up a small continuous integrated exposure to this ionizing radiation and if you sit around for 100 million years soaking up this radiation that becomes a very sizable dose of radiation and that may cause color changes in the feldspar let's take a look after all of these studies we finally come to a model of what we think is going on in amazonite we believe that the gamma radiation from the feldspar itself interacts with the water molecules which are structurally bound within the feldspar and they rip them apart the energy of the gamma ray is enormous compared to the binding energy of the h and the o-h of the water molecules and this can break the water molecules apart forming what we call radical ions ions that have an unusual number of electrons h radical and o h radical and the o h radical in particular is a very strong oxidant it can easily react with things and oxidize them to a higher oxidation state and our model says that the o h radical interacts with the lead plus two which forms naturally in the feldspar and changes it into lead plus three we know from chemical theory that lead plus two is going to have basically no color at all but we know that lead plus three is going to have the ability to have very strong color because of the way it has electrons oriented in the crystal so we believe now that the lead plus three is the cause of the color of the blue feldspar it's the cause of the color of the green feldspar but because of the ordering of the aluminum and silicon ions they cause slightly different electrostatic environments around the lead plus three the color can either be blue in the ordered feldspar or it can shift to more of a greenish color in the disordered feldspar so we feel very confident now that amazonite feldspar is a radiation color involving lead water molecules and natural radiation coming from the feldspar itself [Applause] let's take a look now at another example of where radiation causes color and now i want to home in on tourmaline tourmaline is certainly one of my favorite minerals it's in the cabinets behind me and we've spent a lot of time analyzing tourmaline over the years currently tourmaline has the tourmaline group i should say tourmaline is a group of minerals that share a common structure it's not a single mineral there are 36 different tourmaline species in the tourmaline group some of them i'm sure are well known to you drayvite albaite litigodite and shorel these are the ones pictured in the bottom in that order from left to right they're pretty common most people know about them they're abundant tourmalines relatively speaking but there are also many very uncommon species of tourmaline that represent different chemical compositions detroit and all the other ones on the list are examples of these probably most of you have never seen them they're rare they're uncommon some of them exist in minute quantities they have different chemistries from the common tourmaline but all of them have been studied and documented and they've been approved by the international mineralogical association as new and different species of tourmalines today i want to concentrate on the albite tourmaline this is the very common one that we find in pegmatites and albaite chemically is a sodium lithium aluminum boro hydroxy silicate and as we said before sodium aluminum and silicate do not cause color lithium also does not cause color warate does not cause color either nor does hydroxide so if alba a tourmaline had the textbook perfect example of the compound composition that you see there it would be colorless and rarely you can find them in nature that are colorless but most commonly alba eye tourmaline grows in a pegmatite where there's iron manganese tourmaline and fluorine available at the same time fluorine itself is not going to significantly influence the color of the tourmaline but iron manganese and titanium are important chromophores elements that can cause color in minerals like tourmaline we're going to go to the himalaya mine because that's a mine i've been in and studied samples from that particular mine addressing the origin of color the himalaya mine in pastimes has been one of the largest producer of gems and specimen-grade tourmaline in all of north america for much of the 20th century for some of the 20th century it was in fact the most productive gem mine in all of north america if you go there today you'll find it's located in southern california let's take a look at a map here before we actually enter the mine this is a map of southern california in los angeles la is up in the upper left you can see the border with mexico san diego and then i have a little dash pointing to a little reservoir called lake henshaw this is important for the tourmaline pegmatite area let's blow this up there's lake henshaw in the upper right and the area within the yellow box is the area of the himalaya pegmatite let's magnify that and see what happens here it is the himalaya mine as you can see the disturbed ground it's a pegmatite that runs from above the disturbed area then down and around to what we call the san diego mine that's all part of the same pegmatite but it's under a different ownership and it was given a different name if you want to go to the himalaya mine you take the roads except you're going to end up at this block gate it's not open to the public it's on private land and unless you're one of the people that has the mining contract to be there you basically are not going to get into the himalaya mine or the adjacent san diego mine i was very fortunate to have made a good friendship with bill larson who was mining the himalaya mine for many many years and i've had the opportunity to go there and to bring students into the mine and conduct research so let's open the gate so to speak drive up and go to the himalaya mine this is what was the opening of the himalayan mine when bill larson was mining it the lady in front is alice keller the former editor of the journal gems and gemology now we're going to go into the mind we're going to walk back and we're going to get into the actual pegmatite itself and see what that looks like this is the himalaya pegmatite the dark host rock on top and on the bottom the lighter colored pegmatite in the center the pegmatite's about a meter thick it formed when the host rock was cooling and cracked because of contraction then the residual magma that was still in the magma body made its way into the crack and that became the pegmatite this is really sort of the last gasp of crystallization of a large body of rock that was crystallizing deep in the earth you can see the black tourmaline coming down from the top these are shoreldravite tourmalines when they enter a gem pocket they turn into albite you can see the beautiful pink lepidolite pods there the miners know when you hit lepidolite you could be close to a gem pocket towards the center you can see some large feldspars there's also quartz in there this is the typical himalaya pegmatite but there's no gem pocket in this particular field of view so we want to do is we want to now take a look at what a gem pocket would have looked like and this is one after it was mined the lady cynthia below gives you the scale and the large opening above her head was a gem pocket that contained gem tourmaline and perhaps other minerals quartz and other things but that was been all mined out but this is a typical size of a gem pocket there can be significant quantities of gem tourmaline carving quality tourmaline specimen tourmaline in a pocket like that and there were many such pockets like that in the himalaya pegmatite here's a gigantic pocket this goes back more than 10 feet this pocket contained large quantities of tourmaline gem tourmaline carbon tourmaline specimen tourmaline and you can see to the left of the helmet there's some crystals of quartz that had not been removed but imagine the quantities of tourmaline and other things that came out of a pocket of this size big enough for multiple people to go inside crawl up and go to sleep that is a gigantic pocket from the himalaya mine here's another pocket that actually still has the tourmaline in it this is bill larson who was mining it at the time you can see numerous turbulent crystals sort of the darker red material mixed in with the white matrix the white matrix might be zeolites and carbonates things that formed when low temperature fluids came in probably you can also see that some of the tourmaline seem to be cracked they seem to be breaks in the tourmaline that's because these things formed maybe eight or ten kilometers below the surface of the earth and when they came to the surface they were brought up by earthquake activity tectonic motion and these can be very violent events that can cause the tourmalines to break in the pockets fall whatever and over many tens of millions of years of geologic time they made their way up to the surface where they're now accessible in being mind like you see here now please remember i am interested in the origin of color of these red tourmalines why do they have red color well let's begin to explore that now a little bit further bill larson was very kind to us he let us come in while he was mining a gym pocket somewhat small pocket you can see the mining instrument he used it's a dull screwdriver he uses it to poke into the pocket and bring out the various tourmalines and other things in his hand you can see some small tourmalines and he was generous enough to give these to us for the research activities that we wanted to conduct at caltech he also let us put radiation counting equipment inside the pocket geiger counter equipment basically so we could measure the ambient flux of radiation coming from the minerals surrounding the pocket many of which are feldspars we did all this we took the samples back to our lab one of the very first things that we did is we took one of the samples and we sliced it up like a loaf of bread and we polished the little wafers on both sides and made them transparent like a window the window you see here is roughly one and a half or so millimeters thick and you can see the pink color of the tourmaline as it came out of the ground now the questions we want to ask can we do things that will give us more insight into the nature of the color of the tourmaline and one of the things we did was the very same thing we did with the feldspar we heated it up but this time only to 500 degrees that's sort of the temperature at which these things begin to form they form at relatively low temperatures they may form in a matter of a day a few days or so but the point is that we're going to heat them up for a very short period of time and see how stable the color is and as you can see here when we heated it the color nearly disappeared completely even though it was a very short amount of time at 500 degrees like in the case of the feldspar this is the behavior that we expect to see from radiation-induced color so the next thing we want to do is to take the sample we decolorized when we heated it we want to expose it in the laboratory to ionizing radiation we did that we know that the element potassium which is the component of the feldspar surrounding the gem pocket orthoclase and microcline in this case is radioactive as we said before emitting potassium 40 gamma rays and the important thing is that these gamma rays are so energetic they can easily penetrate through 10 centimeters of rock and not lose all of their energy so for the geological time that this pegmatite existed close to 90 some million years even though the radiation from the feldspar was feeble over geologic time the effect of this radiation really built up and did things to the tourmaline so we took the sample that we heated to remove the color and we gave it a dose in the laboratory of radiation equivalent to 92 million years of the natural radiation we knew the natural radiation rate because we'd measured the radiation in the gem pocket with our counting equipment and in the lab we have facilities that keep this radiation in a controlled environment and to our great happiness when we gave it the 92 million years of laboratory radiation the color came back almost exactly to the color that the tourmaline had when it came out of the pegmatite when it came out of the ground so i think we have shown very clearly that the color in these tourmalines is a color coming from natural radiation we can understand that they didn't grow that way but they became that way when they were irradiated primarily from the potassium in the gem pocket surroundings which was largely feldspar potassium feldspar the other thing that we did is we gave these tourmalines much more radiation than they would have obtained in the natural geologic environment let's give them several hundred million years of gamma radiation and see what happens and there you can see the answer on the screen they turn darker nature in no way has taken this process to completion whatever is going on is only partially complete in the 92 million years of geologic time in the himalaya mine but if these crystals were to stay around for hundreds of millions of more years they would turn darker and darker from the process of natural radiation very very similar thing to what we saw in the feldspars the next thing we have to do is obtain chemical analyses on these tourmalines and here is a very typical result that we find in a pink tourmaline from the himalaya mine first of all all of the pink tourmalines have manganese in them it has to be a relatively modest amount of manganese on the order about 0.1 plus or minus a little bit but even more importantly they have to be very low in iron content and they have to be very low in titanium content iron in the tourmaline would cause it to turn blue and the blue color is a strong color it could easily mask a lot of the pink color of the term the manganese and if there's iron and tourmaline both present they interact with each other and they cause the tourmaline to turn green and again this is a strong coloration it can easily mask or modify the pink color of the tourmaline and if there's a lot of iron in a lot of titanium it's going to be black it's going to be a shorel or a drayvite or one of the other dark tourmalines so the formula you see here is the formula for a typical pink tourmaline low iron low titanium and some modest amount of manganese and let's see how that plays out with the manganese the manganese ion is in the tourmaline it's in the structure of the tourmaline but when the gamma ray comes through the gamma ray from the potassium 40 it comes through with a very large amount of energy it comes through with like a thousand what we call thousand electron volts of energy huge amount of energy compared to the binding energy of an electron in the manganese that's just a couple tens of electron volts the gamma ray comes through with an enormously larger amount of energy passing through the crystal where the electromagnetic force of the gamma ray can literally strip an electron away from the manganese and send it cascading through the crystal somewhere oxidizing the manganese to a higher oxidation state now we know that happens because when we look at the optical absorption spectrum of the tourmaline we can see it very clearly demonstrated the big peak in the center is the peak from manganese plus three there's a modest amount of that in the natural pale pink tourmaline when we heat it we see the manganese three level go down and when we irradiate the tourmaline we see the manganese three level rise also when we heat the crystal to remove the color we see a very weak feature from manganese plus two growing and that feature goes down when we give it large amounts of radiation from chemical principles we understand that manganese plus two is a very weak absorber of light it does not significantly cause color but manganese iii is very effective at absorbing light and it can cause the color you see the absorption of light on the pattern i show you where the center of the absorption is in the greenish the greenish-yellow portion of the spectrum allowing when the curve is low the red color is a little bit of the blue to come through which is a slightly purplish red color of the albide tourmaline so we have now shown that radiation generates the manganese plus three and the manganese plus three is the cause of the color in these tourmalines this basically is a display of what's going on the science behind the coloration in a nutshell when the tourmalines grow deep in the ground at modest temperatures 500 degrees and lower when the pegmatites form the manganese enters the tourmaline as manganese in the two plus oxidation state that has very little ability to cause color so these tourmalines will be very pale colored effectively almost colorless but over geologic time potassium 40 gamma rays from the surrounding rock and from other materials potentially in the gym pocket irradiate the tourmaline they strip away the electron from manganese oxidizing it from the two plus up to the three plus oxidation state and that is the pink color that we see in normal albides and if you want you can take that tourmaline to a laboratory and give it even more radiation than nature gave it and that's going to make it even darker in color like the one that you see here on the left on the right hand side and that is simply causing more manganese plus three to form from the manganese two in the sample again nature does not take this to completion in the typical pegmatites there's a lot more manganese too just waiting to be irradiated and oxidized if they would stay in the ground for a longer period of time this is done commercially as you might expect here's the economic reason why this is tourmaline as its mind on the right hand side an afghani tourmaline very pale pink color you can't really sell it as a gemstone it's too pale but if you irradiate it in a laboratory you can greatly enhance the amount of pink color making it to a much more viable gemstone after it's faceted yes this is being done commercially on some significant scale and also you can heat the tourmalines if they're too dark make them lighter as well as you radiate them to make them darker both for the specimen market and for the particularly the gemstone market this is in your radiation facility that i have seen it's a facility where we have ingots of the element cobalt isotope number 60. here we're looking at it when it's submerged under a large swimming pool to protect the photographer from being irradiated and the glow that you see is the glow of the science fiction movies that's called cerenkov radiation and that occurs when the gamma rays come out of the cobalt 60 at a velocity higher than they can normally travel in water and have to dump their excess energy and that comes out as visible light for irradiating the tourmalines the cobalt 60 ingots would be taken out of the water and put in air then the tourmaline would be allowed to be in contact with these ingots of cobalt 60 and be irradiated on the right hand side you can see an example of one that i did and you can see the before basically an almost completely colorless tourmaline after a large exposure to ionizing radiation turn into the very dark red tourmaline that you see there so yes this is a viable commercial process as we come towards the end here now i'd like to show you some examples of other minerals that are naturally radiated we talked about the alba eye tourmaline which is a very widely available naturally irradiated mineral but amethyst is also an example of irradiation amethyst involves incorporating iron plus three into the quartz gamma radiation will oxidize the iron from iron plus three that is pale very pale colored in quartz to the very vibrant purple color which is iron in the plus four oxidation state next we have a piece of ametrine the variety of quartz that contains both amethyst and citrine and again the amethyst portion of this is because of natural ionizing radiation in the mine in bolivia blue topaz natural blue topaz occurs it's not particularly common but again it's an example of natural ionizing radiation causing color in the topaz on the lower left you can see a brownish topaz this material is very common this is an example of ionizing radiation causing the brown color but this is a very unstable color it will fade in a matter of hours in bright sunlight blue topaz in the upper right is quite stable to fading where the brown topaz can fade quite rapidly then the next we have quinsite variety of the mineral spogamine as this is mined in california and some of the mines in afghanistan it comes out with a distinctly green tint like you see there that is an example of radiation color but it's also manganese but here the manganese has been oxidized from the plus two to the plus 3 to the plus 4 oxidation state and that is the green color but it's a very unstable color in a matter of few hours exposure to sunlight the green color completely goes away and the queenside turns into the pink color which those of you who have queenside are much more familiar with the next example is an example of gold and barrel this one is from the ukraine that is also an example of a radiation color iron is oxidized when it forms in barrel from plus two to plus three and that gives rise to the yellow color it's heat treated in a laboratory after being mined to turn it back to the plus two color which is the beautiful blue color of the gem aquamarine in the specimen aquamarine then we have halite common sodium chloride common salt when that is exposed to ionizing radiation the radiation interacts with the sodium ions it causes little colloidal particles metallic sodium to form and that is the blue color that you see here in the halite finally we have an example of quartz that is smoky quartz that's also an irradiation color in this case it's a minor amount of aluminum in the quartz that substitutes for the silicon it is irradiated an electron is stripped away from the alo4 unit and that gives rise to the smoky color it doesn't stop here however there's a little bit more we can talk about we now know from very reliable sources that have been out for a long time that people are using laboratory methods to color topaz to make the blue gem and other minerals of commerce that's as a concluding effort take a look at one of these reliable reports on how people are using radiation to alter the color of gemstones okay that's the national enquirer and they're quoting a professor from the california student technology by the name of rosman who has shown that in fact early on many years ago that radiation technology was being used to color blue topaz which is now the important gemstone of commerce it's a very stable color a beautiful color no danger with it but it is certainly something that has been done for a long time on that happy note i'm going to come to the end of my talk be without mentioning gems no i got to mention gems i got to mention gems that are irradiated tourmaline as a gemstone can be irradiated diamonds are irradiated in a wide variety of colors and like i said blue topaz is an example of natural ionizing radiation and example of laboratory radiation to make the gemstone of commerce quinzite can be irradiated from pink to green i would advise you if it's an irradiated queenside don't buy it unless you want to have a stone that's going to fade in a very short period of time it's very unstable even if you keep it in darkness the color will fade away and then finally even synthetic stone synthetic diamond synthetic amethyst is being irradiated to generate the colors that we find in the natural environment and that happy note i will come to the end of my talk i thank you for the opportunity and i'm very happy to take questions all right thank you george that was fantastic uh as we anticipated it would be uh so i think we have a lot of questions uh that uh came up so um uh you wanna go ahead jessica do you wanna go ahead and ask some of those questions sure hi george thank you it's great you could join us oh my pleasure so we do have a number of questions for you so i'm just going to take it from the top it looks like uh aaron asks when you say that radiation damage centers are also called color centers are all color centers or f centers related to radiation damage in common parlance that's often the way that people refer to them sometimes people casually refer to other things like metal atoms as color centers but i think you'll find in the scientific literature primarily it's referring to the radiation induced colors thank you see robert wonders if the pale blue albite cleveland diet from the homestead pass jefferson county montana would fall into this category we've examined a number of pale blue elbites from different localities around the world yes all of them that are blue contain lead it's a much more dilute version of the emma of the amazonite color but it is a lead induced color and ron wonders if the is it the potassium 40 that colors the smoky quartz associated with the amazonite in colorado right any source of radiation will contribute but potassium is going to be the dominant source particularly in the potassium belt spark pegmatite and greg wonders how much gamma radiation from cosmic sources at high altitudes in colorado if exposed at the surface the surface exposure will be relatively brief when a piece of feldspar is exposed to the surface so that amount of radiation is really minuscule compared to a few hundred million years sitting below the ground where cosmic radiation does not penetrate angela wonders if one can tell if amazonite is naturally irradiated or if it's been irradiated in a lab i don't know how to do that sorry [Laughter] oh let's see rob wonders uh says there are orthoclase pseudomorphs after mariolite from afghanistan with a sky blue color have you looked at this material no i've never had one of those to play with if somebody wants to send me one i'll be more than happy to look [Laughter] anti-intent if roberts says is the color no is the source of the color zoning in tourmaline for example zonation from green to pink to blue due to relative concentrations of other elements such as iron and titanium absolutely the blue cap on a blue cap tourmaline is iron plus two which is the dominant ion when we get the green tourmalines we have a mixture of iron plus two and titanium 4 that have to simultaneously be present and if we have large concentrations of iron plus 2 in titanium plus 4 and iron plus 3 the whole thing turns black the shorels the floydites the dravites uh you're you're so on the ball this is great uh iron three versus iron iv in amethyst uh from eric i was unaware of the plus force state where else do we see this oxidation state almost never it's an incredibly rare oxidation state it has very little stability in a chem lab environment but trapped inside a mineral like quartz it can persist for geologic time uh see that's more of a statement than a question here let's see rob says the blue halite is colloidal sodium is that blue from raleigh scattering that makes the sky blue no sodium itself intrinsically when it's colloidal will absorb the particular wavelengths of light to make it blue so it's it's not scattering scattering can be a factor in many things but it's actually an intrinsic color of the sodium in the case of the halite and greg wonders greg says sapphire can be heated to a darker blue can it be irradiated too sapphire can certainly be irradiated we can throw it in a radiator but typically when i irradiate the corundum materials you gain an orangish color to them or a kind of a yellowy brown color and in my experience these are largely quite unstable colors if i take a colorless sapphire and irradiate it which i've done many times i get a kind of a beautiful golden slightly brownish yellow color that comes out but in a matter of a week the colors faded away wow which is a good question rey asks uh he is told that shoryl is not black but actually a deep deep blue and that if thin enough its blue color can be seen is that true absolutely if you make a thin section 10 20 30 micrometers thick most sorrels will be blue or a blue brown or even a dark greenish brown i don't think i've ever thinned a shorel down to a few micrometer stick that has not been transparent with some other innuendo of color oh wow do irradiated tourmalines fade upon exposure to uv and sunlight like some other radiated gems in my personal experience it may span something like 20 30 years of stones being out in intermittent room light i have not observed what i would call any significant fading whatsoever of the color bill larson who of course mined the himalaya himalaya mine for many years has been to china where he has seen tourmalines that were mined in the early portions of the 1900s and it is his opinion that after a century of exposure to sunlight there is noticeable fading in the pink tourmalines very cool oh erin says that she can send a chunk thank you aaron i'll take it hold her to that uh we have another question from rob is the blue and sodalite from colloidal sodium or some sulfur complex no sodalite is the sulfur complex the blue color is typically a little chain of one two three sulfur atoms in a row with a negative charge and can you address the blue caused by sun on barite i have been working on that but i do not have an answer yet to give you atomistically well we'll look forward to that in a future presentation i guess see am i missed any questions these are all the questions i see yeah linda smith was asking uh would rose quartz be an exam result of irradiation no uh rose quartz in the classical sense massive veins of quartz that have rose color is due to tiny thin hair like inclusions of an aluminum borosilicate that has the pink color it's a mineral related to demorteurite color coming from iron and titanium however there is a variety of quartz that forms crystals that have a pinkish color i call them pink quartz not rose quartz for example from gallia brazil or argentina and those are radiation colors coming from aluminum and phosphorus substitution in the quartz but the vast majority of common everyday bulk big hunks of rose quartz that's inclusions of pink material not radiation fascinating yeah i i have a question george this is julian um the uh photograph that's uh behind you on the wall is that erasminite uh yeah it's three different species of tourmaline this one comes from elba italy the bottom part the sort of crinkly partly turbid part that's the phase albite the common tourmaline species the very top of the crystal which is black is the tourmaline species phytite and the beautiful clear transparent area i'm now pointing to is the rasmonite very good well tourmaline is my favorite mineral too and it uh specimen number one in my collection was a shorel that i collected uh a few hundred yards from my house when i was a kid so that's that's what got me started so uh it got me started too in science when i got a sample of tourmaline when i was back in grade school and it became fascinated by the color of the material and ever since i pursued a career literally looking at the color of minerals including tourmaline we we are all very grateful that um of several things that you did pursue that career uh that you've been very successful and that you're sharing your time but you also have a talent for making incredibly difficult concepts very understandable and that's one of the other reasons that we wanted you as a speaker today so thank you very much oh my pleasure indeed happy to do this can i ask a quick question before we uh before we move on um there is uh an occurrence uh supposedly of ross knight at the tanko mine in uh manitoba are you aware of that and can you confirm it if indeed that is rasmania i can confirm it is probably the largest crystals of rasmunet in the world at least discovered so far the first crystal of rasmonite from the tonko pegmatite was obtained by a group from the university of winnipeg manitoba they went into the mine they sampled tourmaline they brought a little teeny piece of a tourmaline crystal two-thirds of a meter long a few months later they got around to analyzing it and oh my gosh it turned out to be rasmonite but when they went back to the mine that crystal was all mined out but there are many other smaller pink tourmalines in the tonko pegmatite that have been shown occasionally to be raspinate the trouble is to really determine it absolutely it's an expensive analysis to do involving detailed electron microprobe analyses it's not something you can easily do by simple quick methods i ask one quick further question oh i'm just uh sharing a picture of a rossmannite from tanko there whoever had a had another question go ahead the other question was with these very sub microscopic inclusions in the rose quartz cause calling the rose color do they organize to the point that they are the source for the asterism yes sometimes they'll go along the a axis of the courts giving rise to the beautiful asterism thank you thank you so much george [Music] you", "wsZ2X7MP-70": "a hero's reception for our top wardog so here's your award sobby sobby receiving the purple cross for the bravery she showed in Afghanistan after she lost her regiment during a fierce battle with insurgents like in 2008 her handlers feared the worst but 13 months later sabe was found there's no doubt that sabe has shown an incredible resilience and strength that should be recognized a recognition that made her handlers beam with pride they probably don't maybe get recognized enough for the job as they do over there the significance of it all seemed lost on sabe yeah I think she's only bewildered at the moment but she left it up anyway Bobby's only the ninth recipient of this award and the RSPCA hopes that she'll raise awareness about the crucial role that animals play in war like most people no doubts we would prefer animals didn't go to war but they do go and while ever they do we must recognize

actually 9 news", "AEKO-PORA-k": "sorry about that you guys for those who don't know I generally use my cell phone to record all my videos of a note 3 which actually does a fairly decent job better than my old camera and somebody a telemarketer called me and totally screwed up our video next time I'll have to remember to put it on airplane mode and yeah interesting ever since I reregistered my dick my domain name I keep getting phone calls from like Google listing services and stuff like that which is just really kind of lame when they call your cell phone anyways back to where I was I've got my sticks double crochet chain two and then six double crochet so I've got two three four five and six this came a little tight because I haven't secured it yet next what I'm going to do is I'm going to double crochet into this single crochet then I'm going to do four double crochet in this chain 4 space and of course crocheting over any tales that I have need to loosen my yarn again so I've got the one two three one more I'm going to do another double crochet and this single crochet and now I'm just going to repeat everything I've already done so in this corner six double crochet chain 2 6 double crochet double crochet in the single crochet four double crochet and this chain four double crochet in the single crochet you're going to repeat the pattern all the way until you get all the way over here you're going to slip stitch and then you can change color one final time or a very last row so you in just a moment all right after this round is a really good time to go ahead and get your measuring tape out and make sure and see where you're at if you want to make sure that it's the same size as your other squares if you need to add the additional length I know I crochet a little bit bigger than other people so some people will need it some people won't I'm used to using a smaller hook when I crochet it with a four gauge i normally use a G or a little bit smaller because I just like the the tighter look what your one I want to do mine still does need it i'm not at six inches yet I got the six inches when I did the last row I like to join at a corner I just feel like it gives me a neater spot I'm going to do just a round of half double crochet let me go ahead and focus this you guys it's there we go easily out of focus I'm going to change you for our first stitch in the corners of this row it's super simple it's just two half double crochets chain to two half double crochet and then for the sides it's one half double crochet in every stitch around super simple super quick and just super fun I really like the square it's one of my favorites at the moment so yeah we just go all the way around the whole thing just like this very simple until you're done and this is what it looks like when you're done depending on what you pick for your colors and what you like make sure that you remember to sew everything up and then I just wanted to show you something kind of fun I don't know some people might find it interesting but I have a notebook just like this and this is what the page looks like i was at my son's basketball game he's been he's got two to three hours worth of games every single week for the summer which he totally loves these eight years old and he just suddenly decided before this he'd never liked sports now he's just all into it so i take my crochet with me in my little book and I came up the idea with the flower so I drew everything I kind of wrote notes with what I wanted and then when I pulled out my yarn this is just kind of my process on how I design or how I come up with ideas comment below let me know what you guys do for ideas tell me what colors you want to use for your flower", "zwIh8BcVljQ": "block 44 the Tunisian sampler Afghan is the bicolor squares block it's actually block 50 in the leaflet all of these blocks are based on Leisure Arts leaflet number 2501 and Afghan stitch sampler the leaflet is available for PDF download it's no longer in print the price I believe currently is $9.99 but I will say they constantly put the PDF patterns on sale so it's one of those you kind of just need to check back with them the best way to find the pamphlet if you're looking for it is to just Google Leisure Arts 2501 and click on the link that is directly to Leisure Arts comm and it takes you straight to the pattern these this particular block the bicolor squares block the pattern is derived strictly from changing colors of yarn it's all the simple stitch or Afghan stitch and you basically change I think according to the pattern it's every 5 stitches you do 3 rows every 5 stitches you change the colors you alternate them because I'm doing 36 stitches in my blocks I'm doing it every 6 stitches so all I'm really going to do here is show you how how and when to change colors and in the first half of the row you match the yarn that you're using to the loop that you're picking up so here is when I change because I want my loop to be the coral color I changed now this is the end of the block and I am as I've shown in previous blocks on to in my vertical sashing and then connecting to the previous column as I create each block so now I'm changing the color to the off light yarn for my vertical sashing now I'm going to go into the back loop and this purple loop at the same time and now I'm going to yarn over and draw through two all the way across and I switch colors as soon as I get to the point that I have two different colors to draw through I'm going to change to the color that's the second loop on the hook okay I've got two different colors time to change to yellow you get the idea here time to change to the coral now I'm not going to finish going all the way across the room but after I've got this is like the second row in this series after I've done the third series of this when I get down to these last two stitches that's what I'm going to pull through my coral yarn so that my first stitch of the next row on top will be coral on the back here well you'll see there's a lot of color changing going on and so you're going to have a lot of threads to bury each time I change colors I leave a generous length on there because I'm going to use a needle to bury them and I will be doing a video on that on varying threads later I have used yarn bobbins here and I've got six of them three for the yellow three for the coral i highly recommend you using the bobbins and use six of them the reason being the pattern itself tells you to just do two balls of each color and then use your the remainder of your scheme for the third color around there I'm here to tell you if you go balls of yarn versus using the bobbins you're going to drive yourself bonkers trying to keep those separated because as you move those balls of yarn are going to unwind and they're going to be going left right in everywhere and if you have a cat forget it you're going to lose I know that when I'm just working with one ball of yarn as soon as I move I get up I go to answer the phone go to get a drink whatever that ball goes running away from me so I would suggest using the bobbins I think that's basically it because I'm using the 36 stitches again mine are going to be six stitches wide versus the five called for in the pattern and I'm doing 29 rows and since these are in series of three rows I'm doing one row of plain Coral on the bottom and one row of plain Coral on the top and then a series of nine of these three stitch rows for the other 27 rows and that's it block number 44 the bicolor squares thanks for watching", "MxQ5lK8XWG8": "all right I'm back I'm starting my Afghan and once I've done a couple of rows I will take a picture of the progress I've made so far before and after pic Here I am starting my crochet cluster and I've already chained one and I'm going to do another crochet cluster here it's very simple only doing a couple of these so that you can see how it goes I'm going to try and work to the end and then I'll show you how to change colors doing your crochet clusters believe it or not all of this yarn is scrap yarn goes to show you how much your and I have didn't tonight you know what when I first began this this Afghan I had considered going to one of the local stores to buy some more yarn and I was like well let me check what I have in my drawers first and I may not have a whole lot I'll just do what I can do before going to buy some new yarn lo and behold I have got I've gotten a long way with this Afghan and I still haven't bought any yarn I've been you know given some yarn one of my friends actually gave me a some cotton yarn which is awesome I love cotton yarn so I'm gonna use that too but aside from that I mean this yarn I'm gonna actually show you got to show you this yarn is coming from a previous starter blanket I had started this blanket as a shell stitch I'm using this yarn actually right now and I'm going to use it's the white after I'm done and then I've got the yarn that my friend gave me peaches-and-cream yarn all right so I'm going to keep the video short and do a couple more of these and show you how to change the colors this blanket Afghan whatever you want to call it it works up really fast I mean imagine doing it in chunky yarn you'll be done in no time so if you're if you're interested in making a baby blanket or a blanket for someone then try this stitch out it's very quick you can do it while you're sitting watching a couple movies try Star Wars that'll get you through a whole blanket okay I'm gonna change the colors okay for demonstration purposes I'm going to change it to lime green even though I'm not done with this color yet I'm just going to show you really quickly everybody has their own technique on how to change it colors so if you find a different technique that is easier for you then by all means do it so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna keep my yarn here I kind of hold it back so you know it doesn't get in the way I do a slip knot first okay boom I take it off my hook in my chain one space well first I will yarn over and then in my chain one space I'll go through this is here okay I'll put my yarn my new yarn on my hook I will pull it through okay yarn over pull through yarn over pull through okay now it seems like it's a little loose right now but do don't be a frightened about that you're going to crochet over that yarn over and just continue with your crochet cluster okay that's how I start my this is done this year on done just drop it behind it or you can cut it and just continue making your crochet clusters I'll do a couple of you so you can get an idea of how it just kind of blends into itself okay one more for good measure okay all right so that's that you can hardly see I mean you know hardly see the the blending and then you just keep on going this is really good if you have a lot of scrap yarn it actually turns into a wonderful Afghan I'm gonna show you really quickly before I take the picture this is the right side so many colors I mean I've done hot pink peach yellow bright yellow flat yellow just get grit yellow lime green did I say well I'm doing already hot pink I think I said that one too blue obviously purple definitely red and a couple of other colors I've actually blended this color this was a size G that both of the yarns were like a size G yarn so I put them together into me like a size H or I mean sighs I for my hook and it came out pretty I thought you know and you have your hot pink you're kind of like I'm magenta reddish teal purple definitely red dark purple white I love the white in there because it's just a an awesome crisp contrasting color but anyways I started with my purple and this is what you did that's what you did so if you were to continue out then this is how it would look so anyways that's it and I hope this helped and if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them Thanks let me be patient", "76XrebIXuo4": "greetings everybody mehdi cropper here this is my day 14 video of my 3600 watt afghan care special girl last week I went through and lollipop all the plants up to at least the third ring of tomato cage right here and the plants were just a little bit above the fourth ring the top ring and I also super cross them all I've made that video and showed you that there's you know nice nice and even canopy like right after height of the tomato cages since then they've grown about two feet which is quite a bit two feet in a week so we have some like these tops here that are about you know 26 27 inches above the top bring the tomato cage others or foot let's say the average height of this canopy now is about 14 to 15 inches above the top ring the tomato cage but we didn't come through today and do one last trim on the plants just on some of the smaller stuff that's you know way below the canopy like this stuff down here that's not even above the top bring in the tomato cage you know things like this [Music] things like this like this whole branch comes off right here [Music] you know it's not doing anything so that all get cut off did raise the lights again the plants all are about 12 inches 10 to 12 inches from the hoods the the highest colas or 10 to 12 inches from the hoods but it's still nice and cool in here to go look at the temperature actually 72 73 degrees 73 degrees [Music] have a little bit of bug production not a whole lot day 14 I guess this is average for day 14 you know they're just trying to come in today I did my first meeting with big buds so we've done with the button nighter phase under the big bud just water today and gave each plant one gallon of water this grow is coming along absolutely great I've got a 6 foot by 8 foot canopy with 3,600 Watts all brand new 6 under walk bulbs now running in super lumen meds or really about 3,900 watts because it's boost about 10% anyway not much more also talked about for day 14 yeah everything's just filling in quite nicely it's gonna be a great growth here I will try and get you an update next week I don't know if I'm gonna keep doing this updating the scroll every week I might space it out a little bit more than that but we'll see what happens but for now I'll leave you here at day 14 with my 3600 watt Afghan Chris special girl you guys have any questions or comments feel free to let me know otherwise I will see you in my next update all right peace", "oJyod3hVspk": "hi guys welcome back to Browns boutiques I'm Megan and today is day seven of national crochet month March 2020 and today I'm working on something that I worked on my second video that black and purple throw so I'm just gonna be working some more on that today I'm at a different location I'm actually at my dad's working on laundry so I thought I'd bring my camera and my work and while I'm waiting for laundry to get done I can do a video so it's just gonna be about a row or two we'll see how long it goes but we're just doing that basic double crochet again so you just yarn over insert your hook under the two loops then make the V on the top yarn over pull through you'll have three loops yarn over pull through the first two now you have two loops yarn over pull through the last two and there's your double crochet so we're just going to do that all the way across on this one this one got a lot of views and so I thought I'd just go ahead and do this one again and get some more work done on it for you today it's a nice sunny day the weather is really nice I'm thinking spring is even closer coming along here I hope you guys are having a good weekend I have to work tonight in tomorrow so my weekend isn't really free as such I'll have next weekend off so I'll be nice yeah yeah I'm just hanging out with my dad today doing some laundry he made some really good food for us for lunch pick some pork chops and tater tops but yep he's gonna maybe do just one row today I don't want the video to be too horribly long trying to a little bit better focusing if I'm going too fast there any newbies trying to follow along with this stitch if I'm going too fast let me know in the comments below I can always slow down a little bit they're just one of those stitches that you can just keep going and going or you miss it completely like I do because you're nervous and you got a camera but yeah I do love this coloring it's kind of ombre but kind of not because it's purple and black but it comes up with a really nice transition between the colors I think it's a little darker in person and it looks a little bit more blue tinge in the camera but it's more of a dark like royal purple then it gets a little darker here before it goes black so it's kind of ombre not really kind of in that same wheelhouse of being ombre if you hear a little ticking in the background that's actually a little solar monkey on a swing and it's swinging back and forth like because the sun is shining gay here in northeast Indiana we have some Sun it's still a little chilly but it's not bad so really think spring is right around the corner there we go and it's still super soft go back and fluff it out this looks a little bit nicer it's so pretty but I'm almost coming to the end of the skein it's getting a little smaller so I may have to buy some more of it in the next couple weeks or so here see little bit more than the row itself it's more yarn there there we go fix that real quick I lost the stage in the middle of a double crochet there just drop the yarn right there little easier to reach and get to I'm gonna try and get to the end of this row here I just do one row today but definitely working on this in between videos gonna fluff it out I'm very nice I've just got a few more stitches here and then we'll be done for the video for today may try something different for tomorrow may try to start a new project have you guys see the beginning of a project I can find a stitch I want to do for it there we go so that may be something interesting for tomorrow to start a new project and have you guys see a new stitch instead of the double crochet all the time just when you're in kind of a when you love something so much like I do love the double crochet it's hard to break away from it if I want to try and broaden a little bit I'm gonna see how it goes nope that was not right I went under instead of there we go I went like in between the posts instead of just on top there that would looked funky these end ones are always kind of hard to find but just do your best to find that B throw it underneath both of them and pull through and then just find the end stitch and there we go all right it's got one row and I how do you have to be careful cuz in my hand I can't go for two horribly long at a time I've also started going numb on me but that's gonna be the video for today hope you guys enjoyed it again just a little bit of happy to go throughout your day and showing you this really pretty project I'm working on you guys can go ahead and like and subscribe so you can see more videos I do appreciate it you can also comment down below if you have any ideas you want to see or just telling me if you liked the video or not anything I can work on also definitely appreciate it thanks again for watching and happy crocheting bye", "7P-Ntq3apHI": "what up YouTube keeps it cut share and today with a star our season two so those are gonna be our new grow we start off right with them in the back these are the first one that went to flowering which will be the first one right there it's the white widow this is the Gani you know the first ones I went to firing that about I would say 17 days into flowering this Afghani was the one that turned out to be a female and then was a male so we got rid of it and yeah the sewer with right now and the other ones or the four right here which will be the this della haze which has like like a lot of spacing that's the chronic lights this right here will be the purple perilous and now in the back will be the blue barrel G all these for our nine days into firing right now you do have the signs of little pistons and these are sort of formed flowers already it's enough to get the nitrogen deficiency like somewhat did lollipop these two somewhat not too much and have something to trim these up and do a little cleaning get some clones maybe so yeah this is what I'm working with right now this prepare list right here supposed to be from purple it's mostly sativa starting pretty big and there's Ella Hayes it's supposed to be like a mango flavor supposed to be a big city of it too so maybe these two are here gonna take longer this time for some growing them so we're still experimenting with each single training here we have six different strains you know all the same so yeah that's what I'm working with right now so let me show you my betting plants see what's going on over there alright guys so here's my virgin plants that's my king city crush right there it's gotten really big it's like almost touching the light I can get any higher because then these right here won't get any light much of penetration it needs water it's really getting really droopy so I my water that right now just our harvest that we did there all right they're just still there seeing badly happens this are hundred percent iike there's a double block which will be next into flowering once there's enough space in there either the clone that I took for the white widow about five oh this is our Girl Scout cookies maybe in a week transplant it show a bigger pot start maybe with a two gallon and then from there I'll go to a five same thing with these this is like Candyland and this is a granddaddy purple there are four more QT the curse isn't looking pretty shitty down kind of and these two are looking pretty good and our clone we just have basically just four or we have two that were didn't make it and I believe we have three white widows and two Afghan these males I'm melt I mean females have actually kept you can see here just will be harvested in my last video just sitting there so yeah this my my next grow my water that one so stay tuned let's see if we get a real yield this time actually I think I'm gonna make a my yield wasn't that great you know I was kind of counting it with the scalp the scale can go over a certain limit so what's coming up am i working on me but I think we got over at least four ounces I would say which is not great I believe I'm not exactly numbers but around there so yeah stay tuned for my next video d peace okay so here's a first batch from our first batch we got about twelve point 81-82 roughly thirteen grams it's nice and frosty can hard tilt the camera but I think I might have over dry these buds they were looking kind of pretty dry believe my open for like maybe two days so yeah let's let's say well say it will say 13 grams so let's get those in there yeah that purple Cadillac okay so here's our second batch 36.1 six there's the purple Cadillac - I know you can see that purple but probably post a picture yes you see them kinda hard to-- so we got about 36 and 13 that's about like 50 grams purple cowlick 50 grams so that's about why like an ounce counts on something which is really not that great so I don't think you I don't think it was a low yield er it's more of a I was at the growing conditions that I had time to bags and everything so you know we'll see how much we get for our next girl hoping a numbers increase Beth the purple Cadillac now there's a way that the Drake's crazy okay so here's a 3x crazy she got around 20 1.19 just a little try off an ounce just 21 grams like seven short off the ounce smells pretty good just now up I don't really see any propylene and they see a couple of months the purpling but it's not as much as the purple kavik public I like is a little bit sexier than this one so the yield this was a little bit less this wound on that went hermie but actually I can't even find any seeds or anything the thing that was just like in this last day just about to turn oh yeah now let's look at the King City coach okay so here we have the King to the Kush which is my screen looks like yeah thirty-six point 51 so got an ounce and like announcer nine and Gramps this should actually Maeve had one of the bigger knives so I'll show you so it's kinda hard to tell you check it the room in there kept us good it's gonna get but that's actually pretty big frosty shrooms cut out mm-hmm let that sexy but it's big I pretty dense hard nugs so yeah I'm a the plant that happened there right now vegging that's pretty bigger than this one so we know who might get a more yield out of it so an ounce not too great but let's say we couldn't at least get to next time and push our limits so yeah this is my my harvest so yeah peace you", "m8BmjVrKhvU": "[Music] and you do with yellow you can see then you said here I'm just going through [Applause] their things but I will be definitely letting you guys know and I will be sharing with you all the whole process of on YouTube now they definitely tearing my view to room with you off yes guys I'm a little bit sick of not a little bit super sick and as you can hear from my voice but this won't stop me from it is for you also today video is really really interesting guys I am trying some makeup from Primark if you don't know what prymaat is it's a huge brain with all over Europe I guess mostly in UK and now it's in Germany too and I am always shopping from them like they have shoes they have makeup they have skincare they have hot decoration have clothes for kids babies girls women men every type of people I mean you can find there tons and tons of things and it's really really affordable and super great so without further ado let's get into this video Oh a few months back I just went to primer and I couldn't stop myself to do this video because it was like I have to do it well I got this bunch of stuff from there I know I will excuse my spots it is it is the shoe box from my baby but I couldn't find something else cute here so when we started off with Omega so I will be moisturizing my skin with clean water as usual as usual excuse my voice excuse my voice because I am annoyed by my own self so I just must raise my face I haven't bought a primer from Primark I mean they are always super picked in a Primark and I was just with my baby and sister and everything was so horribly zzzz I just picked up things like I was super thinking about should I think that or should I pick this so in this between I just forget to buy primer but it's okay it's okay I'm taking this PD and have some cosmetics primal through it on one hand I mean uh participating it all these I'm gonna be just full of it and if I have to get over this prime alpha [Music] like you can literally see how it

like enough babe but you can see it's really great the packaging is so cute and it costs me around cost me three year old $0.50 I mean three hundred fifty cents a little brush what we will be finding out if it working well or not if it worked it and okay so we got in just I mean this is a little cool screen but I mean if it's like for your face you can do it easily which I find really decay so just get the brush oh it's not so hard and it's not soft I mean this is like perfect soft and perfect hard for your face but you can find it easily and also it's not being harsh a little bit mixing it so how big is putting it all over my face and it does smell a little it do smell like a strong perfume so basically it's my first time that I'm using this color right looking great for my skin I mean oh goodness you just see how it's culprit and my face is looking so good I mean wow I mean I'm loving the finish it's like a great finish hmm I'm loving it I mean this brush is also doing wonders how well it's planting what I really loved about this foundation it's not too fast crying which is quite good it turned out so well I mean I'm really they happy about it I mean it have covered quite good my scars and my pimples and everything which is so good but what I really wanted to choose from private was really liked it for your cheap prices that we're really affordable so I came across this one of concealer from them and concealer stick so they are like this small and they cost each one-year-old fifty sons I mean for when you're fifty cents you are getting like one stick which is so cheap and so affordable but let's find out if it's working Green is putting it on this is why well you select white chalk okay and it's not disease yellowish but let's do it so I'll be putting it on my nose here be taking this blending brush and I will be blending it okay so this it's a little bit like them I'm so sorry program cutest I mean how I can just have some great expectations from when you're 50 cents a small stick I mean I'm not judging it back may the shade for me is not good or maybe because of that it's not looking good because overall start I guess I think it's the blending brush is really doing great so if I see it's not looking back at all I mean these two have this warm tones on my face however I didn't like the concealer part because it's too too too light for me and it was my mistake to not get the right shade and now I will fix my foundation and everything with the article fixing powder and I'm loving this one a lot cheekbones I will be using today this eyebrows pencil by Benefit Cosmetics and I am in love with your product and if you can see tada oh my god look at these small little gorgeous palettes I mean they are looking so great palettes and they come up with like they came with this exact small palette which you can carry along and it have all things so each of so each of them goes to meet trio $0.50 I mean 3 or 50 cents and you will get this gorgeous palace so this is really really great each of them have nine shades in it and as you have seen in my previous videos that I have this Emeril obsessions by the dead beauty palette and it's the dupe of this the dupe of that pallet I mean if you can see so it has exact same shade not exact but it has kind of same shades and is the hope every day eye shadow palette and you can see here and this one right here is the prologue eyeshadow palette and oh look at the shades mostly I will be going away this gorgeous palette today because I have tried to scream a roller shades before and I really wanted to give a try to this gorgeous palette right here and we will be just sing it all over my crease also they are really pigmented pigmented you can see so they are quick to put it blend they did this transition pink shades right there so now I will be putting a little bit darker shade of pink are now meeting this two shades right here and I'll be also planning along I will be doing it otherwise hello eyes because I really like I really feel that this hello eyes will be really really great for this look so I will be just creating cutting my crease with the start if she can't see the street right here this is like whoa and it cut out really really pretty and I will be putting it all over my eyes [Music] I will be taking this essence cosmetics us Kara it's from the newest mascaras and look at this cutie how pretty is this and of course they are so great like there's a lot of Disney themed of makeup like this literally Atlanta Palacios were really looking great and this cost me - your 50 Cent's I mean 40 or 50 cents you will get a feel like so guys I back I sponsor these lashes and as much as I wanted to love them but they were so hard to put them I mean they were the abandon that this bad of this Irish is so hard to even buy I did you know this was so hard and I couldn't just put it and fix it on my eye I mean I just put a lot of glue on my eyes which I'm not even comfortable and if you can smile like this one eyelashes I corner is not just sitting in right position I mean I have tried putting on glue on the lash on the skin I mean like 20 times and my eyes is going to be like a 10 with each other but not the leash with so disappointed so what's next what we will be doing is I will beat this cutie oh let me show you the most secret for it from primer which I really really loved by me and I'm so excited to open it so beautiful I even don't want to touch it because the packaging is so so cute a bit expensive as you can see is for 4 euros and it's a lipstick and it's of course a new chain and will be updated so look at this lipstick I mean ooh smashing my sweater so so look at this oh it have oh if you see here it's like a magnet type and you just leave it in an old so look at this shape right here so so pretty really pretty and so pre Shia's i mean it would be really like my favorite favorite product from Primark [Music] small get the shade oh my god so good kitty it wouldn't be like my favorite favorite around for a really long time because I am so annoying when it comes to shoes because there's not my perfect fit in pinkish I actually also bought another one lipstick from Primark - and it's like you know this tube of huda beauty power bullet lipsticks or anything [Music] the shade is like dark pinkish cut up which I really like as you can see it's a little bit making it dog but I love it you can see it's like this dark shade of color to take it was my this highlighter and I will eat just putting it all in my face so guys my lip is completed and the whole look is really really pretty I am in love with this purplish look and as much as I like the look so this was all the products when I wore from primer and the most of it was and every product what I really like from problem was absolute this will stay right here because the sheet is completely completely gorgeous and packaging - and I love really their foundation who really worked for me and it really is matching my skin tone and it's really looking good the concealer however I didn't like but it's okay and we really have their own choice and everything I mean the eyeshadow palette is really great I mean for someone who is not into makeups for mothers they can really have it then play with the colors a little bit but ABS food overall I

guys this is the Irish pit bull away it's gonna be medical video oh wait I believe we'll keep this real short I'm aiming for a minute or less this is some cut-and-dried purple kush I make common reference to it in the hydroponic and the organic also in the cloners it's the strand that real familiar with this is just kind of a pilot an ounce of it so ever since I got the purple I got the purple a lot of growers can throw a lot of nitrogen or just extreme cold in to several different strains that will react with a purple coloring or tinting doesn't necessarily mean it's got the THC development or complexity of a purple kush plan so just wanted you guys to see some of the crystalling in this bud this is real average this isn't it's a super heavy bud or anything this is just when I picked out of the owl so they have right now laying around so this is the purple if I can give you better video in broad daylight I will just picked up a medical supply tonight and this is some of it and just thought you guys might want to take a look you can see some of the classic fingering in there like a this is shot from an iPhone so the resolution isn't super high but if you look at some of this bud and we started pushing it's real dankey super sticky I could probably break a piece off stick it to my fingers and show you guys how how sticky this is but this is a legitimate purple kush strain and again it's not crossed it's uh it's a real real hard plant to grow but when you do you can get high yields out of it and the quality is amazing so there you go everybody talked about purple kush here is a brief video of it we'll go back down to the so the pile for you just show you some of this stuff this is here is Nivas ounce so if that gives you an idea of how how large it is that's there you go Irish people out for a push hydroponic organic we're also growing the sense I star mighty mites UK cheese obviously the cush and there's one or two in there I'm forgetting Northern Lights soon to come stay tuned guys subscribe rate comment Pyrus pitbull", "E2lS79LAc9k": "mmm I just wanted to do something great hey guys welcome again to my channel I am so glad that you guys are here and watching me record again because I really love doing this for time um thank you so much old and new subscribers guys that has been following me for very long time I've been doing this two years a year right now and I really just want to share some little enthusiastic your creation this is a uh okay not a dream come true that is exaggerating this is not a dream come true but it is cool to have a feeling that you know people are just you know like Afghan disco is somewhere cool so I'm just going to okay what i'm loving too much this video is this week about her shape braids and i'm totally digging the colored it's time it's purple and i'm going to do a walk-through so stay tuned I do apologize for the Lightning right now as you can tell from the recording earlier on its much dark here and getting here my kids net needed me earlier on so i had to stop recording yes the duty of a mom never ends it never ends so this is the crochet braids and the hair that i use for the ultra grade of connection on premium that looks like this it's partly deep purple and i totally totally dig this car it's really cute very nice and like I soon as the color purple is a connecting on fiber so you can curl this here so first of all about my own natural hair it's been six months and I'm so excited it's really growing I've been taking care of it and praying and it's doing very well and um I can say the difference between its and relaxing is way much bigger because it's just so full and it covers everywhere and I'm just really happy with it and even though I color it every like sometimes even I color it's like one week two times a week with a semi-permanent coloring it's that still does very well I shall kudos to my head back to my crochet braids I first braided it as you can see here my braiding patents were all back I just put really chunky braids and then I started a crochet phrase i did not use a lash it hook or a what we have in constant here is the hopes that she used to like into the dude I'm speaking Dutch right now no I used a normal bobby pin because that works for me and what I actually did most people already how you do the crochet braids that you insert the pin or the rush it hook into the fray you put the hair on a tour through the eye of the pain pull it out and then you then push the hair to the the whole of the extensions and you pull it tight you make sure you twist your fingers a few couple of times like that so that it stays very secured and then there you have it it's very easy I apologize if you don't understand a thing but just look in my mini video that's here somewhere and you understand where this is very very easy to do so um my as you can see my hair is in different layers and then if you notice it but I do the top is shorter and down is longer and all you need to do so to make sure that when this hair divided into you divided again and then you get different layers is all a preference afterwards well when I finish really likes the end result the straight though for some things like wow this is really nice and I don't really like straight hair or me it makes it look different but I did like how this hair looks straight and I've seen so many videos and then also an Instagram girls that works trade by first doing a blowout and then they curl it even with a curling iron which is surprising because I'm like wow doesn't even melt people are now you producing good products amazing yo I mean the hair that I used to use back in the day there was no way it was going to call that hair without smelling some plastic feeling some hardness now it's different that's a good thing anyways what I did is that I twisted it around a a perm rod and then I make sure I twisted it tight and then I got disco patent by also as a chart of turning it around the curl I put it into hot water and then I waited for like I think 20 seconds and then I took it out and there was a pro part and I really liked how it turned out as yeah funkier and its really well um I do love my other video where it's I think its sexy long crochet braids go check that out the curls there are much bigger so yeah I do lean more to that close what I can about there's nothing wrong with this ones as well like you know this ones are much softer than the ones of the Mardi brakes that's the one I'm talking about and yeah I just like the fun and the fullness out of it so uh yeah I hope you guys do enjoy doing it yourself if you're like okay I want to see how it is to do it with this type of here this type of it actually is also used for braiding so an ultra for twisting for twists so now you see how it is when colored anyway beautiful guys and girls out there thank you so much for watching this video and I hope you guys have questions if not thanks for watching anyway share the video if you like if you don't doesn't matter thank you so much guys for watching me and I hope you see you guys very soon god bless you jesus loves you he is the way the

back to the purple tulip workshop and I'm your host Shipra today I'm going to be taking you through the steps of how to make a linen stitch also known as a granite stitch or a ma stitch so let's get started today for this type of a stitch we're going to be requiring a ball of yarn I'm using a three ply 100% cotton yarn you can use anything which is available to you or whichever is required for your project and we require a locking pin to hold on to our loops just in case we're leaving up work in between a broad eyed needle this has a big eye so that the yarn can go through a cutting scissors and I'm using a hook which is a 4mm this is also known as a g size six so for this stitch type we're going to be working today on a linen stitch also known as a granite stitch or a ma stitch we're going to start off with our slip knot and for this stitch we require to have a foundation chain in even numbers so for my swatch I'm taking a chain of 20 you can chain as many as you want as per your requirement of your project so whatever the width you want for your project you do the chains accordingly I'm going to just quickly now make a foundation chain of 20 and I'll just come back so I have my foundation chain of 20 now we're going to be working on the second loop so we never count this loop on the hook this is the first loop and this is the second loop I like to work on my back loops so I'll be inserting my hook into the back loop off the second chain like this yarn over pull through we have two loops on the hook yarn over pull through both the loops now we'll do a chain one and we will be skipping this next stitch and working on the stitch after that so I'll put my hook into the back loop here yarn over pull through yarn over pull through both the loops chain one so this is how we go on with a linen stitch I'm going to complete this particular row and come till the end end take it true how to go forward from there so I've come to the near the end I'm going to work on the last edge here now so we have to do a chain one and then I'll insert my hook in the last back loop over here yarn over pull through so this is the first row of Glennon stitch now to move forward onto the second row we will do chain one turn our work around and we'll start working on these spaces that we created over here by doing the chain one and skipping that to back loops okay so I'm gonna insert my hook into space yarn over pull through yarn over pull through both the loops chain 1 and now insert my hook into this space again yarn over pull through yarn over pull through both the loops chain 1 I'm gonna continue the same way all the way till the end I'm going to just finish the second row and come till this pin part and I'll show you how to work on this tricky turning point so I've come to the last portion nearly lost I'm going to insert my hook in the space yarn over pull through then chain one and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna work on this particular loop that was created by our chains so this is actually xx chain that we did on a foundation chain so that's the loop from the 20 chain and what we're gonna do is we're going to insert a hook in this particular chain yarn over pull through yarn over pull to put the loops so this is how you work on your turning-point chains then we'll do chain one work forward onto the third row turn our work around and work into the spaces that is created over here when we are skipping one loop over here so we have the space so voltage then chain one hook into that space hook into that space chain one and we continue award like this right till the end so I've come to the end of this particular row again we have to work on the turning point so this is the loop that we work on this is the chain one that we did over here in the second row so now we're going to insert a hook into this chain loop yarn over pull through yarn over pull through both loops then we'll do chain one and we'll continue on working on to this particular stitch we can work as many Rosi one two I'm just gonna complete this swatch and I'll come back till the end of the swatch where we have tilt that and I'll teach and then I'll show you how to just finish the work from there I've come to the end of this particular swatch I've done a 14 drawers and this is just completed my square swatch now to finish or we will be doing a chain one and we'll pull onto this loop and we'll slip it and then pull onto this towel to lock the stitch and now what we can do is we can just get a broad eye needle this is also known as a darning needle and we'll just thread this needle and we can weave the work into our stitches over here and like I've just woven detail ends over here into my existing stitches and this tail as well over here into the existing stitches I'm going to just snip off these extra yarn this is now just completed uh swatch so you see you can now see what the linen stitch looks like we have these beautiful V's falling into each space that we created early on by skipping these stitches it's a really gorgeous stitch like a basket weave so you can make a basket out of this stitch so it looks really nice so if you liked

office still a bit of a supply come with sit a minute it was no work and doing actually paid this myself yeah handheld painting but yes I would decided to sit facing each other a few people I said you know works a little bit better to watch a podcast doing like this so I just want be satisfied away from each other today but this episode is what's happenin lab saw the new series the last one got sort down yeah yes all the last episode got taken down so you could technically say this is the first episode so I won't think of what to talk about this week is obviously the movie versus it's now available on Netflix star in hora con a swindle directed by Ted Lily as well go and check out the movie is available on Netflix did you watch it yet yeah they have yeah I watched it when it was on Sky actually paid for it so guys store what do you think everyone know why it was a battle rap to be honest he's not really my finger yeah and nevertheless he enjoyed the film obviously cuz we know shy and well you know him I just fun boy him I said it's a good film money enjoy did you know we were writing in it the the girl who rapped on beat page KK yeah yeah she was she always did have one little bit yeah what she was yeah I fought EB I'm gonna happiness so controversial same reverses I fought the last pot all without Adam wins I thought he got killed by showing that you know he quit halfway for him and he let Paige ukq step in and finish his round off which she's like a no-no in battle rap oh yeah so I do oh you go first yet then you slag me for a few minutes and there's a fight yeah yeah waiting to kick in then it's my gold you [ __ ] mean by that what always supposed to be rapping funny boom you've been to events before what you've like stayed for one battle you're confident but you came to probably about holes match day free Manchester at the venue it's a long as you've stayed that event well yeah let me just say first I saw massive fan of rap meanwhiie grime yeah I've been from day one since Dizzee Rascal and all that's yeah I stayed on the ground went groundwork cool you know what I was asked ruffle listen to it everyone was like I've been listening to ground since day one yeah you've always thought we go hey I had a gold chain with a cross on it you know when everyone smoked in grams always been my finger and I like the rap music and the ice who do the rock bar wins yeah yourself all of your bison brings ease music I love shoulders music and odd bits for my lunacy and the aware of his bar up to make some good songs here and yes or not each item anymore won't be Spotify bill I'll rap so much as I'm able you disclose I shot he's always been one of my favorite I so listen so yeah like I even loved his indie stuff now I think he's probably the better than his rap and yeah the type of guy to listen to yeah yeah but still [ __ ] dance on tables so new album and now yeah [ __ ] yeah the the battle raps not my thing basically that's that's the point Ron what do you think turns you off bowel wrap because he let you say you like rap you like I'll be honest yeah I went to that last event yeah yeah that you'd have yeah yeah I think so bunch of jewels acting

me yeah I like the battles on beat and I like grand balls yeah you don't like like the old like my except the a cappella finger I'm not billions I grew up with sin Schwimmer yeah yeah but I'm not very into the hip hop anymore and don't get me wrong I prefer like someone who's massive and me sorta morning such a shot a battle rap yeah who's obviously brilliant or what it does it's not necessarily Michael Bertie be I was cause I'm not a big fan of battle rap I preferred a more comical sides of him yeah you like jaded a big J yeah I thought I don't get me wrong have not much many bow yeah I'm

we're working on um this is the hour that we're working on um it's called the colors of salvation afghan and it is from this wonderful wonderful knit and crochet bible study devotional um journal by terry and porter stitched in christ i don't know if you guys have read this or seen this or anything like that but i'ma share with you this yeah and so it has at the end of the devotional there is the project called the colors of salvation afghan and each panel is a different color that represents um the salvation message story so yeah so the first one was orange we already did that um the second one is white you know some are still working on why i.e me okay still working on white one but um today we started the gold one and if you don't mind the crazy world of caden can you crochet mask yeah if you want to do i i have it because you know i've been making other stuff um but i do have masks and um but yeah you can crochet masks that is for sure and i had a pattern that i was going to be working on actually for that tell you the truth and i ended up not working on it hi crochet every day with judy hello and hello proverbs 31 yard honey what's up so i want to share with you the color gold on what that represents if you don't mind yeah i'd like to share um the information what do i say information what it represents according to the word here so i'm going to read just a little bit you guys just bear with me i appreciate you feel free to hit the thumbs up i curl shade a mask i don't care for it felt how it felt on oh yeah you know what nancy's hooked on crochet i thought about that um have you um did you use like what kind of yarn you use like the one that i started i use the simply soft carrying and i'm not done with it i started it but it's in a box because i was like i'll get to it later i don't i don't want to do that when i can just go get a mask and um people were crocheting those little attachments like they had little buttons on it you can put behind your head and just instead of hooking it on your ear you hook it on this little attachment that had a button on each side and um you can attach it yeah use cotton yeah yeah i probably wouldn't yeah that's too hard okay yeah yeah i know the crazy world of caden honey i could yeah i know that's sad but yeah i've been working on other stuff i haven't had a desire to i tried it when the first you know for everything's first happened i was like i need to crochet a mask and then i was like i don't know the caring cakes oh i'm using um yeah they're extenders that's what they're called proverbs 31 yard they're called extenders they're like these little they're little uh rectangles uh crochet um items with button on each side and you put your instead of putting around your ear you put it on this little extender it's really kind of neat yeah judy i might hand it or use a machine yeah let's see i crochet and gave 12 dozen ear savers to my local hospital for the nurses and other employees that's great judy yeah dallas that's a lot of masks oh yeah for sure my friends sewed some they are light and pretty more comfortable yeah for sure now to me you got there's a lot you have to do if you do a crochet one like i was thinking there's got to be some t-shirt material you put on the inside or something that you sew inside and all that i don't do all that i was looking at buying a um sewing machine to do it but i i didn't so no i wouldn't i'm not gonna but i will uh direct everybody who wants one to those who are making them yeah that's so sweet yeah awesome i made so many for my sister she is a nurse and took them to her co-workers as well that's so sweet that's so sweet proverbs 31 look at the gifts just flowing in the chat my good gracious yeah kelly where do we get the pattern for the colors of salvation again okay layla if you want i will drop the link in the chat so you can grab it up how about that let's do that i'm going to drop the link to the pattern you guys this pattern is free if you're interested in trying it with us please feel free to do so let me oh happy and um if you want here it is there it is i also gave some to my local walmart grocery store and a couple of restaurants i just feel bad that all those employees have to put up with ear paint yes judy that's a great idea you know what i didn't think about it like that maybe i can do something like that when i'm just sitting around just chilling because you can bless somebody anytime yeah whether it's a hat scarf or an extender that would be nice yeah so let me um so anyway this is the book you guys and so the color gold that we're working on i just want to read the uh the part about it it's not long you guys i promise it's only a few um just a paragraph okay it's not really big so basically the color gold is used to represent heaven as described in revelation chapter 21 and verse 18 and the city was pure gold jesus is preparing a home for you and me he promises to take us to that home in john 14 uh verse two and three oh lord my dogs they telling us all about it okay um who is that that is raven my dogs they gotta say it sorry you guys and it says um in my father's house are many matches i'm going to prepare a place for you i will come back and take you to be with me your heavenly home is under construction right now so isn't that a blessing so um there is a specific pattern for it um for this particular panel and that's what we're working on so if you get go ahead and grab that link and check it out i think you guys would really like it um if you want to work on this wonderful project with us um i haven't finished the second one i'm almost i'm close but no cigar so this one this is the this is the gold panel so i'm starting it so it's going to be it's going to be pretty should i pull it up so you guys can really see see it so y'all can see what it's going to end up looking like i'm going to do that i'll pull it up so you can see let's see i've been wanting uh to buy m95 masks and talk them and talk them to the home and take them to the homeless and pass them out to them oh that'd be nice yeah why not i need help with this yes grandma anna i did too okay

guys are interested in seeing this say judy save the day yeah okay i think his grandma was a grandma anna okay grandma anna so let's talk about it a little bit uh the stitch the way it's made right so this is where i was getting confused um and uh helen j here has helped me understand the way we were i was doing it was just fine um it looks weird because we're doing the back it looks it's the back of it so when you flip it over you'll be at the front of it if that makes sense once you get through the row you flip it over it's like oh this is the front so let me show you what i mean this is it right here all right let me make that small let me remove that for a second let me show you what i mean so this is what the back look like this is what i started with and i was like this ain't right this is so not right but when you turn it over honey uh it's right it's right this is the right side okay all right grandma anna so all right grandma anna let's go ahead and get started with so

double crochets right so now we have to skip two let me get this guy in here so we skip the next two can you see we skip um this one and this one not not where this is stitches just skip the next two stitches so it's this one and this one you work in the third stitch does that make sense let me know yes no maybe so okay thank you guys for responding y'all are some rock stars in this chat um so this is where we begin our um triple or treble stitch okay so we skip one two and in that third one that's where we come in to this stitch and we go ahead and treble so you know how to treble so that's not a problem so you treble in the next two this one here one two and there it is now now that we did that can you see it okay how do i flip it auntie dane i don't know you know what i don't know how do i flip it so i'm not upside down do i need to turn my camera around is that what it is let me let me try it let me try to turn my camera around you guys let me um let me try to fix it real quick because that could be just me being all upside down okay all right that's better oh shoot we can see it okay let me start over all right y'all this is right now thank you all for your patience okay all right so we did the triple are you okay with the triple uh treble stitches grandma anna are you okay with that just say yes type in yes you can if you can type it in the regular comments is fine too i know you get to type in the private chat too i don't know which one you get okay so you fine with that cool all right so now this is where it's gonna get crazy sorry i had my mic muted oh no wonder i couldn't hear you girl grandma anna is in the chat uh okay yeah i'm fine with the even the first uh cross it's after that oh okay let's go ahead do it then let me go ahead and get through that all right um let's see so then on the next step is to you go behind behind the front yep you go behind and you do let me see i'll make sure i'm in this stitch i think i am this is where it looks crazy it looks crazy on this side you guys okay and then you do the next stitch you go behind and do it right right oh sorry here i go come on one two all right so this is the easy part right here well it gets crazy it looks crazy so then after you get to that part then it says to skip the next two stitches so we gonna skip the next two stitches right yeah and then we're going to come over and we're going to do the treble in the next two right can y'all see let me see let me see okay here we go get in there get in there come on in the room i always want to double crochet when i know it's triple drop out get in here okay so then after you do that now we go to the front so we um treble so it says okay then it says working in front two and working in front of the two that we just made you're going to do tremble in the next two right so basically you're going to do this you're going to be you're going to come to the front see did you see that well right in the front and boom oh come on lord let me let me do it over hold up come on one two three you gonna come to the front and i go in this way does that make sense yes yes and no okay all right so let me show you the second one so basically we're coming to the front and we're going to go behind the first stitch the first uh stitch that we're in right it says in front yeah we're in front but i'm in front i'm still in front girl i'm going behind it i'm in front but i'm going in the front of this stitch as well does that make sense yes no maybe no right yeah i guess yeah i know if you're um on that first one that's in front um it's a are you having to take your yarn does your yarn go over just that's hard to describe okay let me i'll take it out again and so you can watch okay okay i did my two you did we got our two trebles right yeah let's go ahead and prepare for the next one that's gonna go in front yarn over okay so once we do that we take it all the way over here and and you're not gonna go in the front just go to the back you're gonna go in the back to the front does that make sense of that stitch right here see it let me do it again let me show you hold on i think i got it okay yay you're gonna yeah you're just gonna pull it back a little bit and just go in the front of that stitch yarn over yarn over go through two yarn over go through two i believe i got it girl yes and then we do the second one the same way i knew this was this was the challenge right here girl i knew it was this this is crazy but once you get this part honey it is going to be smooth selling and there we are and it's going to look like this you got it i believe i got it yeah that makes me so happy okay all right so now once we get to that part then we're gonna um we're going to let's see we're going to dc in the next three that's it double crochet in the next three stitches one so double crochet in the next three two and three did you get that yep okay now here's where the fun part begins all over again we go back up where it says skip the next two stitches so we're gonna skip two one two and we are going to do another treble crochet in the next two so we skip two treble crochet and one here and then we're going to do it again in the next stitch beside it now here we go to the fun part again this is the fun part so we yarn over we're going to do we're going to do um working behind the two trebles we just made we're going to do it all over again we're going to treble stitch going behind we're going to go in the back this time right and go straight to the back that's what we're going to do and that's it and we're gonna treble crochet come on and we're gonna do it again trouble and the next stitch in the back behind it now after we've done that we're going to do um we're going to skip two which is one two and we're gonna start our we're gonna do treble crochet in the next two stitches okay did you get to that part yeah okay now now we're gonna um we're going to uh go in the front we're going to do it all over again that front remember we came to the front yeah we're going we're gonna pick that one up right here we're gonna get in there get your little happy self in there haley don't play with me girl don't mind me i'm talking to my hook so [Laughter] like putting yourself in there playing with me today okay so that's one two and then we're going to do it again in the next stitch beside it go back behind it we're in the front we're gonna grab that and now we have to do we have to do three double crochets in the next three stitches so here we go one two and three and that's it that's it that's all and it should look like this okay i got it and then when you flip it over that's the right side this is when you're gonna see it you're gonna be like oh that's it yeah that's it and that's all that's all we do the same thing the same thing so we gonna get this girl that's it yeah well thank you uh for you oh yeah no problem because i was working it out today honey i was like

temperature yeah i put it on 400 and i put in there for like 20 minutes what size i'm talking about like a medium mine was huge i had a huge big potato oh you put on 100 yeah i put them before i had a huge big potato you stabbed it or anything yeah i stabbed it but the potato was huge do you have a a area where you can select what how are you going to make it like is it going to be air fryer is it air baked is it not it you know i got a cheap one turn it off and turn it to the temperature and how long do you want to cook it that's it oh okay i my husband we we got one for um christmas and this one is a space saver oh so you can flip it up it's like it's not round like everybody has those round ones i wanted something that didn't take up a whole lot of space so it's long like a toaster oven but you can put a pizza in it you poop on it too but you um just flip it up and it sits up it don't take up no real estate on the counter i like that i like that zone yeah then we got the clear one

gets home okay that's cool yeah i think the one i put in like 25 minutes or something it adds up to about 25 minutes or so if i remember good i'm not sure though it all depends on the size of the potato that that potato is huge okay and i didn't know now you i'm talking my phone it was talking back to me oh my gosh she says mine is like a mini oven does pizza and anything a bigger oven can do

which is the head in the arm and then i'm going to go into a full doll small doll first and then i'm going to go into a bigger like a 18 inch dollar other dog i'm going to do is probably like maybe a 12 or 13 inch and then i want to go into the 18 i mean the 22 was the 18 inch i think 18 is over there oh wow you are moving and grooving too cause i've always been scared of doing ammo grooming but i'm going to try it yeah years ago i did a little acorn and it didn't it didn't to me it didn't look right so i i got rid of it oh wow it came out kind of cock-eyed actually but you know it was my attempt yeah i'm trying to get him to go in the right direction yeah i like doing it i sewed his eyes on and his ears are crooked but that's what it is it's cute yeah it's cute i just want to do like little like heads of something like maybe uh like a bunny or a teddy bear or a lion head and i want to sew them on to uh baby blankets that i make big institutions got a whole bunch of those yeah what do you call them when you just do the heads and stuff where you can put like as an embellishment on a blanket i love you i always have a little flat piece not the whole emma groomy are you doing that right like an applique yeah but uh but it is like it is stuff maybe it's a bunny and it yeah is it flat or is it like like puffy she says stuff oh i don't know it's a lovely that's what i'm talking about making i'm making a lovely as well you put like a little stuffed animal and you add a little blanket too it's like a lovey it's for babies what you would do is a mom would kind of like carry with her like hold it with her either put it up on her shirt or sleep with it somehow to get her her body uh smell on there and then once you give it to the baby it helps them transition from the bed to the crib and they can have hold on to this loving it's not like a little security blanket ordeal and they can smell mommy and they don't feel like they won't get in that bed it's easy for them to sleep in the crib or by themselves because they still have that smell of mommy with them oh i see thank you brenda you make it ordeal gnaw on it and chew on it the head of the uh stuffed animal and all that type of stuff too yeah that's what i want to make something like that is that what you're doing yeah that's the next thing i'm going to do after this i'll do my dog first and now i'm going to

lobby those they look like they're cute like they come in all different designs yeah just buy a brand new one you stick and you put some complimentary yarn you know you pick a color that matches it

university of the chat but she don't need to see anything uh got some pretty colors too so it don't bother me one way or the other yeah it might be cool they're about the same yeah yeah about the screen yeah exactly that's why i always used to say that when i was together i mean literally the colors are so close you can taste them like when they play each other i confuse who's what who's running yeah they play each other and they both had to wear home uniforms it was the most confusing thing ever mm-hmm it was so confusing something happened nerdame had to play and they left a home jersey or something or they home jerseys oh they looked their weight jerseys oh yeah and they end up having to play each other in white and green white and gold jerseys it was so confusing that's confusing it was terrible i was like who got the ball [Laughter] i didn't know who had the boy was so i literally renamed it was so confusing wow that's the same color yes that's just the way it is

more to the list News 10s McManus le shows us why this hero's homecoming was so special and why it almost didn't happen Nick yeah well Christina before we go we got to the airport we knew the homecoming of US army corporal Jairus Perez was going to be special but then we met her a four-year-old who hadn't seen her daddy in nine months and just could not stand to wait any longer we have been counting down for weeks before whatever reason you need to see what suspense looks like so today you should have seen four year old Sidney coming home Sidney daddy's homecoming means even more though because it almost didn't happen Myra stopped I know what to think and what to do US army corporal Jairus Perez leads a special team in Afghanistan last week that team was attacked with an improvised explosive device shrapnel hit Perez in the arm and the hip just inches from his grenade when I heard his voice I knew my boys okay so sure it was a setback but nothing was going to keep him from his grandma his mother his brother and certainly not the camouflage boots filled by the youngest love of his life besides just seeing all you guys all the support stuff he's he's great Greg is great to see her she's gotten big it's just I'm lost for words yeah say purple heart too huh oh yeah that's the second reason this homecoming was so special just days before shipping home Perez was given that Purple Heart and maybe to come a medal for bravery minutes after that explosion while they were still being attacked Perez found an unconscious comrade and pulled him to safety make sure he wasn't bleeding anywhere and then I said hey look at me my hip kind of hurts he took a quick glance at me and told me I was bleeding I was like alright cool put man a donk let's go Robbie so kiss bye kiss Jairus will ease back into civilian life but only for two weeks because he says there's a job that needs to be done even if that means more suspense in the place he'd much rather be I just give me home that's really so it could take four weeks for a full recovery and then he's got two weeks off and then another three months overseas and that he could potentially be right back here in Sacramento for good now there are several other untold stories part of the second senior cheering up still a little bit i'm told stories the first part is that on the day of that attack he actually had pneumonia it was not supposed to be with his unit he said there was no way i am staying behind and of course as many service when a woman dead he enlisted in the army the day after 911 no kid he's the kind of guy that makes us all so proud yeah wow he is a soldier soldier I just can't wait for the day that that he and his comrades are back here for good and he also mentioned before I left the airport he said please make sure that we send prayers and thoughts to everyone else overseas because he said there are so many others that we time to forget about and he said this floor in Afghanistan and Iraq is far from over despite what we've seen Oh welcome home enjoy your family", "rP5jV9ydS9M": "hi folks just polished off some Afghans these were from afters and designs I actually did these for off to the right here I think you might have seen those I have placed them up just to spruce them up a bit little bit of a mix of grass and stones I had I'd like to use some of the finer stuff on basing and just a few of the stones so as you can see that's quite nice great the only thing that people might quibble over is I suppose I don't know if you'd have the mix of colors like grey stones and over Sandy stone I'm not sure but it cause be rubble or something like that I like to have lots of different i'm stand to collect all the java seniors ready mixed packs and they're quite reasonable for all the well the variety of it that you get in there those quite handy and they're good for a tabletop standard you know if you want really want to take things to display standard you could be looking at some of the nicer basing to your stuff they've got out there but for me just going through my lead hunting it's just the job you know you looking couple of feet away there based you know if you can put through Tufts on that to spruce them up I think that works out really nicely and does the job maybe I should say I've just put one on a cap of rocks just to give you a bit of a view so about the pool lighting I haven't if you have a light box but I'm not sure what improvement that would be when taking videos I know that I like to take pictures using that I might give the light box a go sometime I do have another overhead light if I just turn that on it doesn't seem to make much of a difference so these are the Afghan regulars have got a section of a tier and therefore the second Afghan war the White has now well I have tried to improve the method this one was heavily using the shade that I bought i bottled that into a convenient little squeezy bottle it's a sepia wash these clear bottles are very handy you can buy a pack of twelve from eight of ten bottles and I think I got those done in Firestone but I'm sure they're available on eBay very nifty to have clear bottles like that the squeezy bottles I know some people don't like those kinds of bottles but for me there well I must say I prefer them to the Games Workshop for bottles which I'm quite a clumsy person sighs always knocking those over man the Nomo is fairly expensive for the amount that you get it was quite wasteful so anyway back to it keep your Washington nice I don't know if you can see but it's in the recesses so I had that well I think I had Vallejo silver gray mixing with a bit of off-white which I've start to replace with or added I should say I'm some ivory is interesting in there so if you're just mixing around your whites it's worth picking up ivory its covers a bit better than off-white it's less than so that stands up better for covering over darker colors and don't be afraid at how yellowish you think is that is some tint in there but if you look at any white in the real world barely ever get brilliant white so don't be too afraid of using that I was looking at something oh I think it was in the Indian Mutiny book that I just received I was hunting down the Osprey book and I've I had found some on eBay and also my favorite bookstore on online there's a books aid a B e-books but people as having 40 pounds because the copy is out of print now completely I contacted Osprey publishing if they would consider bringing out of print but unless there's a demand for it it doesn't look like it's going to be back so I'd really picked up an old copy I was about to buy just that but I actually had a really good deal of three Osprey books for a tenner it was a Saladin which was one that I didn't want buy or flick through but it was worth it just to get the other two which was the Indian Mutiny and there's a book which is third in a series on the Victorian British army and that one mainly covers India and Afghanistan maybe maybe the Crimea as well so that was really handy to have because I really wanted the color plates for painting the in the mutiny should I should I get round to it but at the moment I'm definitely on a little ban from buying miniatures and I'm just trying to get through what I have so these are on the way and the stain worked really well Adana fit shows better on the folds and it's subtle you know sepia settle was basically hitting it with a hammer if you go for dark brown or black wash over white I think just want a little bit of darkness just bring out the folds and usually I'm lazy on the cross belt and I'd barely ever paint the metallic clasps if I have done that and it's nice just a block outline it with a bit black the facings are light blue which i managed to achieve using field blue and lift-off uniform World War 2 that gave you a nice stuff one coat light blue covered really well I've mixed in so some of the trousers are white the tunics are red I think there's quite a lot of flat red in there yes cavalry burn or flat red I think and well happy those no black gray for the leather and yeah job done so those Oscar Hawkins you'll probably see a video from me quite soon because I'm coming to the end of the Grenadiers enough to do quite a few stuns I've got a lot of them in bear skins they're going to form a few stands of branded ears I'm going to have enough probably for a combined battalion of grenadiers which you see sometimes I was reading about Borodino and they're definitely battalions of you have seen a full Grenadier battalions so you don't always have to have them just as a company you know at the end maybe that goes without saying I already know that old guard grandi is you know you feel those in battalions but be more regular Grundy's that those often came with banded together and they've got different starting back powder I take it aren't sure whether - sorry I should be showing you something now I wasn't sure whether to bang together some battalions of altar gears and treat them as line infantry you know is that possible just have like enormous a light infantry battalion because you can have light infantry and those are in dark blue uniforms usually for the dark blue trousers as well so that's worth considering but then I've got lots of both the gays always wondering that I could ban those together into battalions and I've got officers and drummers for them that's the big thing so there's not much point just putting them out screen machine if I've got the drummer on the lot inna probably won't give them a flag bearer but I've got some some pupils Bugler's yeah there's also a rock strip diorama to be finished I've green stuffed mealybugs and I've put a plastic as assegai sticking out of it and I've got the historical rock strip characters there Bromhead chard Co sergeant Bourne and the historical hook which I really like because hooks a really interesting character in the historical narrative you know and some some casualties for the Napoleonic Wars as well just going to send these Afghans off to Sean who brought them as a commission he's picked up my French Foreign Legion and I think you watch some Afrikaans for me previously the Highlanders I believe so my second Afghan walk collection is been sold off completely because I wasn't walking it war gaming it and that's one of the criteria for what I keep and I wasn't intending on war gaming it either I'm trying to narrow but also expand some small collections I really really like the angles of a war staying all my bolt-action and stuff elves have lots walk into that so yeah lots to think about then just get through this led mountain it's definitely dwindling I don't know if I can show the the cupboards sorry about the mess so the drawn drawers here they should be labeled really one of the cupboards of shame with some things primed up there there's some French Napoleonic dragoons I know it doesn't look very organized but there's some organization my head to it there's some French Napoleonic so that I peeled off I don't really want to paint those right right now think the dragoons are high up on the list with I don't have any cavalry for the Napoleonic cause yet in there then that's not stuff to be immediately painted but getting there it's it's nice to have some stuff at staff painted because it didn't take long to finish those off in the purple box then there's the last of my and resolve the war metals and right the back there some foundry metals I've nearly finished some Highlanders and throughs and there's either pulling Innova scope he'll I believe mounted cavalry officer and some Vietnam NVA those are primed up I've got some Fossum Jaeger primed that but they're not India the bottom drawers oh this was my plastic and metal mounting so it's very quickly getting cleared out metals that I've got left now in a smaller box that's not the pile that it once was at leas the there are the franco-prussian war I think that Ralph and Liberator said they they were so there's a confirmation on those dismount the dragoons in the back they're not high on the list because I'm not skirmishing and Napoleonic write this in a second so they're not a priority as you would say got some of the kr cases which was handy and a big supply of baking paper so that's my wet palette Oh maybe that'll feature in another video well some Dark Age warriors and then the rest and there's actually painted to be fair there's some dwarves for my fantasy collection and yeah that's about it Dark Age warriors have to think what we're going to do those may be multi base them and they can be combined with some my wash metals to form some battalions I would be sold off or if I have some moment of madness and decide to collect a hill Caesar army for the Welsh that would be a temptation definitely and or I could do them as Anglo Saxons in opposition to my watch it's always nice to have plastics but it's I'm just trying to get through everything I have and it seems to be working I must say the Confederates I've built up as you need to clean up the mold lines and prime them I've got two battalions out of one of the boxes all I have to do for to get two battalions is actually order one more sprue which I did very inexpensively I think is three pounds or four pounds and they're going to be one battalion of Fort Sumter Guard and the other battalion would be regular can't", "YyBHTaSFx7c": "yo yo yo what's good was good I know

too", "OIiOFv3ga94": "how's it going everybody little jumper back bay scale customers i just wanted a real quick video and let y'all know that the 57 Ford is in the purple pond mainly because I didn't like the clear this is the clear that I used because I got it on clearance there and figured what the hell I'll give it a shot but I just didn't like the way it polishes out I don't like the way it lays down I don't just do not like the clear so you know i'm going to go ahead and just redo it because i was very unsatisfied with it and I didn't want to some of those situations that if you're not unsatisfied with something and you just keep pressing forward that one little detail is going to stick out to you like a store sore thumb for forever you know so I'm going to get it done but good news is i can show you all the purple pond which i will do right quick so I'm going to pause the camera here and and show you how I do the perp upon so here we go okay I thought I could turn the camera around but obviously I can't this is the purple pond for me and it's just a red you know a tough box are nothing like autozone years ago but if you look there's a few bodies in there you know and here's the body right here if I just grab it with my fingers right quick and this stuff will dry your hands out there's the body you know it looks good you know what I mean it looks really good see how shiny and smooth it is it looks good it's in it's a good paint job it's a great paint job but I do not like the clear and it's really aggravating me so I'm just going to just redo it you know it's not going to take that long to redo but i'll show you all the process on how i get the stuff off of the car for the purple pond and everything and i think that i just add to the series but and i might even change the color up a bit who knows but here's the drain plug dear which is two separate pieces the frame is separate from the the chassis there but you know I also like to do you know different colors on the bottom of my car as opposed to the top much like NASCAR would do some cars that you know in the 80s they would flip over and someone would be grey underneath but others would be red or they'd be gold or they'd be white underneath whatever color so I like doing that too because it really breaks the I up and if you got certain details that you want seen you can you know change the color up a bit you know like in this case it shows the frame very well even though the frame is you know separate peace in this kit which is another thing i really like is when they they give us all this separate stuff because really you could build just this chassis if you wanted to and you can seal all the top of it up and you could build just the chassis and it could be like a rolling chassis and a diorama very cool lots of things you can do with stuff like that so I'm Little Joe back basically I'll customs I've been polishing on the hearse a little bit I'll get out in the light and see if it's going to be shiny oh yeah look at that that's a shiny car that's a journey care I don't know I don't know how this this camera this is a camera on the back side of my phone I don't know how it works but I found a really good new polishing thing that works really well and I get the car squeaky-clean tienda de polish but be careful this right here is badass for final polishing badass does a good job but alright guys I'm little joke back basically customs we'll see y'all later stay tuned and I've also decided that I'm going to be building the type 41 bugatti royale 116th scale vintage kit for the hunter selby tribute that I'm building trail so we'll see you guys later", "5eSExa10q3w": "hello everyone its Glenda and welcome back to my channel creative grandma this is just a short and sweet video to show you the six brand new colors that premiere yarns has come out with with their puzzle yarn I have used this puzzle yarn in several of my designs and it's a wonderful yarn to work with so first let me tell you about the yarn and then let me tell you about the six new colors so premiere puzzle yarn is 100% acrylic it is 328 yards it's 300 meters 7 ounces 200 grams it's a number 5 bulky weight yarn it is very very soft it is machine wash cold water tumble dry so great that it is wash and dryable so when you look at their label it says that it passed the standard 100 tests it was tested and approved against 350 plus harmful substances so this is great for even the most sensitive skin now this is one of the newest colors this is color number 10 50:31 hopscotch look at the gorgeous colors in that yarn this is big it's squishy it's cozy it's just you want to cuddle up in it it's great if you want to make those quick and easy comfy afghans and what I like of what premier yarn did this time was each color has an Afghan made with that color so let me get it up close look at this gorgeous Afghan that was made with this yarn you can see the actual Afghan worked up so I didn't make samples because every new color has the Afghan made in that color yarn so you can see what it's really gonna look like this one has those beautiful orange rust blue pink a little bit of purple mixed in just a fabulous color so the second color I have to show you is this beautiful I want to say earth town colors now I didn't think I would like this one but boy when I got at home I did really fall in love with this because I didn't expect it to be this pretty the website just did not do this color justice on the website maybe it's just the colors but when you get to see them up close and really see those colors now this one is color number 10 50 - 30 - dodge ball beautiful beautiful earthy tone colors and look at this Afghan that was made using this yarn here's the third color and this is color number 10 50 - 34 marbles so this is beautiful shades of what I want to say almost a really pastel mint green and then you have like a reddish orange mixed with that and then you go into more of Sun Golden yellows and more of an orange tone and look at how this blanket works up isn't that pretty and this is what I really like is because the labels are showing an Afghan made in the exact yarn and sometimes you'll see those yarn labels and they'll have the same color blanket on every label so you're still not sure what it's going to look like but this way it kind of gives you an idea now depending on what your pattern you're going to use it may differ a little but it gives you a really good idea of what this yarn is gonna look like when it's worked up so this I thought was really really pretty the fourth new color is 1050 - 30 this is called leapfrog this is really deep shades of I want to say a almost a midnight blue mixed with some green and then you have some purple and maybe a darker purple or darker Navy right there so I wasn't sure about this but I thought well I'm gonna order it in because I really wasn't sure about darker colors because I like those brighter colors but look at this Afghan isn't that gorgeous look at how pretty that Afghan is so when you see it worked up I really liked it I thought this is even prettier when it's worked up so again I really like that they put these Afghans on the label that matched the yarn very very helpful to us crochet errs so that is the fourth color the fifth new color is color number ten 50-33 and this is called double dutch look at these beautiful shades of I want to say kind of like just a medium brown mixed with almost tannish white Pink's dark pink you go into here and you see some purple and look at the Afghan that was made with this yarn oh my goodness absolutely beautiful isn't that stunning so when you look at these skeins of yarn it's really hard to tell you know how they're gonna work up but when you see a full-size Afghan it just really inspires you to honey get that yarn and make one of these up I thought this was really pretty for the spring and summer season so the last color I have to show you is color number 10 50 - 28 and it's called jacks and when you look at this yarn it has beautiful bright white and then lighter gray and then you go into that little bit darker gray and are you ready for it look at this Afghan that was made with this yarn this just reminds me of something that I would want to cuddle in maybe in the winter maybe make a great holiday Afghan with this it's neutral colors it would go with anybody's decor it's soft it's squishy it's just one of those colors that you know when it's cold outside and you have snow and you're inside and you can just grab your Afghan and it just I just thought it was a beautiful color for someone looking for that perfect color that would go with anybody's home decor and I just thought it was a beautiful Afghan so that was the six color and again that was color number ten fifty - twenty-eight jacks so those are the six new colors available at premier yarns comm website now I'll have a special link in the description box underneath the video where you can save 10% off a twenty five dollar order when you use that special link or you can save 15% off your very first order at premiere yarns thank you everybody I hope you enjoyed seeing the six new colors that premiere came out with for the premiere puzzle yarn I hope this got you inspired and until next time happy crocheting everyone", "d_9l5sBaBKI": "[Music] you you howdy folks good morning from gin - gin ooh something like that we are halfway up the track to Annapurna base camp as you can see there the first little glimpses of the snowy peaks there I am sore as heck it has been a very intense a couple of days carrying my backpack up these very steep ascents and everything but we were about to get back on the trail here so this is going to be a amazing adventure getting up to the base camp for annapurna mountain which is the 10th tallest mountain in the world at 8,000 meters or about 26,000 500 feet I am trekking with a couple of friends John from England and Phil from Germany and you will see them shortly I'm gonna hit the trail in a couple minutes and so there it is jinwu down there is where I stayed and up the steps this is one of the hardest a sense of the trail up to the base camp oh but what have you pan we're going up that way check this out folks that there is wild ganja ganja and goats and some kale or chard or something it looks like pretty cool deep in the Himalayan wilderness hey there you gonna keep following me another couple of weeks are doing this and I will be in some killer shape that's for sure because John and I are planning to do the annapurna circuit after this so this is the annapurna base camp trek which goes to the base of annapurna mountain and then we will be coming back down along with phil the german who promised to meet shortly there behind me i got started a little bit earlier earlier and phil will head back to town he doesn't have as much time and then john and i he and i then will continue from here connecting to the annapurna circuit and that is another three weeks or so so we got a long ways to go so this is phil from Germany did you see the wild ganja no there's a whole bunch of it by uh I guess that last little Lodge right there with and then there's a little container thing with goats in it how you feeling so far good yeah excellent yeah I haven't quite found mine yet but I'm doing it anyway it's gonna take me a little while to get into better shape exactly one step at a time and you'll get there Hey [Laughter] namaste John is right behind me there somewhere just song the hang in no problem it's brutal but this is the worst of it yeah and I had a awesome revelation which is that we don't have to go back down this so that is killer Chum wrong eh oh what a relief and so I think I can see the trail that we'll do when we come back cuz we don't have to go back down this yeah out there because like poon helmet and everything is up that way ghandruk Wow don't know how much we gonna stop we might drop 200 meter and then have to conform here and probably like that yeah at least we get a little respite works in different muscles hey guys good afternoon to ya namaste you can just barely see some snow up on that side of that peak there if it weren't so hazy then it would be a much more magnificent view of a high peak there we're back down in a valley here [Music] and taking a break so this is spaghetti tomato tuna cheese whole enchilada so to speak for 500 rupees which is 5 bucks [Music] hey guys so it's about 9 o'clock at night know is definitely a very very intense day of hiking I'm pretty wiped out once again for day number three here but I just spent the past several hours kicking back relaxing having dinner and using the internet because there's actually Wi-Fi here however it is way too slow to be able to upload any videos but at least I was able to answer some comments and stuff and just kind of check in with things so that was cool you can't expect too much you know way up in a Malaya's I ended up actually separating from John and Phil because they were cruising ahead of me there was one last Hill coming up here that was really really brutal and so I said that I would probably stay at the top of this hill whereas they were going to another spot a little bit further so I will very likely catch up with them tomorrow I'm hoping otherwise maybe the next day at the base camp but anyways you can't push yourself too much when you are doing this kind of trekking you got to listen to your body and decide plenty this time to stop and not be you can you know more messed up the next day so I am just here in my room pretty basic as you can see but it is just 150 rupees which is a dollar 50 so the rooms while trekking are super cheap it's because they make most of their money off of the food that food gets more expensive as you go higher up trekking along because porters have to carry it further I will do another video at one point showing all of the expenses for the day including all of my meals and everything and they're just gonna show there are thousands and thousands of moths out here this is this is nothing they were all inside the dining log room there where I was eating look got one inside here as well so his loss season I guess anyway time to get some sleep get up early and do it all over again yeah", "Ufh_aRppf80": "ah haha alright well this is my next round it's a purple kush and bubba kush pre 98 bubba really [ __ ] nice fat stocky ass man I've never seen anything

advanced nutrients and he made it that house and gardens uh rude accelerator was a way a far superior product to their route accelerator so he said that he was going to take it off the market and try to formulate something that would rival or surpass it but yeah i'm using the views in the bud candy for Advance Collegiate so don't think I hate advanced nations around hating on them because they're actually a really good product I just think they have way to eating idea products but I like this [ __ ] too so but yeah I mean this is the first week of bloom I've got a poor deluxe bulb that I just picked up recently I figured I try it kind of keep the noting tight and keep the plant squatty I'm gonna let him run I begged for for two weeks under a t5 then I veg done to this this mhm bowl for a week and then I'm in the first week of flour now with it and I let it go to the second week once it starts like actually showing fat white feel growth in the flour I'm gonna change over my poor deluxe that's a really great bowl I got it for a good price so Mike yeah all over that [ __ ] but yeah this is my cabinet I showed in another video on my other products those using son system hood greenhouse diesel Bella's high output cam fan I had the light hooked up to the camp fan but then I ended up taking a tree doing basically just having it been fulfilled Rory off and have the duck for the exhaust coming off the side of the light going up to it so it's kind of doing double duty on it but yeah so comment let me know what you think I'm going to try to post another video at least the third week you know once they started flowering up with showing flowers and see how those come on I'm gonna try to get a hold of some other stuff like the top loom and there are other finisher their budget

before our fall so give you guys a quick little update last one went really well everything hearts it really really well right on par with what it should be and this is basically this is all clones from the same garden except again this is blue this is glued rain a blue train blue dream back here as blue dream this is a diesel that Diesel's the bomb and this is also another diesel these three are all brand new these are kimball push cookies from big dan green boned see genetics I popped five of them and three of them women were ladies so three different finos here I call that one back there number that one back there one two three my plan is to only take clothes off of these I'm definitely going to keep the diesel weren't going again and i have another room over here let me show you guys that one and i'm thinking about these are all three all three of these are blue dreams and this is a my purple trainwreck and i'm thinking about keeping a cut of purgatory just in case I changed my mind saucers I'm gonna take some cuts off a bit mixing flour and make up most from other planets just in case when I do get back to back to brewing if I want to make another run of it I have it because it's super dank but I'm just trying to I really want to focus on just mono cropping I want to kind of check out these well I'm not like I'm on a problem but I want you to I definitely want to mostly check out these chemicals cookies for a while and this diesel because this is great but I don't know about that purple trainwreck I'm going to keep it out of the flower flower again I'll make that decision I'll keep it for a few months and see because it's going to be neglected this is my last roll I should be winding up this grow and the end of Main first of June this is I'll put these into flour maybe oh geez today is the Easter happy Easter by the way guys I think I put these into flour on Monday last Monday is when I so um maybe a week tomorrow I guess building tomorrow so I just want to give you guys a quick little update of what's going on in here this is my last garden of the season again like I said I don't have any air conditioning and so it gets too hot in here for the summer I've tried to grow their summer and I've got some production out of is too stressful for me and north at my plants are too hot and you get something out of it but you know you don't get I mean usually we still get some think you know I just don't think I want me to do instead of running both of these lights I would probably just ruined only one or running here and I can pretty much Charlie I can keep this at a more manageable rate of people that cool so I don't know but I used to take the summers off and I got a family and I like to spend more time with them and now really happen to worry about working in a garden because sometimes you know being in the garden becomes a little bit of a job sometime so i just want to give you guys a quick update and let's just see what's going on here i'll be back with you like you know he's more updates later please", "2WOb3-hP3Rg": "hey YouTube how's it going welcome back to another episode of the fourth one Chronicles I'm your host the danke daintiness today I'm doing a little nugge view for you I'm went back up to a little caregivers place up the street when we goes up a little glass Kenny's I think the green garden or something like that yeah green garden caregivers anyway got another little candy here what was this called purple candy cush that fit PCK um this was just some great little nuggies I saw up there I just knew I was gonna get this from the second I walked in the door that's just how good this stuff is looking to me you're gonna get the picture of course but um they're just beautiful little nuggets nice beautiful green but like they do have purple in there it's just that it's like you know it's kind of thing kind of hard to see but it's definitely there it has a [ __ ] ton of orange hairs just all over the place beautiful little nice smell of course like I even need to smell it just from down there but it just reeks of candy of course it does it's [ __ ] purple candy crush but either way great candy stink to this so come on so without further ado got charity here let's smoking portion that is nice that is a very very smooth smoke no pop at all no tingle no nothing however it's not as sweet as I thought it would taste I mean it is a candy strain it should be just reading of sugar tastes like sugar reeks like sugar of course but uh I don't know maybe the hit wasn't big enough let's find out there is that good sweet hiding in background are we either way now that I actually got a slightly better hit there was a shit-ton the sugary sweetness in that pen in that instep just the way a candy strain should taste beautiful sweet not very harsh at all not too expanding sorry if you can't really see it I am outdoors right now and the winds just taking it away but see if we can't get a couple more cuts off this Wow there goes lighter either way it's bulls almost dead but yeah can't really get a good hit anymore I had disappeared it's not expanding it all it basically just goes into your lungs and just gets absorbed like that but either way you don't always have to get the big white plume of smoke out of your mouth because basically that's just wasted material anyway either way there's about a hit left so I'll take that and then I'll see you off was dead either way that wonderful little purple candy fish smell I can smell it from here oh it's just beautiful stuff so I'm overall like I said that smell it's just beautiful sugary smell overall look beautiful colors purples it is there it's just a little you know hidden [ __ ] tons of orange hair really dense little nuggies taste the first it wasn't too good but after that start getting real sweet like just the way a candy should taste let's see harshness not too harsh unless you're just taking really [ __ ] fat rip just like trying to work an entire Bowl to your dome and overall high overall high rating it's an indica it's not too much of a good into color well that was only one bowl overall rating thing I'm gonna have to give it a 7 out of 10 so um yeah purple candy cush you're definitely dank but there's definitely some better stuff out there but of course it was a good nut member less I can't complain so until next time YouTube enjoy your medication and I'll see you on the next video peace", "H4L5nhwz2Dc": "what up YouTube keen to the cashier and today we are at about week seven and six almost week 842 our plants which will be our white widow and our family here in the front everything else is about to be about seven weeks so let's start off with the white widow and a little bit closer and show you guys so this is our white widow this was from dinafem I believe it's a free seat from her B's i think i read that this will finish it around seven to eight weeks it pretty much looks ready so we all go get her out these nugs are like really really hard it's for thing touching the golf ball at the Hardys are pretty small but really hard i would say this are these have to be hardest ones out of everything right now the spring grove they're really sticky frosty this actually has a sweet smell to this white widow suits funky smell really hard so probably give it nine weeks or maybe let it finish to the eighth and harvest but it looks like it's already done I just watered them right now looks like it's not the getting more water in so I really slow when the spinnaker wrong 100 degrees in here he's 10 I'm started taking water so let's give your Moodle signs that it's close to finishing up but we might take it to a for nine weeks so yeah now let's take a look afghani okay I don't really gets bent elbow this that gammy is actually purple it's turning purple and it's been hot so the temperatures have not changed they've been constant 80 81 and to a nighttime about the same maybe a little bit less but you know it's turning purple it's actually really fee a lot of bud on it I would say my love a petition flower it's more of a leaf structure but yeah it smells pretty skunky candy just really leafy overall pressure this monster has a power that able to week 9 but I like that purple color on it pretty much about here and the rest of here this is actually micronics iconic likes the northern lights with chronic also really fee let's frost the drop the bag on it but I've have been having a problem with pests the shot this fan I've been having a lot of white flies lately we tolerate that no you can see you but this one right here it's just white flies flying around another by just about it so yeah and this one is our della Hayes also also free one from herpes I suppose I'd like a mango citrus smell to it the butt on this is like where's the butter you know but it's a frosty frosty it's to get it smells like pine like pine or something does not have that sweet smell to it like they said they have at least this female and over here we have I believe it's our blueberry yeah it's a blueberry it's frosty it's scoring big buds it's kind of lead to cut it down because I haven't watered it until today actually gonna have any time it also has a pine smell to it I don't see no footing on this one too pretty frosty leafy bigger and this one has to be our like our biggest one of the biggest buds you sell the whiteflies fire everywhere this is our purple pendous slips from purple but I haven't seen any purple yet this one has part like the biggest buds on it it's not ask frosty but it you know they're pretty big pretty dance has that kind of small have kind of weird smelling can't really describe it so like wood yeah it's pretty much what I'm having brain out to a quick little look again so let me show you guys the bedding room let's go look you guys so here we are we are vegging room and everything has grown to the top I can raise the lights anymore so i have no more space so i'm just waiting for those two plans to finish that's why i might give it 8 weeks for wine the 19 you know all right there talking to the coach the monster Irie Mon some monster birthday bend it over many times and just keeps on growing I did take it outside and saw a lot of yelling on top and I'm guessing because either that pots too small for already I don't think it's through the lights yeah and right there we have our house one hundred percent indica a double block that's our candy land this is our girl scout cookies are purple not purple Cadillac is our granddaddy so they kind of bent it over and we have our white little clones Marvel Kingston crush cuts so yeah I have no more space it's pretty much it for this video so stay tuned for more

believe let's see let's do the math 1911 18 days what's today that a knife all right we'll say 19 days so little over two weeks I actually had a lot of issues with the plants the first week and get some focus in here and I think it could have been the cups were waterlogged because this media I'm not really used to it so hopefully I can get rid of it and go to Coco fully and change it up and then get comfortable with it because this stuff just holds water too much I don't know why this thing is not focusing so yeah so you can see a lot of the leaves hang the brownie some spots so what I basically realized was they needed their feeding a little bit earlier than normal so once I fed him about 12 hours later they started popping up better and I also think the roots maybe hit the reservoir at the bottom so maybe that kinda also now the growth is starting to go up set it down so yeah that's the update they're all doing good I haven't had to get rid of any yet this one over here is a little scary I got to keep an eye on that one but other than that he's going pretty good so again this is kind of the boring part not sure when I'll transplant probably he'll at this rate I don't know another two weeks maybe in these cups we'll see another week maybe so yeah so that's that on to something else the rest of the last row is now gone actually trying to dry out some of the trim just so we can run some more but we ran some pho the other night this is my first time running it and actually first time having oil so it was kind of a cool experience definitely going to do it again I actually have some lavender diesel I picked up some and I might actually run BHO at so anyway so this is what we got so to focus you get out of that so it's a nice dark brown color it's kinda hard to see with this jar this is my like a custom piece i had made so next time I run it I'm going to be doing shatter I think instead of this I just like that the texture shatter better the coloring this is really good though even though the weed you know the ones her Mead this stuff gets you get you good and medicated so yeah I'm going to think I'm not going to give their names out but I'm gonna give shoutouts to him they knew they are I was a great experience yeah they show me a lot so I'm going to start really getting the concentrates more start making it now that I know what the process is and make some shatter and see how it goes but yeah I think we didn't really measure it but this was maybe maybe an ounce of miscellaneous nuggets buds trim and it was all the plants as the Boston Barry the rest is some of the gdp I know it wasn't a gdp was some of the she was just Boston burger and I think about it sorry I had some devs as you can see so yeah this was the Boston Barry and man it tastes good so I guess that's going to end it yeah i think i'm going to go have some tabs and i want to thank everyone for watching the videos actually i got a lot of new subscribers about any questions and i always comment make sure to share the videos and stuff so i guess that's it peace youtube", "NNtm5gdKcWM": "united states of america to all who shall see these presidents greeting this

three as usual which is soooo much as five sir", "mVcLggHCnPE": "and it's time for the tournament of stitches roll the credits well hello everybody and welcome to the tournament of stitches with marley bird this is the fourth annual mystery make along that i have held during the march madness basketball event it is a great chance for knitters and crocheters to come together learn some new stitches and techniques and have a little fun along the way i am thrilled to have you here and if this is your first one welcome if this is your fourth one i'm excited to have you returning as a team member this is a fun event this year and it's a little bit different from years past let me tell you why in the previous years we have made shawls primarily and in those shawls we've learned a bunch of different stitches we've made a basic triangle shawl an asymmetrical shawl and then last year we made scarves and cowls so a lot of neckwear this year i decided that after the year of 2020 and the craziness that is my life i needed something a little bit more relaxed and i assume that a lot of you feel the same way i don't want to be working on something that feels like it takes a lot of brain power to work through or even a lot of energy to get through a full list of homework i want something that's comfortable that's fun that's colorful that's going to be inspiring and something i really want to work on whether it's picking up the hook or picking up the needles to me i feel like this year's class project really hits the mark it's something that is rather easy yet exciting because of the color work and then once you see the full reveal of what you are making i think you'll be pleasantly surprised this tournament of stitches is something a little bit different than other mystery make alongs that i do because you do know what you're making you just don't know what it looks like so for this year we are all making a blanket whether you're making a knitted blanket or a crochet blanket that is your choice and this year for the first time i'm giving a smaller option for the knitters i know that as knitters it takes us a good amount of time to get through our homework and some of us are slower than others so i'm giving those of you out there who don't think you can finish a throw blanket in a six-week time period a chance to make a pillow instead so you will follow instructions for the pillow instead of the throw blanket but you'll still be able to follow along learn some great techniques and hopefully have some fun along the way a full list of the materials you need and the details regarding the tournament of stitches are listed on my website i've put a link in the video description box right down there below and you know the drill smash that like button as you're down there once you click the link you will see all of the yarn you need the hook or the needles that you need and the full list of instructions now i'm going to cavi i'm going to put a little caveat there or or put a little asterisk there for you as we're going through the tournament of stitches the instructions are given on a weekly basis so as you scroll to the bottom of that blog post that's where you will find the link for each set of instructions this is a six week course six week knit along or crochet along so you will have a set of six different instructions and the full link for each one is at the bottom of the blog post that is linked in the video description box below this video so hopefully that is as clear as possible for where you need to go to get the details regarding the tournament of stitches to get the material list and where you're going to go each week to get the instructions that you're supposed to follow along with these videos okay the last thing i want to mention is that if you want to ask questions participate as a team together i really encourage you to join me over in the marlies minions facebook group i know some of you don't do facebook but i will let you know the facebook group that i run the marley's minions is amazing it is upbeat it's inspirational it's fun the moderators i have in there are exceptional they keep everything on the up and up and par and the one number one rule that we have is that you you keep it positive you keep it fun and uh you don't be a jerk so if you're looking for a safe place to come and play and be part of the team i encourage you to come and do that are there prizes yes you can find the details about that once again in that blog post below all right so i've talked more than enough at the start of this video and i know that there are some of you out there that are like oh my gosh stop jibber jabbering but i have to give you some of this information at the start not all of the videos are like this so having said that i'm going to ask you to go ahead grab your yarn and grab your hook or your needles and let's go ahead and jump in to week one of the tournament of stitches okay knitters it is time for us to dive in this week we are going to learn the main technique we are going to use for the entire blanket and as i refer to the blanket pattern or the pillow pattern i'm going to refer to it as our class project okay the class project is what we are making throughout the tournament of stitches and we will only use this one technique we're using today for our class project however through the next five weeks after this week i will be teaching you other techniques that you could use in place of this one on future projects if you want okay we are diving into modular knitting you guys i am a big fan of mitered squares and entrelock and corner to corner and i mean you name it i love all of that stuff and i decided you know what when i work on those type of projects i find it very relaxing and comfortable i love the finished result and as i mentioned at the start of this video i really wanted to have a project that was a comfortable knit it's still exciting because of the colors there's a little bit of twist with some color work that we're doing with this but overall this is a fun and relaxing project at least i hope you find it that way as well just as i said before if you are a fairly quick knitter confident your knitting skills and you want to make a throw blanket you absolutely could follow the instructions for today's video with the throw or if you're a little bit slower maybe you don't want to throw blanket you want to test this out with a pillow you could follow today's instructions for the pillow either one will work make sure you have today's instructions the link is in the video description box below so you'll go to that link for the blog post it'll send you to the link for the week one instructions okay for the knitters week one instructions for the knitters i'm going to be very general in my instructions today you are going to follow along with the numbers of the pattern given in the pattern did that make sense you're going to follow along with the numbers given in the pattern for your project okay let me show you the technique you will be using okay first things first you want to make sure you do have your needles with you i said you could use straights but i do prefer circular needles and highly recommend using circulars especially as you're working through these modular knits you also have your five chosen colors right now i want you to go ahead and designate what color is color a color b color c color d and color e i will let you know that color e is the color that you will use for the border of your blanket or the back of your pillow so make sure you choose the color e that you want to be sort of like your border around everything your highlight of everything that's going on in the center of the blanket okay so make sure you've labeled what is a through e all right once you have that established we can go ahead and jump in with our first square of this modular project the first square is made individually we are going to cast on stitches using two colors as we work through these modular mitered squares we are going to work with two colors throughout it is a form of intarsia now don't don't get scared don't freak out don't think oh my gosh i can't do this you absolutely can do this it just takes a little time a little patience to get started once you get on block number two or number three it becomes very comfortable very familiar and you're gonna have no problem at all working along so let's go ahead and grab your color a and your color c for the first block those are the two colors we're going to start with first so i'm going to move aside all of my other colors you guys can i tell you how excited i am to work with these colors i think they're so pretty it's super exciting to me now i do want to remind you you want to follow along with the numbers written in the pattern for your pattern itself okay we want to start with color a and we are going to put a slip knot on our needle and using the long tail cast on i'm going to cast on 13 stitches you can cast on either 13 stitches and follow along with me or if you're gonna if you're gonna jump right into the pattern you can go ahead and cast on the number that is listed in the pattern for color a i am using the long tail cast on for this you could use another cast on should you choose i just really like the long tail cast on so i tend to use it quite often let me count two four six eight ten twelve thirteen i get a little bit over eager all right so i have 13 stitches on there with my color a now i'm going to take my color b and cast on 12 stitches or the number listed in your pattern i'm going to use the long tail cast on once again so i will go ahead and start with a slip knot and place that slip knot on with my color c and then i will carry on and place 12 stitches on here with my color c all right so right now i have a total of 25 stitches on my needle they are not joined right they are separated just like that what's going to join them together is as we come across the row and we transition from color c to color a or vice versa we're going to have our old color jump over the new color so whatever color you were using is going to jump over top of the new color you're going to use and you'll carry on with your new color now that will make sense as i show it to you but that is a phrase you're going to say to yourself often old over new the other thing that we want to point out is that as this fabric is facing you right now this is the right side of your fabric so when i turn my work and i do my first row i am looking at the wrong side which means when i do my intarsia i want to make sure that my old over new happens on this side we want to place all of our intarsia floats or our our twining of our intarsia for lack of a better word on the wrong side okay so here's how we're going to do that don't get too frustrated here at the start you guys this is something that might take you a couple times to get used to but you can do this i promise we're going to go ahead and we're going to knit across using the same color as the stitch right now okay so i'm going to knit across using my color c all right now i have to go to my next stitch and i have to change colors but here's what i'm going to do i'm going to move the purple to the front of my work just like if i were purling okay and i'm going to grab my color a from the front of the work notice i've put my color c over top of my color a all right so it's old over top of new and now because i'm knitting i want to make sure that that new is pulled to the back and that's all it is that that little twist right there old over new and now i carry on with the new color working these same stitches with the same color if that makes sense all right so that is the end of our row one which is a wrong side so we're going to turn our work and this is where we begin the shaping for the miter when we do miter square shaping it all happens on the right side of the fabric by doing it on the right side of the fabric we're enabling the stitches to all look very uniform and familiar it's going to be great right the other thing is for for us for us and our purposes of working the intarsia only having to do the um the the decrease for the miter on the front but allowing our colors to change on the back is a lot easier than that little extra step we have to do when we're on the wrong side and have to change color so it makes it so there's not too much going on at least that's the way i look at it all right so here's how we're going to do this again i'm going to make sure i want to get all my tails out of the way to make sure i'm good my yarn i'm not stressing if it's a little bit twisted here you can always untwist them by moving your balls of yarn or if you want to make yarn butterflies you could do that as well i have a whole video on how to do yarn butterflies i'll make sure i put a link to it in the video description box below and then that little i button above but right now we're gonna maintain garter stitch we're going to knit across to the last two stitches of my color a okay so i'm knitting across to the last two stitches of my color a so i'm going to be knitting to that point so let's do that all right so i'm to the last two stitches of my color a let me get some more yarn here and it's at this point i'm going to work my decrease so this is the decrease we have to be familiar with okay so we are going to slip this first stitch let me get my yarn here we're going to slip this first stitch as if to knit now we knit these two stitches together all right so it's the the last stitch of my color a the first stitch of my color c i'm going to knit them together then that slip stitch that we did we're going to grab it and have it jump up and over the stitch we just knit now we're going to carry on with color c but once again we have to go old over new right so we're going to take our orange and go over top of the purple you see that see the crossover drop the orange grab the purple and carry on with the purple if you want to actually like move your balls of yarn one over the other you absolutely could do that as well it gives it a little bit more of a visual representation of what you're doing like a more physical act all right so here i'm at the end here i've worked my first decrease and notice it's a double decrease we've decreased two stitches so we have one fewer stitch over here and one fewer stitch over here congratulations we're on our way from this point out it's a lot of the same so we're going to turn our work once again on our wrong side we're just going to knit back making sure you're knitting with the same color as the stitch that's on your needle when it's time to switch colors we're going to do old over new knit over to the new color there's no decrease on the wrong side no decrease so this would be row three and remember in order to do old over new on the wrong side we have to move our yarn to the front all right so i'm here i'm gonna move my yarn to the front of the needles and then here's my my color a is already up here in front waiting for me so i have my purple is over top of my color a over my orange i bring my orange back to the back right because i'm knitting and then i'll knit so i just carry on i just drop my color c and i just continue with my color a it really is that simple you guys it all comes together nice and neat we're back on the right side so we have to work our center decrease again and we're also going to maintain our intarsia so as we go through this row i'm going to make sure that i'm working the center decrease and i'm doing my old over new when i change colors so let's go ahead and work the same color as the stitches over to two stitches to the end of this color a so i'm going to work over to two stitches from the center essentially like it's the last two stitches of color a that's really the better way to say it so i'm at the last two stitches of color a i'll slip a stitch as if to knit go into the next two stitches and knit them together and then have the stitch i slipped jump up and over the stitch i just knit now it's time for me to do old over new so here's my old here's my new so i did old over new drop the old pick up the new see there's the twist that's that little that little twist right there that's all you need it creates a nice little link in the intarsia and you carry on with your color c it is that simple and we're going to keep doing this these two rows just like this until we get down to three stitches so get to the end of the work turn your work here's a little tip what i try to do is i make sure that my needles that my color a all right my color a is in front of my needles when i start it just makes it a little bit easier all right when i start my wrong side i make sure it's in front of my needles when i start my wrong side and here i go so i'm on the wrong side so i'm just knitting the same color no shaping on this side i'm just maintaining the intarsia so here i go all the way through color c gonna do this one so i have to move color c forward make sure it's over top of color a bring color a back because i'm knitting that's why it's going back to the back is because i'm knitting okay guys and i'm making sure that this link right here that we're creating that little link is on the wrong side that's why we're doing it all over here on this side once i bring that back i continue on knitting through this color this is going to give us some mitered squares that are triangles one half is going to be one color the other half is going to be a different color and they're going to fit together very nicely you're at the end turn your work we're back to a right side so this is the side we're going to do a decrease on right this is the side we're going to do a decrease on you can move your colors if you want if if if having your colors kind of twisted up on you bothers you just simply untwist them okay just like this here we go let's do this again we're going to knit down to the last two stitches of color a you get to the last two stitches of color a you slip one as if to knit knit these two stitches together then have the slip stitch slip up and over that stitch you just knit we're going to change colors here but our yarn is already in back right because we're on the right side so we went old over new so we went the orange over top of the purple so i could go like this and now the orange is over top of the purple and i continue on with the purple see that okay i have a feeling you guys are getting the hang of this but just because i know a lot of you like to watch me go through this i'm going to go ahead and let the video continue to record as i continue on with this mitered square i'm going to get up to where there are three stitches it's at that point i want you guys to join me back in if you're fast forwarding ahead or if you just want to work along with me go ahead sit back enjoy the music and work with me as i work through this mitered square okay just remember old over new when you're on the right side make sure you work your decrease when you're on the wrong side make sure you're doing your floats or your your links is that's the better word for it your links for your intarsia on the wrong side all right so i'm going to continue on you do the same do do do do okay you're down to three stitches and here's what you're gonna do you're gonna turn your work and we're gonna go ahead and we're going to snip our color a make sure you leave a nice long tail to weave in once you snip your color a go ahead and move color a out of the way and we're going to do this last row only with our color c so what you're going to do is we're going to work a decrease essentially on this side so we're going to slip one so slip one we're gonna knit two together so even though they are color a you're gonna knit two together and then pass the slip stitch over all right once you've done that go ahead snip your color c leaving a nice long tail and i still i mean guys you could just pull this out and make it just elongated and give it a pull i i don't like to do that so what i like to do is just open up that loop grab your tail and pull it through just to give it a little lock all right once you've done that your miter looks a little something like this on the wrong side you should see all your nice little locking floats all the way up look how pretty they are old over new and on the right side it looks like this look how pretty it is isn't that great all of those decreases that we did are right there you have a nice little line and the two triangles together it looks pretty darn awesome now this is the right side of your triangle if you need to use a stitch marker to mark the right side to help you remember you absolutely can do that or you can always remember hey the side that has my little intarsia links that's my wrong side so anytime i see that i know i'm on the wrong side one thing you can do at this point is you can weave in your tails right now which i will encourage you to do you guys know me i love to weave in my tails as i go so it's at this point i usually will grab my my needle and weave in my tails and the great thing about intarsia is we can bury our tails in the links and i have a whole video on that that i did with ann burke who is antarja she is all about intarsia and essentially you use a very sharp chenille needle take your yarn and if you just zip up and i'm splitting the links can you guys see that i'm splitting the the links i'm splitting right through them with my sharp needle i'm gonna pull this tail up and then as i come back i split those links again and i split the yarn i just pulled through come all the way down zip zip and that's all it takes that's all i need to do to weave in that tail give it a nice snip that again i encourage you to weave in your tails as you go along so now all of that is woven in there's my wrong side and if i flip it over there's my right side all right guys you see that and there you have it you have created your very first intarsia mitered square it really isn't that difficult and i promise you it gets easier as we go along as you create more and more of these it's going to be easier and easier now we are going to create our class project as a join as you go project meaning all of the squares we are going to make are going to be joined to a previous square or squares however if you find that too difficult you absolutely could create these squares on an individual basis and then seam them together later in the pattern that we are creating totally up to you but i will encourage you to give this a try because it just makes life so much easier to not have to seam them all together it's a really fun great project to work on and make these mitered squares so what we're going to do now is place our square down just like so so that way our color a is up top here and color c is down on the bottom this will follow along with the diagram you see in your pattern what we want to do now is create the next square over here on this side of this square so if this is square number one we're going to create square number two right here and then when it's time for square number three we're going to create square number three right there when it goes to the next square following that that will be the square up here square number four which will work along this edge of square number one and then square number five will work along this edge of four and this edge of two okay so it becomes very easy to do once you understand how to pick up a knit along this edge right here you should be able to pick up a knit along all of the other edges without any issue for our class project the next two colors are color d and color c so for me my color d is this really pretty green tea color so the green tea color is what i will use as i pick up and knit along my square and then i'm going to go back to my color c and that's the color i will cast on for this edge of my square when you create mitered squares if you will notice on this one you create the edge of the piece right here so we cast on all of these stitches and then as we worked up we kept decreasing down our center to get down to few stitches up here so that way we get this really nice beautiful diagonal line we're going to do the same over here by picking up stitches here and casting on stitches here and our diagonal line will be going in this direction again so it's going to go the same way as this one all right so here we go to pick up a knit when we're working on garter stitch i usually will turn my work so that way i can work along this way of the edge but i want you to notice like this is the square as it would it would be sitting in the diagram we want to pick up along this edge so i tend to turn it so that way i can work down this way and for me i will look along the edge here and i have these these bumps these turning bumps right from the garter and i will pick up the stitches there and i want to pick up either 12 or 13 okay whatever i can do if i get 12 i will cast on one extra stitch to get 13. if i pick up 13 that's fine too because i want ultimately 13 stitches along this edge i want the same number of stitches along this edge as i started when i did the first edge of this square does that make sense so what i will do is i will go in to the edge here of my piece so there's my edge so i'm going to go in put in my needle grab my yarn make sure i have my the center here wrap my yarn around the needle and then pull that yarn through that loop all right make sure you don't split the yarn and that's that i'm going to stick my needle in the next bump along the edge here yarn over my needle just like i would if i were knitting and then pull up a loop through that the stitch i went into all right so i'm going along essentially this next garter ridge i have here i'm going in right along there just picking up that little bump super easy picking up the bump yarning over my needle and then pulling that yarn over through that bump let me do that one more time i'm in the bump yarn over and then pull the yarn over through the bump if you're struggling with this something that you can do is find the next bump you want to go into so let's say it's that one right there okay instead of using your right hand needle go into it use your left hand needle go into that bump all right put it on your left hand needle now treat that bump as if it's a stitch go ahead and go into it yarn over your right hand needle and come out just like you're knitting go to the next garter ridge right here find the next bump if i can get in there with my left hand needle put that bump on my left hand needle and i'm going to treat it just as a stitch take my right hand needle put it in yarn over and come out when i say yarn over i'm you know yarning around my right hand needle i'm just creating a knit stitch so i'm going into the bump and then i'm treating it just like a knit stitch i'm going to do this all the way down my row go in around and notice i am on the right side of the fabric so as i pick these up i'm going to have a little bit of a ridge on the wrong side but it's better that it's on the wrong side than the right side right now i'm just picking up that outside bump on each one of my ridges and when i get to the end i'll just count my stitches and i'll figure out what i have there now in the pattern it might give you a set number of stitches to always pick up which is fine i just want you guys to know like there's a little flexibility here like you can do whatever works best for what you've created all right so this one i'm going through the back leg on this one because that stitch just looks like it's seated differently so let's see here so i have 2 4 6 8 10 12 stitches i could go ahead and try and get one more right down here i mean why not let's go ahead let's just get one more to give me my 13. i don't like how i split that yarn there so i'm going to get 13. so i have my 13 stitches all along my edge looking good i'm not going to worry too much that there's a little bit of an opening there because i can use this tail to close that up later so i'm not going to stress about it but now i have that edge picked up so if it were sitting down flat to look like the diagram it would look just like so so we have a we have c now we've cast on so we picked up a knit essentially i mean not essentially that's what we did we picked up and knit 13 stitches with our color d now we're going to go back with our color c and cast on 12 stitches now you could do the knitted cast on cable cast on or long tail cast on just like before and i'm going to use long tail because i like it and it's just my preferred so i'm going to start with a slip knot i'm going to place that slip knot on my needle tighten it up and that counts as one so there's one so i need 12 more stitches okay so there's one two three four 12 all right so here i am i'm set up just like i was when i did this square right i have 13 of this color and 12 of this color so when i turn my work i'll be on the wrong side and i'm going to continue on working in the exact same manner i created the first square so the only thing different right now are the colors i'm using and the fact that i picked up and knit my very first cast on edge instead of casting on right with my my color that's that's right here everything else is going to be the same let me go ahead and work the first couple rows with you so you can see exactly what i mean and then i'm going to let you carry on and finish this square okay so i will go ahead and i'm going to turn my work all right so i'm just going to knit across again i'm just using the same color on as for um i'm using the same color to knit with as the stitch is on the needle all right the only time that's different is when we do the decrease here we go i'm coming up to the end here this is the wrong side so this is not a decrease row yet right it's so i'm on the wrong side which means i need to bring my yarn forward to bring my yarn forward and it's old over new so purple over top of the green old over new and because i'm knitting with the green i make sure it goes between my needles back to the back so that way i can knit with it let me grab it and i continue on knitting and here on this first one i'm not worried that it's a little bit separated because as i pull this that just tightens that up no worries so this first one is to get everything connected and it starts that link process of old over new all right pretty simple we're going to keep going here when i get to the end yes this one gets a little bit loose because there's nothing attached to it but again you just tighten it up all right so i'm going to turn my work this would be my row one this is my first wrong s or a right side row i apologize right side row which means i'm going to work a decrease so i'm going to knit down to where there's two stitches left of my color d i will slip one knit two together and pass the slip stitch over all right so here we go i have my colors all right here ready to go and we are off so i will knit over to two stitches it's two stitches left of my color d alright two stitches left of color d i slip one as if to knit i knit two together and then i pass the slip stitch over top now i have to change colors so i'm going to go old color which is the green right so let me get this over here so i have the old color my green i'm going to put it over top of the purples old over new so you can even go like this like old over new that's very visual so i old over new green over purple and i grab my purple and i go ahead and i carry on using the purple again if it's a little bit loose right there it's okay just tighten it up snug it up a little bit with those stitches and it looks good let's keep going here is our first first little join right there all right so now we're back to the wrong side so i turn my work make sure this is over here i'm just going to knit with this color and then i'll do old over new and i'll knit with that color you can do this even if you're a beginner i mean think about this we're just knitting we're just knitting and we're doing a very simple decrease and as far as the color change goes as long as you do old over new it'll be just fine just fine you guys you can do this you absolutely can do this it's just sticks and string everybody all right here we go we're going to bring our yarn to the front because we want our our links over here on this side so we want our old color over our new color so here's our new color so old over new pick up the new and i'm going to knit so i have to bring it back to the back so that i can knit with it and that's it that's all it is you saw i just gave this this yarn just a little bit of tug to make sure it's nice and tidy there not too much nothing too spectacular and as i mentioned before if you want to use butterflies instead of full skeins of yarn you absolutely could do that that is an option for you turn my work i'm back to my my right side so i'm going to work a decrease so i'm going to work all the way down to the last two stitches of this color i'll slip one knit two together pass the slip stitch over all right so let me see here i'm going to make this as visual as possible again with the colors make it so you can really see the old over new one more time some more yarn all right so i'm down to the last two two stitches of this color so i slip one as if to knit knit two together pass the slip stitch over top now i'm going to do old over new so green over the purple so purple see that the green is over top of the purple that's that creates the link that's all you need to do and then we carry on with the purple just grab your purple and then keep going with the purple right down here this is the square that we were just working on i finished it and you can see that it has a nice diagonal the same diagonal as this one for the following square you would make the next one right over here and then for the next set you would start to build squares on top of these ones and that's kind of where i am next so i'm going to move this aside because we will use this in another video but this right here this is a representation of squares 1 2 and 3 and four five and six so as we go to squares seven eight and nine it starts off the exact same way this square started off so i'm going to come up here and start this square but knowing that it starts off the exact same way this one does just different colors so you will get your colors for this square which are colors a and color color e color a and color e with color a you will go ahead and using the long tail cast on i did 13 stitches with my color a and then my color e that is actually my polo color here so i got to pull that over and this is the one we're going to use to pick up and knit so working along this edge so this would be the edge of square or miter number four we're gonna work along this edge right here to pick up stitches same thing guys we're still going to work along the edges of these garter ridges picking up these outside little bumps and we'll make it as easy as possible whether you only use the right needle or if you need to use the left needle to really identify that bump you choose what's best for you i'm going to start off right here with this bump just so that i'm right here on the edge and if i don't like it i can always rip it out and start again no big deal i want to pick up 12 stitches here okay you guys so i want to pick up 12 stitches remember it's 13 stitches with the first color essentially and then 12 stitches with the second color or whatever is written in your pattern don't forget to have that pattern in front of you once you go in you will wrap your needle and pull that through so there's one so i need to go ahead and continue and get 12. so i'm just going to follow right on through and if it gets to a point where maybe i have one too many or i don't get to the end i can always just tweak it it's not that big of a deal as long as you're consistent with where you pick up your stitches pick up a knit you will be just fine so i'm just going to go along and i will count once i'm done because i find it easier just to pick everything up and then count oops i split that and then i sometimes will pick one up right down there but let's count my stitches quickly so i have 2 4 6 8 10 12. so i have 12 already so i want you to notice this if i keep these 12 just like so i have quite a big gap right there so that's not really something that i would want okay so knowing that i could rip out this very first one that i did over here i'm going to go ahead and do that and the reason i did that is because i know that i can add my border right here and really kind of tidy up that edge but if i leave this big gap right there that's just not too too good so i know that i can just go into this last loop down here and get my 12 and that will be a nice tidy little edge there now this will leave a little bit of an opening right there but i'm not going to stress about it because i have these nice tails that i can weave in and close any hole or gap between my squares so don't let the gaps scare you or don't fret over them we can close them up with our tails that's the beauty of having those tails alright so now that i have all my stitches on here i have my 25 stitches total 13 and 12. i carry on creating my miter just like i did these you know how to do that pretty simple let's go ahead and get this square complete so that way i can show you how we will pick up along this edge of this square and this edge of that square to create the miter going that way pretty easy i know you can do it i'm gonna do the same thing okay with that i have finished what would be my square number seven and i'm going to move on to square number eight which is going to be done by picking up a knitting along this edge and this edge this would have been the same thing we would do for square number five and square number six so what i'm getting ready to show you is exactly what you would do down here and right here okay for this square we are going to use color b and color d which is actually this same sequence right here so i'm going to use my lighter purple color right here along this edge to pick up a knit and then i'll pick up my green tea color along this edge to pick up a knit so very easy to do as i did when i was picking up and knitting along let's see it would have been right down here right here along this edge i tend to turn my work so that way i can go along here working this way and then i'll shift my work and i'll work along this path so this is as it's laying down flat this is the square i just finished i'm just shifting it around so i can get to my stitches this way remember on the first side you want to pick up 13 or the larger number written in the pattern and on this side you want to pick up 12 or the smaller number written in the pattern we keep that consistent throughout the whole pattern so for this one let me go ahead i'm going to start up here and i'm just going to grab one of my bumps outside just like i did before guys and i'll just start up here at the corner make sure i get my yarn right here leave a nice long tail so you can weave that in later yarn over and pull up a loop all right so there's one i'm just going to work my way down right along the edge just like i've done before all right nothing new here what's going to be new as far as new for this video is that we're going to pick up and knit along both of the edges we're not going to cast on either of the colors it's just going to pick up and knit and this is a great way to join as you go for these mitered squares if you are making your squares individual like you would actually ignore all of this bit right you're just going to cast on just like you did for the very first one but to do the joint as you go with the miter this is one of the best ways in my opinion to go about making something with miters i mean i love it when i can work a joint as you go with it because i don't have to seam things up all right so as before i'm going to just work all the way down and then i'm going to go back and count as i'm going since i'm talking the whole time i can't count and talk at the same time sorry guys i'm not that talented all right let's get that in here make sure i pull it around oh that one's giving me trouble there we go go down here right there along the edge just keep it consistent as you're working along that edge and i just pick up right there in that bump yarn over pull that through and just keep it going pretty consistent 2 4 6 8 10 12. so this is where i would want one more so i can pick up one more here i could cast on one i'm actually just going to pick one up right there in that corner and give myself 13 i've worked all the way along this edge it looks really great and now i will carry on and pick up stitches along this edge with the other color so what i would do from this point is i would rotate my work and then if you're using a circular needle you can pull this down so that these stitches are on the cord or you can just kind of keep going with your straight just kind of pinch your work so that you can work across this way you see what i mean so i'm going to do the pinch the work way so that way it will demonstrate for the people who are using straight needles and circulars it works for both i'm leaving a light a nice long tail with my color d i'm going to kind of pinch it see how that pinches up and it allows me to have my work ready and i'm just going to work along this edge again just picking up my bump so i'm going to pick a bump and keep that consistent throughout so i'm going to choose that one right there let's see if that's a it's kind of a kind of a really solid bump i really woven my tail there pretty good but i'm going to see if i can get this through and make that work look at that all right so there's one i want to get 12 over here or get whatever is written in the pattern you all right so i'm coming up to number 12 right here so i'm going to get number 12 and i'm going to count just to make sure 2 4 6 8 10 12. perfect so as you see here if it's straight it kind of pinches up and it looks a little goofy but it's going to be perfectly fine as we continue our work now we have all of our stitches on here we have 25 stitches total just like we did before so we would carry on working our miters just like we did before first row is going to be a wrong side row second row will be the first right side row and our first decrease row we're going to continue to put the old color over the new so that way we get the intarsia and carry on let's go ahead and you know why not let's go ahead and do the first couple rows together even though i know by this point you surely know how to do it but i think it it is good to always demonstrate just a little bit more rather over demonstrate for you guys than under demonstrate for sure and the good news is for your homework for this part of the class project it's just these nine squares okay so you're going to create these nine squares you have a whole week to complete them no stress you just take your time enjoy the process honestly once you get past i want to say the first three squares if it's like all right this is pretty cool and it's really exciting to see how the colors all work together once you see the entire project you're going to just be like wow this is really cool at least i hope you will be i mean it's pretty exciting i know some of you are probably going to ask me at some point you know should i use lighter colors darker colors at you know at what point i mean honestly i would just say just try and use the colors that are pretty you know just not too close in color and you could really put them anywhere you want this this whole project works really great with all colors so you should be pretty darn good all right so i finished the first wrong side row i've turned it i'm going to decrease on this row so remember i'm going to work down to the last two stitches of this first color and i'll slip one knit two together pass the slip stitch over so i'm in the pattern you will follow along with the pattern but this is this is essentially what you're doing so if you are coming home late from work and you're you're working on these squares and you're just like man i don't want to sit here and count the number of stitches every time what's an easy way to remember where i'm supposed to work my decrease this is the easy way work down until you get down to the last two stitches of the color you're on right if you're on the right side get down to the last two stitches slip one knit two together and when you knit two together it'll be one of each color and then pass the slip stitch over all right and then from there it's just old over new so my purple is going to go over the green i can find my green purple over my green pick up my green and just continue on with the green and just by doing that old over new i'm linking my colors together you guys know this at this point you should be able to look at your mitered squares see the linking process it doesn't take any extra twist or anything else just that simple link will keep those colors together and you will not get a hole alright guys so i'm going to turn i'm going to continue on and i'm going to get this square done once i get this square done i'm going to go ahead and complete square number 9 so i'm going to get this entire panel done which is exactly what you're going to do for your homework whether you're making the pillow size or you're making the full-size throw this is your homework but i want you to see what it looks like before the end of the video so let me get my work done and give you a peek and voila this is what the first panel of your blanket or your pillow should look like the color placement is very precise so make sure you did follow along with the diagram as far as where to put the colors hopefully this was not too difficult for you and you were able to easily accomplish the mitered square plus the intarsia it is something super fun to do again if the join as you go technique is too difficult for you you can make each square individual like and then we can sew them all together later on don't forget to weave in your ends as you go make sure they're all woven in they look nice and neat it will make it so much better for the duration of your project as i mentioned in the introduction this particular technique that you learned in this video is what we will use for the entire class project so you will become very familiar with this style of modular knitting however over the next several weeks i will be showing you several different styles of modular knitting i'm excited to fill up your knitter's toolbox with a ton of knowledge and i really really really do hope that you love this mitered square just as much as i do with the combination of the colors and the ultimate placement as we go on through this knit along is so exciting i can't wait to show you more explain more behind the design and just have some fun if you find this fun and just have some fun don't forget to join the marlies minions facebook group to ask some questions to others that are participating in this knit along or to the testers or to me i'm over there answering questions as well last but not least as you are working on this project be sure to share on social media use hashtag marleybird or hashtag tournamentofstitches alright that's it for me good luck this week finish your homework and i'll see you next thursday for a new set of instructions and a new technique bye everybody you",

the way what hello and welcome back to my channel thank you for clicking onto this video i'm jennifer glatt sofa a musical theater performer a voice teacher and today we are reacting to someone new ish because obviously i've never done i've never reacted to this person but they are really highly requested so i'm super excited i always say that today i will be reacting to and analyzing diana and kudinova i will be reacting to wicked game this has literally been in my suggestions comments a lot so we're gonna go before we do get on to the reaction please do hit that subscribe button and the bell button to be notified whenever i post let's go i have no idea what i'm in for i i'm so excited [Music] the world was on fire [Music] i don't know what i'm expecting going into this by the way as well so what i believe she is around 14 15 correct me if i'm wrong or if you know the specific age that she is was when she was performing this but that's so low what what was that that is on an f3 and she is so secure down there it sounds a little bit dopey uh down there but like she sounds so secure and i love that we are starting on a little bit of a breath like quality and do you see how that voice then comes in so clearly what let's watch that again [Music] and then it's connected [Music] oh wow we have gone up that octave so we're now on to our f4 still in our chest voice we are kind of hearing a little bit more of a blend mix because we're softening it up there on that last part of what we just heard we heard again like we've listened to about well it says 33 seconds and we've heard a whisper-like quality more connected quality and now we're kind of going towards her back of her throat changing the tone of her voice and to be able to do that in like the space of a couple of seconds is crazy let's listen to that part again we can see that she's kind of going into a more mixed voice because of that volume and blending qualities already together [Music] and now she's exploring that voice there oh it's so like we don't hear this voice often that's why it sounds so different and unique but it still sounds super healthy in voice singing lessons we are told to neutralize the larynx i don't know how much i like using that term because naturally the larynx will move but here what we are seeing diana do is manipulating that larynx so changing that space of that larynx allowing it to drop down to get into that it's the choice that she's gone for i mentioned this before but if we're going with something we want to be 100 in that choice and live in that choice therefore we love it i'd love to see someone exploring their voice it's so cool [Music] wow oh i think they're gonna get another vote could you hear that smoothness of that slide up we are going through registers there so we are naturally going to hear that no can you hear that break right [Music] we're going lovely into that breath-like quality at the top still quite connected actually really lovely in that head voice then coming back into this chest voice into back to that same position with that dropped larynx and open uh back of our throat but cool glass [Music] she got two more wow so relaxed as well like how is she doing this no it's not necessary like we said earlier where are we we're on a we're on an f sharp three down here but because all the way we're manipulating the larynx and changing that tonbra um and she's staying down there and it sounds so sustainable it doesn't sound like she's hurting herself at all [Music] [Music] oh we got a little bit classical there as well before we could you hear when we went up to that head voice before it was a little bit breathy we were still connected but we allowed a little bit of that breath through and here we got really quite classical in that i we don't hear voices like this and she's so like just free with her voice and allowing it just to go to any color this whole passage it's like low down and do like how we said with and it's opening that space at the back but it's still really forward at the same time [Music] and now we're kind of leaving that place a little bit adding a little bit more of that twang like quality just to get that bright sound [Music] wow so again getting that breath uh quality in there in that head voice making it really floaty that's lovely [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh she's literally using her voice as an instrument right and playing out all those lovely notes and just oh we're going into more of a belt now here we're getting uh that speech-like quality is lifting slightly we're not raising our chest voice we're not pushing with our chest voice but allowing some of that quality to go up there and add in that head voice that she clearly has as well blending the two together to get louder sound over there now we open up she's also using some cry quality in there let's just listen to that one more time [Music] so we still have some of that quality that we had at the beginning but it's not as uh so if we're talking about percentages is not towards 80 90 it's probably like fifty six forty even so we still have that in us because it's her voice but she still changed it so much to get that brightness in there and keep that and her mouth is so relaxed as well which also relaxed to allow that to happen [Music] [Applause] [Music] and at that last moment we returned we added some vocal fry in there to get that uh to get that back into it adding that whisper right at the end so it's kind of like a full circle how many vocal techniques did we just see how many different tones tonbras styles like shook whoa so hands up if you've never heard a voice like that before that was out of this world someone to sing like that at such a young age and have so much um support down there as well that's crazy and like her voice could only go further which is very exciting again this kind of shows that there are no rules right if our voice wants to do that and it doesn't hurt and it sounds healthy obviously always consult with a voice teacher if that's something that you um have in your life then go for it explore your voice be free thank you for watching this

Beautiful.\\ As promised I am doing the second Eid look.\nThis is a really dramatic smokey eye. Its silver with bits of purple, dark navy blue\nand some black and some orange thrown into it. My last look was so simple. I just had\nto do a dramatic eye today. The inspiration for this look came from these sparkly lovely\ndangly earrings from Sokora Jewels, I will put all the links in the description box.\nIf anyone\\'92s interested my top is from Global Desi. I have never done this on camera before\nbut I love dramatic looks for myself so I hope you guys enjoy this nd if you wanted\nto know how I created this look then please stay tuned and keep watching. \\\nFirst i am going to prep my skin with a mixture of Embryolisse Lait Creme and The body Shop\\'92s\nVitamin C Glow Enhancer. This mix really plumps up my skin and leaves it super moisturised\nso that my skin is ready for all the products that are to follow. Now I am spraying some\nof the Smashbox Primer Water all over my face so that the foundation sticks to it really\nwell. I planned to start with my eyes but I forgot and started with my foundation instead.\nI mixed some Giorgio Armani Luminous silk with a drop of the Body Shop\\'92s Shade adjusting\ndrops to get the right shade for my skin colour. Even after I felt that my foundation was too\nlight but then I knew I would fix it later with some bronzer. I used a Real Techniques\nexpert face brush to apply the foundation and bounced my beauty blender on my face to\nmake sure that it soaked any extra product I had on my skin. then I moved on to my eyes\nand primed my lids with the Sephora primer, such an important step when you are doing\ndramatic looks like these. On top of that I applied the Maybelline Color Tattoo in Creamy\nbeige so that my eyeshadows look vibrant all day. then i set it with some laura mercier\nloose powder. I find that this step makes sure that all my eyeshadows glide on easily\non my eyelids and the color payoff is pretty intense. \\\nSo I am going to use the Nubian 2 Palette Today. now these are the colors and you can\nsee how well pigmented they are. i think it doesn\\'92t get as much love as it deserves\non instagram or even youtube. So I am going to use the colors Morocco, Jezebel and Cleopatra.\n\\ before that I am going to stick on some post\nit flags under my eyelids to help me create the slanting shape I want and also to catch\nany fallout I may have from working with so many eyeshadow colors. \\\nI am starting with the shade Morocco which is a lovely deep warm orange shade for my\ntransition color. This will give me an interesting contrast to my intensely silver smokey eye.\nI am taking the slightest bit on the tip of my brush because these are so heavily pigmented\nyou need very little. So its better to build up the color slowly so that you dont put too\nmuch color on your lids at one time. \\ then I am taking the shade Jezebel which is\na deep reddish purple shade and I am going to place that color on my crease\\'85again\nwe are building up the color slowly but surely\\'85I am using a very light hand here because I\ndont want this color to muddy that orange transition shade.\\\nNow for the navy blue that i will place on the outer corners of my eyelid and bringing\nit to the centre. We are leaving the inner half of the eyelid free of any color for now.\nI keep going back and forth with the shades Jezebel and Morocco to really build up the\nintensity. now for the silver, I am using an intense silver eyeshadow by Colour Pop.\nthis one\\'92s called Liberty and I am going to place it on the inner part of my eyelids\nwith my finger. I find using a finger versus a brush gives for a more vibrant finish. Thats\njust what I think. now I am taking a fluffy brush to blend the edges so that there is\na smooth gradation from the silver to the blue. Again I am using a light hand here.\nThen I am going over the crease with my fluffy brush to make sure the purple still retains\nits color and there are no harsh edges and all the colors are well blended into each\nother without looking too muddy.\\ Time to de-tape\\'85I am going to line my lower\neyelids with the navy blue shade, taking it until the tear duct but leaving the tear duct\nfree for all the silver we will use later. Then I go in with some purple below where\nwe put the blue, before blending it all with a fluffy brush. For my waterlines, I am using\nthe black gel eyeliner by Colour Pop. This gel liner is now my favourite. I believe its\ncalled Swerve. It doesn\\'92t budge or transfer which is a must if you want your eyeshadows\nto stay clean and bright, with no black littered on it. I am now adding some silver in the\ntear duct area just to brighten the area up and then with an eyeliner brush I am going\nto create an outline for that silver and join it to meet the navy blue. I love creating\nthis shape when I do dramatic smokey eyes. I used the same gel liner for this but you\ncan use any eyeliner you want. Now I am using the NYX Super fat Marker to line my upper\neyelids and I am going to create a rather extended wing for this one since we have that\nline already thanks to the tape we had used earlier. I usually work rather slowly when\nI create my eyeliner and once I am satisfied I move on to the other eye. Working slowly\nwhile looking down into a mirror really helps me make fewer mistakes and gives me the shape\nI want. I have also connected that wing to my lower lash line so that there is some depth\nof color at the very other edges. \\ Time to highlight the brow bone I am going\nto use my Sleek Highlighting palette in Midas Touch. I dont tend to use it too much but\nit has the perfect silver shade to match this smokey eye.And I love how this elevates the\neye makeup.\\ Now I am going to lightly fill in my brows\nwith my eyebrow pencil, you have seen me do this before\\'85I dont do anything dramatic\nbecause I think my eyebrows are dark enough and I am quite satisfied with their natural\nshape as it is\\'85\\ For concealer, I am using the MAC Studio Finish\nconcealer in NW 35 to counteract all the darkness under my eyes, patting it into place with\nthe beauty blender, before moving on to highlighting with the Maybelline Age Rewind concealer in\nmedium. I am going over all my usual areas to highlight. You\\'92ve seen this before\\'85under\nmy eyes, bridge of my nose, my forehead, under my cheekbones and my cupid\\'92s bow. i am\ngoing to blend it all in with the beauty blender first and then with a real techniques shadow\nbrush so that it doesn\\'92t erase my eyeshadow.\\ Now for contouring I am back with my favourite\nAnastasia Beverly Hills Palette and I am using this light brown shade here to shape my chubby\nface and create dimension. If done right this is so flattering and looks great in pictures.\nNow for some baking, I am using my Laura Mercier Loose setting powder under my eyes and everywhere\nwe highlighted and I am going to let that powder rest there for a few minutes.

So I will see you guys in my next video thank you so so\nso much for watching!}", "_iA4fZseGZk": "hi guys this is going to be the tutorial that's going to show you how to make this V stitch ripple stitch and as you can see with this stitch it has very high peaks and very low peaks I really think this this looks very unique to do the stitch it looks better if you change colors every two rows you can use any size yarn I'm using worsted weight yarn which is four ply for the US Tim fight for Australia and use any size that that the yarn will recommend a hook size when you look on the paper and for worst weight yarn it's usually around the five millimeter size each hook for the US so that's what I'm going to use the multiples of this stitch is 20 plus 3 and what that means is that you're going to chain in sets of 20 this is two sets of 20 the chain and then once you have your sets of 20 and you have the width that you want then chain three more and you're ready to start now the width that I have here the crocheted piece i chained 60 so this is only a chain of 40 so you can already tell because of the highs and lows that this stitch has that it's definitely you're gonna lose some you're going to have some shrinkage whenever you start to work the stitch so I believe that each one starts with the top and goes up so this is 40 and then I added the other 10 which is what this is this is 60 this is a chain of 40 it would fit over the whole thing so this keep in mind you're gonna lose I'd say about you're gonna lose about an inch every 20 stitches so for instance I have 40 so I've done 20 twice and I've lost I'd say from this peak to the end I've lost about two inches so because it's such a ripple just keep in mind you're going to lose about an inch per Toni chains okay so I have the width that I want so I'm ready to do my plus three now now I'm ready to start row one for Row one you want to double crochet in the one two three four if the fifth chain from the hook so counting over one two three four five in this fifth chain from the hook you want to work your first V stitch and these stitches are made up of double crochet chain one and double crochet all in the same stitch so that's our very first V stitch then you'll chain one you'll skip three one two three and then this fourth chain over again your work your next V stitch which is double crochet chain one double crochet and then you'll want to chain one again move over three skip three chains one two three and then this fourth chain here you want to work a V stitch then you'll chain three because right here we're going to be making the peak so chain three and in the same chain that you just worked your last V stitch in you want to work the next V stitch as well so you'll have two V stitches and a chain three all worked in the same stitch and that will give you your peak then you'll chain one again you'll move over you'll skip three one two three so in this fourth chain over you're going to do another V stitch and then you'll chain one again and then we're going to be starting our down peak so skip 3 1 2 3 and then this fourth one over you'll do a v-stitch and then without chaining 1 you're gonna skip skip three chains one two three and in this fourth chain you'll do another V stitch and that's going to be the start of your down peak but it only starts to become a down peak as you do more rows and it'll pull it more together so once we've got our down peak you'll chain one skip three one two three and then the fourth chain over do a v-stitch and then you'll chain one skip three and the fourth chain over do a v-stitch this is going to be our peak again so you'll do V stitch chain three and then work another V stitch in that same stitch okay and then you'll chain one skip three one two three fourth one over you'll put a v-stitch the old chain one you'll skip three one two three and then that should give you three chains left so skip three and then the fourth chain over do a v-stitch this would usually be our low point or a low peak so without chaining one you just want to skip one chain and double crochet in the last chain see as I said the low won't really become sharper until you do more rows but that's what the beginning and that's what Row 1 looks like you want to chain three and turn for a row two we're going to be working in the chain 1 spaces from Row 1 so find your first chain one space between the two these stitches and they will put a V stitch there then chain one and you're going to move over and do the same thing in the next chain-1 space you'll put a V stitch there chain one this is where you work on the chain three space itself here you're going to work a another peak so using the chain three you're gonna do your V stitch chain three V stitch all worked in this chain three space you'll always work your Peaks like this in the chain three space so V stitch chain three don't lose your loop like I just did and V stitch again that creates the next peak for this row you'll chain one and then again you're going to be working in the chain one space creating a V stitch chain one I don't know why I keep losing my yarn here okay so then it brings us to the peak so whoops not chain one I'm so used to chaining one wait no no okay yeah Pete you are do chain one after that when we start one more v-stitch to do before the down part and this last chain one space but don't chain one after that one you want to move over to the other side so you'll be skipping your low peak here the two V stitches that have no chain in the middle and you're just going to come on over to the first chain one space after and that's how you start to pull your low peak down then you'll chain one find your next chain one space before the peak here chain one then you'll do your peak so in your chain three space the top of your peak you're going to put your V stitch what do I keep losing my yarn Beast its chain three B stitch then after that after you've done your peak you're going to chain one move into the next chain one space here and do a V stitch then chain one and your very last chain one space here you're going to put a V stitch but don't chain one at after you're just going to come right in here and this chain space here and you're going to put a double crochet in the ending chain three space and that will end row 2 and if you haven't noticed if you if you look there's only one like what I call free-floating V stitch so you're only gonna have like this one is already on the bottom peak and then this is the floating one and then here this first wasted chair is already as part of the peak so you so these also these are both bottom ones and these are top ones so see you only really have one V stitch in between one regular V stitch chain one then you're gonna already start your low peak or your upper peak so just keep that in mind you don't really have one floating a V stitch the rest are going to be a part of the upper or lower peak so that's two rows of the same color this is where I usually change also this is where we're going to start the way the stitch will be done from here on out is how you'll do Row 3 which is what I'm about to show you and then you're just going to like repeat Row 3 over and over again but you're just be changing colors every two rows for the best results so I'm going to switch colors real quick usually what I do is I take out the loop so I don't complete the very last stitch then I'll get my next color I'll just take my next color and create my own loop which I will feed through my loops to complete my stitch then you want to pull the original color just to tighten the loops a little bit and then pick up your new color okay for Row three and this will be the repeat you will chain three turn now we're going to be working with v stitches last time you we were going through the chain ones between the two V stitches from now on you're going to be working in the V stitch so this first V stitch that you have here on the previous row will always be skipped you never put anything in this first one you know when we end the row by doing a V stitch and then don't chain one and you just double crochet there at the end it's just basically on the down it's on the down peak so you don't touch this you're only going to be working in what I call the floater the one I was talking about before the one that's between the high and the low point this will always be your first stitch of the row if you mess up you're gonna get off okay it won't look right on the ends so to make sure that your side stays straight always put it in the middle one so I'm going to do that now I already chain three and since I need to work one row down this is my floater this is my middle one see this is my peak that's my low so no one's gonna be working one row down so next row after you come back this will be the middle one but since we're all will always be working one row down so I'll be working on row one in this middle one middle V stitch so I'm going to come down into that V stitch and then just do a v-stitch you're basically working in the first row over the second row and this is how it's going to create color blending down so once you got your V stitch chain one then you're coming over here to the next v-stitch which essentially you're creating your middle one your middle V stitch your floater as I was calling them that's the middle one so that means we're going to start our peak we've come to the chain-3 here so you'll do a B stitch chain three V stitch then you'll chain one find that middle one which is here which is actually part of your peak on row one you'll be coming into that B stitch I'm doing a B stitch in that one and then you've got one more here one row down whoops go down one row into that V stitch and then without chaining one you want to move over here take a look here this is your two middle ones that are your low has no chain in the middle so you'll be working a V stitch before it and just like we did before we'll be working it after so we've gone into this V stitch skip the two Center ones and then work into the next V stitch on row one again you don't chain one in between these two okay now you chain one find your next V stitch here which is your middle V stitch not part of the peak or the bottom either peak then you'll chain one and then you'll work your upper peak so V stitch chain three and B stitch okay then you'll you'll chain one again and then again you'll go down one row here there middle V stitch which will bring us to the end where we do our low point like our half a low point so you will chain one after that one then you'll come down and in the very next V stitch work your V stitch but don't chain one after just yarn over and again in this chain three space here at the end put a double crochet and that will enroll three and you're going to be working this exact stitch two rows down I should say one row down every row it'll be a repeat of chain three so this is row four which is a repeat of chain three I mean Row three keep saying chain okay so this time chain three actually needed to stay chained that time okay so chain three skip the very first remember skip the very first V stitch find your next V stitch one row down and do your first V stitch in that chain one find your next V stitch which will be part of the peak do your research there chain one now you're going to be working your peak so do a v-stitch chain three and then do a v-stitch I want to show you something I have to show you this row okay so again this is two rows down this is your very next stitch which is your middle one because you just did your peak so that's going to be your floater so you know the next one will be part of your down peak so the first part of it is before the first V stitch remember don't chain one after and then you skip on over and do the V stitch after so now you can start to see TV stitches to view stitches TV stitches starting to pull together so after you do that V stitch you'll chain one then you'll do your middle V stitch again what your middle one will always be part of the previous peak chain one and then do your upper peak one two and three don't forget chain one after that then we'll be doing our center V stitch so do a V stitch and chain one and that will bring us to the end again so just like before you'll you'll always skip the very last few stitch you'll always skip the very first V stitch so this one here will be our last one so do your V stitch and without chaining one do a double crochet in the final chain three space and that's the end of row 4 which is the repeat of Row three and you just want to keep repeating Row three like now I just did two rows of color I would want to change to a third color I think I used four different colors on mine originally which I'm going to show you now and what I wanted to show or tell you about anyway is as you can see get that out of the way there's no because you're doing over two rows changing color all the fringe if you want to call it that all the tails I'll end up on one side so you can hide those or at the end of all the blankets you can add friends on the other side as well or just create a border around the whole thing though doing that on this particular car stitch can be difficult but I just wanted you to know that it's only a one-sided thing so that's it guys I really hope you enjoyed this tutorial if you did please don't forget to like and share and comment under this video

edition of photoshopping palettes into the way i want them to be because they weren't exactly perfect in the way i wanted them to be so um so i have four palettes that we're going to be working on today i have the blockbuster and hot topic palette i have the urban decay wild west palette the uh new natasha denona loco circo loco palette the one that looks kind of like clown makeup and then the beauty bay uh fiery 2 palette i spent a good amount of time editing these down um and i've edited this down into like essentially a speed edit a speed build a speed building of pallets if you will so let's just get started okay i've done this once before if you haven't seen it i will put a link in a card so you can check it out i did one a couple of months ago but um let's just dive right into the first palette we're starting with the hot topic and blockbuster palette when this first came out i was kind of excited for it but knowing how the quality of hot topic palettes are as a former hot topic employee um i wasn't optimistic digging into this the first thing i wanted to do was change the background to black because it's easier to work with and easier to see because one of the biggest pet peeves i have is when a palette has a bright colored background that's like so close to one of the shades and it just makes the shade look that much more desaturated and sad so i made the background black just because it's easier to actually like see the colors be inspired by the colors it's a clean canvas and then the next thing i actually did i grabbed the actual shades from the outside of the palette because the yellow and the blue at the very front the very first two shades were actually a little bit lighter and not quite as as like rich as what was actually on the outside of the package so i wanted to deepen those up make them a little bit richer and i literally went on google and just started like searching for blockbuster images and i was like what what can i find here what other colors things do they have in their stores because um we had a hollywood video near my house we didn't really have a blockbuster we had hollywood video um so i kept some of the shades the same but a lot of it was kind of like adjusting uh finishes and tones and because this whole palette was matte so i made this gold in the bottom right the shade television i made it into like a satin kind of shimmery gold whereas the first color is like a straight up matte mustard shade and then the green shade i actually made it a little bit lighter a little bit um more kind of the lighter teal felt a little more 80s a little more pastel i don't know why i felt like changing it but you know um and now i'm messing with the browns so this top brown shade what did i do with it what did i make it pink oh i tested i started doing some shades that were more like kind of stereotypical 80s shades that lean more in like kind of cyberpunk type colors and i ended up not keeping that pink but we're kind of playing around with the pink for a little bit um and moving some things around we're just adjusting stuff and then i also added a purple because i felt like purple pink and teal and blue were definitely very 80s but the pink and the purple don't stay stick around for very long i end up changing them but this kind of gray charcoal at the top i made into more of a shimmery kind of oh yeah shimmery kind of gray like a shimmery charcoal um because i wanted to add again a little bit more of a variance in finishes because this palette was so matte i found a photo of a blockbuster t-shirt so i took the yellow from that shirt and actually made that shade into uh comedy yeah comedy i made into the bright ass yellow and i thought it worked and then i also grabbed the kind of dark blue teal from the uh from the shirt as well and i actually ended up changing the pink into that like dark blue teal and i feel like it works a lot better into this kind of like more 90s color story because i realized quickly and like blockbuster isn't solely like 80s type stuff it's also very 90s so uh we went into this kind of like darker desaturated tealy blue shade i made the teal into again kind of like a shimmery shade um the way i i showed a shimmer i actually added a filter and a texture to the uh gradient images just to you'll see that in just a second that i'm doing right here i'm adding a filter texture over the top testing which ones work gotta love photoshop there it is so now it looks more like a shimmery eyeshadow and i'm doing this to all of the other shimmery eyeshadows and i think is this how it stayed i thought the purple went away oh no i do change the purple i was like i know i changed something oh i made like a darker kind of reddy brown because there wasn't any other like dark dark shades in here besides that charcoal and then the dark kind of bluey teal made this charcoaly one with that filter and there we go look at the difference i mean i think the original one was fun but i feel like the one i made was a little more fun and had a little more variance because of the finish because the whole original palette was mattes it just ended up looking kind of chalky because probably the quality and also just like the shade variations weren't that exciting but what do you think of my redo i like it next we have beauty bay and this is the fiery 2 palette which is 42 shades so the first thing i did and literally i think the only thing i did was um delete a bunch of shades i'm just going through and finding things that look way too similar things that are redundant things that don't need to be there because so much of that top like line is all very like light tan light nude shades which are just very unneeded especially because they're looking gonna look exactly the same on the eye so i went through and i just deleted a bunch of shades and moved them around so it's me just kind of like making a puzzle a new puzzle to fit this into half the amount of spaces i think i actually had a lot of fun with this one because it was interesting to see exactly how many repeat shades there are what did i do with this one oh yeah no i deleted one of those because again pointless i'm counting how many i have left and i have left to delete bam i think i have one more finding the layers that i'm working with is always a struggle like which layer is it i don't know i don't name my layers when i do this stuff but i'm going through and just rearranging the shades to put them in a an order that makes sense because i literally cut down it to half the shades and once i cut it down to all of these shades i think they end up being like a really fun color story i think it totally works i think uh it yeah it totally works i would buy this i would buy this in a heartbeat hell yeah just moving stuff around there we go look at that look at that look at the difference i think i ended up adjusting a couple more yeah i added one kind of deeper reddish shade which is what i'm doing right now i'm just grabbing a shade that i can adjust a little bit easier and copying it and pasting it so i can just work with it because i wanted like a deeper kind of like eggplanty maroon wine shade i was like eggplant maroon wine wine and that's literally all i did i changed one shade and i deleted half of them bam there you go and now we have a new balance wouldn't you buy this i would buy this look at the difference honestly the difference between these two is pretty staggering because you can see on the top level like i deleted almost all of the shades at the top because they're just so unneeded when you have all of this like fun rich color on the bottom i don't know i feel like having unnecessary amount of crease shades in a palette this big it's just like why is it this big like what are you doing we don't need this who asked for this 42 if i thought 35 was bad 42 42 shades is an abomination i'm sorry not sorry next we have the natasha denona circo loco palette and this one was the hardest for me to find a photo of because like there weren't any actual like clear photos of it besides this so i wasn't a huge fan of the oranges in the palette i feel like it kind of like i don't know was a weird contrast uh even though i have orange and purple going on right now with my lighting but the orange is i i wasn't a fan so i spent actually a decent amount of time kind of going through here and figuring out where i wanted to move things what i wanted to delete and what i wanted to adjust and so this one right here that i'm working on i'm making it more of like a light purple um because i feel like there wasn't like a light purple in the palette a lot of dark purples um and i wanted to make this more kind of purple green and gold the orange and the pink just kind of threw me off i didn't mess with the pink that much but the oranges threw me off so i was just very confused by this i don't know it's like they just can't get it quite right i don't know with pallets being this expensive i don't want to invest a bunch of money in a pallet that i don't love wholeheartedly and i actually did kind of struggle with this one because it was so all over the place so there's just a lot of me kind of struggle busting through this trying to figure out where i want to put stuff what i want to copy and paste um so i'm just leaving this whole thing in because it's honestly kind of interesting seeing like how much of a weird struggle it was because this palette was so complicated and disjointed so i'm just kind of moving around and copying some stuff i like the idea of putting more kind of gold tones and keeping the golds and the yellows because i feel like those really complemented the purples and the greens but the orange is i don't know orange next to purple just reminds me of college colors like it just reminds me of college football all right now we're kind of playing like a bit of a musical chairs kind of moving things around and putting things where i want them to go just like literally stretching images to the size of the palettes themselves no i just switched the light purple and the dark kind of berry shade yeah i just ended up moving this this one around a lot because it was it was a struggle to kind of get things in the right place and i don't even know if if i succeeded in making this palette more like what i wanted it was fun kind of going through it you know just kind of like making sure that the placement was what i what i liked because that was the thing about that palette that kind of bothered me was the placement of everything so uh i i think i achieved something i don't know next next we have the wild west palette from urban decay and this is one that i actually mentioned in my last anti-haul that i'm like i'm gonna redo it i'm gonna make my own and again this one was actually kind of a struggle kind of finding exactly what i wanted because i feel like a lot of my ideas around this palette was about pairing it with other things in like a full collection doing like a sheriff's badge highlighter and like cowboy pocket rocket lip glosses like that would be like chef's kiss of a collection literally the first thing i did was i searched wild west images on google just to kind of get ideas for colors and stuff and aesthetics uh grab some like blue tones a little bit like scarletty red tones this one again i kind of go back and forth with a decent amount of times so i'm taking this gold and really saturating it up because one thing that urban decay is known for is putting these like sad ass golds in every single palette so i'm making the gold very gold and then this kind of brownie warm brick tone i'm making it very warm brick tone because i just needed to add some more color some more saturation this palette was also just sadly lacking some shades that really made sense so i added in like a really really really dark i mean like a black realistically um and i literally just searched wild west i eventually searched wild wild west so uh you'll get to see some will smith and cisco kevin klein kenneth branagh yeah so i i the wild wild west it was 1999 i was right i wanted to add the black in there because while a lot of things were dusty in the wild west there's needed to be like a straight up black shade and because i thought it was an abomination that they didn't have midnight rodeo or midnight cowboy in the palette i added in midnight rodeo i literally like grabbed midnight rodeo and slapped it in the palette because urban decay you already have multiple eye shadows themed around wild west midnight rodeo midnight cowboy midnight cowboy is like a pink so i wasn't really keen on using midnight cowboy so i made that yellow a bit more actual yellow um oh this is where i put midnight rodeo there we go really just like copying and pasting like a swatch from the color and then just slapping it in there it's not that different from what they already had it's a little more taupe and a little more champagne than what they already had theirs was a bit more silver which i can see silver as being a shade in there but it wasn't what i was going for yeah see midnight cowboy is definitely more pink what do i do with this charcoal what did i do i just made it a little darker just a little bit darker just a little darker like the studs on your shoes you know this was the shade i had a hard time with i wasn't sure if i wanted to do something more red so i grabbed some red tones in there and i actually moved the brown first i moved whiskey over to have uh that spot right there and then i messed with that kind of lighter tone right there and i made it red it doesn't stay red for very long but i wanted to show that process because um yeah i wasn't feeling it i wasn't feeling it oh and i also made this charcoal i made it more blue like blue jeans and this was kind of where i realized i didn't want that red to be red because i feel like having the blue the yellow the green and the red was a bit much so i end up turning the red into a uh a gray here in a second because i'm like no the red's not working the red's not working for me see that's so i like that a lot better because we still got that kind of light not light mid-tone kind of charcoal and we get some of that going on so and look at the difference i mean i i'm not i don't super dislike the original wild west palette i feel like it wasn't everything that they could have made it but it didn't look like a bad palette i just wanted to kind of up the saturation make it a little more fun match the outer packaging a little bit better because there was that kind of blue blue and green and purple kind of snake skin thing going on um so i wanted to add a little more color into the palette and i think i succeeded i hope i don't know let me know in the comments please don't tell me if it's bad i'm just having fun photoshopping some things oh my blanket's falling down i got a new chair but i have an afghan over the top of it because it's comfortable i had fun with that one uh let me know in the comments down below which palettes you maybe want me to redo that have come out in the last little bit because these are a little bit older and so uh what i might want to do for next month is kind of like gather some palettes that have come out recently to do for next month so let me know in the comments if there are any recent palettes that you have seen that i should photoshop and redo i've definitely had a lot of people uh suggest the elf and chipotle palette and honestly like they kind of got the color story down so like i'm not mad at it i mean i'm mad at it from like a corporate standpoint but like the colors i'm like that kind of looks like a burrito for today's song of the day let's see i will say today's song of the day is say the name from clipping because i have been driving a lot lately like a lot a lot and listening to like the loudest music possible and clipping has been one of those artists that i have constantly been like yep i'm gonna play this because it's loud and i can shout along to it and just like dance in my seat in my car but say the name by clipping is your song of the day it is fantastic it is like hardcore kind of alt industrial hip hop wonderful that's what i've been blasting in

lately you can easily find products that say things like boosted terpene content added terpenes and so on you can even find pure terpene extract oils designed to give things like hemp oil extracts and vape liquids an authentic cannabis aroma and flavor but what exactly are these compounds and what role do they play in terms of the overall health effects of cannabis let's take a look before we get right into the meat of the content let me take a second to remind new viewers to subscribe right here to the way of leaf channel we offer expert-backed information on all things cannabis and cbd anyway back to the question what are terpenes in the most basic sense terpenes are aromatic compounds that give cannabis its unique flavor and aroma you know how each different strain of cannabis has a different smell and taste well terpenes are largely to thank for that there are literally hundreds of different terpenes sometimes called terpenoids that exist in cannabis the prevalence of specific terpenes as well as the mixture of various terpenes in a given strain are what gives strains their own distinguishable smell taste and even their own unique effects in terms of the high they produce as we said a moment ago there are literally hundreds of different terpenes that exist not only in cannabis but also in other plant species as well here are some of the most common terpenes you'll find in different hemp and marijuana strands mircine potentially the most common cannabis terpene of all myrcin is found abundantly in most varieties of cannabis and hemp the terpene is known for its earthy almost dirt-like aroma and it exists naturally in things like mango and lemongrass effects-wise myrsin is known to have a positive impact on soreness and inflammation-related pain it's also been known to help tremendously with trouble sleeping pinene with an immediately recognizable scent of pine the pinene terpene is found naturally in things like orange rinds rosemary and other herbs and you guessed it pine trees this is a terpene that's found in high quantities in a lot of sativa strains in fact the presence of pinene could be what gives sativas their uplifting almost energy-inducing characteristics lowell as a wonderful floral terpene linda lowall is the dominant terpene in lavender ever wonder why lavender is used so commonly in aromatherapy to help treat things like stress anxiety and depression it's probably mostly due to linolo and its calming soothing effects limonene found abundantly in juniper peppermint and of course lemons limonene is another common cannabis terpene with a strong citrus aroma strains that are high in limonene have been known to boost energy levels elevate mood and even help with anxiety and depression karyophiline known as the spicy terpene karyophylene is the dominant terpene presence in black pepper and cinnamon as well as several popular cannabis strains the compound is known for its potent anti-inflammatory effects which can work wonders on things like joint pain and muscle soreness other less common terpenes include compounds like humulene and osamine but these are rarely the dominant terpenes in any one strain and little is known about their therapeutic effects admittedly a lot more research needs to be done if we're to better understand the specific role terpenes play with regard to cannabis effects on health one thing is for sure though the therapeutic effects of cannabis wouldn't be the same without them in fact numerous academic publications have observed a phenomenon known as the entourage effect the entourage effect describes how the presence of terpenes along with other compounds like flavonoids and cannabinoids work together to produce enhanced wellness effects this basically means that cannabis extract without terpenes probably isn't as effective when it comes to pain relief stress and anxiety relief inflammation relief and so on in fact a publication in the british journal of pharmacology made the suggestion that terpenes display unique therapeutic effects that may contribute to the entourage effect of cannabis-based medicinal extracts the study goes on to suggest that terpenes are likely to produce synergy in relation to cannabis ability to treat a variety of medical conditions including conditions like pain inflammation depression and anxiety addiction epilepsy and even fungal and bacterial infections like mrsa what does this all mean in a practical sense well some experts are hypothesizing that the cannabis market is going to see a huge influx of products marketed not only for their thc and cbd content but also for their specific terpene content for example if you're looking for a strain or extract to help you sleep you'll probably be able to choose a product in a year or two that's been genetically bred to contain high amounts of linolol the a4 mentioned study even references as much claiming that if proven cannabinoid terpenoid synergy will result in an extensive pipeline of new cannabis-based therapeutic products a separate 2018 study in the academic journal headache reproduced many of the observations made in the prior study researchers again suggested that the complete arrangement of compounds in cannabis including terpenes phytocannabinoids and other compounds all work synergistically to produce variations in health benefits variations in strain characteristics and even variations in a strains specific side effects they also suggest that advancing research on terpene activity in different strains will allow growers to cross breed phenotypes and eventually allow people to target specific symptoms and even specific diseases alright so on to the fun part how do you know which terpenes are dominant in which specific cannabis strains some dispensaries not many but some include chirping profiles on the various strains they sell to help you out we've provided a brief rundown of the most abundant terpenes in cannabis and which specific strains you're likely to find them in knowing and even memorizing this information will help you better choose a strain depending on the specific therapeutic effects you're wanting to achieve if you're looking for specifically high amounts of mircine you'll want to focus in on popular breeds like og kush nine pound hammer granddaddy purple and girl scout cookies other mere scene-rich strains include skywalker og remedy and one of our own personal favorites tanji mircine is known for its sleep inducing almost sedative qualities so keep this in mind when selecting a strain based on its therapeutic effects the pionene terpene known for its uplifting energy-inducing characteristics is found in high quantities in super popular strains like blue dream og cush and train wreck it's also the dominant terpene in other slightly harder-defined strains like hazeberry bubba kush and chemdawg91 the wonderfully aromatic chirping linaloal which has a brilliant floral aroma and calm soothing effects is most easily found in lavender cannabis strands this includes several different strains of skunk and afghani genetics as well as more obscure strains like fire og scooby snacks dosy dough and skittles if you're looking for strains that have the potential to help with stress anxiety and depression keep an eye out for breeds that are high in limonene this includes strains like ac dc a cbd dominant strain as well as cinex and super lemon haze the limonene terpene has a potent and very obvious citrus aroma which allows you to often tell an unidentified limonene dominant strain just by giving it a good smell last but not least karyophiline the spicy terpene can be found in high amounts in potent strains like death start and gorilla glue number four to a lesser extent it's also a dominant terpene in several kush varieties including bubba kush skywalker og kush and kosher kush this is a terpene that's known for its anti-inflammatory benefits so it would be a good choice if you're looking for pain relief or are suffering from things like aching joints or sore muscles well that just about wraps it up for our beginner's guide to what are terpenes

talk about that later when i'm ready it's closer to the areas where i have all my meetings um no no it used to be a long drive i'm just moving around that's it um you don't see the actual work behind all of that has to do guys and let's start boom and in makeup is going to be our glass uh full face hourglass which is exclusively available in sephora you can buy it online from sephora and i'm starting with the best primer ever which is the veil primer my favorite the second foundation i go through or the third i guess because palastool i love the first one this is done which is golden natural which is the most beautiful olive shade you can use it's a little bit light so this is the vanish stick foundation it's a full full coverage foundation that you can play with its thickness and the way you want it to appear and the parts usually chocolate and i'm gonna darken it i'm gonna make it like a bit dark with the golden amber lighter i'm going to darken it with a golden amber mattress for best um what i want to tell you who wouldn't they want to stand the realistic and then apply it on your face and what had told us it's much better and it will look much better trust me golden amber and i'm gonna contour actually yeah i'm gonna contour with it but no i mean there's my foundation i don't want to show like i'm contouring and i'm what i'm trying here to do and know to fix the to match my shade perfectly i know golden amber is a little bit too dark and golden natural is a little bit too light right now with my tan [Music] brush now so so excited about with the newest product our launchmen hourglass with a veil um eye primer so they have now an eye primer which is called just helps everything hickey so look clean oh it's clean this is my brows of calm and since i have the primer on now i'm ready for the eye shadow for i'm going to be using the scattered light glitter eyeshadow in the shade aura so i'm going to be applying this all over my eyelid you can use your fingers to apply this best since my nails are like thule late i'm not able to put my finger in there actually yeah i can a little bit not painting so [Music] i'm using a sponge instead bronzer which is the nude bronze light and i will bronze my entire face with it and the reason why i'm doing this step now is because i'm going to be using it coming as an eyeshadow the same bronzer high hado and i'm going to kind of like blend the crease here and then i will be applying it on my lower lid artichoke habit i always do this step i feel like it makes my eyes a bit bigger hello is that an extra drama you can use the same glitter i'll attach the liner i think i'm going to use that do that in the end i'll see but i'll be taking one of hourglasses bestseller which is the caution uh black like ultra black mascara and stamina obviously and i will be applying two layers of this mascara my soft take on this look if you want to make it a little bit more edgy but how to do a little bit of this glitter allergies from the head but and you apply thick lashes out if you have lash extensions and it will make it like much edgier and kind of like sexier this is a soft glam look uh but you can just change it up with an apple because it's been um it's been a while it's been a while it had black um eyeliner viable let me do that it doesn't look with black but i'll edge it up with putting glitter lashes done now i'm gonna apply the blush which is um euphoric fusion i think it's a perfect match and also it's a highlighter at the same time so i'm not gonna actually apply highlighter because i feel like the glitter on my eyes are enough and for the lips i want it to be glossy and lipper glossy in the idaho way um unreal in the shade halo let i know it's kind of clear with a little bit of shivers but it keeps my natural lip color which goes perfectly with this look i feel um anyway to kind of make sure the makeup is going to stay the way it is um where's my brush i'm just going to take a little bit of that and just set i wanted i was supposed to do this before the gloss best i'm just going to set so this is one of my favorite powders which is the veil pressures and setting powder and he could look be the veil soft focus setting spray which is the latest launch coming of an hourglass spray machine like that i feel like hourglass they're really killing it with the complexion and hello you know like it doesn't leave how did nothing wish five doesn't ruin the makeup that's kind of that's it for tonight's look let me know guys what you think i'll post the picture in like 20 minutes", "sbYJhRJfLqI": "hey what's going on GBA purple grizzly here and I got some modern warfare 2 gameplay for you um evening ask why modern warfare 2 why not black ops the answer to that question is I thought modern warfare 2 would be a fitting choice for this commentaries topic and the second question you may ask is what is today's topic very simple answer the topic for this commentary is going to be modern warfare 3 so I've been watching a lot of commentaries on YouTube lately and a lot of the well-known commentators and some of the commentators that i watch have been talking about modern warfare 3 so I figured hey you know why not I'm gonna go ahead and try and touch on it no homo so I'm not really going to talk about black ops so I figured a good thing to start this off would be talking about my experiences with modern warfare 2 as any call of duty fanboy I have been playing cod4 um since 2007 2008 and it's just cod4 one of the best games of all time hands down you can't deny it even though you want to so like a cod fanboy I was highly anticipated for modern warfare 2 I got it at the midnight release in everything and i gotta say when the game first came out I was in love I loved it with a passion and I wanted to make sweet sweet love and have babies with this game but we all know that's physically not possible and somewhat mentally disturbingly wrong so I didn't really get tired of the game until I'd say a few months I'd say probably months of floor black ops came out i love the weapon customization I loved all the options you could do modern warfare 2 I loved all the you know there's just so much so many attachments so many secondary sources it's probably one of the most like free customizable call duty games to come out to date it overall it's a really fast paced game and I love that I love a lot of action in video games you know it's a change from the average boring life of a teenager so let's talk about some of the things in modern warfare 2 that really really irritated me on the number one thing I could think of and i'm sure everyone except for the douchebags that partake in this act would have to agree with me it's the one man army Danger Close new tubing I hate it with a passion I refuse to do it I it's just a moral standard of mine i religiously believe against new tubing in this game it is it's such garbage and it ruins everything from a comp taters point of view especially I mean I play modern warfare two for fun but you know hey I might want to try and get a gameplay to commentate over like this um and there's always new tubers out there ruining that they're just constantly ah it's just you guys you guys feel me I know you do I know you feel the Grizz right now so I know um there's gonna be new tubes in modern warfare 3 there's a picture of one and you know I'm okay with that I'm okay with new tubes and black ops they're not that bad but if new tubes are at the same bar as modern warfare two new tubes I will I will honestly cry and I might have to shake a baby or something so if an award can hear this issue one of the other things that that really bothered me with modern warfare 2 was was the hacking there was constantly constantly spamming of 10th lobby messages and just all these people ago yo you want tons per studio I can do or 60 Marcel points like I've had friends get scammed it's just like I mean you guys spend so much money in so much time developing this game again it could be modded and hacked that easily I mean that's that's kind of sad and I really hope that modern warfare 3 doesn't follow in the same footsteps when it comes to money on a different note let's not talk about the depressing and horrible things that modern war efforts you've brought into our lives let's have a brighter look at the future that is called modern warfare 3 so from the trailer so far and all the quote unquote leaked information on definitely I definitely have my hopes up for this game I'm definitely looking forward to it and regardless of how it turns out I'm going to buy it it's call of duty I'm a gamer and I love Cole duty and others millions of people out there that do love it and just to give it an analogy for how much I love call of duty I would buy a jar of malaria and if you guys don't know what malaria is it's a disease that is spread by mosquitoes in Africa and it kills thousands and thousands of people and I would buy John malaria if had call duty on the side of that jar so there's been rumors recently that there is going to be this new premium service introduced with modern warfare 3 and it's going to be called call of duty elite I'm not sure what this is going to be I've heard rumors and there's certain speculations that it's going to be a monthly subscription fee to to coal duty in everything call of duty and for a small price that you can get like like all the add-ons or something like that and it's going to be like you have dedicated servers which is also a good thing and it's just like it's going to be so much more extensive with your call duty experience it's going to be like PlayStation Plus 44 PSN and it's like so I going to be like having a gold account over a silver account on xbox live and it's just like it's gonna be like that for whole duty in everything called ed so subscription fee or no subscription fee I'm looking forward to this call of duty elite the amount of coal duty that I play it's definitely going to be worth extra few dollars month to have a premium service and just get more enjoyment out of the game one of the things that I'm looking really forward to with modern warfare 3 is definitely going to be the freedom of attachments modern warfare 2 had a large large amount of attachments they can choose from and it's awesome and modern warfare 3 is rumored to be even more than that like I guess you could put two scopes on your gun or something like that like for example you could put an acog site and a red dot on a m4 and it's like I have no idea how that's going to work sounds insane um I don't know if it's going to be like alternating scopes or if you could like look through both them at the same time like it's some dual sided action up in hell I'm not sure but it looks pretty cool from what I've seen um there's leaked pictures out there there's trailers out there I'm sure you guys can find it so my main point is I'm just I'm looking forward to this game so much and I'm sure all the fellow GBA commentators and the viewer is on this channel are looking forward to it as well of course there's going to be the first week high of the game that people like the call everyone's going to love it's going to be the best new thing ever and then people are going to start complaining all the bullcrap is going to be noticed so hopefully you guys enjoyed this commentary I want you to rate the video i want you to comment and let me know what you guys are looking forward to in modern warfare 3 peace out guys remember purple grizzly here as always and i'm signing out", "Fl1XmwT3iVs": "hello everyone and welcome to purple rose crafts today we're going to create this lovely moss stitch dishcloth it is this is one that i created uh prior with some scrap yarn honestly it was two small balls of this dark gray and then this pretty blue color but we're actually going to use our bernat handicrafter cotton in the anchors away color so it's this lovely teal dark blue and gray with white we're also going to use our six millimeter uh crochet hook as well and before we go further i want to give you guys a little bit of a tip uh if you can see this ball here it actually has 340 grams in it this is one of the variegated patterns of course uh but recently i picked up this of the ball of this um light gray color it's called soft gray and if you can see the amount of yarn in this ball it's 400 grams so you're getting an extra 60 grams in the solid color than you are in the variegated and it turns out they're both the same price so uh tip for new uh cotton work uh people you know dishcloth makers and things like that that you get extra yard if you buy the solid colors uh versus the variegated ones all right so we're going to do this by creating our chain row we're going to start with 30 chains and then we're going to move into a very nice and simple pattern for our most stitch this is suitable for beginners and can be worked up very quickly i usually work these up in just a few hours so i can get usually one done in an evening and um you know that means i actually give these as gifts for my kids teachers for christmas and they tend to love them because they um you know they're useful and they're not another coffee mug right so um i like to give them for the teachers so i tend to make quite a few for each year at christmas and and i really like using uh different patterns for all different types of of cloth so if you can see some of the other videos i've posted i'll link them in the description below i've posted a couple of knit videos for dishcloths already so far but we're going to do some crochet ones as well now before we get close to christmas as well okay um so first of all we're gonna do this moss stitch and then we're going to move into some other styles as well all right so okay so i'm actually using a little bit larger of a hook than i did for the original design um so it's actually going to be a few less stitches than i had planned so we're going to do 21 stitches and uh we are doing 21 so basically this stitch is going to be multiples of 2 and then we're going to add one extra stitch for the chain at the beginning of the row so um to go ahead and start our row we're going to start with a single crochet on the second stitch from our hook and then so here we have the the last chain from our um chain row and this one is our second so our pattern is going to be single crochet chain one okay and then we're going to skip a stitch and work into the next one so we're going to work into the second one over again and chain one skip and then chain one again skip our stitch this one here and then we're gonna work into the next one oops we're making a double crochet here so i'll just unlock that single crochet chain one skip work into the next one all right so nice and simple and i'll come back in just a second for the second row and to give you a good idea of how we work the second row on top of this first row on our foundation stitches okay uh just a moment all right so here we are at the end of our row so basically we have our last single crochet here and then one last stitch on the end so we actually want to uh anchor our cloth with an extra single crochet on the end so we're not going to chain one at the end of that one so at the end we're going to do two single crochets to finish off the row we have a chain one and now we're going to actually chain a second we've created our chain to be equivalent to the single crochet that we had at the end of the row now we're going to skip this first single crochet from the row previous and we're going to create a second chain to create that stitch okay so we have changed two at the beginning of the row normally with single crochets we'd only chain one but we want this actually to go over so we can work into the space between the two single crochets in the previous row so now we're gonna single crochet into this into the chain space from the row below and so single crochet and chain one and now we're gonna skip over come into the chain space again and continue working in that fashion so single crochet and chain one okay now skip over to the next chain space single crochet and chain one and continue that like that across the row all right so here we are at the end of the row now and we have done our single crochet chain all the way across now what we have left is a single crochet and our chain from the beginning of the first row and so now we're going to chain over top of the single crochet skip it and then put our single crochet in the end of the row to finish off our anchoring at the end of the row okay so this row slightly different from the first row um but honestly a very simple two-row repeat so we're going to do uh chain one and then we're going to turn our work around and we're going to work that first row back into uh but continue working into the spaces okay row one is the row after our our chain row and it is going to be a set up row and then we have our row two and three which is going to be our repeats okay so for now we start with the chain one single crochet into the space again chain one and then skip over to the next chain space and we're going to work the row the same way that we did row two with our single crochets and chains but it's just the way that we set up the beginning of the row and end of the row that's going to be slightly different in row two and three okay so basically that's it for our pattern i will come back here in just a moment uh once we've created our square ideally i make most of my dish class about square so what i generally do is towards the end of my uh pattern i'll put this aside for a second so what happens is the end of the pattern to find out whether or not i'm pretty like i'm pretty close to square i'll fold my cloth over um and see um you know how close to square i am and that's pretty darn close if you ask me um so you know basically that's what i'm looking for as far as dish cloth so from this point we're going to finish off our cloth now if you were changing colors like i did in this example one with the three sections of dark gray what i did is i added the border so you can't see me carrying up the uh the colors along the side of the of the cloth so it really does kind of give it that you know illusion but it also saves me from having too many ends to weave in okay so this one of course completely reversible such a lovely design and you can really see how the colors change in this pretty moss stitch all right so in order to create our moss stitch we're going to actually do a little bit of a different foundation row here to kind of give us that uh foundation that we're looking for in that cloth so what we're going to do is we're going to start with two chains on our hook so we started with a slip knot two chains uh just for your reference we're using our four and a half millimeter crochet hook here and our bernat handicrafter um cotton yarn and this color is actually called psychedelic so in the previous section i showed you using the anchors away color uh but i decided after i shot that video to uh change the way that i did my foundation rope or now we're going to include a little bit different way to do that foundation road in order to get us our setup row we're going to do it a little bit differently all right so i wanted to show an alternate way to do the chain row so we're starting with chain three basically what we're doing here is going to be our chain for our the bottom of our single crochet another chain for the single crochet and then a chain for the chain that because our pattern is single crochet chain one so we're starting with three chains now in order to create our foundation row we're going to create another chain but we're going to actually do it from the bottom of the stitches so in this case we're going to go back to the very first chain insert our hook chain one okay and then now we're going to do a foundation single crochet so if you've seen the video that i talked about the foundation single crochet it was in one of the granny square videos i will link that in the description below as well but to do a foundation single crochet we're going to do yet another chain one here in the bottom of the stitch and then we're going to do a single crochet from that chain so now we're going to loop up again now we have two on our hook still and then we're going to finish off with our single crochet so basically what we've done is we've created a chain between our stitches then a chain as the foundation for our single crochet then we finished our single crochet and we also created the chain at the top of the stitch as well okay so basically we're making a little bit of a circle here which is basically doing the chain row and the single crochet uh chain one row all at once okay so this gives us a little bit better way to judge the size of our cloth so now we're going to chain one for the top of the single crochet and then we're going to insert our hook back down into the what is the chain stitch and draw up our second chain and then we're going to draw up one more so we're going to chain two at the bottom one at the top and then we're going to finish off as our single crochet all right so now we chain one for the top of the stitch and then we're going to come back down into the bottom of the stitch [Music] one second all right so just going back all right so we chain one at the top of our stitch for the end of our single crochet chain and now we're going to chain two at the bottom so one and two and now we're going to do a third so that's giving us the chain between the stitches the chain for the bottom of the single crochet and then now we can finish off our single crochet okay so this one is a little bit more confusing than just a straight single crochet foundation row but give this a try it actually works out really well once you actually get into the body of the cloth um okay so once again we're gonna single crochet at the top of the stitch where we just finished off our single crochet and now we're gonna come back down and insert our hook into the bottom of the stitch which is a little bit hard to see but it is back here so there's our single crochet right here okay so here's our single crochet so we want to actually put this into the base of it which is this stitch here so we're going to insert our hook into this one yarn over draw up one two so that's our chain stitch between our stitches and then now we're going to make our foundation single crochet so chain one again and then finish off our single crochet all right so now this time this kind of like greenish turning one here is our our foundation chain and then this part is our single crochet okay so chain one for the top of the stitch and then we're gonna come back down into this spot here all right so this one that's starting to turn green this is our chain of the stitch so we're going to insert our hook here yarn over now we're going to do a chain twice there's one and two and then draw through both loops on the hook to give us our single crochet all right so chain one for the top of the stitch [Music] and then down here into the screen is our the base of our single crochet so we can see our single crochets here okay so we're going to come back into the base of it which is this spot here insert our hook okay so we have one chain two chain that's our chain for the space between the stitches and then we have chain for the base of the single crochet and then finish off our single crochet all right all right so again chain one at the top of the stitch then we're going to come back okay so here's our single crochet stitch now we're going to come back into the base of it which is this this part here we're going to insert our hook all right we're going to chain one two so that's just our chain between the stitches this will be the base of our single crochet and then we draw up to finish off the single crochet all right so what's happening here is we're creating our foundation row of chains here at the bottom and our single crochet chain one that gives us the base of our moss stitch okay so let's do this a few more times because we're going to make this into a dish cloth and i'll be right back and we'll start our second row all right so we finished our row here with our chain one at the end of the row now what we're going to do is we're going to actually turn our row around and now we're going to work our single crochets into the chain spaces from the row below okay all right so now we have our chain one here so now we're going to work into the chain space for the row [Music] previous so there's our single crochet and then chain one and then we're gonna skip over to the next one so the next chain one space and then single crochet there and chain one so that's our pattern as we work back along so how do we know we're finished our cloth um it's basically going to be square okay um so give it that fold um corner to corner diagonally and when everything basically matches up um you're going to want the folded corner to be basically one right on top of the other and make everything nice and square and we're just out a little bit so i could block this and it would actually probably turn out perfect but i'm not overly concerned about it at this point okay so we're looking for basically it to be um being able to be folded diagonally in half and we lose the one on the bottom from the one on the top okay if you make it or if you like your cloth to be a little bit more rectangular that's fine too um you might opt to stop crocheting a little bit shorter to make it that nice diagonal or that nice rectangle that you like or crochet it a little bit longer it's completely up to you okay um so now that you know how to do the moss stitch um with that just that simple you know setup row as i said it's it's a two row a two stitch repeat so you can choose how many stitches you want to put on and then add one at the end of the row to go ahead and um for our turning single crochet okay so i'll include the pattern below as well thank you for joining us with

we're going to begin by\nchaining five one two three four five take your needle out of the loop with a\nslipknot already on the color B or red first we're going to insert the hook in\nthe next stitch pick up that loop bring it through and then chain 5 1 2 3 4 5\nremove your hook so I like to keep color a or white on the right and color B red\non the left trying not to get them to tangled up okay so enter your hook back\ninto the white color a working in front of your red chain you're going to go\ninto the next stitch and slip stitch that loop now one loop is made I'm going to\nchain 5 2 3 4 5 take out your hook pick up the red or\ncolor b working in front of that white chain we're going to go into the next\nstitch after that and slip stitch another loop made one in white one in\nred we're going to chain 5 1 2 3 4 5 now what I like to do is kind of turn it\naround and separate the yarn again and insert your hook in the white go into\nthe next going in front of the red again insert your hook in the next stitch slip\nstitch chain 5 2 3 4 5 - take out your hook pick up the red going in front of the\nwhite into the next stitch slip stitch chain 5 1 2 3 4 5 take out your hook\nand repeat this same sequence all the way around until you get to these last\ntwo stitches this last one here and the one before that and I'll meet you there\nnow that you've worked all the way around the coaster the last two stitches\nI'll show you here pick up the red just same concept go in front go in this\nsecond to last stitch slip stitch chain 5 1 2 3 4 5 drop the hook or drop the\nloop pick up the next loop color a now you're going to work in that very last\nstitch next to the beginning white chain which seems a little weird ok and then\nslip stitch cut your yarn leave a little tail pull that through okay now pick up\nthe red the last loop that you're going to make now you're wondering where am I\ngoing to put this stitch and what you do is you go over the top and through the\nback or through the base stitch of the first red loop ok let me show you that\nagain so you go over the top go through the base of the first red loop slip\nstitch it there and I like to do one more change and\nsecure it cut your thread pull that through okay and now put your hook through the\nback of that first white loop and just pull that tail through to the other side\nand that will form your peppermint coaster edging so now you can't really\ntell where the beginning or the end is at and both sides look the same so just\nweave in your ends and that's all there is to it I hope you've

This is a really easy blanket using Bernat Blanket yarn. Welcome back to The Crochet Crowd as well as yarnspirations.com. I'm your host Mikey. In today's pattern what we're going to do is work on the Greyscale Blanket just like you see here and gray is very much in trend just like you see the small example today. In today's tutorial we're gonna talk about being able to make this. I'm gonna show you how to do it. Also gonna talk about the multiples in order to change the size of you wish. Just know that if you change the size you will change the ball counts just like you see here. If you'd like to do this large example it's 52 inches by 65 inches long. In order to do this that you'll need three balls of the 300 grams these are the big balls just like you see here and you'll need three balls of the dark gray and you also need three balls of the vintage white and then two balls which is this one here of the pale gray. Of course you can change out your colors to match your home decor and let's get started on working on this pattern and let's talk a little bit about the work involved. So let's review the diagram key that is here. This is a crochet diagram and we can see that there is an up-and-down motion both sides finish in the up formation and if you look at it carefully you see that there's actually three chevrons. So 1, 2 and 3. To make this blanket in any size that you wish all you just need to do is chain in sets of 14. So there's 14 stitches in a chevron, so 1, 2 and 3 and so that's what you can see here and at the very end of your chain you're gonna add three and that gives you the multiples that you need in order to make this successful for you. So today's sample I'm gonna do a smaller version just to show you how to do the up-and-down motion and I'm gonna show you how to change color and in today's pattern you'll need a size 'N' or 10 mm crochet hook and you also need Bernat Blanket yarn. You can substitute your hook size and your yarn if you like, love this pattern so much in order to change it. You should know though if you change any kind of chain counts in this you will need a different quantity of yarn and I don't know what that answer is. So without further ado let's get started and working on this particular project. I'd like to talk about the chain before I actually physically do and you'll notice here this is a smaller example that I'm about to do. And what we have in this particular example here is that it's in multiples of 14 but you should know because of the up-and-down motion when you go to chain with this yarn you're going to notice that the chain is gonna be really long. But because you're doing the up-and-down motion this string will change. So for example say that you had a string and it's like this length. Okay, and you're thinking okay that's really long, but just think about the string bending down like this and all of a sudden it's a shorter distance. So when you're considering how long this afghan or why this afghan should be you should consider that the length of the chain isn't necessarily what the outcome of the afghan is gonna be. So you have to consider that it's gonna have to bend down just like so. So it's a kind of a neat idea and what I have here let's take a measurement and I'll show you what the thickness of one chevron will be if you're deciding that. So off-camera I did a measurement and it is six inches from one side of the chevron to the other. Just these are six inches so fourteen stitches equals about six inches. So that gives you an indication and see how it's going down. So when you go to chain that 14, it's gonna be probably out appearing to be a lot wider like that where my thumb is here and that's because it is going down. In today's tutorial I'm going to get you started here and this is a very easy pattern once we get on to row number two. All the other rows are exactly identical. I'm gonna show you how to change color as well to make this particular project. So let's get started on that next. So let's begin with a slipknot. So if you'd like to make the exact pattern you can chain 115 if you wish and if you would like to alternate the size to make it a different size then you're gonna do in multiples of 14, which I'm gonna do because that's just, just makes a lot of sense. So let me, I go in, I'm going to chain 14. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10 ,11, 12, 13 and 14. So after you get 14, you can make a decision whether it's long enough or not. Remember has to come down so it's not gonna be this wide. It's going to be more like this. And so then you can do as multiple and as many multiples those 14, so I would do another set of 14. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 11 12, 13 and 14. Once you're satisfied with the whole length of your chain at the very end of your chain if you're doing it this way you're gonna have an additional three. So 1, 2 and 3. Let's pull up the crochet diagram I wanna show you something next. So I wanna show you the diagram here and what we're going to do is that the ends are always gonna be the same. So they're always gonna be up coming down and then back up and down, up and down and ending in the up just like it is on the other side. So this is one of those projects where it doesn't matter which row you're starting on too because the both sides are in the up position it makes it a lot easier. So for example say you had it like this and the other side was finishing in the down it'd make it harder to remember. So when we're in the up position we're going to be adding more stitches. So you can see that the first one here has three double crochets in the first one. That chaining of three counts as a double crochet and in the bottom on this side of the chevron there's three that come in to one at the top and then the other side there's three that come in to one at the top. So as you're on the top you're adding extra stitches and on the bottom you're subtracting stitches which keeps this going up and down. So the next up on the middle one here on this side of it going up has three and then three additional stitches added to the top and then the other one is three additional on that side and then you come down in it subtract stitches. So that's what's happening on any kind of chevron kind of idea like this is that usually at the top they're adding extra stitches because in the bottom side they're subtracting and that's what keeps it going in the up and down fashion. You're also gonna notice that this looks really jagged when you're going to do this but as you saw my example today because of the, the thickness of the yarn the waves are more lazy or looking and it actually looks pretty cool. So let's get started on that next. So regardless if you started with a 110 or 15 chains or you've done it in multiples of 14 this same, it's gonna be the same. So coming fourth chain from the hook. So 1, 2, 3 and 4, this is where you wanna start. So just turn it around and get the back hump of that fourth one and what you want to do is do a double crochet into that one. So the chains that you just skipped over counts as a double crochet, this is a double crochet and you're gonna add another one to that same stitch. So that is your top three of the double crochets and now we're gonna move down. So the nice thing about this particular pattern is that in between the tops and the bottoms there's three double crochets that stand alone. That's what makes it really easy. So the next three stitches will be one double crochet each. So continuing on the back hump of the chains just continue to do one double crochet in each of the next three. So this is the second and third. So now that we're got that so we got the top one here, it's got three in this one, these three are standing by itself, now we're gonna be in the down position as we then start coming up at the bottom. So the next three stitches are gonna be together. So how we do that is that we wrap the yarn first and going into the next chain go and insert in, yarn over pull through and then pull through two and then we do the next one. So yarn over going into the next chain push through and yarn over pull through and then pull through two. So you're gonna collect until there's four of these loops on the hook. So move to the next chain in so yarn over into the next chain pull through and then pull through two. So now you have four loops on the hook. So these three now just became one. The first loop is the starting string here. So don't worry about that. So yarn over and pull through all of the four loops. So those three just became into one just like it shows in the pattern. So this is one side. So this is expanding at the top for three, going down with three individuals by itself and then the bottom three are together. We're now gonna move up the other side of the chevron. So the next three are gonna be together. So just going in pull through, pull through two and hold. Okay, next one. Okay, so we wanna collect so that there's four loops on the hook. So we just have to collect them. It's called three uh, dc three together. So now that you have your four loops, you can see that these three are here, this is the starting one so you don't worry about that. Yarn over pull through all the four loops and now you're ready to go in the up formation of the other side of the chevron. So the next three stitches are going to be one double crochet each. So 1 and 2 and 3. So we're now heading to the up to the other side now and now we're heading and about to go over the top. Okay, so you see that it's not as high as the other one because we're not done. So the next stitch is gonna have three double crochets into the same stitch and this allows it to then start to turn over in order to create the upper part of the chevron. So there's three in this one. So that's one side of the chevron done if you look at it from this point of view. So there's one chevron done and now we're ready to move on to the next chevron which is gonna start at the very top. So the next one is gonna be three double crochets into that one. So now we're gonna just it's kind of like the halfway point of a chevron. So one side of it has three in the same and the other side has three in the same. Like that, so you can kinda see it's now starting to turnover and go down. So the next three are going to be one double crochet each. Okay, so this is the spaces in between the top section and the bottom section. There's just always three double crochets that sit by themselves when you do that. Okay, up and down, so now we're gonna be on the bottom. So the next three are gonna be grouped together. So we're gonna put them together. So we're just insert into the next one and their double crochet three together and I've already shown you more slowly how to do that. So let's put these together and you're gonna go all the way across the line doing this exact same formation. Just going up and down. Once you have four loops on the hook yarn over pull through all four and now that is one half of the chevron going down and now we're gonna do the other half. Okay, so this is leading to going in the up motion on the other side. So the next three are together. Okay, this one's a little tricky to get into. Just like so, so these three are together. So we're just gonna pull through all four loops, and now we're gonna work our way up. So the next three are by themselves, so a double crochet up by itself. So 1, and 2 and 3. Leaving us with just one stitch left over which is here, and now on that one here, it's the edge so in the edge, it's always gonna be the same ending with three double crochets right in the very end. Okay, so if your chain was much longer obviously you'll be going up and down until you get to the very end. But this is what it looks like. Let me just pull this out. So if I flatten things out, you'll see that it goes up and down. So the side is ending in the up it goes up and down, up and down and the other side ends in the up as well. So I'm gonna keep the yarn on and I'm gonna turn the work and let's go for row number two. In row number two and all other rows for this particular afghan it's always the same. So we're always gonna start off by chaining three which counts as a double crochet and in the exact same stitch right underneath it we're gonna put two more double crochets there. So that gives you your count of three double crochets. So now we're gonna move down the line so the next three are going to be one double crochet into each. So 1, and we got number 2, so this by itself and 3. So now we're in the bottom now and the next three have to come together. So what I want you to look at here is that you'll see that there's gonna be two double crochets sitting by itself and then the one is the group of the first three. So the in the bottom there's two groups of three just like you see. So in this one here the next three are together which will be the, the first two double crochets and then this group of three. So if you can remember that it's a very easy thing. So let's put the next three together. So just like we had shown you before you start gathering your stitches. So the last one is that first group of three. So now you've got four loops on your hook pull through all of them. And now let's do the other side. So next three are together. So just start gathering. So the next three the first one is the group of three here and then the the next two double crochets that are by itself. I tell you that because it makes a big difference when you're working on these kind of projects what you can physically look at and it makes it a lot easier. Once you have your four loops on the hook just pull through all four loops, and now we're ready to go in the up formation. So the next three are by themselves. So 1, 2, and 3. So I wanna give you another visual key. So in the three there in the top there's three that are in the same stitch. You can see it's orientated right there and on the other side of that there's three in this one. So when I went up there, here there was three by themselves. The last one here is where the next three goes into. Okay. Do you see that clue? So there's gonna be three double crochets in the top of that one. So that allows it to start turning over. That's one side of the chevron you can clearly see it here and on the other side of the chevron you have your group of three just like you so, you see and the first one is gonna have three double crochets in it. So 1 and that allows it to completely turn over. So the next three are gonna be by themselves. So 1, 2 and 3. So we're back at the bottom just like we were on the other side, so let's review that again. So you have three that are on the bottom. The last one is the group of three which means that I'm in the right position. So we're just gonna gather the first three it's gonna be three together double crochet. So you got four loops on your hook and pull through all of them and now, let's go back up the other side. So we have to put the next three together. The first one is a group of three that's here in the bottom. So we do it so there's four loops on the hook and now we go up the other side. So it's gonna be three double crochets standing by itself and if your stitch counts are right you're gonna go up and down up and down all the way until you hit the very end and here is my three that are sitting by themselves just like you see. The last stitch is the turning chain. And in the last stitch we're gonna put in three double crochets. So it's a very easy pattern to remember if as long as you can look for the key elements of when to put three into the same one and when to make three into one just like you see here. So what I want to do is that I wanna show you how I change color. So I'm just going to trim off my yarn about eight inches and I'm going to take this yarn and I'm gonna pull it through the loop and lock it. So it's gonna be locked in and what I want to do then is just take my yarn and just weave it in a few of these stitches and then the next time I'm coming across with my next color it's gonna be underneath and trapped into position. So what I'm gonna do then is just turn my work and I'm gonna start here but I'm gonna turn my work and I want to grab my next color and I'll show you how to do the next color. So I'm gonna do the next color which is gonna be a darker gray. So you can do the color scheme as per the pattern. It's up to you and what you want to do. There is a certain order in order to make it exactly like that. So in the top one here the first one. Okay, there's three. It's gonna go into the top one, you're going to join it with a slip stitch. So just let this yarn going from the yarn ball pull through to lock it. Keep this straggler down on top so you can trap it in a position and I want you to chain up three which counts as a double crochet. So because you're in the up formation, this one here needs two more double crochets. Okay, so this is the top of the chevron and so now that you have your three in the first one the next three are by themselves they're just double crochets making sure the straggler stays down on top of the line so it gets stuck underneath the stitches. So that was one, this is 2 and 3. So now that we're at the bottom again, so what we want to do is that the next three are going to be together. So here's the group of three that we talked about. Here's the two individuals that sit by themselves. So the next three are gonna be together. So again leaving the stragglers down on top of the line, it gets stuck underneath the stitches. You barely can see it. So these three are going to become together. Yarn over and pulling it through once you have all four loops on their hook and then go up the other side. So the next three are together, 1, 2 so, I'm collecting it so I got four loops on the hook and pulling it through all four loops. So we're gonna come up the other side and we're going to put three individuals by themselves. So 1, 2 and 3. So at the very top you have your groups of three just like we showed before. So this this one here in the group of three, it's the last one available to you it's gonna be three double crochets like we had before so you can turn the corner. So this is one side of the chevron done. You see that and now let's move to the other side. So then the other side is gonna have three double crochets. So 1, 2 and 3 and now we're gonna move down. So the next three are by themselves. So it's really quite an easy pattern to work with. Everything is in groups three and you can have a really neat look with this it'll grow really quickly in this particular afghan because of the size of the yarn. So the next we are together so they're in the bottom. So we're bringing them together so we can turn that corner at the bottom. Once you get your four loops on there just put them together and then go up the other side. So the first three are together like so, bring it together the next three are by themselves so 1, 2 and 3 and then the final stitch if you've done it right, you're g gonna go up and down all the way across just like you've done here and the final stitch there will be three double crochets in the turning chain. So this is how you do the Greyscale Blanket. It's just a really easy pattern to worry about. It's well, if you want to worry about it at all. It's really quite easy to do and it's a lot of fun to do and you'll see your afghan grow in no time. So on behalf of The Crochet Crowd as well as Yarnspirations. Thank you so much for joining me and until next time we'll see ya. Bye, bye \ud83d\udc4b.", "wCUI4v_imAA": "what's going on YouTube just one shot back another update 34 days tomorrow is five weeks so I just got this in the mail today my friends purchase this for me for Christmas instil medical marijuana tin for daily use only open it up rolling joints instructions that's good for me because I am terrible at rolling I usually have to use one of those machines little hand rollers for small treasures and keepsakes and curiosities so thanks man I will be getting your present out soon apparently there's something else too but taking that up tomorrow but yeah nice little box gonna be great when these [ __ ] are harvested all that in here so this will be getting be put to good use all right on with the plants it'sit's night let me shut these fans off tonight you're going to get a special treat there's going to be a some night shots of the nugs tonight spend about five minutes before the tent lights came on and just took some video of the night buds and they look fabulous so peyote purple it's covered in frost I'm gonna pull them out just again I'm not gonna put them under cfl because you're gonna see why I got a better way to view the quality of them maybe i'll i'll change the cfl we'll see but to give the overall look that's push number three back there just chunking up like crazy the smell and the terpenes coming off these plants right now are just it's just insane if I have the tent open more than five minutes my whole place starts smelling so honestly I can't recommend the fresh carbon filters I'm just not happy with it it barely lasted one grow so I'm switching back to can filters next grow I'll switch to canned light I guess and see how that is but I'm just not happy with these fresh filters it's just not really working at all so I might have to be replace it soon but i don't think i will in the next couple weeks but so but that said they want to pull these ladies out i will take a good look at them all right right back alright guys so here's push number five so hopefully this this angle will actually get you a better shot of the resin this wants the focus there's nice big buds not too heavy on the nods right now but the frost and the resin is pretty incredible just beautiful stacking I mean it's just frost throughout nice and white so that's question number five there's one of the main clothes stop shaking so all right let me get uh I'm only gonna show for you tonight I don't want to show them off but uh just like cuz I only have a few things to talk about but all right let me grab some more here she is crushed number three all her resinous glory fat nose just one of the penthouse suites it's a little tough to see really i mean how big they are but next three weeks these things are gonna swell up so much focus it smells so good guys nuts so this is definitely the more that's love a cush side so yeah all right that's qysh number three and i'm going to show the peyote and then i'm going to have one last plan to talk about and then i'm going to show the nighttime shots of the buds so be right back guys here's the peyote sugar-coated just see how white it is from all the trikes I mean it's just coated however this is week five tomorrow thirty-five day flower 34 days right now all this tip burn right here this is pH burn because I figured out too late unfortunately that my my ph pen that i thought was on accurate was actually point one off for I think two waterings that was a rookie mistake always check your meters always check your your things are clean your supplies everything that's a rookie mistake and my plants paid for it the pH tips um so may I have it dialed in now but you know once once that's done it's done can't do anything about it it's not going to affect the plant much I mean it might dump it a little bit but I don't care at this point and you sing sir juicy so I want to thank everyone also actually know what I'll do that then but this is peyote just another gorgeous plant covered in frost I can't wait to see how she finishes not gonna be a big yield air like I always say but it makes them sick God half this video is going to be out of focus i have a feeling come on you got to be [ __ ] me cover alright so that's peyote so I'm going to end it on my last plant I don't want to talk about and then do some couple mentions and that'll be it so be right back alright guys so this is course number one this plant went from the ugly girl band camp to the prom queen I think she heard me talking about cush number three and how much I love her and she got jealous and all of a sudden she [ __ ] frost it up like you would not believe she's like no no no you are gonna pay attention to me Jesus Christ come on this is ridiculous [ __ ] focusing on my nice shorts and Lego in the background but I don't know what pissed her off or made her so jealous but man this beauty this is definitely the space queen phenol coming through this thing is just stacked with resin this is push number one I'm really sorry about the focus issues tonight trying a new lighting setup hopefully you just tell from a distance help frosty she is I couldn't believe it you know she didn't really move positions much in the 10 but she just like she got jealous I guess I wanted to be on camera she want to be the star so here you are a little lady push number one disick gorgeous plant guys very nice buds so I'm super happy very happy right now with these with these plant progress I just like the resin that's underneath it's getting under the leaves so can't wait super big heads too so she said there's no way you're gonna be able to see him probably didn't got a shame there the trikes just popping off the leaves right there that's all the heads of the trichomes so all right I think I'm gonna put them back in their home and they don't need watering tonight little probably watering tomorrow but follow up some thoughts and we'll be out we're back youtube I did to plant shuffle put the kod back in the corner there push number three on the side and put that resin fitch course number one right in the middle here so she's gonna get nice and covered again so I moved her over just get three out of the way that's prom I did pretty because i didn't know these genetics really i did kind of a pretty poor job to folding them and Lolly popping them early so as you can see and there's definitely a lot of websites but down below I could have cleaned it out a lot more I mean I could go in there now but I just don't want to risk anything everything's gonna go everything's going well so far so I don't want to really disturb the plants and stress him anymore but you know I am having space issues I could cage them up but again I'm not going through this link flower so I just want to stress this is why you want to you know get in there and lollipop morn and get rid of all this [ __ ] in here because right now I mean they are growing but you know it's just it's gonna be a pain that has to trim all this [ __ ] so look on youtube for some lollipop and videos I might do some bro 420 God has some but yeah obviously I can't do it just grow but next girl I will but that brings me to the next point um you know the channel has basically become just me doing grow updates and grow videos which is all good but I kind of want to maybe teach more things so you know we are winding down so I'm going to get into quote season 3 at growing by grow for 20 guys little numbering it'll be season three coming up soon so you know I want to I want to do some more for the YouTube community what do you guys want to see out of my videos obviously the budding videos will still happen and stuff but you know during the veg cycle I'd like to do some more interesting things for you guys and there's so much stuff already done on YouTube it's hard to kind of be new but I want to bring some new excitement to the channel maybe do some partnerships do some duo videos with some people once I start meeting them and getting an industry more but yeah so I think that's gonna be it I do want to thank everyone commented about the pods I was worried about just wasn't used to these genetics and these like Alex's and the pods or just swelling up and covered with resin don't even know if like you know I they're so stack now I can't can't get in there anymore but so I guess that's all I had for this video you shout out to everyone you know the people always reply hi life and a god you know you guys are always there replying appreciate it shout out all the neat people you know I'm getting subscribers by the day so you know make yourself know and I reply to everyone so if you want to you know interact with me and asked questions about LEDs asked questions about my nutrients I run you know anything just comment reply and i'll make sure to answer everyone take care of all the trolls or whoever come out but you guys are great so far I love in the support and I'm going to keep bringing you high quality vids maybe some more nighttime shots and hopefully you guys enjoyed that portion of the video please let me know if you like that so because I will do more if you like them obviously so with that I think the plants need a little break from me showing them off horn themselves out for the camera so I'm going to let them soak in their raised and do their thing and I will probably be back later in the week guys so for tonight peace", "dmvQfjdBPwk": "hey everyone and welcome to the grow hemp series today I'll be showing you my first outdoor grow within automatic ruderalis plant from seed to harvest while also going over how to set up your first outdoor grow so let's start first with the supplies because growing outdoors has so many variables I'll be covering the essentials separately from the optional equipment so you can get a better idea of what you'll need for your situation to start with everyone will need a seed and grow supplies which is basically a pot soil and fertilizer from there you'll have the utility cost of just water which is practically free but assuming you'll need a pH balance it will say that's another 10 dollars and that's it for the essentials for any other equipment needed it really depends on your environment well list the comment items here along with why they could be needed then go over the extra items that I needed for my first grow so although growing outdoors means that there is potentially almost no setup costs the downside is that you can't choose what your outdoor environment is like this means that anything that is not optimal for growing you're gonna have to get equipment to change it or just accept that the plant will not grow as well because of it if at all the good thing is that we can survive in a wide range of harsh environments but for better control common outdoor equipment includes a greenhouse which can enclose the grow to help regulate the environment humidifiers and dehumidifiers to help control the humidity Shade fans heaters and air cooling options to help control the temperature organic pest control solutions and pesticides to deal with plant destroying bugs and then additional lighting to increase the daylight hours artificially for my first grow setup I started with the greenhouse not really to regulate the environment but because I wanted to film the plant to keep a video log of my grow process and having an enclosed was the easiest way to do so also because of the greenhouse there would be no wind going through the grow space so I had to get a fan to simulate air movement which makes the Kempe dock stronger and helps prevent certain bugs and mildew from attacking the plant the final thing I got was pesticides near the end of the grow which I'll explain in more details why during the time lapse total that comes out to be three hundred and sixty dollars although most of that is because of the greenhouse which wasn't necessary for the grow so first things first I needed two things to start growing my first plant a seed and a home for the seed for the seed I went with an automatic variety this is because I was starting this grow at the beginning of the year with about twelve hours of sunlight a day so a normal seed wouldn't have worked unless I wanted to install lights in the greenhouse which I didn't want to do for my first grow now for the grow medium I just went with regular potting soil from local big-box store and then mixed it with a third of perlite I set it all in a five-gallon fabric pot put it in the middle of greenhouse and and that's it for the greenhouse I went with something solid as opposed to just a plastic film because I wanted to be able to hold the camera on the roof and in the future possibly a grow light now while I don't think the plants would have grown any differently outside of the greenhouse because the weather was very good throughout the entire grow I do think that if you have the budget for one it's worth investing in even just the basic plastic one is better than nothing because they give you a bit of control over an otherwise uncontrollable environment now all that was left to do was to water the plant every couple days with tap water when the swell fell dry down - the first inch of the soil after the third week when the plant changed from a seedling to the vegetative stage I started to add agro fertilizer to the water which contained equal parts phosphorus and potassium and slightly more nitrogen generally all grow fertilizers will already have the correct mix of these main nutrients so you just need to mix it in with your water when feeding the plant I started with 50% of the recommended dosage every other feeding and after week 5 I kept the 50% dosage but added every time I watered the plants also by week 3 when the plant was stable I added a small fan to blow on the plant this isn't necessary if you're not using a greenhouse since the greenhouse was preventing the breeze from hitting the plant so I needed to recreate it and viola 8th week when the plant was growing too tall I switched to an oscillating fan now as we watched a plant slowly go through his vegetative stage I'll go through my growth supplies and why I chose them I went with soil because it's a simplest grow medium to work with and when buying soil there are three types to choose from a normal soil with no fertilizer included which is what I'm using a soil with synthetic fertilizers added and composted soil or swell that has organic fertilizers and microorganisms included composted soil is not common and generally found only at nurseries and gardening stores but if you have access to them or can make your own they're the easiest to grow with because they have the microorganisms in the compost they're able produce all the nutrients a plant needs which means that all you need to feed the plant is water now slow as synthetic fertilizers are the ones you want to avoid these are the ones that always say something along the lines of two months three months six months of feet included the reason for this is because synthetic fertilizers will always absorb into the roots and typically contain a large amount of 9 jujin which is great for the plant when it's growing but could be toxic to the plant when she starts to flower so to be safe stick with the composted soil or soils without anything added to it and if you have to use as well with synthetic fertilizers built in when the plant starts to flower be sure to flush it down with water to try and wash away the excess nutrients I also included perlite with the soil which is a lightweight rock like material as well as utilize a fabric pot versus clay or plastic because of both help with getting air to live roots and keeping the soil from getting too soggy this is huge for new growers like me because there are a ton of issues that can come from over watering from an increase in bugs mold root rot to the plants straight up dying from the lack of oxygen weed is very resilient to dry conditions and can bounce back easily from under watering so the perlite and fabric pot were used as a buffer for the other extreme of over watering and that's about it until the plant started to flower I checked out a plant every other day or so watered when needed and once a plant started to flower I change the nutrients from a grow fertilizer to a bloom fertilizer the main difference in the two fertilizers is that the nitrogen levels went down and the potassium levels went up now the trichomes has started to appear cloudy at this point I also noticed that some of the family started showing tiny white marks I cut off on the fan leaves and saw that this was caused by a spider mite now this being my first grow I wasn't scared of most pests but spider mites were the one I feared based on the stories I've read so I got in organic pest control to mist over the plants every other day and decided to harvest a little bit earlier than planned with him depending on how you're going to process the plan you can choose to harvest it in multiple ways here I'll be doing the most traditional harvesting method of drying and curing the buds and to start this off I'll be trimming off all the large van leaves before cutting down each individual stem [Music] now I'm just giving the stems a light trim to remove any excess leaves from the buds and unless you're planning on smoking the hemp which is one of the ways to intake the CBD content in the buds the step isn't necessary as all the other forms of extracting the CBD from the buds will want the whole buds in town now I'm just hanging up to individual stems to dry for a weekend [Music] and then finally facing them in glass mason jars for long-term storage and to ensure that the buds have dried evenly I'm using a hygrometer in the jar to check that the buds are under 62 percent relative humidity and that's it for more weekly videos guides and lists of where to get all the supplies that I've used check out hemp in a pot calm you [Music]", "1vmfowwFiYs": "[Music] blow pops brush broom yeah mmm les

ok it's straight up mommy looks like you're really clumsy today sis ok I really need to go to bed alright getting to get inside the bed girls so I can read you okay beeping actually Elsa why don't you read this story to the girls you only read it what they were little they I don't think they remember it here you know oh not a bad idea onna I'm gonna sleep with my new puppy that I got for my birthday and I'm gonna sleep with my cute pink bunny he once upon a time there was a dog that lived in a city it was a little Golden Retriever puppy and its name was Charlie and one day it went outside to have some fun and it hurts a little bird tweeting on the floor that's what it sounded like oh so cute yes in the dog look looked at it and he said whoa what's what happened to this bird why is it crying and when he looked closer at its wing and saw that it had a scratch in the puppy felt bad for the bird but guess what the puppy did it what what guess what happened he took the bird gently gently from her head and brought her all the way to his house so he could take care of them so he got some food for the bird he put some water for it and he even saw where his owner keeps the bandages so he got one and put it on to the bird's wing he's so nice yes and when the owner came home he said that he couldn't keep the bird and then the bird in the dog became best friend I'm such a good story good stories yeah mommy I think that's my favorite story now hey wait I think I remember this story when I was smaller so do you like it yeah okay time to go to bed good night kids good night mommy good night we will even turn off the lights see you tomorrow at school visit our channel and subscribe for more videos [Music]", "j511VqFvlUk": "hey you i'm back again today with a quick design with diani segment it will call it uh it's just a quick necklace using crobo african beads and some stabilized turquoise i really like the earthy and kind of tribal look of these beads i do wish i had a ton more of african or tribal or even afghani or indonesian beads oh my goodness i would just love to buy a whole bunch of vintage or trade beads uh that would be so much fun so today i'm not going to do a stretch bracelet i am going to go ahead and start working on some wire let's see how long i'm going to want this and again too much is always better than not enough so i'm cutting off you know i you know i don't know how much i'm cutting off so i'm gonna measure it um let's see it's 24 okay so it's like 36 inches so i got about 36 inches about three feet of some beading wire but i do have a focal um i do want to try to use this bead as a focal and so let's see let's get some 20 gauge pair of wire or is basically non-targe craft wire and i'm going to use my baling wire pliers on the wire i'm gonna just roll it over pull it over [Music] hold that down do a quick wider wrap okay and we'll just trim off the tail okay so i'm basically making kind of like an eye pin but like a dangle pin because it's a closed loop so it cut off about that's an eight inch piece of wire i hope this fits in there please fit in there if it doesn't fit i'm gonna be sad okay all right so it fit through one end all right and so i'm gonna use some brass head pins and jump rings to attach the dangles now these are all bent that's the fun part of getting head pins is just how bent and crazy they can be all right um [Music] i'm gonna take some of this uh purple flower opal from dakota stones there we go just get a little bit of one of these on here and some chexy beads oh let's actually do this the other way now maybe okay so here's a dangle turn to the side i'm going to use my round nose pliers i cut it wrong because i can't see what i'm doing all right we'll try this one more time is it two times the charm it's really fun to have my purple flower opal to go flying across the room because it's not cheap so i don't know where it's at um i heard it hit the wall i don't know all right so again just wrap it over around okay i'm gonna try to use my head to okay plug it on there and close that up so it's got one dangle um [Applause] this is kind of interesting i don't know how i could use this i wonder if i could just do a jump ring uh let's see got my euro punch one point 25 millimeter punch let's see if this works i don't know i don't know if this will work on here cool it worked but it's hard to get off oh it left a little kind of a divot on there um so i got my bag of jump rings no that's a split ring here i'll just use this jump ring right here i hope that's not the right way oh my gosh i'm trying to do too many things at once with my hands okay so we gotta close this oh my gosh i'm gonna close this off but we gotta make sure it's sitting on there right nope i didn't get it on there right of course i have to try again so let's try again we're gonna flip it around the other way all right i feel like i'm being too adventurous for this video and this dress sweats are getting me okay okay i gotta correct the dangle but that's okay all right so i'm gonna use my bailing plier i'm going to use the smaller i'm going to just twerk it around and let's do a messy wrap okay just a little messy wrap in there and trim off the tail make sure your eyes are covered and you don't get that metal in your eye okay i'm gonna put these little seed beads back that they belong okay here we go all right so we've got this dangle that needs to be corrected have that hanging in front of the metal piece not on the side of it this is so hard to do when you can't really see what you're doing it's like really interesting you really have to okay so there's the dangle the bead on it okay so i've got these and these okay um so i'll string a dangle there's a cat going crazy behind me she's funny she's always making noise when i do videos it's like i swear they get jealous like the cats really want your attention i don't know if you can hear all that cat noise right now but oh my gosh she's throwing a fit okay so i'm gonna string on a couple three string on three what no i'll just string on two no string on yeah string on two one on each side and then [Music] a string on some red wood beads and that's my cat going bananas in the house and let's bring on some crowba beads okay then string on some turquoise and i'm gonna do a bread a red and then one of these sand cast beads why does it keep flipping around i don't understand so this is where i'm at okay we'll put on another seed bead and turquoise and let's get some of these black matte onyx beads out put okay black bead on crowball bead on black bead on [Music] let's see what that looks like okay that looks fine turquoise bead matte onyx bead crobo bead onyx bead turquoise bead then a matt onyx then onyx okay we'll do this side so matt onyx the crowbow with the matte onyx turquoise and then the matte onyx the crowbow the turquoise oh nope nope matt onyx doing the pattern wrong okay onyx and now the turquoise and then another matte onyx crowbow and then a matte onyx all right so on this side another turquoise matt onyx the crowbow the matte onyx the turquoise and the matte onyx okay so we need turquoise on this side onyx and then i'll do like four crobo beads and then matt onyx so this is there's one side of the necklace done yeah i like that so on this side we need to do four crowbar and then a matt onyx okay so we have some print covers is this do i have this right do i have one two three four uh so i was just going [Music] to gung-ho and i totally that's why my stuff is not spaced out right i i just went ahead and didn't i didn't do it symmetrically okay one day i'll be able to do a video where i don't mess up and that day i look forward to but i'm not going to get mad like i said in my other video i'm gonna get even with these beads they may make me mad even though it's my fault that's what really makes me mad it's i don't blame the beads i know it's me i know i'm nervous i know i'm anxious i got this sweats going getting the hot flashes um yeah it's okay it'll all work out maybe if i can get these beads off okay that's what to say i can help you get these beads off i think i'll leave two of these beads to make earrings out of so there'll be something to match this necklace okay this is the necklace i got so far [Music] it's big and chunky it weighs quite a bit um get some cramps i think these are [Music] beadsmith crimps they come in the multi-pack of different colors and they have really thick walls so i like these crimps a lot and then get some crimp covers wire guards not crimp covers we'll get some wire guards and my tool okay so i think i'm just going to end these here i'm gonna put these through the wire guard got our clasp here i don't i probably don't need a clasp but i'm gonna use a clasp anyways all right i'm just going after it because i can see it where i'm sitting at this point okay so i've got some crimp covers i like to use my crimping tool if i can on crimp covers okay and then we'll string those beads over that tail all right and so again we'll put on a crimp put on a wire guardian put on the clasp and thread it's a mess you can't see what i'm doing thread it through the crimp so you can see that crimp is on their string going up into the wire guardian coming out of the warrior guardian and going back through that crimp and so i'm going to get some leverage i'm going to string this tail for the beads and i'm going to cinch it up okay i'm going to make sure it's not too tight and so i want to use my crimping pliers i'm going to use the back part of the crimping pliers to mix it elbows little shape and then use the front part of the crimping pliers it completes that shape you make you have like a you have a tube and then it smushes it down into this like this little thing and then you smoosh it tighter so like it rolls like into itself and the last thing we need to do is put on a crimp cover cover looks like a bead when it's done on the on this side where you put your crimp cover on your crimp okay and this is our very boho [Applause] necklace okay that was me trying to do a fast and a furious non-stretch cord beading project where i didn't mess up but i still messed up but that's okay because you learn from mistakes and i probably have some mistakes in here that i don't see off hand right now and it'll probably probably pop out at me when i'm watching this video to review it and then i'll laugh and then i'll cry and then i'll laugh because i'm getting even i'm getting even

three double crochet into next chain space and complete this round with this pattern [Music] after making last three double crochet next we have the chain space so make a chain and here you can see this we have already made these two groups of double crochet with three chains we'll just make one group of three double crochet one two three then make three chains insert the hoop into this second chain and make a slip stitch you can see this with this pattern we have made the second corner these three chains and these three chains will make the corner okay for next round insert the hook into next chain and make a slip stitch like this then insert the hook into this chain and make a slip stitch and now here we have chain space and thread the hook into this chain space and make a slip

and now make three more double crochet into same chain space with this pattern you'll make the corner one two three now make a chain and jump towards the next chain space skip this double crochet and repeat the pattern make three double crochet three chains in three double crochet into same chain space like this after making three double crochet make three chains and three more double crochet into same chain space one two three with this pattern you can see this will make the corner then make a chain and just make three double crochet one chain three double crochet in each chain space with this pattern and complete this round after making three double crochet in each end next we have a chain space make a chain and jump to the chain space and make three double crochet one two [Music] three then make three chains and three more double crochet into same chain space one two three after making this double crochet make a chain insert the hook into third chain and join with a slip stitch with this pattern we have completed this round and with the same pattern you'll make next round insert the hook into next chain make a slip stitch next slip stitch and next slip stitch then make three chains as you double crochet two more double crochet one two you have to repeat this pattern make three double crochet three chains and three more double crochet into same chain space one [Music] two three then here we have chain space three double crochet chain space three double crochet chain switch we'll just make a chain and three double crochet into each end space like this one two three then make a chain and jump toward the next chain space make three double crochet three double crochet three double crochet with this pattern you'll just pick three double crochet in each chain space and when we will reach to the next corner we have to make three double crochet three chains three double crochet like this after making last three double crochet here we have the next corners insert the hook into this corner make three double crochet one two three three chains and three more double crochet into same chain space then make a chain and here you can see this we have a new chain space so we have to make three double crochet into this chain space one two [Music] three after making this three double crochet next we have the corners so make a chain and jump over the chain space and make three double crochet two three chains and three double crochet [Music] like this three double crochet three chains and three double crochet [Music] one two three with this pattern we'll make the corner [Music] then make a chain three double crochet one chain three double crochet one chain three double crochet of this pattern we'll make this round and then we will reach to the next corner again make three double crochet three chains and three double crochet then here we have a chain space we'll make a chain three double crochet one chain in join with the slip stitch into third chain then we repeat the pattern slip stitch next slip stitch and into the chain space we'll make three double crochet three chain three double crochet and make three double crochet in each chain space and increase the runner with same pattern you'll make six rounds one two three and make four more round with this pattern after making last three double crochet make a chain insert the hook into third chain and join with the slip stitch and cut the yarn from this point [Music] as you can see this we have completed seven rounds one two three four five six and seven we have made seven rounds with same pattern [Music] for next round we have to change the color i'm using this purple color insert the hook into the corner [Music] okay now insert the hook into chain space and take out the yarn and make three chains one two three this chain will be counted as a first double crochet make two more double crochet we'll just change the color and the pattern will remain the same three double crochet three chains three more double crochet into same chain space [Music] like this then make a chain and jump towards the next chain space and make three double crochet one two three make a chain next three double crochet [Music] make a chain next chain space three double crochet [Music] just keep doing with this pattern and make two rounds with this color we'll complete this round and after this we'll make one more round with same color after making a chain make last three double crochet into this chain space one two three then make a chain insert the hook into third chain and join with the slip stitch then cut the yarn from this point we have completed this two round with purple color now we are going to make the next one with white color pattern will remain quite same okay insert the hoop into the corner [Music] now make three chains one two three make two more double crochet [Music] one two with this pattern you'll make three double crochet three chains and three more double

next three rounds with white color in after completing three rounds then last two rounds again we'll make with purple color then i will tell you that what we have to do next we are at the end of our second last round insert the hook into last chain space and make three double crochet [Music] then make a chain and join the slip stitch insert the hook into third chain and make a slip stitch then cut the yarn from this point now we are going to make the final round [Music] let's insert the hook into same chain space and make three chains these two chains will be counted as a first double crochet one two three this chain then make three more double crochet into same chain space one [Music] two three with this pattern you'll make four double crochet these three chains as double crochet then make three more double crochet after making four double crochet next here we have the chain space insert the hook into this chain space and make a single crochet like this then make three chains and make three more double crochet into same chain space [Music] one two [Music] three after making four double crochet jump toward the next chain space and make a single crochet three chains and three more double crochet into same chain space one two [Music] three after making four double crochet make a single crochet into next chain space then make three chains and make three more double crochet into same chain space we have to repeat this pattern all around [Music] like this just keep doing with this pattern and complete this round after making four double crochet in chain space now we are at the next corner after making this four double crochet insert the hook into chain space and make single crochet then make three chains three more double crochet into same chain space one two three the turn the side insert the hook into next chain space make a single crochet three chains and three more double crochet into same chain space with same pattern we'll make this wrong [Music] like this [Music] after making last four double crochet insert the hook into first chain space and make a single crochet then cut the yarn from this point and with this pattern we have completed the runner [Music] as you can see this we have completed this runner [Music] so friend i hope you will like this we'll meet you soon with a new video till then good bye", "Y3GvGjWB0oo": "Welcome back to The Crochet Crowd as well as my friends over at joann.com. This is week number one. Yes, we're gonna get ourselves started today to be able to make your beautiful afghan together with me right here on camera. What we have this week is actually three stitches that are gonna be building on top of each other. So we're gonna start off with the Stacked Blocks. We're then going to transition and we're going to do a zigzag pattern which I think you'll be really quite proud of yourselves after you're done. I know I was and then the third one we're going to do the Offset Squares and what this is is like the Stack Blocks, but it's just being shifted over. So each one of these are going to be working together in order to really create that layer. So we're gonna be doing this, also in week number three we're also going to bring back the Stacked Blocks as well as the Offset Squares and we're gonna put something else in between. So it's one of those items where you can learn these skills and then kind of just puzzle it up and make it your own. So without further ado let's head on down into the studio and let's get started right away. So let's start off with a pattern review we have this afghan it's 50\" by 61\" long. It's a mosaic based afghan and we're gonna be teaching those techniques and what you'll learn from this stitch along you can use elsewhere whenever you're thinking about your crochet. So it is an intermediate level but a determined beginner if as long as you understand the concept can actually master this. We have four different color ways that the designer has chosen. So you can choose up a color design that suits your lifestyle and your decor the best. You're gonna be using a 5 mm, size 'H' crochet hook and this afghan is a one piece unit. So we're gonna start off in the one section and then keep on building and building. So it's not a particular motif based project. So let's turn the page. In the next few pages you have what the instructions are from the designer on how to use this concept to your advantage and how to follow the charts and things to watch out for. So we'll be going through that when we go through the mosaic concepts. We're then going to work on the pattern itself and you have the written instructions for those that prefer that and we start off in the one section here we jump to another and then another here in week number one. So then as you're continuing along and flipping you will see like larger photos of the afghan itself but you will also then run into the stitch key diagrams which we'll talk to you about when we get to each one of these concepts. So the whole pattern has been laid out like this so it's a lot easier for you to be able to follow. You can see that repeats in the pattern really quite easily and ultimately, the designer has done a fabulous job here. So what we should jump to next is that I'm gonna show you how to do this mosaic concept from the designers point of view and she did an excellent job on putting that together for you. So let's go through that next. So here we have Mosaic Crochet and it's been written by the designer for your convenience. The concept is actually pretty simple. It's just getting it into your head to make sure that you understand it so that it makes your life a lot easier. You can also reduce the stress by understanding the concept as well. Mosaic Crochet patterns are worked in alternating pairs of single crochet rows with each pair consisting of the right side and wrong side. So what she's saying here is that when you go across with single crochet with let's just say for example gray here when you return back you'll be using gray and then what's gonna happen is in the next row you're going to be using here the purple so you'll go across with purple and return with purple and the colors will be carrying up loosely on the one side. So the coloring is always gonna change on the one side here and that's what she's saying in that particular instruction. So the unused color is being carried up and the beautiful thing about this concept is that the stitches will drop down. So this double crochet I can put my hook right behind it and if I move it to the side you'll see that the purple is right underneath. Therefore this will literally hide the color instead of being tapestry crochet. So when it's purple, gray has not been traveling under, gray has just been left to the side at the end and then you'll come back and return. And so when you have this here the gray you don't see any purple in there at all because it's not being carried. So that's a really wonderful thing. So let's move along in the next paragraph. A mosaic crochet pattern starts to come to life when the double crochet stitches worked on your right side only, so whenever you do the drop down it has to be the side that you can physically see when you're putting it onto your sofa and displaying it. So the good side is always that you're going to be doing something fun like this. So the opposite side, the bad side, the wrong side is all just going to be striping because there's no mosaic happening on the other side. But what's happening here behind here is what's making it possible for it being in the front. So you'll start to see ideas. So whenever there's a drop down just like you see here there is a chain two space behind it. The only difference is that when you have things like this where there's two colors in a row, there's two drop downs, that would have been a chain three. So here's the concept. If you have to skip over one stitch you will chain two. If you have to skip over two stitches you have to chain three and you're adding that extra chain in there so when this drops down it sits flush within your project and not popping out and jumping out and causing it to not sit right. So the extra chain whenever you're going to put in there will make it sit so everything is really aligning properly. So when you're reading the diagrams what's gonna happen is that when you do a drop down like this one here you're going to notice that you would had to do a chain two after this in order to create a space that is appearing so the next drop down in the future can happen. So what you have to watch out for is that when you have these drop downs happen, there's going to be um, spaces either before or after sometimes before and after in order to create the spaces for things to happen. So you just have to keep an eye that when you, ever you're going across on the front side, the right side of the work is that you're not only gonna do your drop down but you're also gonna create spaces so that in the future when you have to drop down again that they'll be there and available for you. To keep track of this what she's recommending as well is to have a post-it note or a piece of paper to overlay the pattern. So you could just lay it on top of the pattern and just hide what is above. You know sometimes the hardest things are so easy to do when you can never, just ignore what is in top because you don't need to worry about what's on top at this moment but you can just focus on what's underneath and just move up your paper. And the nice thing about being a sticky note is that you can unstick it and then restick it without any issues at all. So it's a really beautiful concept. The charts also have an unusual red line and there's an explanation for that but we'll talk about that when we get closer to the actual pattern itself. And so she also has instructions for us on how to do these particular concepts. So she provided to us not only just examples of how the chart is going but also examples on how it's physically crocheted as well, which I think is a real bonus here. So in this first example what we have is a reduce or sample of the right side of the first uh, to fourth row of the Zigzag Mosaic crochet pattern. So you will notice there that we went across and we have row number one and then we came back with row number two and you saw that they were just single crochets in each. If you don't know how to read these things um,  the stitch key is available to you and also we will be covering it at the start of every section as well. As we begin row number three is that we're going to chain up one and the first three have a single crochet and then chain two, skip one, single crochet in the next, chain two, skip the one and then single crochet in the next three. And what you see in the red line here is the repeat of it of the, of the project happening. So you can see that everything between the repeat happens over and over again. So once you get that into your head it's so much easier to be able to follow. What you're doing here is that you're creating the holes of the extra chain that has been provided so the next row that will come into play will drop down in front of those chain two spaces and attach right to that single crochet to be in the position. So we'll cover that in the next chart that's just straight down. So what you're seeing here is that you're getting yourself overlaid. So the first color it's easy to tell is just going to be your main color so it can be um, a white or gray. So back with the or forward with the main color and then back with the main color. Drop it, let it hold to the side and they grab the fun color the secondary color and then just single crochet the first three and then go across with that color and then back and then you'll drop it again and bring up the main color. So you'll loosely travel those up. So let's move down on that page and let's go through this chart which is just a build on to what is above. So let's begin down here in row number five. And what we have is that we're going to just chain up one and single crochet the first two. So you have to think about two things when you're coming across. You have to think about building more chain spaces and you also have to think about dropping down at this point. So you're gonna single crochet in the first two, chain two which will skip a space or skip a stitch here and you'll double crochet down into this single crochet down here. The double crochet has a bend to it. That means that we're crocheting in front. You're going to then single crochet in the next stitch here and then dropping down again for another double crochet down here. You're chaining two, single crocheting in the next so you're just gonna skip this stitch, single crochet in the next and you will see that the repeat has just shifted over slightly. So the red line is showing you that and so then you'll see the constant repeating of this pattern then going all the way across. So you're chaining two, skipping one, dropping down, single crochet in the next, double crochet by dropping down, chaining two, single crochet in the next and et cetera all the way to the end. Here's the advantage of this whole concept. When you return on the wrong side it always matches what was on the right side but only doing a single crochet. So let's look at it. So chain one, single crochet in the first two, single crochet in the next, you're, see this chain two you're just chaining two, you're just matching it. Instead of dropping down you're just single crocheting. So you single crochet in every stitch and when there's spaces you're just gonna jump over. And if you don't think that's true if you look back up here when we did the return pass on number four it matched everything and you're going to see that happening every time on the back side. So if you single crochet in every stitch across you're single crocheting in every stitch going back. If you're doing some space work you're gonna match those spaces returning. So as we continue this particular concept, and we're then moving up in the pattern we're now going to rows number seven and eight. So seven and eight is again the fun color the, the contrast color. So you're worrying about dropping down, I wouldn't say worry is a good word. But you're going to chain up one, single crochet, chain two, then drop down where the space is. You'll see the space right on the project and then you'll single crochet in the next three. You'll drop down with a double crochet and then you'll chain two and then drop skipping uh, skipping one and then dropping down and you will see that it's following that shift that we did the last time. So if you're looking here you're seeing that the blue is dropping down and again, the return pass is just matching stitch for stitch so single crocheting in the stitches where they count and where there's chain two spaces you just continue to do that. So the backside of this whole afghan is actually gonna look just like this. So when you're going in the back, you're just matching it. So if I turn the sample over you see nothing but stripes. That's gonna happen. So the nice thing about it is that even if it does flip it'll look striped but when you turn it over you can have the magic just like you see here. And so it's a really neat concept in order to do it and as you're building it and you start to do repeat of this pattern you're going to notice is that once the repeat's done you're gonna start to be able to look before and say, okay well, how did, where did that really go into play? And when I back out the camera, now is that when you look at the sample like you just see one repeat here you'll see five of these when you actually have the real sample done and what we're recommending is that every time you do a repeat just put a stitch marker in there and you'll be able to see it. But on the Zigzags here that you'll see you'll be able to count five. And then here as you're building up this is just a small example but what you'll have is three repeats of this eventually, this is one repeat and then three repeats of that going the other way. So it's a really kind of a neat concept in order to play. So I know this was a really kind of a long section here. It's really necessary for you to understand this concept to make your life a lot easier. Less frogging more hooking and that's kind of the goal. So without further ado, we're gonna move along now and we're gonna get ourselves started with the first section of week number one. So let's begin week number one officially. We have three sections to do for this one. We have three different types of stitches that we're gonna learn. We're gonna start off with the Stacked Blocks. We're then going to move on to the Zig Zags and then we're going to be going on to the Offset Squares. So the what we're going to do is going incrementally into this and we're gonna return then back at the beginning of each one of these sections to look at the diagram that's available to you. So there's a lot of written instructions. That's because those chain two spaces that we need to skip it gets too wordy to write that. So it's it's really not that hard if you're just following the concept. So let's continue then and let's start the Stacked Blocks first and, and this kinda wets your whistle to get yourself started and then once you get it you get it. So as we begin the Stacked Blocks we're going to start up and we're gonna start with our chain and then we're going to then start with row number one and two. So you can kinda see with the coloring of the shading that it tells you like this is the kind of the main color so back, so going across with the main color and then back is just single crochet in each of the stitches. We're then going for three and four. You see that it's a shade of color so we're gonna switch off and we're gonna do contrast 'B' with this one. So it's the variegated yarn and you're going to notice is that we're start to create the spaces in order to make that work. So what we have is that we're going to single crochet in the first one, chain three and only skip two. Remember what I said in the other section there is that whenever we're skipping over a set amount of stitches we have to add an extra chain so that these will stay flush in the future. We're then skipping over two and then single crocheting in the two. These red lines are kind of like your repeats. So once you understand the, this sequential order it gets really easy to be able to do that all the way across. Then once you get those two single crochets you're chaining three, skipping only two, single crochet in the next two and you'll do that all the way back. So the return pass on the wrong side is just gonna match stitch for stitch. So if it's a single crochet you'll do a single crochet. If it's a chain three space you'll continue it to be a chain three space. Row number five we're going to do our drops downs the, the thing about this particular um, pattern compared to the rest of them that we have is that there is actually a physical break of the way that they drop down. So in other ones they drop down sooner so that they have the more the zig zaggy you kind of fun stitches. This one here is about stacking. It's about getting yourself started in this particular concept. So when we come across on number five, it'll be the main color we're just dropping down to where the chain three spaces are to these particular single crochets here. Single crochet in the next two and then drop down but when we do the return pass, we're just single crocheting all there. So we're not providing any spaces within these double crochet uh, drop downs at all unlike the rest of the patterns that you have. Actually the offset squares you won't have that as well. So this is kind of any concept and once you get it, so rows number five through eight are the repeat pattern for this section and you only need three sets of boxes. So this will create one box, this is a second and you just gotta do it one more time before moving on in the pattern. So without further ado, let's grab our hook and let's get started on the pattern. So starting with a slipknot on the hook, please either chain 149 or do your stitch multiples of 24 + 5. So just a stitch, so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and then just keep it in multiples of 24 + 5 or 149 you decide. So I've just finished two sets of 24 so I'm just gonna add my five to have the balance so 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. So in video number three you're going to do this again But there won't be a starting chain and if you were doing that particular video what you need to do is just chain up one and do across and back with just a single crochet um in each. Now because we're just starting here in video number one you're gonna have your starting chain. So second chain from the hook just turn it over and get the back hump of the chain only and just single crochet yourself all the way across your chain. So this will be a row number one and in video number three it's still row number one, but you won't be working on a chain, just the existing row that's below. So let's go across um, and I'll see you at the end of this chain. Okay, once you're all the way across your chain you're gonna turn your work and go for row number two and this is also the same for video number three. So just chain up one and do one single crochet in each of the single crochets going all the way back and then we're gonna introduce our variegated color, which is contrast 'B'. So cheese, please just put in one single crochet in each stitch across. So as I'm completing this row the new color is going to get added on the last stitch before we begin. So every time that we're going to play with a different color, every two rows is the same color. So these two rows will then be grey and then in this case for the Stacked Blocks the next two rows will be the variegated um Peacock color and what we have here is that every time we're changing colors it'll always be on the same side and it will obviously just make it your life a lot easier. You're also not gonna cut your yarn at all. So you're just gonna make it travel up and then you're going to apply a border. So in the very last stitch don't finish it and get your variegated yarn and I just create a slipknot just for my own sanity and I'm just gonna put it on and I'm gonna finish the last stitch with that color and I'm just gonna let that gray just fall out of the way, and then I'm going to use the Peacock color. So let's just turn our work and set this down and let me take you to the diagram and show you what you're going to get yourself into. I also have a sample for you to see as well. So here's an example of what we're gonna get ourselves into. So every two stitches is either going to be gray or it's gonna be the peacock. But we don't worry about the gray until we get all the way over and back with peacock first and then switch over. So what you're seeing here, the gray dropping down is not happening immediately. It'll be the next time we're introducing gray and that's where we're gonna drop down. The trick is is that we have to provide the spaces in order for that to happen. So if you look at it from the back see the peacock is going actually all the way through this thing. It's the gray here and when I actually just take another item, you can see I can just slip my hook right underneath that gray. It's just an overlay. So it's a nice clean color and there's no tapestry work involved with doing this particular concept. So let's begin row number three. Chain up one and put one single crochet in the beginning one just like this. So that's your first one. You now have to chain three. So 1, 2, 3 and you're gonna only skip over two and go to the third and single crochet that one plus the friend next door. So two in a row. So now you have to skip over two. So how many stitches are you going to or how many chains are you're gonna make, three. You have to make an extra one. So 1, 2, 3, skip only two and single crochet in the next one and it's friend next door. Where you're skipping is where the gray is gonna drop down in the future and the gray is actually going to use these stitches in front of the work. So chain three, skip two, go to the third and then make sure you get the friend next door and go all the way across and I'll see you at the end of row number three. If your stitch counts are right and you're maintaining exactly the pattern going across the very last stitch will just be one single crochet by itself. So currently you're looking at the right side of the project, but you don't know it yet not until you get that gray over lay the first time. So we have to return back because the gray is not available for you to change so then this is the back side of the project and you're going to maintain exactly what you see every time you're on the back. So just chaining one and single crochet in the first. You can see that there's a chain space here. So how many was in the chain? It was three so 1, 2, 3 and single crochet in the next two. So when you're on the back side, you're just maintaining exactly what you've done in the row and before it and just return all the way back to the other side. So this is row number four and I will see you at the end of this row. So I'm coming up all the way across and just matching exactly what I see and the last stitch is gonna be a single crochet but I don't wanna finish I wanna now change it back to gray. So when I'm changing colors back and forth I wanna make sure these strands don't tangle. So just keep an eye on that behind the scenes and pull through and then turn your work. Make sure it's kind of traveling up a little bit loosely because you're gonna be covering that later with the border. So let's turn our project and now let's begin row number five and six. So on the particular sample, you're gonna notice that there's three boxes that will be aligned. So we're actually just made ourselves the first one, but you can't see it quite yet and so you'll have to go across one more time and then one more time. So that's the goal for this particular one. When you're finishing this particular section you will notice that the pass once it comes down and then back that would be the end of it. So you'll see that on the diagram as well. So that's where you wanna be able to finish. So what I need you to do is do three sets of these boxes and then just do your pass back and forth to finish off before moving on to the Zig Zag section. So let's begin. We're gonna chain up one and you're gonna single crochet in the first one. Just let that um, peacock just come out of the way. So the next two stitches are down here. So drop down, so uh, wrap the hook first. It's a double crochet and just go right into the stitches and making sure that you don't trap those peacock colors inside the stitch. So just make sure just pulling it out and you're going to double crochet that one plus the friend next door. So this, these ones are working in sets of two as well as the Offset Squares that you'll have in the future. Once you have those two drop down the next two are just single crochet right in the single crochets that are already there. So there is your peekaboo starting and now the next two are right in front and you're gonna do that all the way across. Okay, the next two single crochets are single crochets and then the next two you can see the spacing just dropping down in front. Please do this all the way across and I'll see you at the end of this row. So I'm just coming all the way to the other side I'm just single crocheting the last single crochet and you can see on the other side is where your yarn is for the peacock so you know that you can't change to peacock yet. So you turn your work and then you come back and so you can see the back side. So the fun stuff is on the front and now you can really see where you are in the back. So you're now going to do the return pass so just chain up one and just apply one single crochet in each one of the stitches going all the way across and that will conclude on how to do this particular stitch work. So you need to actually repeat the last four rows which is including the one I'm just doing right now a matter of two more times so that you end up with three sets of those variegated boxes that are stacked on top of each other. I'll see you at the end of this row. So I'm coming to the very end of this row. So what's that mean? You can see that this is going to have the variegates that are sitting there so, you know that you have to change. So the very last one then you just switch back to the variegate and then turn your work. So you're gonna repeat the last four rows. So that you're gonna go across with your variegates, you're gonna put the same space exactly where you need to in order to have it stacked on top and then you're just gonna go across with your grays. So once you're ready to move on to the Zig-Zag make sure that the last stitch is actually finished with the gray. Don't switch back to peacock and we're going to begin the Zig-Zag with the fresh new um, gray here and we're gonna provide the foundation rows with the gray. So there's gonna be a little bit more gray space between these peacocks and when the Zig-Zag starts and let's go to the diagram and see what we're getting ourselves into now. So let's begin to do our Zig-Zag Mosaic pattern. So what we have is that we're gonna be building up from the existing pattern and the first two rows are just gonna be using your main color of row number one and two and it's gonna single crochet across. You will notice that the repeat changes slightly. Just follow the red lines and stay incrementally so that it keeps it easier for you to remember this stitch work all the, all that much easier. The thing about it is that we're gonna start off row number three with the contrasting color so three and four is just creating the space work. So you're gonna single crochet the first three, chain two, skip one, single crochet in the next. Chain two and then single crochet in the next three. So you see within the red box here this is the incremental of the repeat. When you return pass then on number four you're just matching stitch for stitch. If there's a chain two keep it as a chain two and single crochet in the remaining stitches and then just let your yarn drop. Number five and six is your main color again. So you have two single crochet the first two, chain two first skipping this stitch then dropping down, single crochet in the next, dropping down and when I say by dropping down that's a double crochet and then chain two after that. So you're chaining two before the drop down, you're chaining two after the drop down and you're skipping a stitch before and after in order to make this work. So you're gonna notice that you it'll have space then for the next piece that goes in in the future. Your single crochet in the next and then you do the incremental repeat. Number six coming back is just matching it with what you have match the single crochets to the single crochets and double crochets and keeping the um, chain to the same. Row number seven and eight we're going to be starting up chaining one. We're gonna create a gap space immediately on the first stitch here skipping over, drop down, single crochet in the next, drop down and then putting a chain two there, skipping that stitch and drop down. So the way I easy, easy to remember these two here there just gonna be dropped down, chain two and then drop down the next one. So there's nothing to attach to up here. You'd then going to do single crochets for the next three and then you're gonna just continue to repeat that. So row number eights just matching. So row number nine we're gonna be doing the last of the growth as far as like the, the last time it gets bigger at the top of the 'V' kinda shape. It's actually the point. So you're gonna notice that it's only gonna drop down one time for each of the points that you will have. So you'll single crochet, drop down, single crochet in the next two, chain two space. So right in the middle you'll skip and then you will then chain two, sorry single crochet twice and then dropping down and et cetera. So you'll do that all the way across and then row number ten you'll come back and just match stitch, stitch, stitch, space to space. Row number eleven and twelve you are just going to then start up again. So if you really kind of look at it, you see that it's going to be building out again. So what is the difference between the bottom section here is that the bottom section did not have a point down here but it will here and you will notice that appearing in the work as well. So you're gonna be doing the row repeat from five all the way through twelve and you'll have that so that you'll you will physically see five Zig-Zags on your work. Okay, so that's a lot of mouthful at this moment. So let's grab a hook and let's get started. So we're now going to build on. So you would have had three of these blocks done by now for brevity reasons um, I don't need to show you all those three three different times. You can just do it. So we're now going to build on. So we're just gonna chain up one and for row number one and two noticing that I'm looking at the right side as I start one and two um, as I start number one you're just gonna do one single crochet in each and then you're just gonna get to the end turn, chain one and one single crochet all the way back and then we're gonna introduce the secondary um, color which is contrast 'A'. So please do rows number one and two with just one single crochet into each. So as we come to the end of row number two for the Zig-Zag section I want you to introduce then the purple on the last stitch and pull it through and then drop the gray and then we're going to begin rows number three and four.  Let's begin row number three. You're gonna chain up one and do one single crochet in each of the next three so that includes the first one. Once you have that done, you're gonna chain two, skip only one stitch and single crochet in the next and then chain two and then skip uh, one stitch and single crochet into the next three. So 1, 2 and 3. Okay, so that's our repeat going all the way across. So chain two, skip just one, chain two, skip just one and this time it's gonna be three in a row. So when you scan all the way across with your eyes I want you to just kinda make sure that there is sets of three and then you can see two spaces with one single crochet that is standing in between. So please do this all the way across. This is row number three and I'll see you at the end of this row. So when you get to the other side you're gonna turn and you're looking at the back side here. You can see the stripe. So with this one here, just like all the rest when you're on the back side you just match the stitches. So chaining up one and then just do one single crochet where there's single crochets and if there was a space just match the space count that it would that it was. So in this case we were chaining two when we jumped so chain two, single crochet in the next, chain two and then skipping over and et cetera. So, please just match the stitches that you see on the, on the other side here. So when you get to the other side just matching your stitches and then you're gonna switch back to gray and then the gray is gonna be filling in the spots where you've just jumped over and we're gonna creating, creating more spots that you'll see. So switch over to gray and then we're going to begin then and do rows number five and six which is part of the repeat that you'll see. Okay, this is a start of the repeat. So we have five and six as your first one so you're gonna chain up one and you're going to apply two uh, two single crochets in a row. So 1 and 2. You're then going to chain two, which is providing a space for the future and then you immediately drop down here. Okay, so that space covered that one that you're skipping which is right there. You're then going to single crochet in the next single crochet and then drop down. So it's a double crochet and then you wanna chain two for a space and skip the one immediately that comes after and then just go and single crochet the one. If you notice is that there's three single crochets in a row. It's the middle one of the three. Chain two to reset and do two more of those. So chain two, skipping the next one and dropping down. Single crochet into the next one. So if you can see everything in sets of pairs it's a lot easier. Okay, skipping the first one out chain two and just come to the middle one of the grouping of three right there. Chain two, skipping the next one coming down and drop down, single crochet into the middle one of and then drop down and chain two. So if you can remember that there is a chain two before you drop down and a chain two directly after you drop down it becomes a lot easier. Let's set continue this all the way across and I'll see you at the end of the row. When you come to the end of the row don't forget that chain two space and the final three are each gonna be a single crochet. So do you remember how to return pass? It's the same as each one of them. So turn your work and match exactly what you see. So just chaining up one so this is where number six so you're just gonna a single crochet where there's single crochets and where there was a space that you jumped match the count. So it was this case it was chain two and watch these ones here. There's actually three in a row if you turn it over you can see it. See, you got the first double, you got the single in the middle and then a double. So you're just gonna make sure that you're single crocheting and each one of those. So don't forget those and that will pull it back, chain two, single crochet in the next, chain two and then single crochet in the next three. So this is going back for number six and then we're gonna pick up the purple when we get back to the other side. So I'm coming back up to the other side and I'm just matching stitch for stitch and then we are then going to pick up our purple and then go back in the other direction. Just like we're seeing and seven and eight yes we are gonna be dropping down with the purple. So as we begin this one here, we are gonna be dropping down with the purple as I said and we're gonna be coming down. So every time there's a zigzag kind of ideal or standing tile you'll notice that we're using both the purple and the grays to do to drop downs in order to create the effects. Unlike the Stacked Blocks where that was solo by itself we're now gonna be playing with the secondary color here to also drop down. So number seven is that we're gonna chain up one and do one single crochet in the first and then chain two and then drop down into the purple just like you see and this will create an overlay. You're going to single crochet in the next three that you see. Those are right up over top of the doubles uh, like of the dou, of the pair that you see below and then you're going to drop down. So here's how I remember it. So I'm dropping down and it feels wrong to do but you need to create a space in between the two drop downs of this purple. So just chain two and then dropping down to the next one. So you're just totally ignoring that gray section in behind. So it feels like it's gonna separate but it won't. You just have to trust in it. After you get those pair done it's the next three in a row that'll be single crochet and then you're gonna drop down. So drop and then chain two and then drop on the other side. And now the next three in a row are each a single. So you're gonna notice then it's almost like a horseshoe shape that you're creating with that particular color as you go all the way across. So this is row number seven and then we'll return pass number eight when we get to the other side. So I'm coming all the way to the other side and you're just continuing to drop down. Now when you come to the other side here, you can only drop down you can't have a pair so then you just have to chain two after this one and then it's two single crochets that are left. So as we do our return going back number eight just match exactly what you see. So just chaining up one, one single crocheting each. If there's a chain two space just chain two and jump and just continue to do all those across just like that. So just maintain what you know, and then I'll see you at the other side of this row. So I'm coming up all the way across just matching and this is the end of row number eight. So I just skipped over it and there's only one um, single crochet in a row make sure that you do switch back to your main color and then we're gonna pick up on rows number nine and ten. So you can kinda see how things are working out so far. Row number nine you're just gonna chain up one and you're gonna single crochet in the first one and then immediately drop down into the gray down here. You're going to single crochet the next two, so just look for the spaces that you can kind of see in behind the scenes. So the first two in a row are a single crochet so there's five in a row just to keep a, a number of the count. chain two to jump a space, skip the middle one of the grouping of five and single crochet the next two after that and then you can see you're in a space so drop down to the gray, pick it up just like that and then single crochet into the next two. That's your grouping of five in the purple. Chain two, skip the next one, single crochet in the next two and then drop down. And you can kind of really see the definition of things really happening right, isn't that awesome. So continue to do this, this is row number nine and then when you do the return pass you're just gonna match exactly what you see. When you get to the other side the last two are single crochets. There's no spaces between the last drop down and that one. You can really see and now if you're really following the shapes you can see how things are working out. So let's return pass uh, row number ten exactly what you see. So just chain up one and then one single in each and then chain twos over the spacing when you're going to jump. So just keep an eye on those and please do this all the way then back for row number ten. So when you get all the way back obviously you're gonna switch to purple and then we're going to begin then a rows number the final of eleven and twelve of the repeat and then you're gonna go back to row number five and through twelve once again. So you will see that this row here will create the spike that you need and you can see the spike is ready to go in because you have two spaces you can see it's right in the middle of where this is happening. You're just gonna chain up one and you're gonna put in a single crochet in the first three so 1, 2, 3, and you can see that you have a single before the drop down and that's where you wanna chain one or chain two sorry, that's a space and then dropping down in the space. That's the very middle. You're gonna chain two that's the space after it. You're gonna skip the one directly after the space and just put three single crochets in a row. So the trick is is to be watching where the drop down happens, which is here. There's a stitch in the way first so you're gonna chain two to skip over that and then drop down and then chain two and skip the first one and then single crochet in the next three. Please do this, this is row number 11. So at the end of this row there will be four single crochets in a row. So then row number 12 you're just gonna turn your work and then begin and match exactly what you see. So if there's chain one uh, two spaces just match those and I'll see you at the end of this row. At the end of row number 12 all we're just going to do then is just switch back to gray and then if you're repeating the pattern you just have to go back and do rows number 5 through 12 once again. So you will see a total of five of these spikes happening. When you're ready and to move on to the next section after you get your five done of course you can do more than five or less than five. It's up to you. What you can do then is that we need to finish off this section so that we don't end up with any gapping spaces that end up bleeding over to the next type of stitching that we're going to do. So go back now and do rows number 5 to 12, just reverse the video and then I will meet you back here and then I'll take you through the next two rows then to finish off this section. To finish off this section after you have your five Zig-Zags in here you're just gonna chain up one and what you need to do is just drop down to where the stitches need to be, but you're not going to add any additional spacing. So just one single crochet into each and where you need to drop down just drop down, fill that in, you going to single crochet in the next and then you're just gonna drop down. Now the difference between the first time that you did this is that you did create the space but this time you're not going to because you're gonna finish off your section. So that's kind of an easy way to be able to remember that. So you will see that it will look in balance to row number five of when you did that without the spacing in between. So please do this all the way across. This is the finishing pass and then we will come back across with the gray and then move on to your next Offset Squares which is the next stitch. When you get all the way across just go right to the end and then you're just gonna turn your work and because this is the finishing pass you're just gonna apply one single crochet into each of the stitches going all the way. We are moving to the Offset Squares next and we will be using the variegate yarn. So we wanna get rid of the purple at this time and then move ourselves on to the variegated then as we're then continuing our journey. So let's then move on to that stitch at the end of this row. So now I'm just coming to the finishing pass then and you will have at this particular point we're gonna be getting ready for the Offset Squares. So you should have three layers of these blocks. You should have five layers of what you can see for those and now we're gonna move on to the Offset Squares which is very similar to the Stacked Squares. The only difference is that they're offset. So let's go back to the diagram and let's get ourselves and get ready for Offset Squares. So the offset squares the whole pattern is available to you so, the meaning that the whole, the whole thing has been charted out. So rows number one box, second box and the third box. So because it's an Offset Squares the only difference between the Stacked Boxes and this one is that you will notice in the second time that the boxes appear they are appearing right in the middle of where it appears here. So these were solid so it'll be dropping down so you'll create the space and then when you come back and do the third box you'll be back to what you were doing over here. Do you see that? So the actually the row repeat if you ever to use this in the future is from three to ten. But then beautiful thing about this pattern here is that you will see that it will work out pretty awesome. So you will actually physically do for the repeat you'll go from three all the way to ten and then in order to get this section here this is row through uh, three through six. So that's actually pretty easy to remember. So without further ado let's head on into the pattern and let's start crocheting this out. So for the Offset Squares we're just gonna start rows number one and two just with gray and it's just one single crochet in each of the stitches and I'll see you at the end of that and just hold for me at that moment. I'm coming to the end of row one and two as we begin to do the Offset Squares and we are going to switch over then and get your peacock ready or your variegated and we're going to be introducing that once again. So let's just put that on, let's turn our work and let's go back to the diagram and see what we're gonna get ourselves involved with next. Okay, let's begin three and four. So just chain up one, one single crochet in the first and then you're gonna chain three, 1, 2, 3, skipping over two and then single crochet in the next two like that. Chain three, skipping two, and single crochet the next two and then chain three. Please do that all the way across. This is row number three and we'll be coming back with number four for the Offset Squares. So just come all the way to the other side. This is row number three. You will be doing rows number three through six one more time after the we get the uh, first repeat done. So let's begin and continuing across just matching exactly what you see. So one single in each single and this case there is chain three as your spacing and then single crochet in the next singles. Please do that all the way across. This is row number four. Coming up all the way across to the other side and guess what, we're gonna switch back to gray. So when we switch back this time we are gonna just pick that one up and we're just going to fill in the spaces that we've created through number three and four. So just chain up one and one single crochet in the first one and then because the next one is a space we're gonna just drop down right in the front and then of course the next two are two single crochet and then dropping down again. Please do this and then return pass with the single crochet in each stitch and this will then be rows number three, four, five and six which is what you have to repeat after you do the next part of the offset which I will show you as well. So let's continue to do this as we get across. So I'm coming all the way across and I am just gonna, I'm filling in the final two spots and then there's one single crochet left at the end and then turn and this is row number six. So there was six pass across it's just one single crochet into each there's no spaces to worry about and please do this all the way across and then I'll see you at the end of this row. So I'm coming to the end of number six and I just wanna switch back to the variegate color and then we're going to begin then the offset section. So we have to maintain what we know. I can take you back to the diagram but I think it's pretty obvious at this point. So I'm just gonna chain up one and there will be three single crochets in a row. So 1, 2 and 3 and then chain two or sorry chain three, jumping over two and then just do the two after that and then chain three, skip two and going in after. And you can clearly see when you're doing this is that those are in between. So please do this all the way across. This is the Offset Square section. When you get to the other side the last three in a row each be a single crochet. So turning your work guess what, you have to match exactly what you see. So chaining one and one single crochet into each and where you did your chain three jumps please make sure you chain three and jump. So 1, 2, 3 and then coming over. So please do this all the way across. This is row number seven. When you get to the other side you're gonna switch back to you gray and then you're just gonna fill in the spots. So starting up chain one and do one single crochet in each of the single crochets that you have and in the chain two spaces you're gonna drop down and these will drop down creating those Offset Squares to really showcase their pattern. So you're just gonna do this all the way across and you will notice see the drop down is awesome, and when we come back across then we're just gonna single crochet into each stitch going and then you need to repeat then rows number three through six which is the two here and then sorry which is the two of these variegates and then dropping down and then just a solid and then that will take you then to the end of the section which then will conclude number week uh, week number one right here on the Stitch Along. I'm coming up to the end of the row and the last three are one single crochet each and then to return past then just one single crochet into each and I want you to do that and then we're just quickly recap and then finish week number one of this Stitch Along. So you get to the other side change it back to the variegate if you need... Let's just a recap on where we are here in the pattern. So we're at the end of week number uh, one. So when we started off we would have done three rows of these boxes that that's just like you see. We then would have added the Zig-Zag pattern here on top of that and there will be five that you can see. We're then going to add in then the Offset Squares that we just did. So you can see that you've just now completed three different types of stitches. So from the Stacked to the Zig-Zag to the Offset. So when we get ready for then the week number two we're gonna just slowly concentrate on the Chevron Chain and what we're going to do then is that we're just gonna go off in one direction and then back in and I'll show you how to do that and we need to repeat each one of those um, little sections three times for each in order to get that to happen and that's what we're gonna be doing. So please get your homework done. Hopefully this was of help to you and I'd love to hear your feedback. So just get in touch with me here on the, on the video and let me know what you're thinking. Let me know what your obstacles are and we'll go back to where I was in the dining room in just a second. So that's it for this week. It's Mikey on behalf of The Crochet Crowd as well as my friends over at joann.com. Please use our hash tags if you're using social media of #handmadewithjoann as well as #thecrochetcrowd. I want you to feel comfortable that the first time through any of these repeats is a little daunting but once you do it once it's easier the second time you're passing through. I notice that for myself. So take your time, enjoy and by all means post your work in progress on our group pages and we hope this in your creativity really soon. Have a great day, and we'll see you on week number two \u270c\ufe0f.", "h627NtEHLIo": "[Music] hey guys welcome to my video for today's tutorial i will be teaching you how to make the single crochet

this is what it will look like if you're starting from the very beginning making chains you're going to want to make chains in the multiple of two you will then work two rows alternating for however long you want your project on the row that i'm currently working is going to be the row that you will work for your first row i have started with one chain on my hook here i'm going to work one single crochet into the first stitch chain one skip one stitch work a single in the next stitch chain one skip one stitch work a single in the next stitch chain one skip one stitch work a single in the next

single crochet into the first stitch right here now you can see there's an open space from a previous chain and then next to it is a single crochet in these two stitches or spaces you're going to be working a single crochet decrease you will then chain one same thing you're gonna be working into these two spaces right here and you're gonna work a single crochet decrease chain one same thing right here you're just going to repeat this for the rest of your row [Music] when you get to the last stitch of your row you're going to make one regular single crochet so like i said you will alternate

eichelberger and coming to you from minneapolis minnesota it is the day before st patrick's day when this podcast will go live so the 16th of march 2021 we are a year officially into the great pandemic of 2021 i don't know how they will um attribute that going forward but welcome i'm wearing the green today and i've got a shawl with some green in it so i'm a little my little nod to the irish i'm not irish but i will celebrate with all of you it's kind of gloomy and overcast here today and uh i have a couple of stories from last week to tell you about let's start with the elephant in the room i am still wearing my old glasses not that it matters to any of you but i can't see quite as well as i would like and the optometrist's office called this week and they broke my orange glasses trying to put the lenses in they didn't do it they sent them away and so i can't get that frame anymore so i had a little grieving session it was really upset they had a bad day i will tell you all about that um but man i don't want to go look for new glasses i don't want to shop i don't want to go there are several places that i can go to in the twin cities who have quirky fun colorful glasses it's not that i just my glass my eyeglasses were outside of our budget the last time i bought them in my mind wasn't that we couldn't afford them but i you know i just spent more than i thought i should have and they had the springs in the hinges and they were so nice most comfortable pair of glasses i ever had and these hurt my nose a little by the end of the day and they hurt this my right ear a little so i was just really disappointed i tried not to be angry with the woman who called because it was not her fault but she could i was just like you've got to be kidding i asked you that one and she said i know i know but it happens sometimes especially when the glasses are older which mine were several years many years four maybe so i will be in the market for new glasses i don't have to get orange again but i certainly want a color something fun yeah and and the lady was like i know i know i'm so sorry but what are you gonna do i i said it's not you i know you didn't do it but she said just come in and pick out another pair and i was like yeah like that's just easy something that you wear every single day and you want to be comfortable ah well anyway so purple glasses what am i wearing today this is the toad hollow tunic i designed this pattern a last november it um it has a little um stitch pattern that goes down the front right here below the v-neck and then it also has that under the arms to the bottom and up the back all the way so it's just a little um slip knit stitch and then at the bottom of the hem yeah the hem has like a little uh brioche or fisherman's rib on it so it's a really fun uh thing to wear i think because it's it's different it there's quite a bit of knitting because it's a tunic and if you have a big bottom there you know there's a big circumference to go around but there are no sleeves so you know once you get up here then you can try it on um to see how long you want the straps to be and where it's hitting you so it is that's got that nice feature for that i have on my um keep palm and carry yarn uh i think i got this from maybe ticks trinkets at zk at the retreat but she has an etsy shop but you can google this on etsy and find a necklace that you know suits you but i don't always have a necklace on um i'm not a huge necklace wearer but i was in my my closet looking for a shirt to put on under this and i thought oh can i put green on for st patrick's day um probably not what i would normally wear with it but yeah it works uh thank you all so much for your love of the grandma elsie story you know my corey stories have been steeped in family history because i'm not going anywhere i'm not going to teach anywhere i'm not going to retreats which i was doing monthly sometimes twice a month before i was you know teaching locally so things were happening in my life and i had stories to tell you things about or that were related in some way shape or form to knitting and during the pandemic i haven't had that so i really thank you for hanging in there i know a lot of you comment that you like the cory story so thank you um they will continue to be kind of steeped in whatever's going on in my life but right now not in teaching and not in like knitting retreats we also had the time change this last weekend and it affects me so much i i don't know if that's true of everyone else but it takes me about two weeks to kind of you know get used to it and i will be doing melatonin at night for a few nights because i lay awake if i try to go to bed too early um it's not that i don't sleep well but i you know i'm a night owl so i like to stay up until i'm tired and i need to kind of push that back so i'm not sleeping until noon just not what i do but you know if you keep staying up and staying up then you sleep later and later in the morning and then with the time change it becomes crazy so i hope all of you are adapting well my husband said yesterday oh you know it's gonna be it's gonna be dark dark in the mornings now for a while when i go for my run and i know he hates that too when he has to get up and he goes really early about 5 5 30. um he is out running with the dog usually he doesn't run super far but he has been a runner four years and it really makes him feel better and so he goes early and i know he doesn't like it when they're out before dawn you know because people are getting up and going to work if you're doing the early shifts and so the cars are going and if it's dark you know he gets a little worried but so anyway welcome come on in for your hug today we can't see one another in person so we just kind of have to sit in that moment where we're saying okay i'm feeling that hug from corey this week i really like to hug some of you who are struggling i i get comments and emails and messages from some of you and i know that you're struggling and i see you and it is hard this is hard that we are now waiting for vaccines right we were waiting for the pandemic to end and now many people are just waiting for the vaccines so that they'll lift some of the restrictions so that enough people we can get to that herd immunity so we can kind of move on oh i do want to tell you all about may so someone asked how is may and may is really well um maybe i'll move this up um may called me a week ago maybe and they had had a discussion group so they are starting to open up in the nursing home because they've all been vaccinated of course they didn't give you know they they were there first and um and then most of the employees have had the opportunity to be vaccinated in a nursing home so they are allowing them to play bingo she played bingo twice last week which she really likes and they play for a quarter i think um and then uh she had this discussion group she said there were eight of them and she she said i wanted to tell you someone asked why we would plant on the good friday why is that a thing that someone would plant crops or plant their garden on good friday or start their garden on good friday and she s and i i thought why is she asking me like i don't have a garden i mean i've had i've grown some things before but i don't have a big garden i don't agree with them and then she said i was telling them that maybe cory could could get on her computer and tell her and tell us so i did i googled it i got on the computer because i had i had not heard that thing i know that in minnesota we don't usually plant anything before mother's day right like that's kind of the rule of thumb that we can still have a frost through mother's day it's not common but we can have snow and we can't have a frost and it can get very cold through mother's day so we do a lot of greenhouse starting and starting in the house and then moving things out then so you know i was kind of sure i could probably find something on this and i did i found an article that said that um in the 1400s when potatoes first came to um the uk and were becoming a crop and they were sending potatoes people were fearful of the seeds and the potatoes and they were called eyes and they were saying that that was that there were eyes in the potatoes and that there were um you know evil spirits in the potatoes so those of the christian faith believed that if you planted and blessed your ground on good friday that the evil spirits from the potatoes would not affect everything else and also the ground is getting ready in many parts of the country about the time when good friday happens although you know it swings quite so i'm wondering if good friday didn't swing back in the 1400s 1500 16 whatever like if it was just on you know whatever april 2nd because now you know it moves with easter and so i i sent her an article and she was just tickled and she called i talked to her yesterday and and she said she made a copy for everyone in the group so i don't know how she did that if she asked one of the nurses or what but she made a copy for someone everyone in the group and took it to the group and they were all very interested she said in the part about the potatoes so maya is doing well she does have a sore on her foot due to poor circulation and she's still wearing a big boot on it and um i think it's from when she lays at night she doesn't move a lot and so the it pools the circulation kind of in that heel she's got a big blister and they're worried about infection but it's not it hurts her but it you know it's nothing life-threatening hopefully so anyway i don't know if i should be telling you much of her medical information but you asked and i think she would tell someone that called you know that she's got this sore on her foot so anyway thanks for asking and for for caring about may she's still getting some letters and she's written a couple of people back her handwriting she said is just terrible and she doesn't write to me anymore as much and it was very shaky and difficult to write but she said some people asked about minnesota and she wanted to answer their questions i thought that was that was so cute so um but she is still getting some letters from some of you and she she tells me where they come from and some one of you lives near lake city lives down by her um where some maybe near the ski resort down there or something anyway she was telling me that my husband was telling me that medicare or medicaid or somebody um has made a recommendation that the nursing homes need to open and that people need to be able to go in and see their loved ones and um so he is going to call this week to see if because they've all been vaccinated now if we can come go down masked absolutely you know we don't want to get anybody sick but and we haven't um you know our time hasn't come up we haven't heard anything about vaccines for us yet and i haven't heard anybody in my area other than like nurses and whatever so uh we're gonna we're hoping hoping that we can get in to see her and and say hello because you know she's been in that room for a year she's got a new roommate her roommate left got um got to leave with someone who was there for like long-term um treatment kind of care kind of a thing and i think it was because of the pandemic that this person stayed there so they moved out so she got a new roommate and she said that's working out fine so all right let's get going here 13 minutes in and i haven't talked about a lot of knitting i have two audio books for you this week uh the one that i forgot to talk about a week or two ago is the guest list by lucy foley i liked it but it wasn't one of my top picks ever i found it a little disturbing a little sad um and you know sometimes it's just the frame of mind you're in i liked reading it i couldn't stop reading it it was a page turner for sure so here's what it says on an island off the coast of ireland guests gather to celebrate two people joining their lives together as one the groom handsome and charming a rising television star the bride smart and ambitious a magazine publisher it's a wedding for a magazine or for a celebrity the designer dress the remote location the luxe party favors the boutique whiskey the cell phone service may be spotty and the waves may be rough but every detail has been expertly planned and will be expertly executed and then something happens and someone turns up and um there's intrigue and suspense but you it's a character-driven novel you really follow each character and what their history is and and that keeps you interested so yeah i mean i would recommend it i just it's not going to be one of my top 10 of the year right it it was good but i've just read a couple of really good ones recently like the next one that i want to talk to you about and that is anxious people by frederick bachmann oh dear did i love this book i mean i just love this book and i want everyone to have the same experience i had with it so i'm not even going to tell you too much of the premise i guess by reading the the blurb just one sentence blurb on the book you find out something so that's the piece i'm going to share with you a poignant charming novel about a crime that never took place a would-be bank robber who disappears into thin air and eight extremely anxious strangers who find they have more in common than they ever imagined so it is based on this premise of all these people getting together and getting to know one another and i i'm not going to give away any more than that because i think part of the finding out of what the book is about so i would recommend do not go and read a whole book jacket back i just knew it was frederick brock bachman and he writes some quirky characters and and you've and they are they're very quirky they're very different this is not a book for everyone if you i mean i may maybe it is a book for everyone i hope it is a book for everyone but i like finding out interesting things about the characters and having character driven um things even if i don't like all the characters right like i'm okay with that if the character is sometimes unlikable but in this situation you're finding out the back story which is what helps you to decide that you might like that person more because now you know their history and you can empathize oh such a good read just i really liked it i hope they make it into a movie because i think it would be amazing just so highly recommend two thumbs up today on the audiobooks in the recipe section this week i have some news my friend stacy did a huge favor well wasn't even a favor because i didn't ask her just did something really nice for me this week she was in the podcast group on ravelry looking for the recipes and through the recipes and she noticed that in each recipe i have what entry number in the thread it's linked in so if you want to go and look up a recipe then it'll say that the actual recipe is in thread or entry number 27 or whatever and they have to go over to 27 then you have to copy and paste it so while she was in there she made a link behind every recipe or turned each recipe title into an actual link so you could just click on it which is so nice because i was never going to take the time to go back to episode 42 but these are all the recipes that are listed in the ravelry group and then um now there is a link to take you um to the recipe so that you can just navigate that a little more quickly thank you stacy that was really really really nice of you um and speaking of telling stories about may may was a good cook and so i'm going to share a may recipe today and it is in this little keeper because this is the one that she had sent to me and um amber you have to call me and tell or when we talk next tell me um where i get this made into a little piece of wood um there is a uh place that will take a piece of wood and put your recipe on it and this is in may's handwriting and so i would like to have that happen but this is a recipe for may's meatballs and nothing i have ever made has ever been quite as good as hers even using the recipe but it makes a huge batch and she always made them for the girls so in our family ross's brother has two girls and we have a girl and then um that was all there were so there are no boys in the family um and so we would always say the girls because it's the three grandchildren um but five pounds of ground beef and three quarters of a pound of ground fresh pork and then in a large bowl two eggs um tight slices tear up three slices of white bread no crust add a half a cup of milk stir add meat sprinkle two teaspoons of salt a teaspoon of pepper a half a teaspoon of nutmeg a half teaspoon of allspice stir well then knead like a bread dough add a quarter pound of melted butter stir i forgot add and then she writes this which i just think is so charming i forgot add two medium chopped fine onions fry in oil and margie margarine margie till brown a little bacon oven with creamed soups in the bottom of a baking pan bake for 300 300 to 350 for about three quarters of an hour to an hour it makes 50 meatballs and it is delicious and she wrote on the back it can be cut in half for smaller amounts so i will put that out there this week and we should probably have it at my house too we should probably have meatballs um but and i think she usually used whatever cream soup she had on hand so like cream of mushroom or cream of celery cream of chicken what i think but i have just used the grease in the bottom of the pan to just make kind of a roux and make my own gravy like a brown gravy to pour in the bottom of that pan um so if you're not a fan of cream soups or you don't have cream soups in the house it's certainly not necessary to make it with cream soups first is delicious though i don't know what she does to make it so good but her meatballs are always just top notch so there's your recipe of the week this week i have a couple of little tips this week and one that i forgot to tell last time but i have had this sitting on my dining room table for a while now and i just wanted to show it i got it on amazon and if you like stickers you you need to get this little book because it has these great stickers in it and there are like five or six pages of really nice quality the paper is really nice stickers all about knitting aren't they cute so i got it on amazon i think it cost me two dollars so add it to your cart sometime i love knitting stickers and i looked and it was still available out there and then another thing i purchased was this little tapestry needle look at me looking through the bottom of my glasses still folks i will get new glasses and i will be able to see better things will get better here on the podcast i have to take this out boy did you see my thumbs work there i really had to grip this is a ball of yarn with needles and then when you open it up look what you get isn't that cute yeah i love that five different needles and a little keeper by tulip i think and i got this at church mouse yarn online i added it to an order for some yarn i was ordering came like this i don't know if you can get it at other places but super cute there you go let's do the shawl of the week the shawl this week is spring awakening by paulina popiolek popiolik and it came out in may of 2011. i knit it shortly after that there are 84 projects but it is in 500 people's cues so it's very popular it is knit with a u.s size 5 and a size 8 needle and it is in fingering weight yarn and the reason that i chose to knit this shell at the time because it was a bottom up shawl so you cast on all the stitches along the bottom and you do this bottom feather and fan changing colors or not you could do it in one color but most of most of people did it in two colors or um more it takes 1290 yards so for the big version so the three skeins is necessary spring awakening is a crescent shaped shawl knit from the bottom up in sock weight yarn it features garter stitch body with a wide lace border i have used two different colors and yarns to achieve distinct wave effect the shawl can be easily customized to any size all directions are in the pattern oh look at this it says right here picture shows two versions large versions uses 2.25 skeins 900 meters and the smaller version uses 50 grams 75 grams and then for the medium size i have used 113 grams and 105 grams of two different yarns the pattern is written and charted all explained how to use charts in notes it is important to read them there you go okay so there's the bottom and then here's the top and then it kind of has this top edge here that is goes like this yep so you are knitting back and forth and every row you do it's getting smaller and smaller and smaller which is really a nice concept for a shawl if you've never done one this way before i highly recommend giving it a try yes it is a lot of stitches to cast on yes the rows are long at first but then it just gets smaller and smaller and then when you get up into this purple section you're starting to do short rows and you're going back and forth back and forth until you get up into this top section where you're doing um little or short rows so i think that the the pattern the lace pattern is just stunning i do like put purple and green together quite a bit and this bottom part is is super simple right feather and fan which you've all probably done before a repeat of six increases and then six decreases and then six increases and then six decreases is usually how it goes and then you just have a little garbage stitch right here and then this up here in the original pattern is all garter but if you know me well you know i'm not a fan of garter stitch i just i just don't like the way it looks you can love garter stitch i have no problem with that but i decided to do the top in stockinette which meant that i had to do a little fudging on the short rows to get that that top edge to kind of um become flat the first time i did it it it was getting a hump in it and i had to rip back and and fix it and do a few more decreases because you know garter stitch in height is different than stockinette stitch um so i just had to to do a little bit but that's spring awakening and we're going into spring and so it's i think it's just the perfect time to talk about shawls and getting shawls on the needles let's do the sweater of the week it's really working out so funny because i've done these in just a random order i mean i did them alphabetically but occasionally things got out of order and to have the fact that we're doing this green shawl today and then this fisherman's sweater which is kind of apropos to ireland and the irish and the ocean and the uk and i i don't know scotland and fisherman's sweaters it just seemed clever it had nothing to do with that so this sweater is my i was knit 100 years ago and i still love it um it is called the plates knots and crosses tunic by kathy payson it is from the book knitting the new classics which was done by kristen nicholas so it was a collaboration of of a bunch of designers putting that book together and the the book contains 41 patterns came out in 1995 and it is available on amazon for 9.97 and used you can get it for 43 cents so if you like love this sweater or you love looking at patterns and you want to go out and look up knitting the new classics and see what other patterns were you know included in that book with kristen nicklaus you certainly you know could could look at that and then if you're an amazon shopper at all and you want to look at the used books you could get the book for 50 cents and i think the shipping was like three dollars so the book um the the pattern is available the individual pattern is not available on ravelry it was taken down and i don't know if that was done by the designer or because it was part of the book but there is no individual pattern um page there's a picture of um the pattern on someone so it it's a little weird but um there are not a lot of projects for this because of course this was so many years pre-ravelry that even if someone was take you know took took a picture of it they they had nowhere to post it back in the day um i don't think i knitted until we moved back to minnesota from virginia when kylie was eight and so and kylie was born in 97 and so i'm going to say that it would have been the book would have been maybe 10 years old even when i knit the pattern but that the pattern holds up over time you can see we've got a traditional diamond pattern here throughout the whole sweater with the cross in the middle and then it is a dropped shouldered sweater which would be very traditional but easy to knit so that means that you're just working all you know straight up and the um the sleeves are just sewn on here on along the outside it's just a flat i'm hoping that you can all see that and um so it's very traditional in its makeup and it doesn't have a lot of panels like a lot of the other fisherman's knits that i've seen that have panels of cables and things this is just kind of what i would call a classic style it was knit with classic elite yarns cambridge um when it came out which was an errand weight but it was knit at a worsted gauge 20 stitches to 4 inches in double seed stitch ribbing the cambridge that it was originally knitted was 75 cotton and 30 wool so it wasn't a traditional wool sweater but i'm pretty sure i knit mine in like galway or cascade just something standard um it takes 1360 to 1530 yards and comes in sizes 40 44 48 and 52. so i do think it was considered a unisex pattern at the time that it could be worn by men and women which is why it went up to size 52. um i just thought i would bring it as if you have never knit anything in fisherman's style of sweater there are lots of shetland sweaters out there that are kind of traditional that don't have color work i did do a little research on why i'm not using the word gansey in this situation um or guernsey fisherman's jumpers and this is what i found the gansey is a unique type of jumper traditionally worn by fishermen they are knitted with five ply worsted wool in one piece with no seams and so since this one was knit in three pieces and was seamed i thought well it's not a traditional gansey or guernsey which we're often knit with long five long double pointed needles i'm certainly not an expert in this and i could you could do a lot more research than what i have done but i did find a wikipedia article called the erin jumper so here's some information the errand jumper is a style of jumper that takes its name from the erin islands off the coast of ireland a traditional erin jumper usually is off-white in color with cable patterns on the body and sleeves originally the jumpers were knitted using unscoured wool that retained its natural oils lanolin which made the garments water resistance and meant they remained wearable even when wet use of the word jumper or other options such as pullover and jersey is largely determined by the regional version of the english used in the case of ireland britain and australia jumper is the standard word whereas sweater is mainly found in tourist shops and in north america the jumper usually features four to six texture patterns each of which is about five to 10 centimeters in width they move down the jumper in columns from top to bottom usually the patterns are symmetrical to a center axis extent extending down the center of the front and the back panel so read up on on fisherman's knit aaron knit you know aaron gansey's um all that kind of thing but back in the day that's the experience i wanted to have i wanted to have an all-over patterned sweater that um was really the shape of a sweatshirt and so it's they're it's highly wearable i'm sure that there are patterns out there where people have incorporated yoke construction or a raglan construction instead of kind of that drop shoulder look if you're looking for something a little more modern but i still wear this occasionally i i do like it quite quite a bit it um like i have a sense of pride about an all-over sweater like that i think when you wear it you feel like you're wearing something historical so yeah that's the sweater of the week i have some special notes and things i have to tell you this week and the first one is that i got hacked last week on the youtube podcast underneath the co in the comments um a gentleman i believe took it upon himself to grace us with his biblical verses from the quran and many of you got those quotes underneath your comments and i don't know if it was a bot that just went in and did over and over and over so that so many of you got them but i just wanted you to know that i did not put them there it looked like this um so it was written in um whatever the language is and that it was kind of translated it was from alham lida 21 i reported it repeatedly on youtube and blocked the user on my site but um it started out with to turn ye to our lord in repentance and so um it was uh inappropriate for some of you to receive that and i apologize for that um just know that i didn't see it right away and if you should ever get something like that would you please reach out to me via email or um and text or let me know somehow if you're a friend of mine if you see those out there that they can be deleted remember i had that guy for a while that wanted a red knit turtleneck and these things happen sometimes i just hope that no one was offended or or thought that i had posted um something really religious and weird um in all of my comments over and over and over again um i did reach out to some of you and let you know but then it got to be kind of onerous i was like wow these are everywhere i just need to get them down i just need inside to go to into each comment and take it off and and block it and report it so just wanted to to let you know about that um and then last week when i showed the new taco tuesday patterns thank you some of you you're so nice to um be kind to me about my quirky nature and some of the things that i knit and um and do um but someone who wrote it to me it's really cute uh frog and fool commented she said two fun forget tuesday taco 2021 made my day i was like yes to all the tacos all in all the different ways on a little announcement that i have to make i am teaching at knit and escape and so uh i had applied to teach um for them in february and in some weird way shape or form they had lost my submission and i had reached out to christy and said you know i didn't hear back one way or the other it's fine if if you know i didn't make the cut um and she was like i don't think we ever got anything from you and i was like well yeah i sent it in december i sent all my submissions and then they went back and they saw it and then they felt really bad and then they hired me for their april uh retreat that they're having so i am teaching on april 8th in the afternoon um like two to four three to five and then in the evening six to eight or seven to nine something like that it's all eastern standard time so i have to convert it for central for myself but i am teaching that first day it is being called the unbirthday party because it is christy's birthday i believe on the 8th and the retreat goes from the 8th the 9th and the 10th i am teaching in the afternoon my fixer upper class which is a class where i encourage people to bring problem knits to class and then i troubleshoot how to fix them so if you have a sweater that doesn't fit if you have a neckline that is ill-fitting if you have a button band that didn't work out correctly um if your sleeves are too long all those things you bring that item to class normally and we would take a look at it and i would lay it out on the table and then i would provide some type of solution or two something i can come up with and other people also can chime in and say oh i had the exact same problem or whatever um i will also have some tips and tricks that i will bring to that class and some of them will be things that i've talked on the podcast before um but that is the first class called fixer upper we'll be going over how to fix things that have gone horribly wrong and then the second class i think i'm teaching in the evening the i might have these two reversed but is latvian braids latvian horizontal braids we will cast on the choose your own path hat from the minnesota 52 book that has the corrugated ribbing and the latvian braid in it i will be going over the vickle braid from the easiest cable hat ever and cory's two color cast on in that class so they're both two hour class sessions all done on zoom um all done virtually but i was i was happy that they asked me to do it although i felt bad because i thought that maybe they were just asking me because they had misplaced my item my submission and you know didn't didn't really make the cut in the first place anyway you know you don't want to push yourself out on people but if you are wanting to do that registration is open now i have not i have no idea how registration is going whether or not the classes are open or closed they have a ton of teachers and a ton of activities and it's not just knitting like you can do a lot of other things um take classes in a lot of other areas i had someone reach out to me in the last two weeks about the pump up the plaid blanket pattern and was concerned because there was a what she thought was a mistake in the pattern and it was a typo in the color numbers contrast color one two three and four so if you purchased the pump up the plaid blanket and you have not printed it out or you have started knitting it um just know that there was an update to that pattern and that the numbers it should it should be very obvious when you get to it and i have to i'd have to remember but it's like on page three maybe and it says contrast color one two three and four instead of main color contrast one two three see the difference we had switched the way we were talking about the the colors in the pattern and most patterns would be written as a main color and then additional colors not that all the colors have a number one two three before and we missed changing it out there so i just wanted to put that out here there they here because i know a lot of you bought that pattern might not have started knitting it might not you know might look and then might reach out to me and say hey i think this is a mistake and we caught that um early on so just check your updates on ravelry or if you didn't get it on ravelry know that um when you get to that part you just change it contrast color one should be the main color and then the other three colors and you've you've been you've already been knitting at that point when you when that happens and so i think most of you will be like oh i get what happened here i have a new design this week designed this week designed this week uh this is the second to last one i have one more uh new design coming which is an updated older pattern oh i just uncovered something that i want to show and this is an updated older pattern but one that many of you will not have ever seen before or have ever heard of so i am excited to share and many of you have gotten my newsletter if you are not on my newsletter list over on irocknits.com about halfway down on the left hand side is the subscribe box you put in your name and your email address and i will send you a coupon code every time i put out a new pattern so this pattern is on sale for the next few days i think the code is blanky i think and it is a blankie this is my new baby kiki pattern this is a pattern that i wrote many years ago called baby kiki k-e-e-k-e-e um and it is a miniature baby blanket it is the baby's carry around blanket you knit it with the softest yarn that you can find this one is a christening one and it is got little crosses in each corner but this is just lovely it is knit in two weights worsted weight and sport weight this one has little hearts up in the corner each of the corners those are optional it has a seed stitch edge and the if the blankets are about 16 by 16 or 17 by 17. um here's one this one has um a b c d around the the four corners so that starts in the bottom there's a it is also optional to put the little ribbing holes or the little eyelet holes around the outside so if you want to put the eyelet holes they they're written in there but if you don't want to you don't have to i really like putting the really soft satiny ribbon in there because i think little toddlers love to touch that little satin ribbon right and it just pulls out pretty easily for this original sample was knit in debbie bliss baby cash merino it's really soft it doesn't have anything in the corners and it just has the ribbon and you could do it in a baby's nursery colors the quote that i used on this blanket is one who sleeps under knitted blankets is comforted by love and little paragraph that i wrote as romance copy for the beginning page of the blanket is many parents through the years have lamented the fact that their toddlers drag around a hand-knit baby afghan as their favorite nap and bedtime snuggly however all this dragging around makes for a stretched out often dirty and whole filled mess because the size is just too big here is my solution a much smaller soft blanky thus kiki that a parent can use as a small cover in infancy but the child can then travel with throughout the toddlerhood you can adorn with a satin ribbon around the edges for an even prettier presentation these kikis are also well used for a preemie and the pattern is written for two gauges worsted and sport so there you go baby kiki i think the pattern is on sale for two dollars for the next few days um and then it goes up to regular uh six dollar pattern but if you're looking for those charts they are on the last page of the pattern perfect they are great for throwing over the baby's head or body in a car seat when they're a newborn or in an infant seat when they're little and then as they grow it just can become you know their wobbie their blanky their kiki whatever your child grandchild um wanted to call it amber took the new pictures we use some of the old blankets and then the new blanket for um this one is i think this is the softest the white one oh yeah it's really soft it's got this blue little ribbon here in it um the little images that go in the corner are all the same size so they can be swapped out for one another and there's a duck and a train and a heart and um abc and a cross and there's just a bun i'd say maybe i did eight or nine little charts of things that you can put in the corners of of the blanket if you want to otherwise it gives you a great cast on number a seed stitch edge and you can just knit a blanket and you can you know take the idea and just run with it um because it's much much faster to knit this for a baby shower right a last minute baby gift than to take on a baby blanket i would like all of you to raise your hands if you have a baby blanket in a bag somewhere that never got finished for a baby gift or you finished it years later or the child is about to graduate from high school and it never got finished right so these are just that perfect size um it's you know simple to knit easy to knit so baby kiki is now on sale on etsy ravelry my website as well as love crafts another thing that i did finish up this last week and i posted it um was that i finished the color work owl sweater and i did i decided that the red yarn just was not going to be a thing and so i ripped back the one sleeve that had run out of the red and i just put the band on a short sleeve sweater the sweater does not fit me well um i can't get the one sleeve on because the sleeve is too tight i did everything i knew to make it bigger without having to rip the whole sweater back and the sweaters knit from the top down so it meant taking back all that color work and i did the button bands in the same color work and had just enough of the red yarn to finish that up so it is it's going to be a great sample it is not something that i can wear because the one sleeve is just super tight but if you come to my classes in the future and you have really skinny little arms you could try this on because this one just does not stretch it's very very tight but it turned out cute i think really cute still in short sleeved so that's the knit kahoot sweater that had been on the needles for years it was part of the prototype for the first sweater i ever knit and then obviously it had some trouble and i just decided that yes i wanted it done so i finished it up i finished another project this week and i um this was in from my whip pile too so i also laid this in with the owl uh sweater on the on the table because the pattern was written for leg warmers mitts a cowl maybe a hat a bunch of different projects it was pages and pages long and then you had options for how often you wanted to make the chevron and how many different colors you wanted to do the chevron in so there were probably two three or four pages of charts of different options and it was overwhelming to decide which one you wanted to choose right how this is called the flying these cow by lee meredith who is lethal knits and it says a big chunk of sales will be donated to an organization doing good somewhere in the world click to my designer page to find out where current sales will be going the cowl is part of a pattern set for finglersmits mittens leg warmers and a cowl all in your choice of chevron block stranded color work patterns this came out in november of 2012. i bought the yarn for it at the time and you're just carrying your color the whole way so there's long repeats 16 stitches in between that you have to trap your floats and you don't want to trap them all in the same place so you know the back side is turns out not being super pretty um like some things just kind of a hot mess it was fun to knit once i got going once i figured out what my color striping was and what you know what i wanted to do with it these colors were the ones that were used in the pattern let's do cory stories here i have a story for you guys this week so last saturday i decided that i wanted to knit something super simple and easy to do and i have seen this scarf up at b woolen our local our new local yarn store in the twin cities and it was called the 10 and 2 scarf t-e-n and t-w-o and they had a sample in the shop and at the time i took a picture of the sample and it was a speckled skein of yarn and a uh variegated skein of yarn and with mohair and dk weight alternated and it was like in ribbing this is called unicorn giggles by knitted wit and so i came over to my shelves notice how they've been artfully rearranged and i wanted to pull this out and i just wanted to get it cast on so that i would have a take with me project for on the go or for in the car um or whatever and so i pulled out this skein of mole hair and then i started looking for the coordinating skein i remembered that the skein the the two the two skeins matched they really coordinated and i really liked that one and i couldn't find the dk weight skein to coordinate with this and i was like well this is ridiculous now if you'll remember these shelves were really full up there are three shelves here it goes all the way up and um and they're always full and they're all my single skeins they're they're skeins i bought that don't go with anything else mostly um or you know two skeins together that are the same but all my other yarn is put away in shoe boxes sterilite plastic shoe boxes or tubs in two gallon plastic ziploc bags all my sweaters quantities are all put away in two closets so these are just like the extras so if you thought that this was all i had bless you but i'm looking and looking and eventually i get frustrated so sunday i get up and um i'm doing some work and i think i didn't put that yarn away that was on kind of on the dining room table so i came out and i just took almost all of it down and i started laying it out and i have a picture of the mess that was this table and then i got it in my mind that i have too much yarn and i wanted to just get rid of like half of it like i just there were a lot of skeins of yarn in these shelves that i didn't purchase myself that were given to me at knitting retreats that i had won as prizes or often when i go to teach there will be a goodie bag or they will give you a skein of yarn when you arrive as a as a gift and a lot of times those yarns are lovely but they're not things you chose yourself right and so there you don't have a attachment to them you're not going to knit with them right away and i started kind of sorting by color and kind and i was getting all these greens just so weird another reason this is weird story this week but it's getting all these greens piled up over on this side of the table and i was like wow i just got a lot of these like army greens not even kelly greens not really bright greens and um and there were some oranges and rusts too because i have quite a bit of that but you know this is these are mostly what i would have considered previously to be fingering weight sox gains and what was happening was they were all like random skeins of wursted and then there were two or three sweaters quantities in there that i obviously had never put away and i just stuck on the shelf and so i started and started and started and i never came up with the matching skein for this like i i never came up with it and i was really frustrated and i i left i i started bagging up to give to my library knitters a bunch of the yarns that i just knew i wasn't going to get to first right like these are they're beautiful yarns but they're just things i'm not going to get to and they are knitting hats for charity this year um and so and they're all trying different hats it's been really fun to watch um so i thought i'll just put together a bag or two for them and see if any of them want any of it and they were meeting for the first time this week in the driveway um many of them had them have been vaccinated and uh we had beautiful weather and so they were gonna meet and so i called and said does does somebody want to stop by and pick up you know this yarn so she did and she took it uh to the group and it felt so good it just felt so great but it led to me attempting to go into the closets and find skeins of yarn that did not belong there were not matched up with anything and um yeah i i it became this huge do you know how when you're working on a project and becomes bigger than when you first started yeah that's what happened to me and i was frustrated that i couldn't put my hands on it and i thought why are you even looking you have so much design work to do why are you spending all this time looking for skeins of yarn that you don't need you have other things you could certainly cast on but i started putting away the sweaters quantities into two gallons of black bags and then i ran out of ziploc bags so then i had to order more you know it this you know what happened um and so finally on monday i was i was getting stuff put back and i wasn't coming up with it and i then i got down to like the the last little things right the things you have to take care of but they don't they're not where they belong and it's like you've cleaned out the junk drawer but now you have this pile of things that need to be taken care of and that's where i was at and i was like you know what i'm just going to text angel who oh is one of the co-owners of be woolen and just say hey what what am i looking for because this is what i thought i was looking for not this bright but i thought i was looking for a cream skein with these colors in it by knitted wit right so that's i'm this is what i have what i'm looking for is this cream kind of colored skein and i so i texted her and i said you know i can't find the pattern for one thing which i now found the pattern i found the picture and then and it's a pattern for their shop so i don't think you can get it on ravelry it was uh you know a shop pattern where they were selling the yarn um from knitted wit something that they made up um but you could call them and and buy the pattern probably and the yarn from them um and she got back to me and she's laughing and she goes that was that order is from the first time you came here corey and you bought hot pink dk weight to go with it i wasn't even looking for the right yarn i it was so out of my realm of possibility for what i was looking for to coordinate with this that i didn't even realize but when i used the other skein of this yarn to knit something else up neither then did i realize that i had purchased it to go to go with this ah what a mess that i think that they did not have it in stock at the time now it kind of rings a bell one of my knitter friends says if i remember right they didn't have the coordinating one and you thought oh hot pink will be just as good but i already used up a skein of this and so and and i thanked her profusely for being the yarn shop owner that has to get the crazy questions from the customers right i mean they must just get the rem it was that blue hat that i you know and they're like i do not know what you're talking about she could have just been like sorry corey right like but she took the time and she looked it up and she remembered and got back to me so i have now gone out and purchased from knitted wit the skein of yarn that goes with this it has not arrived yet um because i don't have two of these to make the scarf and i think i really wanted the coordinating skein in the first place but what actually happened then was the seven boxes sterilite cork big cork boxes that have sweaters quantities had to come out of the closet so husband lifted them down because my shoulder has been still bothering me and i sorted by color which they kind of were before so i have an entire box of just yellow and gold sweaters quantities one with just orange and rust and one with just raspberry and one with blue or tealy and it it just opened my eyes to the yarn the amount of yarn that i have and the quality quantity and how much i want to knit and most of those have projects planned for them and i've just taken on 13 new design things for the upcoming year which means i won't be knitting for myself and i won't be knitting um most of that yarn up into sweaters for myself so they're you know i love the yarn and i don't feel bad about it really in the sense that i know i will knit up that yarn someday and but i will be now going through um some more of that and i went into the closet in the office where the littler boxes are with individual stuff and those are alphabetized but i kind of re a lot of it was sitting on the floor of that closet the boxes because i'd take them down and not get them back in the right spot so i put that all back and away and then talked to the husband and i said you know i've really been thinking about moving upstairs to the bonus room which is a room um that was a playroom for kylie when she lived here and she's been gone now for five six seven years something like that you know six years um and my husband's working out of the office he's made that his office which just means he's sitting at the wood table that was in this room with his laptop and but there's a giant closet in that room when we moved into this house that room was unfinished and we um it has a little step down when you walk into it one step down and so we had them carpeted and painted and put in this huge closet so all the toys for her whole you know life could be in there so the legos and the american girl dolls and all that the games and all that could be in there now a lot of that stuff is gone we have cleaned out some of that and now what's in there are a bunch of kylie's high school projects and you know there's poster board in there and some of her purses and bags and backpacks but it's not being used well and all my yarn would fit in there great and i could have i could podcast from up there i wouldn't have to have the dining room full of mannequins and um not that were not that were really entertaining in here so it doesn't really matter but it could and so i talked about that he goes i think that would be a great idea to get it all out of the office and move it upstairs you know you could have a computer up there you could you know kind of shut it up work up there not have to worry about always cleaning everything up and tidying it up so it kind of turned into this project after project we bought this new furniture for the family room we want to get some furniture a new desk for the office we have a credenza and a desk and they have been hard worn the front is all just dinged up from us using it for so many years and and it's a beaut it was a beautiful desk but we didn't spend a lot for it when we started and it would just be nice and i we have outgrown the credenza because it's just full of paperwork and stuff that and mostly bills and that kind of thing and so my files are in plastic boxes like um file boxes two file boxes in there like all my pattern work and then all my file folders so we really just need to you know how that has happened during the pandemic right we're all moving forward in different ways figuring out how we best live in our spaces but yeah if that became a just a stupid problem right where i i just couldn't find the yarn and by wednesday i was like i've been working on this project for days i really need to get some of this design work done and then wednesday hit and it was rainy and cold and i decided i'm going to bake that kamut bread and if you follow me on instagram some of you probably saw that i put up a film of me making kamut bread which is a ancient grain um flower that came from a lady in utah the food nanny i follow her on instagram uh and they have found an organic natural no gmo grain that they make their flour out of and then they manufacture it you can purchase it and it's supposed to be good for people with gluten intolerance but i just wanted to try it so i bought her starter pack which was her book and her whisk and her flower and her salt because she has the french gray salt and uh and i hadn't taken the time to make it and i've had it for about a month at least because i didn't know if i could knead the bread with my thumbs right so i've been kind of waiting and waiting and so i spent the day and i'm not a cute i mean i have made bread many times but not i don't always make yeast spread from scratch and so this is a different technique right you make a sponge first so you don't start with just your yeast and water so you make the sponge and and the sponge was the flour the honey the yeast and the water and then you let it rise a little and then you pour in four more cups of flour so not a difficult recipe but my sponge wasn't really foaming and bubbling or rising but i was like this is new to me so then i did my raise and i punched it down and it never really they never really raised and then they didn't get anywhere in the loaf pans by that time you're several hours in right and you're frustrated and so i'm like i'm just baking it i don't i don't know maybe it'll rise in the oven you know well just shut the door and pray um and it didn't it was flatter than flat and it was like eating raw dough it was just the taste i ate the crust and like the piece um the taste was fine as far as like i i wasn't gonna be offended by the taste of the flower it was just so it just never got to where it should be so i posted cuz i videoed for you guys thinking oh this is gonna be great it's a rainy day and but i think my yeast is bad i mean the bottom line is that's where we've gotten to at this point i've talked to lots of people i reached out um to the food nanny and um i had bought a block of yeast and had it in the cupboard it was new i hadn't opened it but i didn't have it in the fridge and you know yeast is live but it's not refrigerated in the grocery store and my cupboards could have gotten warm we do have under counter lighting you know um but not under that anyway doesn't matter bad bad day the lady called to tell me that um my glasses got broken i called the doctor and said my foot still hurts should my foot still hurt like a seven because it hurts like a seven if i have not walked outside i have not taken walks i i i it still hurts should it hurt this much and the nurse called back the doctor wants to see you and he can't see you till late next week which is going to be well when you see this tomorrow and so i was frustrated because i it's been 13 weeks now it's gonna be 14 weeks where i have not been able to really get up and walk or move around and i'm just i'm feeling really lethargic and frustrated by that i you know it was just like a combination of things that just continued to happen throughout the day where i was just more and more frustrated and my husband and i are still sharing a car which shouldn't be a big deal i should be thankful that we have one car that runs really well but he's restoring his truck and he has been restoring it since october and we've been sharing a car which means one day a week when he goes to work i have no vehicle which is fine except that always initially and ends up to be the one day that you need to run to the post office or you want to go somewhere right it isn't the not having the car it's the knowing that you can't go somewhere when you want to go somewhere and he has been super kind he often drops the dog off at daycare he will often go in the morning to the gas station in town and bring me a pop and put it in the fridge super spoiled so when i get up i have a fountain pop for the day whenever i want to have it but it would it just by the end of the day so many things you know it was crazy i couldn't find the yarn which turned in just a huge mess of yarn like it it just turned into a huge frustrating mess of yarn and then the bread didn't rise and and i'm missing something something else happened and i i can't think of what it is right now but it was it was a bad day i do not always have great stories to tell i mean the stories can be funny but this story um was just stupidity not knowing what you ordered for yourself so i am going to get that yarn in the mail and cast on the ten and two scarf call b willin they they're having a plaid blanket knit along so if you have um wanted to cast on your flat blanket oh go and follow them uh b woolen b-e-w-o-o-l-e-n on instagram because they've been posting pictures of people's blankets and the colors that the people are choosing so that's kind of fun but they are having a knit along if you want to join them or order yarn from them or whatever they've been super supportive of me in this journey and they still have the sample knits up there so that's corey's stories for this week i gave this book for christmas to a number of people and it has a wonderful story and it has been sitting on my coffee table in the family room and i walk by it all the time and i i've just been thinking about it and i thought i don't think i ever talked about it to anybody on the podcast and so if you have never heard or seen um this book before it's just lovely and you can get it you know where all books are sold here's the story when the most recent edition of the oxford junior dictionary widely used in schools around the world was published a sharp-eyed reader soon noticed that about 40 common words concerning nature had been dropped the words were no longer being used enough by children to merit their place in the dictionary the list of these lost words included acorn adder bluebell dandelion fern heron kingfisher newt otter and willow among the words taking their place were attached attachment blog broadband bullet point cut and paste and voicemail the news of these substitutions the outdoor and natural being displaced by the indoor and virtual became seen by many as a powerful sign of the growing gulf between childhood and the natural world in response robert mcfarland and jackie morris set out to make a spell book that would conjure back 20 of these words and the beings they name from acorn to ren by the magic of word and paint they sought to summon these words again into the voices stories and dreams of children and adults alike and to celebrate the wonder and importance of everyday nature you hold that book in your hands a book that has already cast its extraordinary spell on hundreds of thousands of people and begun a grassroots movement to read child to rewild childhood across britain europe and north america so these are 20 of the words i gave a copy of this to macy kyle's college roommate who and kylie who both love words they're huge readers and they love words and i just think it's something that if you love words and you love books or you have children or grandchildren you might want to purchase so i'm going to show you some of the pages because they're just stunning pictures of their kind of watercolor in nature so they're the birds so 20 they did 20 of the words with the pictures so mostly it's a picture book with a little bit of writing so kids can just look through and then you can have them name you know what is this oh that's a lark you know so that they don't lose the word for otter like do we really want to lose the word otter with children and i know they can learn it when they get older but i just i just found this to be so amazing just such a lovely lovely book um i think the cost um maybe 25 ish i'm not quite sure but what they did um let me see if i can find a page okay here's a short one so this page is iv it has a picture of ivy and then it it the letters i v and y are written on the left hand side and then there's a sentence for each of the letters so it says i am ivy a real high flyer via bark and stone i scale tree and spire you call me ground cover i say sky wire so i v y starts the three and that's what they did with all the words all the way through so the the word becomes this visual letters at the beginning of each sentence and then the sentences explain what it is yeah it's it's it's just oh look at this look at this page they're all in the fox so anyway i i carried it into the dining room because i thought i haven't shared it and i shared it with people that i knew would appreciate it and i think some of you will really appreciate knowing about the book of last words um and i came across my it was early in the fall when i first saw it i think i was recuperating for my first thumb surgery and spending a lot of time online when i first saw it so i ordered them early on and then um then i had to have one for myself too so then i went back and ordered another one um and wrapped them up for the girls for christmas so wanted to include that i'm gonna be putting up a second podcast release uh with this one this week and the second one is going to be all about the new little idea i had called knitting exchange so if you want to take the time to take a look at that i'm going to put it up as a separate kind of podcast so that people who are just interested in knowing just about that could go over there and find it i have a giveaway to do this week some of you've been waiting for this whole time for this giveaway to happen and it was just on a slip of paper and is at the very bottom of the stack i have five

dedicated in selfless soldiers in uniform stand ready to deploy and defend our nation's freedoms as we honor captain will Swenson for his actions during the battle with John jiggle we honor the sacred trust that he and his team embodied that day we thank you for the last full measure of devotion given that day the Medal of Honor is draped around captain Swenson may the healing grace of hope and peace rest upon each of us the captain swenson example rekindle in us a spirit of sacrifice and a steadfastness of purpose but this occasion renew our commitment to uphold the right to oppose the wrong and continue to work that has begun so long ago this we ask in praying their Holy Name Amen good afternoon everybody please have a seat on behalf of Michelle and myself welcome to the White House last month the United States Army released a remarkable piece of video it's from the combat helmet cameras of a medevac helicopter crew in Afghanistan and it's shaky and it's grainy but it takes us to the frontlines that our troops face every single day and it's useful to remember that there's still a whole lot of our troops in Afghanistan in harm's way in that video as that helicopter touches down by a remote village you see out of a cloud of dust an American soldier he's without his helmet standing in the open exposing himself to enemy fire standing watch over a severely wounded soldier he helps carry that wounded soldier to the helicopter and places him inside and then emits the whipping wind and the deafening roar of the helicopter blades he does something unexpected he leans in and kisses the wounded soldier on the head a simple act of compassion and loyalty to a brother in arms and as the door closes and the helicopter takes off he turns and goes back the way he came back into the heat of battle you know in our nation's history we have presented our highest military decoration the Medal of Honor nearly 3,500 times for actions above and beyond the call of duty but this may be the first time that we can actually bear witness to a small fraction of those actions for ourselves and today we honor the American in that video the soldier who went back in Captain William Swenson not far away that day was then corporal Dakota Meyer to whom we presented the Medal of Honor two years ago today is only the second time in nearly half a century that the Medal of Honor has been awarded to two survivors of the same battle Dakotah is not here today but I wanted to welcome some of the soldiers and Marines who fought alongside both these men and the families of those who gave their lives that day I want to welcome all of our distinguished guests including members of the Medal of Honor Society whose ranks today grow by one more most of all I want to welcome wills wonderful parents Julian and Carolyn Wells girlfriend Kelsey had a chance to visit with them both Carl and Julia are former college professors so instead of a house full of GI Joes we'll grow up in Seattle surrounded by educational games I'm told that even when low Will was little his mom was always a stickler for grammar always making sure he said to whom instead of to who so I'm going to be very careful today I just had a chance to spend some time with him and I have to say will is a pretty low-key guy his idea of a good time isn't a big ceremony like this one he'd rather be somewhere up in the mountains or on a trail surrounded by cedar trees instead of cameras but I think our nation needs this ceremony today a moments like this Americans like will remind us of what our country can be at its best a nation of citizens who look out for one another who meet our obligations to one another not just when it's easy but also when it's hard maybe especially when it's hard well you're an example to everyone in this city and to our whole country of the professionalism and patriotism that we should strive for whether we wear uniform or not not just on particular occasions but all the time you know for those who aren't familiar with the story of the battle that led will to be here today I want to take you back to that September morning four years ago it's around sunrise a column of Afghans soldiers and their American advisers are winding their way up a narrow trail towards a village to meet with elders but just as the first soldier reaches the outskirts of the village all hell breaks loose almost instantly for Americans three Marines one Navy at the front of the column are surrounded will and the soldiers in the center of the column are pinned down rocket-propelled grenades mortar machine-gun fire all of this is pouring in from three sides as he returns fire will calls for air support but his initial requests are denied will and his team are too close to the village and then will learns that his noncommissioned officer sergeant first class Kenneth Westbrook has been shot in the neck so will breaks across 50 metres of open space bullets biting all around lying on his back he presses a bandage to Kenneth's wounds with one hand and calls for a medevac with the other trying to keep his buddy calm by this time the enemy has gotten even closer just twenty or thirty meters away and over the radio they're demanding the Americans to surrender so will stops treating Kenneth long enough to respond by lobbying a grenade and finally after more than an hour and a half of fighting air support arrives will directs them to nearby targets then it's time to move so exposing himself again to enemy fire will help scary Kenneth the length of more than two football fields down steep terraces to that helicopter and then in the moment captured by those cameras will leans in to say goodbye but more Americans and more Afghans are still out there so will does something incredible he jumps behind the wheel of an unarmed Ford Ranger pickup truck a Marine gets in the passenger seat and they drive that truck as a vehicle design for the highway straight into the battle twice they pick up injured Afghan soldiers bullets whizzing past them slamming into the pickup truck twice they bring them back when the truck gives out they grab a Humvee the marine by will side has no idea how they survived but he says by that time it didn't matter we weren't going to leave any soldiers behind finally a helicopter spots those four missing Americans hours after they were trapped in the open ambush so will gets in another Humvee with a crew that includes Dakota Meyer and together they drive past enemy fighters up through the valley exposed once more and when they reach the village will jumps out drawing even more fire dodging even more bullets but they reach those Americans lying where they fell well and the others carry them out one by one they bring their fallen brothers home scripture tells us the greatest among you shall be your servant captain will Swenson was a leader on that September morning but like all great leaders he was also a servant to the men he commanded to the more than a dozen Afghans and Americans whose lives he saved to the families of those who gave their last full measure of devotion on that faraway field as one of his fellow soldiers later said will did things that nobody else would ever do and he did it for his guys and for everybody on the ground to get them out and that's why after I called will to tell him he'd be receiving this medal one of the first things he did was to invite to this ceremony those who fought alongside him and I'd like all of those who served with such valor alongside we'll both Army and Marines who fought for each other please stand and be recognized thank you we'll also reached out to the families of the four Americans who gave their lives that day to them he wrote and I'm quoting will now we have never met we have never spoken but I would like to believe that I know something about each of you through the actions of your loved ones on that day they were part of a team and you are now part of that team so I would ask the members of this team of the families of first lieutenant Michael Johnson gunnery sergeant Edward Johnson gunnery sergeant Aaron kenefick and hospital 'men third class James Layton as well as the family of Kenneth Westbrook to please stay Kenneth was the soldier will delivered to the safety of that helicopter and after being airlifted out he made it to Walter Reed he started rehab and spent time with his wife Charlene who joins us here today she still remembers the first time she spoke to will when he called from Afghanistan to check in on Kenneth soon after that phone call however Kenneth took a turn for the worse he succumbed to complications from his treatment but I think it's fair to say that Charlene will always be grateful for the final day she was able to spend with her husband and even now a month rarely goes by when will doesn't call her taks checking in with Charlene and her three boys that's the kind of man he is Charlene says about well you don't have to ask Wolfe for help he just knows when to be there for you so well Swenson was there for his brothers he was there for their families as a nation we thank God the Patriots like him are there for us all so well god bless you and all the men that you fought alongside and everything that you've done for us god bless all our men and women in uniform and god bless the United States of America with that I'd like my military to read the citation please the President of the United States of America authorized by act of Congress March 3rd 1863 has awarded in the name of Congress the Medal of Honor to captain William de Swenson United States Army for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty Captain William D Swanson distinguished himself by acts of gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as embedded advisor to the Afghan national board of police task force Phoenix combined security transition command Afghanistan and support of 1st battalion 32nd Infantry Regiment 3rd Brigade Combat Team 10th Mountain Division during combat operations against an armed enemy in Kunar province Afghanistan on September 8 2009 on that morning more than 60 well-armed well-positioned enemy fighters ambushed captain Swanson's combat team as it moved on foot into the village of Ganjgal for a meeting with village elders as the enemy unleashed a barrage a rocket-propelled grenade mortar and machine gun fire captain Swanson immediately returned fire and coordinated and directed the response of his Afghan border police while simultaneously calling in suppressive artillery fire and aviation support after the enemy effectively flanked coalition forces captain Swenson repeatedly called for smoke to cover the withdrawal of the forward elements surrounded on three sides by enemy forces inflicting effective and accurate fire captain Swenson coordinated air assets indirect fire support and medical evacuation helicopter support to allow for the evacuation of the wounded captain Swanson ignored enemy radio transmissions demanding surrender and maneuvered uncovered to render medical aid to a wounded fellow soldier captain Swanson stopped administering aid long enough to throw a grenade at approaching enemy forces before assisting with moving the soldier for air evacuation with complete disregard for his own safety captain Swenson unhesitatingly led a team in an unarmed vehicle into the kill zone exposing himself to enemy fire on at least two occasions to recover the wounded and search for for missing comrades after using aviation support to mark locations of fallen and unit comrades it became clear that ground recovery of the fawn was required due to heavy enemy fire on helicopter landing zones captain Swanson's team returned to the kill zone another time in a Humvee captain Swanson voluntarily exited the vehicle exposing himself to enemy fire to locate and recover three fallen Marines and one fallen Navy corpsman his exceptional leadership and stout resistance against the enemy during six hours of continuous fighting rallied his teammates and effectively disrupted the enemy's a soul captain william de Swanson's extraordinary heroism and selflessness above and beyond the call of duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself Task Force Phoenix 1st battalion 32nd infantry regiment 3rd Brigade Combat Team 10th Mountain Division and the United States Army let us pray colonel god we ask your blessing to rest upon AUSA this day we go forth in peace inspired by the actions of courageous and good people they we follow the example set by captain Swenson and his team via people of valor ready when the cause for which we have given our bow bow confronts us going to strength to live through troubled times fill us with grace equal to every need and grant us the wisdom and the will to do justice to love mercy and to walk humbly this we ask and pray in your Holy Name Amen well let me say once again not only to will but all our men and women in uniform who have served us with such incredible courage and professionalism that America is grateful for you to the families of those we've lost we will never forget and will you are a remarkable role model for all of us and we're very grateful for your service we are going to have a reception after this I hear the food's pretty good around here and so I hope all you have a chance to stay and those of you who have a chance to say thank you to will personally obviously that's very welcome I'm going to be exiting with will and Michelle first we'll take a couple of pictures but enjoy yourselves this afternoon god bless america you", "wAzRZ2N2S-Q": "hey guys you here products today we're going to talk about fishing growing with fishes uh hey it looks like uh uh tanner stewart's joined us i appreciate it uh dane howard has joined us waiting on uh dylan here let me make sure he's got his link i think we still have a few minutes uh marty do you want to run a giveaway here for mammoth p or uh yeah do mammoth people all right sure anybody who wants mammoth shout out on chat yeah it was great to talk to murray for a little bit i guess it's always a lot of fun to talk to nobody wants man with pete huh oh you're probably not caught up to live yet you gotta remember there's a delay yeah i forget how stuart farms over there pretty good man we're uh hey why don't you why don't you introduce yourself here while we're we're getting everything sorted here all right on um i'm tanner stewart uh founder of uh stuart farms a uh soon to be vertical but currently uh single layer uh aquaponically driven farm uh we're on the uh far east coast here i can give you a visual aid here this is new brunswick on the east coast of maine or sorry yeah just just north of maine on the far east coast this is our big huge building which we are not at all barely in we've developed ten thousand square feet of the uh facility so far but here i i i gotta get a map ready see so here's where we are this is maine we're six hours north of boston on the i-95 and i can zoom right in i don't know if you guys see a leg on your end oh here oh i'm going the wrong way there we go there we go so this is our four phase project here and this gives a the representation of how much of that building that we're actually in so it's actually this this little area right here that i'm running my nose on we're we're in our first phase is about 10 000 square feet of our entire facility so we're moving our we got our tilapia in the system right now we're using tilapia black nile tilapia specifically and uh yeah that was an adventure getting the getting the fish in the farm but no things are going good you know we just took down our first two crops uh steve's steve and murray since we got licensed that's just the last two weeks actually because we got licensed april 13th so we brought down uh mandelbrot's royal and uh girl scout uh girl scout cookies and uh they're looking good smelling good we got a big outdoor crop we're bringing down here right now but it's uh it's getting cold here on the east coast but we're getting some uh some some of these vinos might not make it all right um bean why don't you go ahead and introduce yourself i'm a little bit quiet i'm not sure oh can you hear me now yeah hey guys uh wayne howard of vertical farms located out here in small town of quorum oklahoma we're just a little ways south of muskogee anybody knows where that one is uh we operate about 20 000 square feet of facility between two separate buildings uh doing we have both of those are hybrid greenhouses so poly types and cops we're running deep water culture aquaponics in one of them and then the second one we're working on bringing aquaponics online up there currently it's being fed with a uh irrigated with our aquaponic water off that dwc but we're working on that's the big project right now is shifting that more and more towards aquaponic heavy all right hopefully that shifts the view so everybody can see it and do the whole uh brady bunch uh view here uh we also have uh uh meewasin farms who's been a really awesome contributor to our facebook group and uh some really amazing cannabis on a regular basis that he's showing off over there so thanks for joining us why don't you go ahead and introduce yourself thanks steve uh yeah i'm dylan with me lawson farms and yeah thanks for having me that news has been an awesome uh i'm dylan well i know i know who you are i said that's your name sorry the your farm name or oh you want what me lawson farms did you just come up with that or has it been that for a while and i just don't pay attention uh it's been that for a while but it's more so just uh like the youtube channel name gotcha uh but then i'll be doing some consulting work for other micros and possibly license producers in the future and then once i do get into the uh legal framework with health canada for producing for stores i'll be able to to do direct farm to retail sales in saskatchewan just the way the the regulations are set up here we're allowed to do that already yeah it should be good and deep cut his picture is the aquaponic cannabis growers uh group picture so when you guys come and check it out like i know you're going to come check out the aquaponic cannabis brewers group you'll see his lovely picture framed up so well there of his fish and his plants and everything all lined up there so we appreciate you letting us use your picture there no problem thank you that was a fun it was a fun contest yeah we did a contest for people to submit their crow and uh his the angle on his and everything is just sweet so that's a good pic and then we also know near the end of flowering too how you going oh awesome we also have liam keys who's going to be joining us again as well so uh to answer questions so i really appreciate it yeah thanks for uh let me join the panel here look forward to answer some of these questions and if you're just catching this uh this talk and you haven't seen uh the other one yet i definitely go check out his other talk a little bit earlier today uh where he gave us a really awesome tour of his facility both future and present so really cool to see all the things that he's been doing so um i thought we could start off with a couple of questions from chat and then uh and then if you guys had any questions you guys want to throw on the floor um we just felt like it'd be cool to get a bunch of um commercial producers uh together and um kind of answer some questions from from the crowd we actually did a similar event with most of the same panel on the future cannabis project a couple months ago and it was a really a lot of fun and a lot of people enjoyed it so we figured close the conference with something equally as cool so we thought uh it went over really well so we we get a do it again so we'll start off here is uh what's the most common problems you're running into when running commercial facilities um i'll uh whoever wants to go first can grab that one well i i can uh i can just talk about like while we're turning on our facility uh right now so so like i said we got our license april 13th so we're on month you know five roughly of of uh getting our rooms turned on and rolling and uh you know we're also deep into uh pheno hunting uh you know we've got a significant genetic library and uh we've got four flower rooms that we're turning on and uh we're kind of doing a combination of uh running our key base strains you know two of which are royal cushion and girl skill cookie uh but also we've got another couple rooms that were that were pheno hunting in and you know like starting up any farm or any company it's really uh you know trying to trying to plan your your process flow uh ahead and you know and holding your mom and veg stock and deciding quantities uh of of uh of mother plants that you're trying to keep for certain strains and you know planning you know uh we're gonna run these two strains you know in room number three in four weeks but then you know actually we're going through it right now right we we let one of our uh strains in half of our room you know we let it go for nine and a half weeks right so that threw off our uh our whole schedule held some held some uh veg material back in our room uh we had another instance where um uh we popped you know we popped 200 seeds across uh across six different strains and uh you know we're working with university here right now and we decided to let them do our sex testing and we're trying to get set up because like we're quite research driven and uh you know they took three weeks longer than we had thought they would take to get the sex test done and that really messed us up so now we've got uh you know we you know because we need to kill half of them right if we shouldn't we should have cloned them uh like a week and a half ago and uh we had to help hold them for a week and a half longer and plus half of them are males and we know that right so we had to so we didn't want to clone a week and a half ago oh sorry um and uh clone double the amount of uh of plants just because because we would have been cloning half of those uh as males so i mean you know really scheduling you know uh you know building a schedule and thinking you're going to stay on that and and just dealing with the reality of uh of all these different uh you know miscellaneous issues that pop up so that's kind of the fun uh that we're working on timing is always you know it's always a [ __ ] just like you were saying all it takes is that one little thing you know like you've got a couple of plants that got to hang out in that room a little bit longer or maybe not a couple but a significant couple of streams or you know you have something that hangs out in a room longer than it's supposed to and it just throws everything off moving forward your bedroom gets too crowded and you don't have a place to put them and you know they're just i would say that's one of the more challenging things i guess i don't look at it i always kind of look at it in order like they're they're asking you know what are the common ones you run into well the first one you run into is getting licensing the second one you get you run into is getting set up and then it's like you know it's like for me it's more uh like in order of things as opposed to like a menu of them um so i i totally relate with what you're saying about the timing aspect of it especially um when you're when you're trying to get into production not just stay in production trying to get the production i feel like is even more challenging than staying on track which is challenging enough as it is yeah i think you really hit the nail on the head there really uh getting a solid plan together you can do all you can to to get your timeline mapped out just right you know these ones are going to follow these ones through this room we're going to get our deep clean in and then on to the next thing uh but consolidating that with real life and then being able to adjust on the fly when those inevitable things pop up whether it's you know a little issue with tests or nutrient things that got you hung up for a few days and just that little lag it puts in the fallout that that has to your whole schedule being able to adapt and with that on the fly is is really key being the crew that's uh doing deep water culture and using a coho salmon water to grow cannabis that has been uh quite an adventure and a big challenge for us uh we currently our knowledge with only a group that uh has done that in that way and we've called around for all kinds of advice in certain aspects mainly around nutrients what you're going to be lacking how to filter your system and uh we've really had to learn firsthand through some trial and error and obviously uh doing it as smartly as we possibly can and always being on your toes because one day somebody will leave a valve on and you start losing water or a pump gets clogged that's say it's seven o'clock at night time and now you gotta spend the next five hours fixing that pump making sure that uh all your salmon stock is safe and your cannabis production is safe i would say in my experience the single hardest part of it is licensing and dealing with all the bs involved with licensing after licensing in terms of day-to-day challenges i would say just making sure that [Music] employee biosecurity and employees not 100 of the time making sure everything is is the way it should be and that causing bios and not not even intentionally i'm talking about accidents like it's the end of the day and they realized oh [ __ ] i left a hose on and they run in real quick and brakes brake protocol from their car just to go turn that hose off and didn't go put their gear on and didn't go through the whole nine um and and stuff like that or people being a little too willing to take in um the cut of the month uh and the popular strain right now from a source that maybe they know um they shouldn't have gotten it from or maybe they they they got a strain and they they normally don't even take in strains but they broke it just because they're trying to carry this popular one um or the other one i see a lot of problems with is people running their clone space is way too hot um if you you know those clones need to be no higher than 75 fahrenheit if you're running a much warmer than that you're going to have problems it's going to screw up your routing uh you know that's that's kind of the upper end um but i think that's probably the the stuff i see when i walk in and i see just super commonly um that and then the other one i see is mosaic virus i think i see that all the time where you have some kind of uh you know weird weird issue going on or weird uh you know very obvious uh insect and you know one insect infection or maybe rusted certain mosaic somewhere in the grow uh a super common last year with septoria um but now i guess everyone's traded enough cuts in oklahoma to in fact at least one strain in their their mom room with mosaic now so i've said i've taken so many pictures this year of mosaic it's crazy but at least we have uh people like medicinal genomics that are making assays where we can actually learn what we're doing on that stuff and uh was it um what's the other one for um for viral testing i'll think of it anyways idea idea.com now that's the other one for viral testing they have test strips uh if you're trying to id that stuff so the next question uh in chat here all right um how are we operating our systems uh the last system is a little bit different um i myself do mostly dual route zone aquaponics my preference is to do media beds and to do uh you know two to four or maybe even eight on 100 foot run if possible and then doing dual root zone pots and that and again to have that level of nutrient control i can you know really accelerate the the growth of individual strains and side by side uh and especially like marty was saying when you're trying to you know pheno hunt and figure out the right nutrient regimens once you've found a good pheno you can run you know a whole bunch of side-by-sides uh really rapidly in a single run and really dial them in a short period of time so these are some of the advantages again that and not only that i find that you when just through testing that it gives you a pretty big increase in terpenes at least me personally um now that other people have found other ways to do mineralization and stuff and had really great results as well it doesn't mean that you can't achieve it but for me it's the way that i've found is the easiest to control and then the easiest way for me to get people that have are used to soil or cocoa or something else to convert to and and succeed with because it's it's something that's that's kind of familiar to what they're used to and it's easier for them to transition to on a commercial scale and they feel more comfortable with at least in my personal experience i don't know who wants to jump in next something pretty similar dual route zone aquaponics and media bags i guess right now what i'm working on is kind of what steve was just talking about i'm first trying to dial in nutrients i guess more in terms of how much potassium how much phosphorus do i really need in those different systems inside an aquaponics system because i think we have enough evidence to show that you know compared to other methods of growing we can use fewer amounts of nutrients so i'm trying to figure out what what ratios work the best and i can only grow 12 plants at a time so dual root zone really allows me to be able to dial each one in per system okay can you view that i'm getting a little bit of an echo oh my god oh so good so yeah in uh because i can dial in the soil mix and keep it isolated for each dual root zone pot uh inside one i can have 12 12 different variations or more like a control in variations of a single strain or multiple strains if i want to do more than one so right now i'm trying to keep my my cuts pretty consistent where i only have a couple of them that i'm i'm using to dial in my nutrient profiles for my new system and then once i have that so from the first run i already have target zones for the next one and i'll bury those over the other 12 plants and get that even smaller and then i'll be able to do that inside of a single run so that's the advantage of being able to run them all in a single system but still be able to have different nutrients for each plant if i don't have to run 12 12 tests in order to accommodate the same thing so inside of that same you know two to three month period i can i can test 12 variations instead of one if i was doing a single system with all my plans so um that's kind of been what my focus is and then once i know what base profiles i want to start with for nutrients then i'll start doing phenol hunts with the same nutrient profiles that i already have dialed in so that way i can create my baselines a layer at a time so that that's kind of what i'm currently working on but i'm growing uh indoors primarily i will have an outdoor system next year with the same you know use siphons media beds same type of stuff in a greenhouse but for right now mostly indoors i've got about just under 4 000 watts of ceramic metal halide um that i'm growing in the flower room right now and uh it's about 20 by 20 so that's what i have burning so for uh our system we uh have coho salmon and then we have a decoupled deep water culture system for our flowering and then our propagation we actually uh take water from the coho salmon and uh we just put those in an aerator and that is how we spread our root so all our cultivation is done indoors we have our salmon room and then that water goes down to a treatment room where we're treating the water for the salmon to make sure it stays in the water quality that we need it to and then another process that's treating the water for the flowering room now we are looking to have as minimum inputs as possible so we're doing a lot of water buffering for example to get your potassium your calcium your magnesium actually in the salmon system to maintain the ph and then we're also uh so the ph for the salmon is at a seven and the ph for the plants we keep between a five seven to a six two depending on the stage of growth so for that then we add phosphorus in to bring it down so we're doing a lot of development on how to optimize the living water and there's uh definitely levels to it we've uh had the current system we have operating for a couple years now and uh still refinement to be done we're also currently expanding and we're going to have a six new flower rooms and every flower room will have its own water control so each room will be able to tweak nutrients a little bit say we want to add a little extra magnesium and we'll be able to do that in its own individual sump and then us see what the results are and as well also environment wise we'll be able to you know bring the degrees up by one or two or bring it down at certain times throughout the flower cycle so we're going to get a lot of information quickly compared to what we have been in just the one room we've been operating for the last couple years so we will be able to learn six times faster that's awesome awesome uh who wants to go next and you for whatever reason your sound is not sure what it is her done there we go we could have uh go next place right on um well we're we're um uh currently we're running a uh decoupled decoupled system so we just have a very small uh fish farm to start so we've only got a one metric ton per year uh system uh at this time so we've got uh you know about 500 black nile tilapia in each one of these uh each one of these tanks got a little belt feeder uh up here and of course our drum filter that's our bead filter uh there in the back uh phase two we're going to build out a 17 metric ton uh system so that'll give us ample ample nutrient at this time but uh right now we're just uh top feeding uh so of course we're an indoor we're indoor grow as well so everything we're doing right now is very very research based so not unlike uh you know lane and how he's tweaking tweaking his uh i'm dropping my mic here tweaking in his uh uh deep water culture system in six different rooms um but they're dedicated to deep water culture we're we're actually uh following the footsteps to use steve a bit but we're wide open right so we're saying we're starting with living soil uh top fed with aquaponic water uh then we're going to progress uh to different mediums we actually have a pure carbon char medium that we're going to be running here um probably in the new year we're going to be running that up against a coco coir everything of course will involve being fed with the with the aquaponics water and you know we doing some dual root zone uh stuff as well and then bottom feed versus top feed you know while doing our best not to not to go down useless routes right i mean it's really about really about tweaking tweaking our strain uh to the best to the best of its ability uh what you're looking at here actually was our very first living soil uh test so on the on the left here we've got a soil called crystal cure and this is a really nice formulation it's got uh some carbon char in it uh it's inoculated with a uh with a mushroom tea which i really really liked uh it's more a lot more of a peat base uh as well so we didn't top these plants a whole lot this was our very first run so we kind of went with a single coal a plant uh this is the royal kush is what you're looking at here but you can see a drastic drastic difference between uh just really the thickness and the undergrowth in the canopy here on the crystal cure and of course uh uh you know it's not nearly as nutrient deficient and then you can see here this one here had some root issues actually in the back um but you can see here the undergrowth is really not anywhere near near near the uh the uh crystal cure soil so on our first flower run we basically eliminated um kryptonite out of our repertoire so we're going to move forward with crystal cure as our base baseline living soil and we ran girl scout in the same soil and uh the girl scout didn't didn't react uh quite as quite as uh negatively in the in the kryptonite as the royal cush did but it did have lesser overall yield but yeah so really really for us everything we're doing is is research driven so it's about uh really answering those questions of what's going on in the microbiome in the soil what's going on in the microbiome of the uh fish water and then combining them running them separately uh you know this is going to take this is really the whole basis of our entire company is is understanding um what the microbiome is doing and how it's react you know how the plant is is reacting to it so so decoupled um decoupled system right now and well they'll definitely remain decoupled and uh yeah as far as far as i guess as a we don't really have a set a set way like i said we're just going to be plowing through uh plowing through and figuring out where where we'll land what the best way is for us here over this next year year and a half two years awesome um and uh what about uh looks like we got bane and um and dylan left here yeah i can go um my setup is similar to marty and steve's it's a flood and drain system with dual root zones um with a super soil mix lots of red regulars in the media beds uh eventually i want to do an outdoor system with light deprivation greenhouses um passive solar heat earth shelter and ultraviolets but that's probably like a three to five year period here but yeah otherwise this is a pretty simple setup here hey how's that audio coming through now much better awesome uh so here at uh vertica i think we're doing something very similar to stewart farms we've got the table set up in much the same way with the living soil that we're top feeding with our aquaponic water and now that aquaponic water we're pulling off of a continuously recirculating loop that we've got dwc that we're running some other plants in that we're working on converting that over to more of a uh much like uh steve you and marty were talking about earlier uh on top of those floating rafts with the you know three to five gallon pod on there and uh letting those roots get down in between excuse me below that uh but for right now that's really proven effect for us we just installed a big geothermal heat exchanger system to try to get our temperature in that deep water culture down because that was giving us problems for for a while there especially during the heat of the summer but that we're working on moving that over to more of a dual root zone setup and then like i said up the hills all uh living soil containers there's a the next question is a good one uh what do we look for for people that we want to hire okay i'll answer oh sorry oh no you're you're good uh i'll uh i can speak to that right now we're really going through that like as we process we've got two really great guys i've got to give a shout out to them right now uh zach and then we're really helping to hold it down out there but when you're looking for new people i gotta tell you and ability is a huge thing can you get a little closer to your mic because it cuts out a little bit there you go i think like we've got there you go dependability is what i was and get everything that has to happen around the farm you know from day to day week to week month month taken care of uh that that's huge so yeah so we uh just went through the hiring process as well we actually had a hundred applicants uh when we were going to be hiring three people for the expansion that we're doing and so the very first thing we look for is that they were able to follow instructions on the application we had some certain questions and the things that we wanted answered there and a handful didn't end up filling that stuff out so we didn't move any of those applicants forward after that there are some certain skill sets we're looking at in our case uh we want to understand the micro life a little more so uh we had brought on somebody uh who would be able to handle that and then some experience around uh certain things like cultivation etc played a big role but uh the big next step after we did our phone interviews with the top candidates was to then check their references and uh had all the same questions for the references but having strong references was pretty much the final thing to make our decision for uh who we'd end up bringing on the team and exactly as mentioned that they're going to be reliable and have a farming mindset for us because you're really uh it's not a nine to five job all the time you got to be prepared if something doesn't go right that you're going to be able to stay longer if you're scheduled on certain days that you may have to come in at 12 at night to fix some challenges that may be happening in the facility yeah i um uh i've got two two key things that that i'm looking for now and the first one is you have to love the plant you have to love cannabis and you have to love the plant and and and i didn't think like when we first got going i i didn't look that this has just been like uh you know dropped the hammer down decision here in the last couple weeks really or even the last month uh i didn't think it was as crucial right you know i i i knew we needed uh i know it was a preference it was a preference at the beginning um but you know we are running a startup company in what is a startup industry uh you know in the legal space anyways and you know working in a startup company in in a well-established industry is is hard enough uh so you know having that built-in passion in a startup company in a brand new startup industry i mean the closest thing to this is the dot-com right bubble that that that burst and you know it was a brand new emerging emerging industry in in with you know companies rising rising and falling left right and center you know it's it's it's uh it's it's a lot of pressure and uh it's it's uh you know you're and you're farming you know that's the big difference you can't really compare it to the dot com you know what i actually you know because then you're farming right it's not like you're making a software so so the second thing uh so passion you gotta love the plant um you know and i'm pretty sure that's gonna spill over into the administration side of this company as well because you know if you're sitting there looking at a spreadsheet you never go into the farm at least you know what you're what you're spreading sheeting about um and the uh the second one is uh the ability to adjust to rapid change and that kind of goes back to the the farming side of it right you know like you have to be willing to come into work every day and be like oh we're not doing what we said we were going to do yesterday and then you got to come in the next day and be like oh we're also not doing the thing we said we were going to do today right and and you know at delade's point uh you know what oh we're going to be here for 18 hours today so so you know and that all kind of loops loops back so like you know if you're passionate chances are you're not gonna mind those extreme changes uh every day but you know you might be passionate but then you really just can't take those those shifting tides i mean a lot of people a lot of people need structure like they need structure and uh and there and a lot of people just aren't built for this kind of uh kind of a gig right so i'm just trying to you know going forward when we're hiring people we're interviewing people and we they make it through all the kind of to the last conversation just trying to be as negative as possible and be like you know nothing you think we're going to do is going to happen many things are not going to work out and this is going to be really hard right you know and you know kind of lay it out yeah i think um i think that as far as like i have the unique perspective of hiring people for a different industry also as an i.t professional i've been i.t manager multiple times and ran you know tech support crews i've ran installation crews and hired multiple people and first of all it's almost always a crap shoot but there are i feel like important things uh in terms of aquaponics that are are interesting which is the first one i have to say is if you have any type of farming experience at all you should just come to the top of the list at least to be considered and there's a reason for that which is everybody can sit at their office job and fantasize about growing weed and how cool it is and how fun it must be and not realize exactly how much work it is until they do it for a couple of days and then never [ __ ] show up again so um that's just so if you've done it before and you know what you're in for that and you're still willing to do it then by all means that you know you should definitely at least talk to them then the second thing that i'll say about hiring people that i feel like is the most important thing across the board is what questions they ask what are they interested in when you are talking to them um are are their interests um related to uh plants knowing expanding their own knowledge do they want you know do they bring their own stuff to the conversation do they talk about strains that they've already grown do they talk about farming that they've already done do they ask questions related to what the job is going to be or do they ask questions related to what the pay is going to be what the hours are going to be um things that are more related let's just say slightly more self-centered as opposed to um knowledge seeking because i i do feel like people thrive in what they love and if they're there to get an hourly wage or they're there to just have a job um you know it's going to be difficult for them to succeed so if you have somebody that is showing up to a job interview and asking questions just because they genuinely want to know stuff about growing a plant or cutting clones or doing a farm of any any sort um you know try to consider them a little bit more than maybe somebody that has more experience but it is only concerned with how the job is going to benefit them financially so i would say knowledge centric questions in the interview process i've always something that i've been looking for and that's the same even in it if people were coming to me and i was interviewing them for a technician job and they were asking questions about the latest operating system or how how better to classify tech calls or um you know trying to get information out out of me to better themselves those people almost always work out after being hired in my experience so that's my two cents oh yeah definitely anybody who's on on point for anyone any experience growing uh especially if they've experienced growing like uh acreage you know then they definitely move to the top because they're gonna especially insect observation they seem to really have a one-up one um i also like to do i'll take somebody especially if i really think they're they got a good chance of being hired uh have them suit up and whatever we need to do to get into a room and be like cool tell me what's wrong with the room right now and let them go run around and tell me what the hell is wrong and i know what's wrong i scout the thing every morning right so that's cool but man maybe if they're really good they find something i didn't know it was there then they're a really good chance to get married but uh uh but uh in general you know if they can at least tell me most all or most of what i know is wrong with the room is you know or hey there's nothing wrong with the room you know let them run around a room for 30 minutes until they tell you nothing's wrong you know that sometimes that's kind of fun too but either way let them you know tell you that you know call them on their experience you know there's a lot of people out there that have trimmed or something like that that might have watched a few podcasts and they can talk a good game but throw them in a room for a minute and tell them and see what they do you know and see what their reaction is when they walk into a room you know another big one is do they complain about being itchy do they know that they're gonna get a sheet right like this there's a big one right like you have people that were like man i don't remember we've been itching it's like okay you haven't grown weed before just like get out like you know that kind of stuff so just stuff to think about you know there's little stuff like that too where you know um just just you could tell if someone is grown or not just by taking them into a girl and then asking them how they're going to go about doing you know x y or z can give you a real good idea and it can take you five or ten minutes to find out if someone actually knows what they're doing or not pretty quickly i went to a grow oh man i went to a grow in oklahoma and their master grower didn't know he was supposed to balance the ph of the nutrient solution which i've seen all kinds of stuff i've seen people over aerate their systems and hold their ph at 8.2 and all kinds of things so you never know what kind of wacky ideas people's master growers quote unquote will have alrighty uh so uh uh before we move on does you guys have any questions here on the panel that you guys would like to ask other producers or anything you guys are stuck on anything you guys are uh wish you had a an answer to or anything like that before i go back to user questions or not user questions but viewer questions anything bueller nobody all right anyone have any favorites go ahead how did i order myself some black tilapia tanner sorry what's that but how do i order myself some of your tilapia well you you will get your cannabis coming out too in eight eight in about uh seven and a half months i will be able to smoke some tilapia up for you and then we'll we'll trade some smoked tilapia for some smoked salmon i don't know i don't know if that's an equal trade but it's a trade yeah so we're about uh we're about yeah seven and a half months from uh from them getting to a pound and a half and the weed um that's a good question lane i mean we uh uh we're just about to put the royal in for its first cure and i got to get my coa on it so finger fingers fingers crossed on it uh so that's like the soonest we can have any wheat on the market is looking like november 15th kind of best case and that would be uh that would be for that runner royal and uh the girl scout would be kind of early november but we're probably going to start here on the east coast we couldn't be further away right like we're starting new brunswick you guys are in bc so i'll be kind of working working my way there unless we land on shelter market with you uh which which is a possibility right well i look forward to trying it soon here and to uh some smoke tilapia thank god bless canada for letting you travel with weed and concentrate on their airlines i know all the all us americans are super jealous right now of this entire holiday just in case you were wondering oh yeah oh man like getting on planes like planes stink nowadays like you can carry you know some guys could carry like you know like we could get out right yeah down here in oregon we do we so oregon you can fly out just about anywhere you want to and they say hey wherever you're going it's their problem so for the most part or you can play out with stuff and you can fly from oregon to oregon you know no problem so that's been great but man to be able to send products to another state just seems like you know should be so obvious that it should be able to happen and it doesn't so that's that's always frustrating but i do have a question for you guys since steve brought it up um what is i know a number of you guys are doing fetal hunts right now so what are your favorite kinos that you haven't been able to try yet what do you what are you excited to try when it's done well i i got this uh cherry west uh from uh freeborn and uh i ran it indoor and outdoor and it's actually uh you know mean gene talks about uh one of the phenos being a mutant strain and uh it it is the weirdest looking plant like uh its leaves are on like like any plan i've ever seen and i wonder if i can find it here uh but it just stinks like oh here it is right here one second here and i actually did smoke some non-cured like okay see that see that leaf profile that it's just the weirdest looking plant right this was early on like this was uh this was about like four weeks before we took her down um but anyways it just stinks it's got like a real real fruity fruity smell on it um you know i i'm really looking forward to smoking a fully cured version of it and it's kind of looking like it might be meant to be an outdoor strain and it finished about 10 10 or 12 days ago and i probably could have took it down about five or six days before that on the outdoor um and it was kind of short and stout and it looked really great so it looks like it actually might be an outdoor strain it doesn't seem to be doing as well uh inside so we're gonna do a couple runs of that as well but but that's uh i basically fell in love with it on the outdoor and i i rubbed i rubbed one part of the butt like i kept rubbing the top cola and then it ended up molding on me because i kept touching it so i had to cut that part off so you know don't don't be uh touching your outdoor bud uh if even if you love the plant so for uh me due to uh our so we're only allowed so much cultivations um canopy space given the micro license we have so we've with our expansion we're actually fully utilizing that just for flower production so we ended up partnering with uh mother labs out in saskatoon and right now we are in week two of a couple hundred pheno hunt so i would say in six weeks when i go down there i'm gonna get all kinds of exciting uh plants gorgeous ladies to look at and uh be able to pick some new flavors for us so it's uh six weeks out at today's date but i'm uh very excited to check out our new phenos that we have going they have some really nice stuff going at mother labs i'm basically just outside of saskatoon yeah they got an awesome uh site there i toured up there a couple months ago great group of guys and i'm very excited to go back and see what we have coming down the pipe who wants to go next i'll jump in um we've got a uh a strain of this gelato g that i'm really excited about it uh actually fared really well we had a bit of a pest problem come through and it was the one plant who just stayed pristine and clear even when plants right next to her just got swamped and so we've got some that just got chopped last week on the racks now that we're waiting to see i mean the flower is really nice it's got some pretty color to it so we're really interested to see how that one really turns out after dry and cure and we get some coas on it because we've got a bunch of her prodigies in a room right now that's coming along flip to flower and is following up behind it so we're really excited about that one and that one should be available uh in our dispensaries in oklahoma city here in the next couple months probably about three months out from now so that one's uh gonna be good to see how that turns out i'm running a few different phenols by ethos right now but the one that's standing out the most is probably purple sunset and insane in the membrane i haven't flowered in zane in the membrane yet but it looks like it's gonna stretch three times as big as it is now so i don't have enough ceiling space but that's okay um and one of my favorites to always have going is cbd afghani by house of the great gardener uh every time i grow it it ranges between eight percent thc and twelve percent cbd and the terpene profile on it is perfect and it's super super super resilient to bugs and pests so like bane was saying you have an infested plant right beside the mother and the cbd afghani just wasn't effective whatsoever so that's one i'll definitely be keeping around as well but i'm excited to try out these new ethos genetics i've never really ran any of them before and yeah probably after i'm done final hunting i'm just gonna go switch back to doing one or two strains because doing more than one in this room is a task by itself uh yeah i have a couple different varieties of my blue hash that uh some of the people have gotten their hands on i usually throw those out when there's a fundraiser or something over on on future cannabis project and stuff like that and that's the lineage i've been growing for a long time since uh in colorado and then uh mr green jeans garden has been back crossing those for me and uh working that line a little bit and then we've been kind of jumping that in and out of aquaponics for quite a few generations now and it really seems to just scream uh and uh but uh of the ones lately um uh the stuff i guess i that i'm makes most excited to germinate next which i'm about too soon is a whole bunch of land race zimbabwe that i allegedly brought back from zimbabwe from the upanianga mountains which is going to be a lot of fun uh pheno hunting those super high and pinene so that'll be a lot of fun so um uh you have you guys found any interesting test results so far in your searches results on that one i was speaking of just back yet so eagerly waiting eagerly awaiting that yeah we're uh we got uh we got pretty high hopes uh pinned on this nexu for our uh original it's the original girl scout uh cut it's kind of classic you know it's not uh um it's not really in the uh in the current current hype train necessarily but on on the first first run of it you know it did two percent terps and 22 uh thc and and that we did that wasn't a run we did actually it was a run i had uh contracted out while i was waiting to get my license uh and just everything you could imagine went wrong in that room so so uh you know it kind of did those numbers despite uh despite that gross situation so we're just about to get our next coa on that so uh it's it's supposed to do up to 28 and uh you know 28 and three and a half percent uh terps i i got it like my nose isn't a coa but like it's stunk up you could it stunk up the whole building you know it was you you walked as soon as you pulled up to the building it was girl scout that you were smelling outside you walked in the office it was girl scout it was right beside the royal right you know it was in the same room so we had two we had two tables of the girl scout two tables two tables of mandelbrots royal and uh you know it was just unbelievably powerful of uh of of ascent right so kind of took over everything so fingers crossed you know i'm more excited about the the terp numbers than the uh thc numbers personally but the market's more excited about thc numbers unfortunately uh uh than than terp numbers right now so awesome very cool anybody else as tanner mentioned for us uh so far so on our cake strain which is a mandarin sunset cross with a dosie dough our highest coa we've got back was a 33 total cannabinoids and 1.87 percent terpenes now uh we're hunting through hundreds more here so i'm expecting that we're going to be able to uh get those terpenes up here from some new phenos and as well the market appears focused very around the high thc but i think people are starting to also really care about the terps so having that combination of the two is going to be big for making sure you're top of the market choice absolutely for sure yeah terpenes is one of the things that we found a huge huge boost and we've had some uh get quite high in the aquaponics especially when you start getting into hybridizing it with some of the different fermented inputs it seems certain plants have different compounds that really trigger terpene production in certain plants as well uh maybe not something that you could do in a certified uh organic system without getting yourself into trouble but when uh in an r d system or something like that where you can experiment a little more um uh definitely or in a home grow for sure uh uh can can play around with some of that stuff that we don't have uh access to always on the commercial scale too so but definitely some some really interesting things that that we've seen a cbd as well a huge increase in cbd against soil controls that we've had uh i can't tell you how many times we've done that one now five six times that we've done that with different groups um yeah quite a bit so uh but the other one was a beta carpalline beta karflane in particular we seem to have a huge boost in was the other one that i've seen just across the board and the aquaponics versus soil have a pretty big boost um bain you do a little bit of side by side as well up there do you have anything else you wanted to add uh yeah that we were able to find exactly side by side comparisons and get our variables as old as we'd like just yet sure i was just curious just because i know you have the different setups up there um i did a lot of work to help uh help at bane's house spot not house the company he works with i was working with them a little bit sometimes it feels like it yeah right um so let me see what other questions we have in chat here um let's see is anybody growing any cbg cultivars not yet but i definitely want to maybe thank you i might i grow something else but no cbd here nope nothing in particular here let's see here there's some other questions um [Music] thank you very much lots of people saying thank you for all the awesome content uh good go uh okay hold on i can't believe it's taking me so long so um no all right would you guys have any other um uh things you guys like to say about aquaponics and your experiences about doing it versus other methods in general i had a had a recent pretty good anecdote occur um you know i came out of the leafy green world originally and i ran uh a farm for three and a half years in western canada and all edmonton alberta and we did spinach kale arugula swiss chard but you know the fact of the matter is that aquaponics really made me fall in love with leafy greens personally on a personal level i uh i didn't realize spinach was so good i didn't realize arugula was supposed to taste like horseradish and uh recently i heard i had heard that uh chef of a high-end conference called the shaw conference center downtown edmonton um you know he used to buy all of our aquaponically grown green greens and you know after i exited that company and came to focus on stuart farms they uh the the guys that were running it they eventually shut it down um but uh like since i since he stopped getting aquaponically grown leafy greens and he tried hydroponic guys like local indoor hydroponic guys and he refuses to uh bring bring any any indoor grown in if it's not aquaponically grown and he's a phenomenal chef and uh i i just heard that within the last week so you know if if we were to be back out there again and stuart farms was to get going back on the food side you know he would bring he would bring our products back into his restaurant here uh again i know it's not cannabis driven uh but it's just uh just a testimony uh you know for me personally anyways i mean i've tried lots of lots of uh you know uh vegetables you know fruiting crops and leafy greens grown in hydroponic systems and and to me the food just stays better in an aquaponic system and and and apparently it does uh with with that particular uh chef as well so i just thought that was a pretty good anecdote i mean for me it's just my favorite thing to smoke i guess i've grown it all kinds of different ways you guys watched my talk earlier i kind of went over all the different ways in which i have grown it and then everything i grow i consume so by doing it multiple different ways myself i feel like i can at least eliminate the grower's bias in terms of that because obviously everything that we grow tastes good to us i think the same's mostly true for food as well um so it's easy to say that our own cannabis is the best cannabis but if we only do it one way then i feel like uh it doesn't rule out our bias so after growing in living soil and growing in decoupled systems and growing in sub-irrigated planters and growing in just straight pots and growing in hydro in all the different ways and then consuming them i can still say confidently that every side by side every strain that i've grown i've all preferred a full loop aquaponic system so that's why i do it i'm a consumer of one so i don't have any other customers that i have to be concerned about so that's nice it's uh something that you can be uh really proud of for uh us like i can go grab sashimi grade salmon right out of our finishing tanks and have for lunch get the amazing cannabis that we've been producing at our facility and as tanner mentioned as well it opens up the opportunities to be able to get in food production and i've tried some of the kale and lettuce from deepwater farms up in calgary and uh definitely i could tell the difference from what i would get at the store otherwise and uh having that quality product grow in an aquaponic system you get amazing protein and your greens whether it be leafy greens or cannabis greens yeah i think the thing that really kept aquaponics apart from me i come from a vegetable and leafy green background as well and i can definitely agree with what you're saying marty the grower's bias is present what you grow i do think tastes better most of the time but uh that aside i i believe that aquaponics is something that's really unique and you can be proud of in terms of its uh regenerative properties and you can make it really low impact and from a commercial standpoint once you get everything dialed in and your process is figured out i believe it's truly a more economical way to produce what again in my opinion is a higher quality product better tasting product at the end of the day uh and better for customers whether they be as is the case here in oklahoma or recreational in other markets so that's what really sets aquaponics apart from me and that's the reason i'm going down that path absolutely i found uh no matter the crop but really increases the flavor uh hands down that just it doesn't matter if it's lettuce tomatoes cucumbers cannabis night and day doesn't matter unless unless you're growing in like the the richest living soil i think is the only thing that really compares um and that takes time and experience uh that a lot of people just don't have and patience that a lot of people don't have to be to be frank with you so um uh yeah so i think that's the kind of the biggest thing all around that you just can't really compare so uh on that note um why doesn't everybody uh go around and tell everybody how to find them and more information about them and their products and then and then we'll conclude so why don't we start off with uh with tanner there uh yeah well thanks steve for uh for having me uh it's always uh always

"SnPjblVHe2I": "okay i think oh looks like there's things um um yeah anyway that was i'm having problems with restream tonight i think i got it all sorted up and i'm stuck on my thing okay wow here we go i think we are live you don't need my phone i was super ready for this stream by the way and then realized i couldn't get into restream uh last minute so yeah fun anyway here we go i think we are ready so tonight i am working from a smart art box just for transparency this is provided me or the box was provided to me by smart smartbox i am not otherwise paid or asked to say anything specific this is just something fun i get to share with you guys so um if you were interested in getting your own smart art box they did give me a code though if you want to use that i think it still works it's a few years old if it doesn't let me know i'm sure they've got a different one but um that is available in the video description and what smart art box is is a monthly subscription box so every month you get a box full of full-size supplies something different something you may have never tried like this is definitely different for me i played with sculpey but not in this manner so this will be interesting we'll see how this goes um so yes and we have the hound cam tonight um they're well wade's kind of scooched off to the side i think he's trying to not be on camera anyway um so let's go ahead and get started with this so the smart art box i'll open it but i already have this part out so one of the things that i like so much about these is that it comes with a guide so like if you've never used some of these materials it's really dark in here and see if that helps a little um but if you've never used any of these materials like in this case there's a lot of stuff i don't know how to use this is going to walk you through it so it starts off with a brief history of whatever medium whatever style you're going to be working in and then you've got your project tools you go through a nice quick start little guide for a simple project this is one of the changes they made on these boxes i really like i think it's it it's a nice change because you've got a simple project and then they walk you through something that is a bit more advanced so that is what we have here now i'm not sure i probably need to get some transfer paper and transfer this so i don't have to freehand it now that i'm looking at this um but anyway so we'll we'll do that um in just a moment but you've got all of that and then in the back it goes through project pointers which i probably should have read i didn't um so anyway let's go ahead and open the box this one was heavy like it seriously weighs a ton that's orange there we go come on stay open please stay open like why are you not there we go so in this box we have four is it four yeah four of these little wood board guys this is for the artwork itself and one of the things that's so cool about this i love when they give you this mini extras because you get a chance to absolutely fail make a mess and then you can use whatever supplies make something better like from what you figured out didn't work so well so we've got these potter pottery wooden sculpting tools we've got brushes roiling nickel the brand i don't the brand is decent my issue is these are really those the camel hair they're really soft like i don't like these brushes for pretty much anything so i really doubt that i'm going to do much with these brushes i'll probably use my own but i don't think i'm going to get to the point of painting tonight my goal is to get the majority of the sculpting done and then paint it next week we'll see how that goes we have the wipe away tool set that's i've not had that yet we've got some mini ribbon tools potter select we have a set of what is this 12 i think acrylic artist colors royal langnickel so whole bunch of paints there we're not gonna really get to that tonight i don't think we've got the sculpey this is a big thing of sculpey um you can make a lot of projects out of this that's what why this weighs so much i don't know when this project was from if they're still doing candy i think someone else said they weren't i don't understand why boxes like this like i don't need candy like i don't know it makes it feel more like a childish thing to me um especially everyone's got dietary restrictions it just seems a little like it's always seemed weird to me when boxes are like and here's a lollipop yay i'm five because these are really i mean yeah kids could do these but i always took these as being a little bit you know more yeah i don't need candy i'm not five anyway that is going to be the never ending rant for me with these so let's get all of this up and out of the way but i think somebody else said that the newer ones did not have candy hopefully that's a thing wow that color is really really orange we'll we'll move this out of the way and see if we can adjust that yeah that looks better once the orange is out okay so the first thing that i need to do is transfer my image on to this that is my plan is to try to school to make this little frog which looks like dawn knots i think but the way i did his lips basically you just i made on knots frog so let's go ahead and wait what huh i won't turn it down there's something going on here let me make sure lynn said i've been thinking of asking my boyfriend if i can get these these are fun these i love these boxes because i this is how i was introduced to in intense in the first place was through a smart art box but you get to try so many things that you never would have like i have so much artwork around my studio made from smart art box stuff so it's really fun um it makes this long juice doesn't look like donuts it really does okay hold on i need some tracing and transfer paper to save myself some time because i don't want to draw this out again wait do i have some dough here i might have some in here if i would stop shoving my art supplies in places they do not belong this would be way faster and easier oh i did find part of what i'll need now i just need the transfer paper hmm oh you know what i never did too i don't even have my reference photo anywhere hold on it's not going to be in a convenient location i don't know that i really i don't know how useful it is let's go ahead and turn it on anyway my reference photo is going to be behind me but i can glance back at it my drawing is the main thing i think that i'll need for this so i don't feel like i'm totally cheating i'm mostly using stuff from smart art box because this transfer paper did come from a previous box this is white transfer paper let's just rip a little piece of this off here oh there's some already ripped i could use that whatever um let's see i love the kitty yeah i mean candy's good it's just i don't need it in my art supplies like it's just i don't know it's just i also think it's weird to have food products in with my art supplies like if i were at a grocery store and i were bagging for some reason food supply or you know art supplies along with like they would not go in the same bags i don't know it's just weird i don't know that i want to eat something that was stored with not that anything in here is toxic it's just see it's one of those things that i think is weird more likely than not it's just me who's weird but whatever um let's see yeah mr olympia one of the best movies ever uh let's see alana said i forgot the u.s had daylight savings times so you're an hour earlier for me yeah we need to get rid of that crap because there is no we need to get rid of that crap we'll just leave that there okay and just for like so everyone knows um if you're here expecting like just a regular straight art lesson that is what patreon or subscribers are for same thing you don't need to sign up for both but for as little as four dollars a month you get access to all of my longer tutorials those are actual painting tutorials not me screwing around with sculpey that i don't know how to use um but if that is what you're looking for this is going to be a better fit for you with these these are this is a chance for me to play with art supplies while i'm also hanging out and chatting with you guys ow and mean my uh table i'm sitting at so i'm just gonna tape this on the upper corners oh good news i talked to frederiks today well i emailed him last week but i kept forgetting to respond back so i have contacted fredericks and ordered the canvases i need so we can start doing giveaways of some of these uh live well not this one but when we do the acrylic which sides down that side's down okay this is the same frog we've used on lots of stuff and the reason that i went with the same one besides my obvious obsession with red eye tree frogs but beyond that it was that i this is a medium i don't know what i'm i mean i've played with sculpey before but not this way this is a very different way to do it and even then i'm not suit like i am no sculpting expert so i wanted to go with something a subject matter that i was very very familiar with i've drawn this and painted this specific frog so many times i figured that would make it a little easier for playing around with this uh let's see veek said should i try to master a medium before trying another is watercolor difficult watercolor i would say is one of the more difficult mediums to get the hang of but if you have a general understanding of your lights in your darks you you know when you understand let's see hold on let me i can't i can't multitask at this point so the thing with working with multiple mediums if you get to where you're comfortable with one the thing the main things that make a difference in your work values and contrast design um composition that's going to make a bigger difference than anything else in your work and that is going to apply across the board no matter what medium you're working in so if you switch to another medium those same things that took you so long because those are the things that take the longest to learn not not the technique i mean may take you a few months but understanding values being brave enough to make your darks dark enough your lights light enough getting the you know understanding composition and all of that that's what takes so long so when you switch mediums it's not that big of a deal no i say you should do whatever interests you if that means moving from medium to medium move for medium to medium for me i don't want to work just in one medium that that is boring to me i mean this is i draw all the time and paint all the time if i'm only working in one medium i start to feel burnt out but because i work in multiple it's like something a little bit different and i don't get burned out give you your mr limpet lips i don't know why they came out like mr olympia this time but they did i love don knotts like andy griffith's show i could watch that over and over and over i haven't seen it in years but i do remember liking it and lassie i used to watch lassie all the time like that was my favorite when i was in junior high i'd come home from school make a big bowl of popcorn and sit and watch um lassie they were reruns i'm not that old i'm old just not old enough to watch them i've watched them when they were new but i would watch lassie on i think nickelodeon played it um every single day and then do my homework okay so the reason that i only tape at the top is so i can ah none of that came out dang it i need black hold on i have to find a different transfer paper this is not working for me at this point it would have been faster just to freehand it okay we'll use the darker one i should have checked that i can't really see what i'm doing here on the light wood under these lights so trying that again but the reason that i tape just at the top and not the bottom is so i can lift and check and see that i can't see is to me still on the well i think that dog probably put timmy in the well to keep him out of trouble he's like you're just you're enough drama also fun fact you didn't know lassie was always played by a male because the females would blow their coats every time they came into heat random information there so if i just ruined your childhood there you go okay that side here we go let's do this again okay and i don't need this perfect i just want a general like let's make things easier on myself than having to redraw all that they had i watched and they have episodes of lassie on youtube i'm sure they're copyright violations but whatever they're there they had one with a greyhound i watched that not too long ago okay this is really not the exciting part i just want to play with the sculpey oops much did i miss this is not showing up well on here at all holy crap it should be how odd like this is just not sticking i think i am going to end up kind of going over this with a pencil this is not i'm done playing with this mess the other thing would probably be more of a pain okay let's do it this way i can kind of see what's there so i'll use that as a guideline just to speed things along i don't want to lose my mr olympia oh here we go i can kind of see oh oops i'm drawing the eye the wrong direction pay attention see and this is why i wanted to go with something i was pretty familiar with because if this was like a motorcycle and i don't know how those go this would have taken me even longer than i'm taking now i can kind of see some of those lines so i'm using that to just save time and they can add in as needed this will get more exciting i hope soon i guess we'll find out um let's see oops that was more of a knuckle and then we've got a toe somewhere around there somewhere around here this is not there we go let's add your don knott's lips back in there okay let's see um where was i joshua said um t-shirt quote it's not about color it's about values yeah that's going to get completely mistaken and somebody somehow will be offended because that's what people do and that's why like the the values light enough uh dark stark enough lights light enough i'm afraid somebody's gonna misunderstand that it's gonna start problems for somebody so that is anytime certain words are used it's like people these days always mistake them for meaning like something nefarious i don't know so i'm kind of hesitant to do that t-shirt i mean we all know what it means but i don't want somebody having issues because of it i know i'm probably being paranoid it's just i'm amazed every time you hear a new story of somebody like misunderstood what somebody meant by something and it turned into drama and i'm like people are looking for those offenses so i don't really want to feed into that [Music] okay somewhere around there i don't know this'll add as we go let's see is that good enough can i start playing with a sculpey now let's see my eyes got some issues over here i mean there are going to be bigger issues once i started with a sculpey anyway so i don't know why i'm worrying that much about little details i'll make that eye needs to be a bit bigger but i think that'll work good enough for what we need here um let's see i am way up behind let me scroll up okay here we go um brent does art says my sweet tooth is undefeated 40 years from running shayna said sweets and smart boxes have been seen as i can talk sweets in smart boxes can be seen as childish but many people love disney harry potter etc i do too i just don't like i don't know i have everything in like different compartments art supplies candy they just don't go in the same bag to me i don't know it's weird um i'm going to paint it but probably not until next year oh flipper was my favorite i was in love with sandy like absolutely with him um i was probably like i don't know eight at the time but huge crush okay so let's see we get to open this now um knight rider and the a team i remember those wow um yeah lassie was a lady yes he was uh rhonda said i have been watching some of your different painting videos do you have a different set of brushes for each medium i do except inktense and watercolor and water-soluble graphite those brushes can all be shared but like i don't use my um oil painting brushes with my acrylics or my watercolor with my hair like everything else is kept separate phyllis said halfway through last year i would cry it was going to be over soon my mother can figure out how i knew some things she uh sometimes she wouldn't tell me it was on that's funny tara said when i was a child my granddad had a lassie dog i loved her the poor dog having childhood having the child hanging out of her i had a um come on open up i had a collie as a kid i had a tri-colored collie his name was sebastian really really people think that collies are really smart they're not at all they're obedient they have such a will to make you happy but my god those dogs cannot figure stuff out on their own like sebastian was not the brightest critter of all critters sweetest dog and you i could teach him anything i mean he was so fun to train because he he wanted to make you happy unlike a couple of hands over here sight hounds are kind of the reverse sight hounds are extremely intelligent but people think they're stupid because they don't do what you tell them to it's because they know they don't need to they're smart enough to know you can't do crap to make them do what they don't want to do so there's a bit of a difference there with the braids for sure um but yeah they're really cool dog the running pheasant at dawn that is one heck of a name said 1 16 a.m here in the uk thanks for light living up my insomnia i'm glad i'm not the only one that gets tech issues with tools now and then oh i got some major tech issues with tools that was that one was an odd like it really was not working for me thinking i can just use these to scoop out the dirt frogs are talking renting tin i don't think i ever really watched like i know the name but i don't remember um really seen that one victoria said the incredible mr olympia was such a good movie at least when i was a kid that's what i thought me too i know so one of my favorite movies as a kid was oh this is soft when i've used skull sculpey stuff before it was like hard as a rock this stuff is soft and fluffy this is not gonna be as hard on my arthritis as most the other stuff i've used what is this how is this different hold on this is sculpey air dry premium air dry clay maybe i thought no baking dries hard maybe the stuff i used before needed i think it did need to be baked maybe that was why it was harder maybe when you guys can let me know sheena said oh that's what i'm saying so um my favorite movie growing up was um the neverending story and i was so excited when it came on amazon prime and i'm like oh i i'm so excited it was horrible my god that is a whole like horror like there was nothing good about that movie i don't know yeah as an adult it didn't work but i can still watch like the little mermaid over and over again so i don't know that aged well uh the never ending story less so like just ba the bad kid at child actors i think is part of it the main kid oh god thank you shayna said try using a pencil to transfer as opposed to the metal tool thing pencils work better while transferring i've not found that to be the case most of the time but maybe on the wood it would be because i don't normally transfer onto wood so maybe that would be the difference kim said it's been a while since i watched love the hound cam thanks at some point you'll probably see someone with their legs in the air um yeah nick said half the time things are intentionally misunderstood oh i would say more than half the time uh kim said let's get to the important stuff now how are the babies the frogs are doing well so i got the new frogs though the purple one it looks like was dehydrated and i think it's because he didn't he was stressed and didn't want to move and he stayed under where the fan was and i think it dehydrated him so i contacted brader she thinks that was why he got all like edema like he got really swollen so i've upped the humidity took off the fan but now i have to work it's a whole balancing act of keeping it humid enough for them but not you want the air moving or they can get bacterial infections it's a whole thing so he seems to be doing much much better he's getting more active he still has not eaten it'll be a week tomorrow and he has not eaten so i'm watching for that the albino that one's eating moving around everything's great there um murky is doing wonderful murky has gotten murky was like tiny he was this he was this big um the green red eye tree frog when i got him as a baby he's like that no more than that like that well it's a she it's big so yeah they're doing um good i guess we're watching i'm keeping eye on the purple one we'll see i my concern is sometimes when they get swollen like that it's a bacterial infection like an internal so we'll see what happens um let's see allura said what books do you plan it to less listen to on audiobooks is way of kings one of them it's 45 to 55 hours did i buy that one i thought i or did i read that one hold on let's see there was one i think that was the one that i didn't read yet or didn't buy yet look i can find out really quick though also mike welcome to patreon thanks for joining let's see no don't want to play i'm listening to stephen king's stand um so that one is what it's trying to play right now but let's go back and see [Music] um yeah i have it i own it i just it looks like did i not listen to it yet nope don't play i think i just haven't listened to it yet but i do own it throwing my phone down where do you here you can go over there don't fall um let's see sam said i miss your surreal painting videos with the violin music i'm so out of practice with violin i need to get back to that again yeah uh lynn said summer dog equals very smart dog yeah and that's something a lot of people don't understand they think that the stubborn means stupid it's usually the opposite although wade over there i've got stubborn and he's not very bright he's an odd combination you usually don't have that that combo um but yeah for the audiobooks right now i'm listening to the stand by stephen king don't listen to that before you go to bed gives you weird dreams finding that out the hard way rhonda said in australia we had skippy the bush kangaroo to go with lassie and flipper oh my gosh i'm jealous um robert says i'm sure having trouble with the polychromos and blender on fisher400 i would need more information to help you with than that because i know it's a good combination it works great i've had no trouble so i i would need some more information before i could help you on that one vik said all creatures plus humans are the same the sweeter the nature the less crafty tara said we had a calling when we were young but she was like a steel blue color but she bit my brother and tried to pull his arm off i think they were like working farm dogs yeah they'll heard you around the yard they we had bunnies in our yard and my colleague used to heard them from one area to the other see if i can get kind of fun questions here um you probably used polymer clay before oh i did that is the difference definitely what it is dealing creative art said that's what it looks like when greyhounds stay on their bed our girl sprawls on the sides constantly taking up half the room she doesn't like him we have to step over her um the never ending story two how can there be a two it never ends was there a two the oh the first one was bad was the second i'd imagine the second one would be worse that's usually how it goes um lottie said love the never ending story as a kid too but the wolf gave me nightmares um scrolling okay so let's go ahead and see what it tells me to do first okay press the clay under the wood panel using the tip of your fingers press it down and spread it over the entire board use a round wooden tool as a ruler to spread it even this is the foundation your piece make sure to take um yeah i don't think i'm going to do it that way i'm going to do it this way okay this is a different technique and this technique we build up the sculpture and refine the piece while using the modeling tool start by sketching your design onto the wood panel using a pencil already did that bit use big shapes in very little detail um it will be easier to a large larger design will be easier to sculpt slowly begin adding layers of plate over the sketch design okay so we're just going to start sticking it in places here i'm wondering if i should do it and separate like do the eye separately i think that's how i'm going to do it there's your eye little frog how does it stay stuck to the board when it dries like i don't know that's gonna stay your eyes are probably gonna get way you know what his eyes are definitely getting away over size as i start mushing this down yeah sorry artist collective said love the sandbox so disturbing i don't totally know what it's about like i kind of get what it's about i'm in the beginning i'm like five hours in or something i don't know so yeah how is this gonna stick do i have to glue it later or how's it it's not sticking at all it makes it look like it's gonna stick but it is not sticking it sticks to itself just not the i don't know laura said hi lisa i hope you're doing well bought frederick's watercolor canvas board and was wondering if i could use oils or oils over acrylic on it i have i had no problems when i did it that way too big shayna said i recently saw your video on the new frogs you got it's been almost a week how are they adjusting to their new home the albino is doing great the purple still is iffy i don't know on that guy he's he's um starting to become more active so that is good but he's been having issues being swollen like edema um and that can be caused when i looked up online it says kidney issues or bacterial infection okay that could be the breeder thinks dehydration which made sense because he was he kept sitting right under where the fan was anybody wouldn't move for the first few days and i was kind of letting him try to adjust didn't think about the fact that that he was drying himself out so i the the dehydration makes sense hopefully it didn't cause any perma permanent damage you know you think i think reptiles might be a little bit smarter because a reptile if they're like wow this area is really too warm or too dry i'm going to move to another area of the tank and i just kind of assumed he would do the same and i don't think he did so yeah we'll see how that goes but he was moving around better last night um he sat in this water for a long time so that'll help rehydrate him we'll see how they do but the albino's doing great she's eating or he i don't know if it's male or female um eating everything's going well there so that makes me happy i need this world out more i don't know what i'm doing by the way uh kim said the sam was my first stephen king book i read it at 12 while babysitting way out in the woods at night terrified myself angelique said maybe water would make it stick to the wood oh how many wait i have well then i'm gonna take condensation off my cup and stick that on there let's see what happens i mean i'm not gonna make it worse probably stick it's kind of sliding around maybe i did make it worse i don't know okay let's see this is fun like i don't expect it to be amazing but it doesn't matter it's just something that's fun like right now i'm working on this really elaborate flamingo painting and the background like last will you guys saw that on on um uh and what's it called that needs to be thinner um patreon this week it's just like a real simple just for the background but it's huge so it took me a long time but i'm working on that and so doing something like this that just there's there's no pressure which is fun that's the thing that i like so much about the smart art box is trying something that well like i said no pressure like i don't really care if this comes out amazing i'm just gonna have fun with it my flamingo has to come out amazing this just has to be fun okay let's use some of these tools maybe i can use this to shove stuff around thank you chris yeah alana's what let me know you commented if you do the outlook refine art or do lock free all in caps something like that so that i can really see otherwise i may not see your comments on these this stuff is definitely different than the polymer clay to work with just kind of scraping that in i think oh uh sarah said i had such an awful day that i can't describe how happy i was when i saw this live livestream oh i'm sorry your day was bad hope everything gets better judy said hi i'm working uh i am working right now trying to experiment with uart 500 sanded paper any hints on how to transfer the image graphite transfer paper does not work work really i've used transfer paper or no i take that back i didn't i used a projector and a graphite pencil is how i typically do um do that with those doing this in little sections and i don't know if that's the wisest thing to do but it's what i'm doing adding like condensation the water here is there a tip like hair you should or shouldn't use water to this let's find out after opening the clay make sure to fold the packaging open to here oh keep air out you know what i wonder if i should go how fast this takes to dry out i wonder if i should have um now that kind of did fold over though put it in a ziploc bag um that i don't need that i don't need that i don't need yeah it doesn't really say anything about water i don't know if it's a good idea or not yeah i wonder you know what i'm going to go grab a ziploc bag right now because i don't want this to dry out this stuff looks like fun to play with and i don't want to ruin it i will be right back he's good boy huh okay you can go in here let's see cats are pick said can i mix powder blender with polychromos pencils yeah they work real well together i need sanded paper right yes you do need sanded paper you will not get very good results without it i'm not sure if the water it seems it might have i mean it didn't make it worse so there's that okay let's make it so his little face sticks out more this is fun like i didn't think i mean i was looking forward to trying something different but this is weirdly fun like i don't know if you can see i'm trying to make his face stick out so it's like more how it would be if you saw him in person you get in there easy is it to smooth maybe not whether that tool oh there we go it said you can carve it after it dries too um [Music] tara i said my son got air drying clay before and he begged me to do a jack skellington turned out better than i thought it dried super quick yeah this seems to be drawing like i have a feeling i pulled too big of a clump out here because it is drying a lot faster than i expected it to joseph said it takes 24 hours to fully cure but then the pieces will take thin pieces will take less time serving artist collective said finishing up fantasy book the old kingdom chronicles by garth nix have you read this one i have not i wasn't sure at first but into it now interesting private love the dog young i figured i didn't have any use for that cam like i don't have a painting palette out or anything we may as well use it for the boys your little nose would stick out here a bit okay i'm turning them into an elephant that's not really the look i'm going for wait wait wait you can kind of roll this in remember whenever you try something new any new art supplies experiment like don't don't get too frustrated when things don't go the way you want them to you're not going to learn very fast and you're not going to have fun that's part of why you're not going to learn very fast like just play with it see what happens especially in the beginning i always tell people when you're trying a new medium biggest tip i can give you is go paint something ugly don't even worry if it looks good just paint something ugly get the feel for get a feel for the paint and then you can start doing something better l frog knots um yes please hit the like button that definitely helps and share if you know anyone heck if you don't know anyone doesn't matter share on your facebook thing page youtube likes when you do that they will then share it with more people frankenfrog yeah we we definitely have frank and frog going here okay this could be flat and then maybe i'm glad i didn't like anticipate painting tonight because that is definitely we're not getting that far on this i don't even know that i would finish sculpting him tonight i may have to finish this like not on the stream so that we can paint him next week i don't know we'll see what happens i don't know what i'm doing to your face but it is unpleasant i like these little tools this really works well for kind of molding that into place there's something better for now i don't know how to use the shading ones we're not using those maybe this greyhounds over there having deep size am i boring you life's so hard huh they do that they insist on being in the room with me when i record my patreon videos not the painting portion but the voiceover portion and you'll randomly hear greyhound on the background sign so when you hear that it's not me signing out of boredom it's the boys try adding water too it seems to smooth out more with water i really don't know if that's a good idea so you know don't do what i'm doing because it's probably wrong oh you can kind of mush those together okay let's see maybe i should mush his mouth together now and then make a line this is hilarious looking like it's oh poor frog you've had a rough start to life and apparently i'm getting graphite all over everything so it looks all dirty good thing we're painting this kind of look like a duck right now oh you're gonna need more of this my dogs sleep most of the day like they're usually asleep well with the in-between zoomies of going crazy um i wonder if like painting building up a thinner layer might actually be easier yeah nick i just did that right now and it definitely seemed like the easier way to go i think i'm gonna keep doing that i'm trying to make the face stick out far enough so that i get that more 3d look my brain doesn't work in like this way of a 3d like i'm used to working two-dimensional so this is definitely a little bit different way of looking at it or at anything really yeah i would say as far as the boys sleeping more often than not it's just they just move from one bed to another greyhounds are very what do they call them 45 mile hour couch potatoes well there we go yeah the thin layers nick that was definitely the better way to go um is that stuff like mala or plasticine that we use to play with in primary school yeah it kind of feels like play-doh um very soft uh that well softer than that because it i don't think this would help build muscles in my hands this is definitely softer it smooths out really good when you put the lighter layers on there that was a definite definitely a better way to go it's really soft brent it's it's so different than any other clay that i've used i think i like it though and it's sticking to the board now now that i've got more on there it really is starting to stick better so let's see about shaping his little face a little bit more let's see if i can help him not to look as much like a duck i don't know i think i kind of like how soft it is it's a bit different to get used to but it's easy it seems almost seems easier at least for me because i have arthritis in my hands it's hot the heart like the harder clays are not something i can do very much i start having a lot of pain so for me this is if i were to mess with with sculpting stuff very much it would this seems like it'd be a better option for me i mean i won't personally be able to do this often because looking down like this my neck can't handle it my back i have ankylosing spondylitis so looking down is like i can only do it for a few minutes at a time and that will start causing problems um gabriella said i have two afghan hounds they do the same i love them if my speaking of arthritis that's why i don't have an afghan hound i could not take care of the coat because brushing um when i used to have my collar we were talking about that earlier brushing his coat really and it was a teenager at the time and it's stillness the type of arthritis i have starts when you're a teenager so yeah that was was rough but uh afghans are one of the most afghans and boys i think are some of the most beautiful dogs um rhonda said from the web water can be added to air dry clay to soften your joint pieces okay good thank you thank you for looking that up too if too much water is added and clay is very soft allow access to evaporate before molding pieces otherwise cracking may result good thank you um i think that it is warm by working it should stick better the board oh maybe it's really like it is on there now so that's good i need to flatten this a bit i'm just giving them more duck lips although i guess that is kind of how they look although it's more squared i'm not going to do the line i don't think just yet for the lips i do need to take part out here oh that made a big difference i don't really need to worry about the graphite showing because that's going to get painted over anyway um let's see maybe smooth out his eye oops you just lost part of your eye get back on there his eyes need to be reshaped bit there we go flatten that out a bit more okay let's see stop wait wait wait yes has skin allergies and he'll chew with his skin and make it worse but apparently if you're not loud enough at barking at him he's like meh i can keep doing it um he said i love your area rug your dog camera system remember genius thanks yeah this rug is huge i want to say it's eight feet by eight feet it just it's nice to sit like when i'm i sit on there when i'm on the phone sometimes like it's just a nice i like it um maria said my doberman is an olympic sigh are very embarrassing during work meetings where no one can see him i know because it makes it sound like when he when i'm recording like people are gonna think that i'm like oh i'm so bored making this video for you when really it's the boys move the lips back together after i separate it a little i don't know maybe i made it stick out too far here i think it did let's flatten that a bit which works because their mouths are actually kind of have that little flat section oh we've got don nacho back we got mr limpet lips um [Music] was this the better one for carving yeah kinda it seems like it has to be at the right level of starting to set before you start carving it or it gets a little chunky this is weirdly fun uh joseph said the sculpey air dry should also be worked on non-porous service like metal or tile weird they gave you wood they do that a lot that's one of the things with smart art boxes they're fun but they will give you paper where you i'm like that's not the right paper for this medium i don't know like it they they do that a lot where i'm like i have questions like i mean i get that you're trying to do different stuff but it's i have questions sometimes okay i might have made him stick out too far maybe it's weird whatever we're going with it he can have a big head it is big like weirdly big i should probably how far over was the line here where is it i don't even see the line anymore what is under there yeah that's what happened he needs to oh that made a difference see my brain like it uses a different like your brain is different we're looking at something 3d versus in two-dimensional mention like it makes a big dif like i don't see it quite the same i'm not used to looking at things that way but that made a difference and it's not that you can't learn it if you're used to one it just takes a little practice like anything else i had that going out way too far it still is going out too far but whatever i like it better now okay i'm gonna do the little part of the octopus arm for next maybe just here yeah i'm trying to think what was it i did recently with smart art box and i'm like that paper it's a neat paper but the medium that they gave it to you it was like that can't handle that medium well like it just i don't understand rachel said have you tried adding olive oil to a wedding's diet it's supposed to help with skin problems he gets fish oil with vitamin e he gets um in part of why he's itchy or now i ran out of the red beets that i mix in with it so that it should be here friday i believe um so that's on its way but yeah he's he gets skin allergy he gets a lot of stuff i'm gonna try changing the mixing that i use i'm wondering if that's causing issues so we he had his annual vet checkup with um because he needed to get hardware medication vaccines and all that so we did that last week or monday and the vet said that they've got both the boys have a little bit of ear inflammation and typically in a dog that young that does not have ear issues they don't show any signs of it but that's usually going to be a dietary thing like skin allergies that goes with skin allergies so i'm going to try a different mix in um right now i'm using one called dr harvey's i'm going to try something else and see if that helps his skin isn't terrible peanut butter oh god peanut butter coconut anything like that that was like the worst for him he that poor boy was so inflamed uh let's see he said so is the reverse process of michelangelo's theory of sculpting i is this a reverse process i have no idea because i don't know and i don't know anything about sculpting it's not something i've ever like i can't physically do it much so it's not something ever like my back is already really hurting so it's not something that i've i've really ever been able to get into let's do the little toes first wait no actually i'm going to do the leg first mush that down i kind of like the way that you can form this onto a solid surface i get where it would be better you know if it was a tile but this is um a little bit easier than the there was a sculpey one before where it was the dia de los muertos lady that was so much fun by the way oh my gosh it was very very uh it took forever but it was so much fun um that one though it was built around like you made a frame and you did that one was really cool but it was a lot harder this is easier by a lot his mouth is still going to need some work that's a whole mess i've got going on over there it's like i'm not forming it right it sticks out too far i like how you can kind of keep going back and messing with it this is fun it's not a you get one chance sort of thing i'm going to remove some more oh that helped too hey i'm getting bet it's getting better just keep messing i guess it's like painting just keep messing with it keep layering until it looks good we're getting better kind of well it looks a little droopy maybe this needs to come down more flatten out i don't know um let's see uh clark finder said i got 20 november 2020 box with derwent graphic tint pan set those are fun i like the graphy tints if all those spells try benadryl i've used it for him when he got really itchy before we realized that it was the peanut butter that was the worst and i was adding coconut oil to their food because you could do coconut or fish oil when you do raw either is typically suitable both were causing issues and he was getting a lot of peanut butter i was putting it in kongs for him as a treat when i would walk gibson because he didn't want to walk with us but then i get so i'm like oh you get a bonus you need to have a treat yeah i was making his skin issues worse he that poor boy last summer oh my gosh he was so inflamed so we've got it really well under control i just watch him if he starts chewing at his feet too much or anything like that poor itchy cow i wonder if it would be easier to do i think it would hold on i'm making things harder on myself than it needs to be i'm going to put the whole octopus arm first and then i can kind of wrap the or maybe do the body then the octopus arm okay i think i'm getting i'm getting somewhere on this um try food for life mix in with your food great company run by a friend of mine i mean right now like i said i've got it pretty well under control i ran out of the beats that i normally do which is why and he's not bad at all right now like his skin is not inflamed even without that so i think he i think we're good for the most part the only thing i want to change is the mixing that i'm using because the ear inflammation um which i don't like the vet that i go to oh this is too thick the vet that i i took them to so the vet there's a vet that is like the greyhound rescue or not rescue but adoption place that they recommend is um they it was going to be three weeks to get an appointment for the vaccines and the heartworm medication okay it's getting a little too warm i'm not waiting three weeks like i'm not chancing them being without heartwarm medication for because they haven't had it in a couple months because we ran out and just haven't gotten over there yet so i'm like i'm not pushing it off now that it's warm and we're starting to see mosquitoes so i took them to the vet that i take the frogs to it's an exotic vet and they are still doing you drop the animal off and wait in your car and they call you so you're not even in the room when they do the exam with you so i don't like that at all like i don't know where you gave the dog the injection for the vaccine so i don't know like which area sore you saw right now because you got a vaccine i don't know because i wasn't in the room i'm not a fan of that whole thing so um but anyway they yeah the ear thing was weird to me usually though like i said it's typically going to be from diet so the meat isn't the issue and i've tried messing with meat as far as his itching we did like kind of an elimination type diet figuring out what that's how i figured out the peanut butter and the the coconut oil but he um it just he needs a vitamin mix in like it's not just your normal when i say mix in i don't mean supplement it's part of the base of the food that has the vegetables and stuff because i feed raw so you get uh i makes a five pound bag of raw meat and then i add in um the whatever the vitamin in that mix and that's what i'm going to have to get more of so or i think i'm going to try a different version so it's not like a vitamin supplement i'm looking for if that makes sense it's a the actual base for a raw diet that i'm and i could make my own he does well with sweet potatoes i would consider doing that but i don't think that's a complete diet as far as for the base anyway random um let's see where were we moody round said goodness me i don't need another medium that costs money but this looks like fun i need an art supply intervention i think this like this isn't gonna be something that i would be like selling or anything it's just it i'm definitely having fun this is an enjoyable project um no wait i'm gonna do that arm after we'll do this stays flat i'm trying to pay attention i'm thinking of it as like what is farthest back so that i can put that in and make it kind of flat and then have it stick out further the further up i come uh hello shiny said hi lisa i missed the beginning i got to see the neighbors brand new newborn duckling oh it kept hiding up my sleeve super cute ducklings are probably one of the cutest things ever we saw them yesterday we went to um tractor supply trading company whatever it's called and oh dear god they had the little ducks there my husband was squealing at them like he wants a duck so bad odd we not you can't have a duck where i live but um dear god they're adorable i'm going to add a little water and see if that on that area is lifting a bunch oops upside down i'm just gonna smudge that up this is man i'm liking this i wonder i don't know it just seems i was gonna say i wonder if if like the harder clays would work well for this this method the layering the soft like this this feels more more doable to me like i don't feel um i don't know i was intimidated by it it just seems easier okay let's go ahead and put in i'm gonna skip the arm and just put the octopus arm going through here paul said are you gonna watch justice league snyder cat version on hbo max i'm sure my husband will he'll let me know if it's any good i've been watching um what was it sherlock holmes with um doctor strange i don't know the actor's name um that's the been the thing everyone saw me try to find something to watch so it's like me and my husband don't do besides running around doing errands we do that together but like we don't go anywhere or do anything else so everyone so i'll try to find something that we'll both watch um but that one has been fun so it like when i'm finished working for the night on his days off um we've been watching that i have been this is this needs to be mushed more um i've definitely been enjoying that although it's funny so with um sherlock holmes that one of the things that i you guys hear me talk about a lot is how in tv and movies they represent art as certain ways where like this person used this brand of paint and i can recognize that color and i know that artist is the murderer and they did that crap on this one that yellow paint is i know what yellow paint that is you're just like it's spray paint like um it makes me laugh what like what does the average person think art like this misconception whoever the writers are like they do not understand the basics of art which is kind of funny benedict cumberbatch that is why i don't know his name because i can't even say it i love him trying to get my octopus arm rolled out smoothly without a bunch of bumps to make it easier for me later on wait is yipping and yipping in his sleep or kind of barking so cute there i need like a roller is there an easier way to do this yes there is i think i have found it get all these little pieces out of the way sushi is screaming his head off in the other room the funny thing is oh no matt just started work that makes sense i was gonna say that's in there with him why is he screaming that would be why because matt just went to work this is much better than using my hand like that's coming out way more even um let's see yeah they're really they're really chirping tonight kathy the frogs are noisy there we i go if that's no maybe a little thinner i probably can do this in two different sections we'll do that yeah this will work and i'll just flatten that out and then do a separate section where it curves up so his toes will go on this and the little suction cup guys so that will hide a lot of it his mouth i still have to do something with his face we've got some we've got some challenges going on there i made his head way too big the end needs to be thinner though can i just pull i wonder if it'll stretch without breaking off um where would that go i just skipped this should i keep my paintings until i can print them or take good pictures of them and sell them and meet or sell them immediately i mean it depends i sold my paintings for years before i could get good photos i like all of my old stuff from pre maybe 20 unless it pre-2014 i would say when did i get my first digital camera 2013 2014 then i was able to get good enough photos for prints anything before that i can't make prints of because my can't that was like before you'd have to hire someone to take decent enough photos and i couldn't afford it so i just sold the originals back then um unless it was small enough i could scan it like eight by tens eleven by fourteen i could scan or you know put it into two pieces and scan it and i could get away with that but the um stick on there the yeah i mean i would recommend get a good photo before you sell it but then if you've got an opportunity to sell something and you're like realistically i'm probably not making prints of this then i wouldn't really worry about it it depends on a few different factors there but yeah i do think you should make every attempt to get a good photo of yours because there are some of my paintings that i was very happy to this day would be very proud to show them off but i don't have good photos so in back then part of it like i said i just didn't have a good digital camera the it wasn't um like feasible for most people to have good cameras back then like you'd have to hire somebody and i didn't know anybody with it one place i went to to get scans of my work i think they were scans they were going to do this would have been around 2000 2000 2001. it was going to cost ten thousand dollars no sorry five thousand dollars for one painting was the estimate i'm like i'm a receptionist in an animal hospital right now like that's not even an ah like there's no way that can happen so um a lot of my stuff just didn't have um yeah so that was definitely um a challenge but i do wish that i had better photos of some of my stuff i just don't um so in that case i'm glad that i sold them they're you know i needed the money to go back towards the art business so i guess it it depends we'll go with that as my answer i need this to stretch out more still it's getting more well i guess if i put i can smooth it out after i get it mostly on there um speaking of prince how is going to a place like whoop that's grilled off smack to get a scan of a painting don't bother they're useless i tried getting prints the print quality was so terrible if i could even get them to do it some of the places wouldn't print they're like they assumed that the painting was copyrighted yeah by me like i own and so i had problems where they're like no we won't even do this we won't even make prints um because some of the stuff so back in the early 2000s i was teaching at michaels until like 2007 and i had needed prints to use for like a portfolio and to advertise my classes and i went in i don't remember it was officemax office depot one of those they refused to even work with me they would not make i had it printed i needed more of those prints no we won't do it and i'm like [Music] what why and looking back i suspect they think that it was copyrighted that it wasn't painted that i hadn't done that so that may have been um what happened there i don't know it was very that still was weird to me like because they wouldn't tell me why they just wouldn't do it it was very weird but no i wouldn't bother with anywhere like officemax or office depot um find if you find a small like mom-and-pop style print shop that might work but for the most part you're probably better off just getting you getting a digital camera and taking the photos yourself that's what what i do learn to to get those photos but i think in the long run and you don't have to spend an arm and a leg you can get a decent camera set up digital camera setup to get just for taking photos of your art for you know around 500 yes that's i know that's a lot of money but it's worth it that is something you want to invest in for your business for sure um where am i uh nancy said this live stream is such a perfect timing for me i just bought some air dry clay to use as bass relief is it base really for bass relief i don't even know how to say it um rabbit plaque for easter have fun yay yeah i'm really really um enjoying this this is definitely fun i'm enjoying this more than when i tried to do normal like sculpting things i kind of like the whole flat side like it makes it more manageable i guess like it doesn't it feels a little bit more overwhelming when i'm trying to sculpt all the way like all the sides here i'm only worrying about the front maybe that's why i'm liking it more okay so this will go flattened out a bit just let's see whatever their tools maybe the back of this stuff nope that didn't work i'm trying to smooth some of this out and get it to stick it's a little too it's still oh wait no right we can cut this i forgot uh do i have a smaller one did your hobby lobby stop giving the 40 discount on i don't know i haven't been to a hobby lobby in so long i don't like well i guess not that long it's been months but i don't know um i i'm assuming so i think that they all stopped doing it which is ideal so this is the thing that people i've talked about i talked about this in other live streams but the thing that people didn't realize is when they do the when they started doing those 40 coupons michael's i was working at michael's at the time when they started with the 40 and what they do is they raise the price on all their products to counter giving you a 40 off any item it was not saving anybody money and that was it's very deceiving it's very dirty like manipulative craft i don't like the idea of like or the whole this is on sale every other week then it's not really a sale that's just your price like you can't so i i didn't like that michaels and hobby lobby do that and a lot of stores do it like just just have a fair price all the time and like hobby lobby for example last time i was in there i was looking for a shelf for some of my plants and they had one shelf like not that big 175 was the full price because they know every other week it goes half price but even at half price it is way above any average and we're not talking quality like craftsmanship here we're talking cheap crap out of china this is not their their furniture their shelves they're not high quality or high and they're not worth even half that 175 it was it's insane what they want want for um to make up for those coupons you're not saving money it it's all what is it smoke and mirrors mirrors and smoke i don't know something magic um it's not real so yeah yeah cats are picked the sound of the frog oh i listen to this they chirp all day long and it is i love it i love the sound it's almost like having a canary um but without the mess of course i didn't have to feed fruit flies to a canary so if there was that um christine said i absolutely love hearing your frogs chirping reminds me of my childhood excursion in the countryside so much fun listening to everything outside your frogs are amazing thank you me too i love it i absolutely i love cr listening to crickets outside and these guys just sound like crickets on crack to me like they just they're fancier sounding crickets i absolutely love listening to them they're so just yeah and all day from like i wake up they're making this noise until i turn the lights out they will keep chirping really cool little frogs and they're so tiny to like they're tiny tiny to make this much noise is crazy to me sounds like the real forest to me now needs a healthier monkey next thing no we could just teach chicken or sushi to to make hell or monkey sounds like the rest of the house when you sushi especially has a very you feel like you're in the rain forest that's for sure sushi's my husband's indian ring neck that bird is loud chicken's loud too but cockatiels don't have like a real tropical sound they're just sound yeah my the only other pet that i plan well fish because i'm doing i'll do the bigger fish tank but um [Music] the uh bumble bee dart frogs i'm still waiting on those to become available and yeah that's about it i i've got enough critters to take care of and especially right now like the red-eye tree frogs take so much work because they're all in quarantine tanks i need to get a fecal in for murky if murky's comes back clean work you can move into the big tanks that'll make one less tank for me to clean it'll be easier but right now i've got every three different tanks that have to be cleaned daily because i'm paranoid about bacteria and all that so they get cleaned like because we had had health issues with them they get cleaned every day changing out the cricket it's a it's a whole it it is time consuming um for sure so i'm i'm kind of at that like yeah i think i hit my fill on on critters i'm good now um let's see clark finder outside her ring neck wasn't as loud as our son conyer oh nothing is as loud as a sun conyer like gorgeous birds but my gosh wow the sound like conyers are on my list of notes when my husband was looking at birds like because the birds are they're really hit like those are his critters i don't have the time necessary to keep a bird happy so there are those are his but um yeah sun conyers are a noise that you can't describe unless you've lived with one beautiful beautiful and such neat personalities too i do love son conyers they're just so noisy and it says maximizing your pet's talents yeah sushi makes some odd he sounds like a monkey already to me the way he he screams and yells in the other room like he's just he's funny it always cracks me up too to listen to matt in the other room talking to him what was it earlier i heard him say i was in clean up the frogs so it's in that end of the house and i hear matt saying what what's wrong with you there's nothing wrong with that or that's clean or something like that so i guess sushi was screaming and having a tantrum up by his water dish matt just changed it he didn't want to take a bath in that he wanted matt to take him to the sink in the bathroom so he could take a bath in the sink so sushi was having a tantrum like this isn't the water that i want i want a different bath so it's always funny to listen to matt talk to to the birds okay this is working pretty well let's see the only thing i'm not doing a good job of is making it get thin like well there are many things i'm not doing a good job with on this but the thing that like i'm not loving is getting i'm not making it thin enough on one end like how do you really thin out just is it just push more pressure on the other side kind of not really or maybe if i just trim some off i guess that would work trying to make the little arm get thinner as we go out i don't know if that's going to work for me there we go oh and i just kind of pull it tighter there's like already just the little bits i've done how much i've learned from the one project i'm really bad at like so when i'll try a new project one of the things they'll tell you like quilting start a small project i'm like not small i'm starting with a king size quilt um that is just kind of how i do things so um yeah same thing here this is not the most simple of projects but it's fun like i probably could have gone with an easier design okay stick wait maybe if i stick it under it there we go oh that worked oh genius actually less genius do you guys ever do that i'll think i'll do something like i'm so smart and i'm like oh i would have been smarter if i figured this out earlier though joseph said pull it like taffy as you roll it kind of comes apart i'll try that but it kind of comes apart like it breaks uh motaba said 5am here and i ran love you lisa thank you and oh you are up early i don't like early my neighbor makes fun of me because of how late he knows when i get up because his dogs mark when i let my dogs out so they make fun of me and matt both well matt works tonight later nights than i do obviously okay i am kind of surprised at how much i wonder if just doing the board first would have helped with adhesion i'm pretty sure just doing the board first would have been just a good idea in general because when i paint with the acrylics the paint's just gonna soak into this um so you're gonna get more of a wood staining effect than um actually you can just stay like that that's good enough i'm here let's add a little water under that good enough okay i'm still not thrilled with how i've got his little mouth your tube your head's too big move your mouth up cut some of this out like i keep shaving bits off and i still like haven't really hit the graphite lines like that's how way too big i made his head that's getting better speaking of frogs have any of mine woken up yet oh we've got a notification who woke up hold on oh that's probably just a cricket walking by on murky's nope murky's up can you guys see i don't know if you can even see the video of um hold on let's back that up can you see murky coming forward he's just waking or she is just waking up you can kind of see the movement she's so cute okay sorry no i'm not i'm not sorry at all that's adorable let's see if my color morph the new ones are waking up yet probably not no oh horizon looks like the albino's eyes are open i can't really see the purple one from here so i don't know because he's behind the leaves so i don't know if that guy's waking up yet anyway moving on let's work let's see if i can form the face bit better if i keep messing with it sooner or later i'll be happier with it this does stay to where i mean you can manipulate it for qui quite a bit after this is this is good um the pencil sketch looks like a human carrying a ginormous frog let's form that over oh that works oh that works well it's like a little rolling pin see again i'd go oh i'm a genius for figuring that out but then i'm like why didn't i think of that earlier i would have been more genius if i had thought to do that see some of this still probably be mushed down okay let's leave that a bit and work on his arms and little toes screen is frozen is mine why is oh no why don't do that did it just leave you better not have lit left why are you trying to no it's not made for kids i've already checked that how many times do i need to check that it's a weird thing when you use restream no it looks like we're okay okay i think we're good okay let's give him his little arm here this will look really different when we paint it too next week i'm looking forward to that part i think i'm going to do it kind of like a wood stain where you i'm just going to do everything with a dark wash and then dry brush over it is what my plan is a little bit of water to make that stick better this pile that i pulled out it's not drying too fast so i i mean i can feel it starting to dry a little but it's working fine for this i wasn't sure how that was going to work um [Music] hold on okay you already deleted that nick never mind i'm seeing it in restream i'm like get rid of this person uh lori said i too love your frog soothing do you still use finer in america for parts i do um i have not uploaded anything new in a long time because about this time last year i went to upload stuff and you couldn't log into your account and everyone was having this problem but they weren't responding to people like the owner i guess there was something shady going on with the owner where he was just like not he's just like yeah whatever but i mean i still got paid when somebody bought the prints people were still getting their prints i just couldn't like access whatever but supposedly things are getting better with them or they were trying to i don't know if they really did but yeah so i have no idea like i haven't tried to upload anything in a while it's one of those things like i need to do but also like i don't have time to deal with this right now i'll do it later type things so technically yes but i don't know if it's still good um [Music] when it dries does it feel like plaster i don't know if i know what plaster feels like when it dries so i'm not sure there because it's not and this hasn't even gotten to the point of drawing so i wouldn't know anyway okay the little toes are weirdly easy to do with that in their little sticky feet no i do not need a kitty um i have plants and i have greyhounds who eat kitties so a kitty does not fit cats i like when other people have cats they don't fit like i'm too weird like litter boxes i i had them before but um i got really neurotic as i got older and like litter boxes are not for me um the eating my plants are not for me my greyhound's eating the kitty not for me so i like better when other people have them and i can pet them and then they don't live in my house and eat my plants um phyllis said it will stay stuck to the board once it's dry or will it slide off and be separate i have no idea apparently it's not it's supposed to be on a non or a non-porous surface which this is very for us so i'm not sure i i don't know oh this one's just the toe um if mine comes off i'll probably just throw some glue on there and try to get it to stay i mean i wouldn't sell it because i don't trust it not to fall off oh patty because no i didn't um that you didn't offend me trust me you said uh screen just got clearer now now i can see the proper sketch please do not take it as a reflection of your artistic abilities well he's he's don knotts is what he should look like i didn't mean him to look like don knotts but he does this however is still i'm still like trying to figure out how i want i think his lips need to be thinner i don't know i just keep fussing over that okay let's see we've got some little toes over here actually i don't know why i'm using that whole thing i don't need that oops i'm just i'm using the condensation off my iced coffee to add a little water to make stuff stick i'm a pro seriously my pro tools coffee condensation so on the photo you're only really seeing two toes there but i think i'm putting three on mine just because my brain says it should be three i want there to be three so there's gonna be three okay so next we've got these toes um actually i should probably do the longer toe and then the little toe being at the end i'm so looking forward to painting this next week this is going to be fun i'm already like thinking like how am i gonna when i think i will do it like a wood stain make everything dark and then go on top but this will be cute yeah my plan if it starts to come off i'll just glue it because this is definitely going on my wall somewhere um let's see edgardo said i kind of want to sculpt a frog now yeah it's fun uh dee said sorry i've already talked about it how long does it take to dry i'm not sure uh joseph you said 24 hours but it starts to dry sooner right um sarah said such a fun project are you going to paint it i am i'm going to paint it next week and i would love to see zombie snail sculpture i was going to do zombie snail tonight decided to do something that would take a little bit more but yes zombie snail was on that's why i was didn't want to waste my sculpey because i like why i wanted it in the bag before it dried out because i i'm going to do zombies now for sure maybe if the painting because i don't think the painting is going to take that long next week maybe um we can do zombie snail too or at least get him started i'm so entertained by this oh he needs a whole his little arm um nick said i wonder if you could just over the whole thing before you paint it oh that might work that might be a good idea uh this thin two hours to the touch maybe six hours to fully cure is what joseph said let's see that little toe we'll wrap that around there and we'll turn this into his arm like doing it in pieces like this i'm it's not hard i thought this would be harder i mean i'm still struggling i bit my tongue struggling to get the um the shape of the face but part of that too i think when i paint it that's going to make a difference 1 2 3 rock fans said i never attended this kind of art before but watching this definitely is encouraging me to try it it looks like a blast yeah yeah i'm liking the air sculpey better than it's easy definitely easier for me anyway than the other how about zombie snail gorging on easter eggs oh that would be cute should we do that for easter um i could use this stuff again we could do a zombie snail since we do them in different mediums apparently i did last time that would be really cute okay let's see we've got oops i need the toe bean there stick and then we need another toe that one is kind of drying out more it was really thin so i don't know if i need more water there it's funny people will ask in some of the frog groups they want um because dark frogs are known to be fairly noisy and these are some of the the noisiest but asking for frogs that are quiet and people are trying to get quiet i'm like i want the loudest i can find uh would painting the pieces beforehand work no i do not think so at all um is that tool you're using good for applying masking fluid it just came to my mind sorry i i tried something like that with masking fluid it wasn't very i was not successful i'm not saying it can't be done i was not successful okay stick in there fill that little spot in who's crying in your sleep gibson gibson he's not waking up i'm pretty sure it's him he is out gibson gibson gibson come there you go stay you can stay there that command he woke up to and then he groans as he goes back to sleep lazy dog zombies even zombie snails only eat brains they well they could be rotten eggs uh rena said uh good to go to work thanks for the fun thanks for joining rhonda okay so that's good now we just need to start putting the little round sections for some of the octopuses a little suction cup guys technical terms are not technical terms susan said your frog is looking fabulous gotta run and do a little exercise before my life gets in the way and i become a couch potato creating you know if you have a good night thanks for joining have fun exercising i have to start getting back into that myself it's it's getting nice weather i i can't use the excuse that it's too cold to walk gibson anymore he says my excuses are bs anyway so this will look better when the color separated for sure because right now it just looks like little circles all over everything hey frida frida frida i can't say things i mispronounce everyone's names i should look at that as a term of endearment if i get your name wrong right i would be more concerned oops these aren't wanting to stick i don't think that's gonna work i'm definitely noticing like i can tell where it's really starting to dry and not wanting to stick as well maybe i should get this area wet before i even try sticking anything on there oops i just dropped a piece on the floor roomba can get it stick in there i used to do um these sculpture things and they weren't practical to ship so i stopped doing it but i would get these ready-made like wood bird houses that you can paint and i would use a palm i used normal sculpey though the heavier stuff and i would do a mermaid tail sticking out so it looked like she was swimming into the birdhouse and then i would decorate the bottom with like seashells and ocean themed colors and the same things and put sand glue sand to the bottom it looked of the birdhouse around the base it would those were really cute i wonder if my mom still has one of hers i think she has one with the lighthouse still that's probably good enough with the little circles because these are getting so tiny i don't know if i should put a few more out here maybe we don't want to stick anymore though that's definitely getting to be an issue there we go well i have a watercolor project that you use also watercolor pencils with yeah probably i'm not sure when but i'm sure i will i actually want to do some projects with watercolor and just colored pencil on top hi gizelle um what is too cold i heard that it was in the 50s last week huh wait what is too cold it's was in the high 60s or the low 70s today it's getting down to um tonight we'll be in the 40s so i had to bring my adenium inside but we've only got a few more days where the nights get into the 40s and then more likely than not will stay warm enough that i can leave my plants out i'm at anything below 50 my plants have to come in like certain plants have to be brought in our weather has been really nice like our trees are all starting to leaf out everything's everything's starting to grow our graph my grass is even turning green digital versus um versus traditional what is my take i think that they are both forms of art i think for some reason artists seem to like take one side or the other and i don't understand that like i've painted digitally and i've painted um traditionally and they both take skill they both like you're still painting either way so i'm not one who does not find value in digital painting i definitely think there is um they're i mean they're just different mediums is all all it really is i really like both i like working digitally um i don't do it enough wait no you're a toe you don't get a dot octopus parts get little holes you know your toes your octopus give them a little bit of shape there okay let's see if i can do something about his face that needs to be smoothed out too i think i need to go more up and remove some is there like just something to cut hold on i'm grabbing a razor blade i know that's not part of this but i think i built his mouth to where it's sticking out so far i don't know i just don't love it i want to kind of there's tape all over this i used it to open a box that's better i'm not sure if it looks the same for you guys there um but in person that was like just a little too much casanova back there agrees these little tools are pretty cool how weird look at how it's leaving that red on it though the color this is why with erasers like if you're working on um white paper do not use red erasers um purple erase colored erasers look i don't know can you see the red that's coming off on his mouth stuff like this will leave color here it doesn't matter because i'm painting over it but that is something you want to be aware of do not use colorful erasers in your work on white paper because that can leave color on there that you do not want that's part of it this needs to smooth out i wasn't sure that i would get the sculpting part of this done tonight i'm pretty pretty excited about this um yeah i think one of the things with the digital um painting the only thing that i find to be negative is you don't really get an original so some people were like well you get the original file it's a file not the same you can duplicate it it's the same it's the same thing so that's the only thing that i would argue and i've heard people go but they got the original file i'm it's not the same i'm sorry it's not the same as a hard copy painting so that would be the one thing that's different do i am i saying one's better than the other no i'm just saying that when you have an original painting a one-of-a-kind it's not the original painting you can have as many prints as you want but they're prints versus the actual original and so that i think is a bit of a challenge when it comes to um to for digital artists is people want that origin you know you're not really getting that so that would be that's really the only thing that i think is somewhat of a negative and it's not a negative towards the artist at all it's just that there is a difference between a hard copy original versus a print original now you can always do you know numbered prints and signed a number and that that is or maybe you're only making one print and not or one big huge quality that this is the only one that's going to be on this service i don't know maybe you know there may be workarounds but i definitely think that that is different and i understand where where as far as like pricing and all that would be a challenge for sure because people want that one-of-a-kind original and there is a difference between a print and an original so like prints don't devalue the original because it is one you you're you're not reproducing it that is the original so that's where it's a little bit um off i guess with or different with traditional versus um digital and joseph said you gave your your frog a lip augmentation a little plastic surgery see what you did there um do i like amy adams lois lane i don't like lois lame as a character there's never been a lois lane that is the most annoying like i'm gonna do the stupidest freaking things and i'm act like i'm so smart but i'm gonna put myself in these situations that i'm definitely gonna i i have never been a lois lane fan of any not like an issue with the actresses an issue with the character i don't like the character lois lane i think she's dumb and she does dumb things and she's annoying and she has this era of superiority except she's dumb so i just i don't i'm not a lois lane fan um let's see joshua said i really really recommend trying my jello mijello mission gold watercolor paints highly pigmented and wood fit yourself i'll have to look into those paula said how about an original digital design like a logo or a trademark design but see no yeah that's definitely if i'm gonna make a logo for somebody or myself i'm doing it digitally but because you have to do so many changes people will always want changes when it comes to logos and stuff but i mean it that's still different than a traditionally painted i mean those don't i don't even compare those honestly like those are there's a difference between like i'm painting a landscape or this versus a logo like that's they're not really in the same ballpark [Music] um bethany said i think realism is much easier on paper with colored pencil easier than digital it's just how i draw a guess and that's going to depend from person to person i mean some people think watercolor is easy some people think it's too hard and oil painting's easier so that's just going to depend on the specific artist i think um how do i manage to keep up with all of the mediums that i work with i just rotate when i'm like oh i haven't done inktense in a while then i'm going to i try to fit that in but i try to rotate i would say colored pencil and acrylics are the two that i use the most but i do try to rotate a lot um the mediums that i'm using part because i get bored so i'm always going to want to do different mediums anyway but part is that i know oh you know what when i stop looking at the photo and start thinking of what i know a red eye tree frog looks like it's like oh i need to change this um but i try to mix stuff up for patrons because i know not everybody works in like acrylics so i don't want to do too many acrylics in a row like i try to keep variation in there it's kind of a little boxy why do i have incoming calls at 10 o'clock at night are you kidding me right now and of course from riverside california i don't live in california hold on we block this person before they keep calling i guess they will and you are blocked um oh who do we have moving oh we have movement on the new frogs let's see who's up oh um the little albino is up and moving around she's going straight to the food dish typical she she's i say she i don't know if it's a male or female but that frog is not shy about the food within day two was already eating so that's that's very good now i need to get the purple one to eat okay i have a night camera on them because the the light like you don't want to really disturb them i want them to feel like they're in the room by themselves you would have a little nose flatten out the top here there we go that is what i was missing is this flat area now i feel like i'm getting somewhere i'm trying to smooth out parts of this i'm really impressed like this is much so much easier to work with than i thought it was going to be i didn't think this would come i mean not that this is amazing but i still thought it would be a lot worse than this um he needs a set of antenna um paul said and she got pregnant with batman's me what i don't even i don't know any of that stuff i don't really follow that my husband pro i'm sure is aware of all that stuff he's big he came home with a lot of comic books today it's wednesday is comic book day but yeah i don't i'm always the person rooting for lois lane to meet her end because i can't stand the character and like i said it doesn't matter who the the um actor or actress is who plays her i just do not like she reminds me of someone i know in person who i avoid so maybe that's what it is but that like i make the worst choices but i think i'm really smart and i'm gonna put myself in super terrible situations i mean the person i know isn't as bad as lois lane but still i'm just doing a little carving this does continue to like reform and carve it was right it said it would do that as it dried that was true oops lindsay makes you want to whip out the old clay and play good do it this is fun i am thoroughly enjoying this i really want to paint it and wait till next week we will do that next week just kind of reforming little bits in here um yeah paul said yeah me too lisa i want to love lois but i i can't i'm so sorry you know and i love superman i like the character superman i'm just like why would she be your choice like i don't i'm not i'm not seeing it um hi sandra don't touch the mouth it's perfect okay fine fine i'm just kind of smoothing it out and like smoothing the skin on his belly a little bit areas where my fingernails that is definitely one thing my fingernails are kind of a problem in this they're making little fingernail markings all over the place my nose are short too i'm just apparently not good at controlling that and i'm moving stuff off the edge just cleaning it up i didn't even use these tools this is so small i'm not sure like for what i did how these little i'm not sure how these would have been helpful maybe they would have i don't know this is really and look i have this whole block like this is a bit this thing is a ton i have a huge block to still make more with so yeah maybe we'll do zombie snail i think that will be cute for easter okay we'll leave him alone you guys have any questions i can we can chat for a few minutes while we wrap this up wow i'm done early never done early on the friday streams or no wednesday i don't even know what day it is don't worry lin i'm not messing it up i'm just smoothing out some of the lines still i don't feel like i could no no i'm get i'm done okay he's gonna stay we can see the little sculpture there the lighting's kind of washing that out but you can see his shape or how much that's i'm trying okay the light is making that there we go you can kind of see how thick that is on there it's sticking okay i don't know if that will end up being an issue or not if it'll try to come off but i mean it's there um lindsay that looks really cool actually yeah i'm really surprised like i'm super i still can smooth out my fingernail marks i'm just adding a little bit of water and kind of smoothing but meh probably won't be as bad or noticeable when you paint it or maybe it'll be worse i don't know thanks giselle um can you use water to smooth out the clay with a soft brush yeah that's um i was just using my finger to do that with and it does work pretty well really all those marks are just my fingernails that i can't control apparently this is really bumpy in there on his eye there oh that worked really well okay i'm just using the condensation oh my god my iced coffee to do this that's a little weird yeah this i like this like if i were to buy myself clay i think i would go with this over polymer we'll see how it dries it's it feels airy like lighter motaba i apologize again i'm sure i'm butchering your name says it's close to persian new year so happy new year peace to all people you too yay jason said lisa use the other tools to smooth out your marks from your nails i'm afraid i'd mess them up like i've always used these to shave areas off what other tools would work for that kind can using the back end of it ooh that works i got most of them smoothed out oh the back end of this brush thingy is working pretty well like the size of those i'm just not sure i can control filling in little areas i missed or smoothing it out i guess i'm really interested to see how this feels that's not only to stick well let's try more water i might have to like that's drying there and it's definitely not sticking to this so the whole knob part yeah i don't know why they did the wood on this i mean i guess with the wood you can paint it but probably just so it would have i'm going to try um the gesso like like nick said i think first and see if that helps um anything that seems loose when it's dry i probably will put a little bit of i don't even know what kind of glue would work well i'll have to i don't know we'll have to play with that thank you christine you said your frog turned out so well i can't wait to see how you paint it next week i'm excited to paint it so hopefully everything dries in place well we may have to i'll let you know if i glue it or what i do to get things to stick i'm even thinking um like the gesso just using that almost as a glue too where if it's starting to lift like if the toe comes off the other but i bet if i put gesso in there it'll help it to stick so that should should work elmer's yeah that may be good too well paint stick well to elmer's do you know lin um i'm not even sure wait is are you gonna flip on your back no not quite of course when i put on the the hound cam you guys sleep right side up like normal dogs so um okay well i guess we're done i mean we've got five minutes but they're just gonna stare at each other awkwardly i think this is this is fun see this is what i love so much about smart art box because you try like i would never go buy this for myself i would never would have thought to because i wouldn't know what to buy well apparently not wood boards because it says not to use that but i wouldn't um he's missing this little froggy no this is his arm right here it'll be more noticeable right there when it's dry he's got an arm there and an arm here and then there's his knee back there i don't know if you can see it there in there arm arm knee back leg but um like this is like i said this is one of those things i would not have purchased on my i it wouldn't even cross my mind like that's well i don't sculpt or do any of that but it's fun to try different things and especially i think as artists in general if you do stuff that's super realistic like i typically do you can certainly get to where you're almost burnt out or there's just that pressure always to try to make everything perfect i'm not worried about that here i just get to have fun and that's my favorite thing about the smart art boxes i feel like when i'm playing with something new like this and you don't have to do that with smart art box just get yourself some some random new supply but do it maybe just a sketchbook that you're not worried about what comes out what things come out like and just experiment with something play with something i like it feels more like a break like something a fun new toy versus okay i'm working if that makes sense so definitely is a lot of fun um you know when he had walked in a circle and laid back down such an active guy yeah wade is the laziest dog i think i've ever had he is not ever active gibson is more high strung but wade is more i'm just gonna sleep all the time he'll get up a couple times a day and play with his toys he loves toys he'll run around with them and toss them around and play and then pass us back out with them all stacked up on the bed with him but that's about the extent from wade um very very inactive dog gibson definitely gibson's my active boy more active anyway um let's see jury art said is that air dry clay you can wet the surface first to make the clay adhere to the adhere better yeah i didn't know that it didn't give me those that is the instruction this is sculpey yeah air dry clay so i mean probably gonna try to glue it because we got this far but good to know um tacky glue okay i may have that i'll have to see um okay oh no we've got more let's see you can elevate your work surface with this to help your back you can even elevate your work surface yeah but look the problem is if i look down at all so yeah this is like well this is actually higher than a normal table because it's a it's technically a kitchen island but um in my

later bye you", "4XXky5Mo5p8": "hi my name is Shahnaz and I'm the founder of knit aid a social enterprise set up to help knitters help others in need today I'm going to be showing you how to make a chunky blanket made up of knitted squares we are going to be collecting these squares sewing them up and making them into blankets to send to refugee families who have fled war-torn countries and are now living in cold camping conditions in Europe I'm going to be showing you how to cast on do the knit stitch cast off and sew your squares together I'll be using 15 millimeter or us 19 sized needles crazysexycool and a sewing needle let's get started so first of all we're going to cast on take our full of wool find the end of the yarn which can be found just tucked in the middle there so to cast on we're going to do a slip knot to do a slip knot we're going to do loop as if to make a knot and take this loop through and pull it tight like that and that's a slip knot then we're going to put the slip knot onto our needle and that makes our first stitch now we're going to cast on using the basic cast on method to do this we need to hold the yarn in your hand like this and wrap the yarn around your thumb like that it's almost like a little pointer like that and with the end of your needle we need to go under that loop there and put it onto the needle and that's your first Caston so just to repeat you hold the yarn like this wrap it around your thumb and pull the needle underneath we're going to be casting on 14 stitches to make a square of 20 centimeters wide which is around seven and a half inches so again so now it's going to check that we've got 14 stitches there now to knit we take this needle with all the stitches and put it onto our left hand and take the empty needle into your right hand now to do your first knit stitch you'll need to go into this first loop here like this so from front to back so that it makes a nice cross like that and with your left hand hold both needles and with your right hand you take the yarn under and over that needle and hold the yarn needle together with the right hand needle you start pulling it out from underneath and pushing it on to the top to make another cross and with that you take that stitch off the needle and that's your first knit stitch so I'll show you again so you go from front to back like this until you make a cross hold both needles of your left hand and with your free hand you take the yarn under over start to pull that bottom needle out so that it's sitting on the top like that close and off that's your second stitch so again on the front to back and don't over pull it out on top and you repeat that over and over again until you finished all right so make sure that you're always working to the point of the needle where it starts tapering off you don't want to be working too far to the top or to bite down the needle because you'll find it quite tricky to work with or that the stitches just fall off and then the the last ditch which was your Slipknot that you're part of a start you do exactly the same so nothing different with that one and there we go we have our first knitted row now to knit our next row we take the needle and turn it round so that all the stitches are in our left hand again and the empty needle is in our right hand now these little bubbles here are your last knitted row so we don't want to be knitting into those we want to be knitting into that stitch there and then we continue as we did the last row when we knit every row the stitch is called the Garter stitch and that's the stitch that we use to make this funky so we knit every row until your piece measures 20 centimeters in length so your finished square will be 20 centimeters wide by 20 centimeters in length so it's going to look a little bit odd now a little bit uneven but don't worry keep knitting I promise it will come out looking really nice last it's there so there's our square there 20 centimeters wide and 20 centimeters long to cast off take the needle with all the stitches in your left hand as usual and the empty needle in your right hand and now to cast off we need to always have two stitches on our right needle so we're going to knit two stitches one two with those two stitches we're going to take the first stitch and pull it over the second stitch so then we've cast off one stitch there and we have one stitch left on our right hand needle so to repeat that we want two stitches back on this needle so we'll knit one more so we have two stitches on that needle and with the tip of our left hand needle we take that first stitch and pop it right over the second stitch so we knit another one to two stitches on our right hand needle and then with the point of the left a needle take it under the first stitch and pull it over the second stitch so here you can see you've started to cast off your cast off three stitches there so keep going until the end of the row and the last stitch you knit again and you pull that first stitch over the second stitch so then you're left with one stitch on your needle like that all right so we're just gonna remove that needle you have a look at our square and that's your cast off stitches there cut the yarn about an arm's length and with that final loop we'll take the end of the yarn and put it through just pull it tight that's our square so now we're going to sew our squares together if you think a large sewing needle gonna thread the yarn into the needle so when we knit our guard to stitch this horizontally like this when we stitch our squares together we're going to alternate gutter stitch so that one of them is vertical and the other one's horizontal so say your two squares together you want to identify the little bumps right on the edge of this piece and the vertical bumps on the edge of this piece so we're going to be going from these bumps into these bumps so starting with the right hand side but I needle straight through that first loop there and then bring that yarn over to your other square and put it through this first loop here with the next square you go through the loop on the edge there and then you go to the alternating loop on the other side and then the final stitch on each side just finish up the last little oops that's now really neatly stitched together and with these ends we just want to weave them in so in weaving in the ends I'm just sort of hiding them in the the original pattern of the garter stitch now tie a knot and cut it off thirty five squares later here's all we made earlier it's all ready to center a refugee camp in Europe", "t7woYkjhlxM": "then what many people have described as a decree that is straight out of taliban's playbook there are reports that have emerged that school girls in afghanistan who are above the age of 12 will no longer be allowed to sing in public ceremonies that are attended by men now this was of course a social media post that was put out by an iran network and that's now been subsequently reported extensively in pretty much all media portals in afghanistan the order has been issued by afghanistan's ministry of education which goes on to state that singing teams of girls under the age of 12 should be trained only by women trainers at schools men are not allowed to train them as per instructions reports further state that the school principals have been warned that they would be punished if they were to violate this order now according to the education ministry there is however an exception that has been made girls above the age of 12 may sing at events which have 100 percent women in attendance now defending the move the ministries spokesperson najiba aryan has said that many families have in fact complained of high school and middle school students of being overburdened with studies but what has prompted this bizarre order is still not clear because the ministry claims that it is because the students are overburdened with studies but some say that this is the ideas of taliban that are now slowly creeping back in the administration the boundary to reply to all government and private schools has fueled outreach there are critics who've described the move as imposing limitations on the civil liberties that are enjoyed by women and girls in afghanistan many have said that this is a clear-cut adoption of taliban's policies and afghanistan's ministry of education had earlier announced to shift primary students both boys and girls to mosques led schools the announcement was later cancelled after

on to discussion and questions and so dina would you like to start by by reading a passage for us thanks thank you ellen can you hear me yes yes yes okay great um well thank you for that wonderful introduction and thank you guys for having me it's a real pleasure um bro and i didn't realize you'd also been at mcdowell now now i have all kinds of questions this is like a very good place for writers um so i'm going to read from the beginning of my book uh the book we use together uh stories of other people and my own story but it starts off with my own and the day that you know or the time when we became refugees so i'll dive right in we became refugees somehow it felt more settled than what we had been for the past 10 months hiding out in the united arab emirates there we were illegal all the same dizzying displacement uncertainty and need but we had to find our own shelter without a state to say yes we will be responsible for you we were so unmoored it was hard to fathom a next step maybe that's why every move had been last minute someone's kindness or a stroke of luck miracles and so when we landed in rome in winter 1989 i bubbled with love for italy and every italian it was unlike anything i had felt for dubai this airport was so european so brimming with leisure i wanted to run to every kiosk and smell the western chocolate and touch the expensive fabrics but a man in a black suit held a sign with mama's name and we were led away to a car my mother younger brother and i bundled in the back seat cold and dirty from the long flight i tried to stay awake for for the ride through the italian countryside finally after an hour we spotted a house on a hill breaking up the rolling valleys in the distance we had been told that we'd be taken to a good refugee camp a temporary safe space for transients seeking asylum outside of italy it was called barba and it had once been a hotel the italian government had leased this building to house the likes of us political and religious asylum seekers and passers through with particular need elderly family or children it was exciting to watch barba appear and to know that even though our clothes and bedding and daily routines would be those of refugees though we would be confined there our house would be on a hilltop in the husk of a pretty hotel we pulled up a winding a hill road after dinner time our room was small perhaps even smaller than the than the cockroach hostel in sharjah and we had no fridge or hot plate this time only a bathroom and a bed we sat on our bed and wondered where we'd get money if we'd find friends among our neighbors would we meet farsi speakers how long would we stay which country would finally take us we wondered about that night's meal we considered walking to a store in montana then someone knocked an italian woman young with a punkish haircut gestured to us that we had missed the dinner call that night for the first time i saw the canteen a glass circle overlooking all that lush valley now empty and dark in the morning it would fill up with displaced families like ours iranians afghans russians romanians it would buzz with many languages many kinds of prayers there would be children mothers grandmothers but for now the room was silent we ate bowls of leftover pasta and semi-dark and heavy silence and thank god that meals were provided here despite its grand skeleton hotel barba was a refugee camp and we had to stay put as we had no status in italy we were served soup pasta coffee bread at precise times each day and we sat in the winter chill praying that by summer we'd be gone from there every day when the postman arrived we would swell outside the male cubbies jostling for a good view we wanted to know who got his letter today when someone did the crowd would hush as he opened the envelope fingers trembling eyes scanning then either wept quietly into his palm muttering curses or loudly on his knees thanking his god everyone was frantic for a letter from america or england or australia or canada roomy anglophone countries a letter would mean the wait was over our lives could now begin in the absence of work or school all we did was dream a maddening state and battle loneliness we ate with people from our own countries we prayed in our own ways some before eating sitting heads bowed some after standing holding hands on cool days the children snuck in a neighboring orchard just to steal unripe peaches and plums because our tongues were itching for something sour and there was nothing else to soothe that craving i tried to teach some english words to a handful of burly russian men skipping around the yard in my pink skirt and pointing to a tree a fence a chador the men indulged me by taking notes we fought boredom in increasingly desperate ways an afghan grandmother collected bricks from a nearby construction site and carried them back to her room under her chador her daughter read our fortunes from leftover sludge in mugs of instant coffee a young iranian soldier with his face half bleached from a wartime chemical burn taught us how to play soccer despite his new kind of whiteness he was as interesting to me as the princes in my story books perhaps that perhaps i sensed that he was attracted to mama and wasn't she just me in another body here was a man who wanted us who wanted to play games with me to make me laugh and then look out of the corner of his eye to see if my mother was watching we had left baba behind in isfahan i began to understand bit by bit over years that i would never live with my father again i was beginning to understand other things too to peek out from inside my own skin i spent time with loving grandmothers from many countries i joined mama for tea and oranges in rooms of russian christians i read english books and played hopscotch and became obsessed with having a home again with ending the wander days rooting and with the mysteries of adulthood i craved everyone's stories i was becoming some later version of myself gorgeous thanks so much dina um and now rowan i think you're going to read us some of your novel styling days um would you like to okay so thank you ellen for introducing us supposed to beautifully india that was wonderful it's very hard to go afterwards um so as i mentioned i've edited a book that was mixed fiction and non-fiction and poetry and i've written two novels and i thought the easiest thing to do would be to read to you from the beginning of my most recent novel so this is two pages in so it is all you really need to know is that there's a woman named reina and she's standing on the george washington bridge in new york at night the river was as dark as poor tarmac they said that when a body fell onto water from this height it was like hitting the sidewalk golden gate had nets to stop jumpers she imagined the feeling of a rope cutting into arms and legs your body would flop like a fish how long did they have to lie there before someone scooped them out there was nothing like that here people said that drowning was a good death that the tiny alveoli of the lungs filled like a thousand water balloons she lifted one purple flip-flop and dropped it over the water she didn't hear it hit the shape simply vanished into the black shadow that was when the lights got brighter and the voice mail and certain lobbed into her ears ma'am step away from the rail the police car's lights flashed blue and white and red once she'd had an ice pop those colors and the sugary water had pooled behind her teeth ma'am step away from the rail good evening officer have i done something wrong mina asked please get into the car he said there were two of them the other was younger and he was speaking into a radio it was hard to make out his words over the wind and traffic was he talking about her this is a public walkway mina said it was open i haven't done anything wrong ma'am get into the car i don't want to get into the car look i was just getting some air i was thinking i'll go home now ma'am don't make me come over there mina had never been in a police car she'd read once that the back doors only open from the outside who knew what would happen if she got into the car the window was rolled down and the cop stuck his head out there was a lump on his upper lip a pimple perhaps where are your shoes it's hot out she said where are your shoes i don't want to tell you anything about my shoes she said i haven't done anything wrong i'm an american citizen ma'am where are your shoes she lifted up the single flip-flop she had left the other one broke she said behind him other cars continued into the night should they even notice her standing in the dark a small woman with bare legs and feet she was aware of the blowing bruise she'd caught banging her knee on the subway door in the shower that morning she'd skipped shaving her legs in the beam of his headlamps could he could he see her hair standing up in splinters ma'am i really need you to get into the car i can't leave you here what if something happened to you in his voice she heard the insinuation that normal women innocent women didn't walk alone on bridges at night i'm fine she said nina knew her stubby ponytail was frizzy bleaching black to marilyn monroe blonde had taken four rounds of peroxide now it stood up in breaking strands if she conditioned it would this cop think she was sane if she blow-dried it would he have let her go home and of course there were the tattoos twining up her arms we can talk about it in the car he said her shattered friend bent over the radio lips to the black box mina was tired it was the heat or perhaps the wind so she got into the car the seat was smooth someone must have chosen the fabric specially this must be wipeable and disinfectable people probably spat on the seat they probably pissed on purpose and by mistake between the front and back seats was a grill she would not be able to reach out to touch the curve of the cop's ear or straighten his blue collar the flip-flop lay across her knees the cops wanted to know her name address phone number and social security she gave them we're taking you to mount sinai said the cop i was just going for a walk clearing my head i don't need to be in a hospital i was just clearing my head damn repeating yourself as a habit of the guilty mina tried to slow her breath see it from my point of view he said you're walking alone on the bridge at night i can't let you out i don't know what would happen only then did she understand that they must do this every night drive back and forth across the bridge looking for people like her i have to go to work tomorrow she said my husband will want to know where i am please please just let me go to the subway we can't do that ma'am the car left the bridge and fell back into manhattan she kept telling them she wasn't trying to cause trouble she said it so many times that the word trouble began to sound like burble or bubble heat rose in her eyes she pushed the water off her face finally they agreed she could call her husband and they would go to the paramedics park near the bridge if the paramedic said she was okay she could go home oscar she said oscar i need you to come get me they won't let me leave until you come get me slow down he said where are you what's going on she tried to explain about the cops i don't know how she'd been clearing her head and now they wanted her to take her to the hospital about how she needed him to be there the ambulance was parked under the highway was it like the cops always there always waiting for people like her they got put out of the car and opened the door he didn't cough her or even touch her but her breath came double fast he led her to the ambulance the steps into the vehicle were constructed from a steel mesh they hurt her feet a hand reached out to help her it was soft and firm and female it was attached to his slim arm and a body and scrubs the collar of the swimming pool where she'd first made her tentative laps as a preschooler mina smiled into the face and the face smiled back please take a seat the paramedic said gesturing to the stretcher a sheet was draped over the end which made it look almost like a real bed i mean i sat on the edge can you wait here the paramedic asked we're going to talk for a minute meena nodded before she understood that we met the cop he stood on the sidewalk his legs spread for the first time she saw his gun it was no bigger than a bottle of coca-cola then the paramedic shut the door that that had to be a good sign they trusted her to be alone her body was reflected as a peachy blur in the metal drawers the sour light marked every pore every scratch on her legs the tiny specks of dirt under her toenails the paramedic returned with a clipboard mina noticed how pretty she was and how neat her hair the paramedics lipstick lips were lipstick to dark red mina had once owned a dress almost that color oxblood the store called it nice lipstick mina said thank you apparently smiled i just want to go home did that sound too desperate so i'll stop there thank you so much such compelling writing and i was really right there in in the scenes of both of your your readings thank you so much um so questions uh i have many and i'm sure the audience will have many too i thought it'd be nice to start by asking you both a bit about your non-fiction works and then moving on to fiction and perhaps discussing the relationship between the two uh so first of all with uh non-fiction work both of you used this form to explore the experiences of migration diaspora and their impact on personal identity dina through the ungrateful refugee and rowan with the go home anthology although that of course includes fiction and poetry as well as essays and so i wonder could you both tell us a bit about how you approached these books and why you chose the forms you chose for those and what you were setting out to do with those books uh that was new um do you know would you like to start sure um i think well the way that i got into non-fiction was kind of i mean i guess it was very organic and long-coming because um you know for me non-fiction started with essays about my life as a refugee and and my own experiences but for a long time i had already been writing fiction about that and it felt like a safe space it felt like uh you know i could hide behind this veil and still talk about these important things or you know kind of show particular kinds of stories but you know for me in in 2015 everything changed i mean for everyone everything changed but you know the refugee crisis came into the spotlight and people um were talking about it in a way that i wanted to talk about also as myself um and then also another thing that happened is that just in my writing journey and also in my life i became more outward looking and i decided that you know i need to stop just focusing on stories that are drawn from my own experience and look to other people's experiences so i wanted to visit refugee camps to go and see people who have lived the same kind of story that i have lived but 30 years later who are living it now and just to sit and talk you know about our stories and and to try to make to use whatever i've learned in terms of the craft to bring their stories to life and i found that really important because um the true stories from the refugee crisis are often told in ways that kind of brought them of of you know um there's an element of empathy this uh you know kind of ability to connect that this is the kind of thing that we do with fiction you know we write prose and we really get into the visceral details and we help people put themselves in those stories but journalists don't necessarily do that the journalistic stories are are are not focused on like telling a good creative story and i wanted to do that with real stories uh so that i could draw people into um into those very real situations and so for me it was i guess a coming together of many different strands in my life uh the personal becoming a mother uh the professional just the evolution of my writing out from fiction and the evolution of my voice um and then also this desire to i guess become more porous as a writer and to become someone who looks outward and and um and connects with other people's stories fascinating thank you and rowan the go home anthology is also a book of of many voices um can you tell us a little bit about that and how you how you came to bring that together yes so it happened a little accidentally um but i in the beginning became very deliberate afterwards but i was a fellow at the asian american writers workshop and while i was there i was listening to them and that's an organization in new york that basically supports asian american writers they're going through a change now but at the time they were very focused on events and giving space to writers and to share their work and support them and they do a lot of outreach and they have two more magazines anyway i remembered i was there and i would hear them talking about like how back in the day they did print publication but that it didn't make sense for them anymore they couldn't afford to do it et cetera at the same time someone from this publisher the feminist press wrote to me and said do you have a book available and i didn't because my first novel which i'm going to hold up like show and tell almost like you i had just found an agent for and we were going down a particular route and so i didn't i couldn't conjure a second book so i said oh no i don't but i'd love to submit to any anthologies you have like you know just a short story or an essay and they said we don't have any anthologies but we could and i basically spoke to the my mentor at the asian american writers workshop and said i think you two should be friends and you should make put an anthology together and then maybe i can submit to it and the people from both organizations went that sounds like a great idea why don't you do it and organize it i would oh okay and you know that that did what did feel very surprising to me i was um still my mid-twenties i hadn't expected that that was gonna be a thing that i would be doing at that point in my career but as soon as i started thinking about the creation of the book it began to feel very serious and important to me we decided that we didn't want to make it an anthology that was like the best asian voices ever because that a it sort of puts yourself in a position of a very particular power that i didn't feel comfortable with and i didn't think i thought i was the arbiter of that so we thought instead we'd have a theme and very quickly the theme um was go home and that's in part because it allow i thought it would allow writers to speak about two things one where their sense of home was what it meant to them because i have always felt very split between places and figuring out what home means to me has been a journey and when i spoke to other people from different parts of the diaspora or different um they often spoke about home and like the ways in which they built it either in chosen family or in their books or in it could be their laptop for one person um and it also allowed people to talk about the experience of being told to go home which very oddly we started putting this together before donald trump was elected during a time in which lots of people were saying to me that's not really a thing anymore though is it and i was like i think it is a thing but i was originally keep going and then sort of and then donald trump got elected as we were editing i was like oh i didn't want to be right about that i would have been very happy to be entirely wrong um okay so and the book in some ways is i let the writers be very free with how they wanted to respond whether they wanted to talk about their personal home or their resistance to being told to go home yeah it's um a very very prescient moment it turns out to be um and i'm interested in that that point that you've both talked about in introductions to your books about how the the wider narrative has changed i mean deena you said and then grateful refugee you know you know since in the 30 years since he arrived as a refugee and when he wrote the book that the narrative had become a lot more hostile and ronnie talked about that increase in xenophobic um conversations since he moved back to the uk from the us so i just wonder if you could talk a little bit more about that that shift in the wider narrative and and apart from you know the the writing of these books um perhaps how you think it's it's affected your own your own writing and and even literary culture and and and publishing more widely um do you know would you like to speak to that sure well i i guess when i arrived in the u.s i took a lot for granted um that i took for granted that a lot of things would naturally happen and i think a lot of refugees and immigrants feel this way especially refugees because you have this sense of extreme rescue you know well you know i was in such a bad position i my life was in danger then i was in a camp and now suddenly i'm in this best country in the world and and everything will be fine from here on out and i think people expect that from you also but um you know back then i had reason to believe that because the uh the conversation around me was so different i think the average citizen understood the humanitarian duty that comes with being born free that comes with being born in a country that in which you have particular privileges they understood about things like the geneva convention i mean the geneva convention was only what 40 years in the past instead of you know now when it's like 70 years in the past and and uh there was a sense that america had a duty to not only the displace of the world but to other countries who it had affected with its policies and people in the population understood that and um you know the gatekeepers understood that so the people that were doing the asylum interviews the social workers and the people that we kind of met with along the way the helpers now so i guess what i expected was that the conversation would move along in a progressive way and that it would get more and more obvious that we owe something to the displaced and then we move on to things like how are we going to use our resources how are we going to make the most of people's talents how do we make sure people don't lose their skills on the way here but the conversation has moved in a completely different way like it just it just did a 180 didn't it and now every now we're back to do we owe something to refugees i mean we decided this in the 40s and 50s i mean this was this is this is a done conversation and yet here we are again defending the same obvious things going backward and not getting to the important questions right so that has affected my writing because it now i have to spend a lot of my time writing essayistically non-fiction kind of philosophically talking about how all right let's go back to what kind of philosophy are you living by you know how do you decide what you're entitled to how do you decide what your children are entitled to and how do you decide what you owe to your neighbors these are not the kind of things i expected to talk about explicitly in essay form so much i i mean to be honest if i could think about my ideal writing life it would be to put all of this lecturing aside and just sink into some good fiction i mean fiction is the thing that i wanted to do with my career and and and it's the thing that i studied in my mfa and i i want to kind of crack open the issues of the world in a more subtle way you know using stories and and visceral details and and and not so much having this hammer you know but right now is a moment of extremes and the conversation has become extreme and you and i kind of feel like the part of my voice that is needed in the world is the part that tells it how it is you know and so it's shifted my fiction to non-fiction um kind of balance and it's also even within non-fiction has shifted um how i write a little bit toward the more um well like i said more essayistic and philosophical and but but i think one thing that i struggle with and i try really hard to keep the balance of is just that those storytelling roots you know to remember that the most powerful form of persuasion in the long run is storytelling and it is to bring out you know people's stories in a subtle way and let let your reader kind of find their way through it and to to kind of get an understanding through the subconscious and so um yeah so that's kind of the sort of things that i'm thinking about now yeah that's so interesting and rowan i wonder if you feel a similar pressure or expectation to you know either address these themes or produce more non-fiction essay-based work around them yeah um so i think i've my own thinking has been evolving as the conversation has i remember you know i was being a little light-hearted earlier but i remember being both tremendously upset by world events by brexit by donald trump's existence and that being not not really balanced a moment of light in all of that darkness i thought well at least now we can have these conversations at least now i don't have to have the conversation where people go we did post colonialism it's done we start we fixed it and to go okay now i can explicitly talk about the things that are experienced by my family by my friends by the in the world and at least not have to go somewhat have to have the conversation about like that's not real we've moved past it and that that was for me a moment of light and i think some amazing conversations have come out of that and amazing books by um meant by different writers you know there are certain you see lists of like these are the books you need to read and like a lot of the time those are amazing books and you should read them um but i think as someone who is primarily a fiction writer i think something i have been thinking about and struggling with is the ways in which is both i do think important to talk about identity whether you know that racial identity i mixed race a lot of my characters are either asian american or mixed race um sexuality and you know i'm bisexual and characters who are that and who aren't that and um mental health which is a big part of my second novel and it's both i both find myself saying like this is why it's important i'm going to give you my log line and why this stuff matters i'm going but i also want you to see that these characters are so much more than those things and that those things sometimes inform what they're doing really subtly rather than being this big hammer and finding a way to fight injustice without having to turn yourself into a hammer i think is something i still am struggling with and learning from other writers as by looking at their work and thinking about in my own such an interesting point and so well said and and it leads me to a question i was i was going to ask about the the role of of literature and and fiction and we'll come to talk about your your fiction work in a minute but as a form of activism i mean d what do you think about the role of literature as activism do you think the two are ultimately you know antithetical in a way that uh or or are they always intertwined any thoughts about that do you know well i mean for me as i was saying in my ideal world i would like them to be separate except in a very long-term broad thinking way so of course literature is does have this activist element because good literature has a point of view you know and it has a it's in the perspective of particular people particular characters and so by nature they're political because there are things that those characters want and need um and and they're kind of crashing into the world in a particular way and so that is the political element and as subtly as you show it that's there so in the long term what we what books we decide to create a canon out of is activism and political you know in a very very broad sense but as you're doing the writing i mean i would very much like those things to be separate and i feel this pressure to infuse my writing with um with an agenda i supposed to be extremely dangerous because i want my my my fiction to to be more than anything just um true and realistic and unaware of itself you know just as the characters would be if i'm writing about you know a villager in iran you know that person isn't necessarily aware of all of the layers of um i guess politics and history and everything that goes into the experience they're having they just know the experience and and they feel it viscerally and they react to it in the most human way and i want to show that and make it you know absolutely apparent to the reader so for that i think putting aside agendas is really necessary you have to kind of sink into the experience of the person and so so it's it's as i said it's a struggle to forget you know to forget that at the end of the day i want my body of work to do something big and to do something political and to become you know um one of the tools that people use to make arguments for the things that i believe in do you see what i mean but that's my body of work and if one short story tries to do that that short story is going to fail you know yeah no it's rick great points but what about you ron do you do you feel that there is um there there is a real tension between the idea of activism and literature and is that something you try to navigate in working between fiction and non-fiction yes so i very much i think agree with many of the things lina said i think she's very wise about what you how you need to write and i think if you write and say this is the moral lesson at the end you get something that sort of reads like one of those victorian children's stories that you don't want to be doing um and i think for me there's a difference between what you write and what you publish and how you promote and so and that's what i i'm writing i need to be thinking of these characters as people and i think one of the things that helped me most is so the difference between my first and second book is my first book is largely set in new york in the 1960s and 70s and the protagonist is japanese and she doesn't have a lot of language for why she can't find her place in the art world she doesn't at any point say people are being racist to me um or even in like this is she doesn't know what microaggression is and she wouldn't think of it in those terms and i had to think like her and to show her the way she would be frustrated the way she would try to work around something um and in my second book is contemporary and the there's almost too much language for that protagonist is trying to understand what's going on in her brain and she's all of webmd and all of the internet and all of everything to go do i feel this way because i'm chinese american i feel this way because my mother is dead do i feel this way why is because it's not wrong my ovaries and the way in which we have so many narratives and stories and like this is why you are the way you are that by layering them on top of each other trying to create a form of complexity and so living with my characters in that in that confusion in the confusion of what it means to be a person and to have an identity feels really important to me in terms of publishing the year my first book came out across all of british publishing in every genre i'm including cookbooks non-fiction like textbooks there were 50 people of color of ba me people depending on terminology who's got their books published i did not think by getting published i was doing something incredibly impossible until everyone kept telling me how incredibly impossible it was and asking me about the choice and really really focusing on that fact that that character was japanese because to me it was an important part of our identity but actually the most important part of that character's identity to herself is herself as an artist and as an artist who can't quite find her artistic language and everyone went oh this book is about being japanese they sent out origami papers with my first book um which i was surprised by and so i think figuring out that okay there's the mindset you need to be in when you're writing a book and then there's a mindset when you're fighting for your book and when you're saying this is why my book's important this is why i'm holding up other writers and saying look at this i think in i've guest edited the good journal magazine which was quite similar to doing this anthology where i'm choosing otherwise something which voices are needed on the publishing landscape now and i think that is much more explicitly a political choice than while writing yeah absolutely yeah it's not really interesting oh can i try them really quick because i think we've had so many of the same experiences probably with publishing and you know it it's such a struggle to try to be nuanced while trying to sell your book in this kind of publishing landscape and that thing you said about the origami it just so resonates i was just talking to a turkish friend who had turkish delight sent out with her book and she was just she was horrified and i have had sour cherries sent out with my book and i was horrified and you feel like you can't say anything because you are trying to reach you know other people um people who i but but it's i think it's a constant internal struggle yeah and you know and i think those origami papers were beautiful on some level and like i think that they were sent with love and care and really fighting for me from my publishing team so i have no anger towards them but at the same time that wasn't the person i was expecting to be in the world and that exactly you're like well you know with paul harding getting you know hot dogs set with his work i mean i don't know whatever like if that's not fair you think well you know i i am not sour cherries just as much as this white male american writer is not you know he he gets to be words he gets to be prose and i get to be cherries you know but you're right but it's well meaning in that they're at the end of the day trying to sell the book but it is it's it's a tension yeah now i'd love to hear it from both of you but about coming to write those first novels before that moment of of encountering the publishing industry and having yourselves characterized in ways you hadn't anticipated um perhaps you could speak about um you're writing your first novels and you know how long they they they took you and what perhaps what what hopes thoughts you had about them before the publishing industry uh joined in to bring them to people around would like to speak to that i i mean i think when i was writing my first book i had no idea if it was ever going to get published or if it was ever going to be read and i remember a writer came to visit a class i was in and was like yes this is the best time when you're writing for yourself and your vision of art and you are not polluted by the world of publishing i remember thinking essentially like  you sorry this has been recorded but like i was so upset as like a young writer of feeling like what are you saying like this is the best time when no one will ever hear from me um and i was so and i now in my old age look back on this and understand what that person was saying i do and i and i i feel like saying silly baby silly baby you should have listened in that i think before you write before you're published you do you're just being driven to tell a story and you have no idea where it's going to be and you have fewer voices in your head about what it should be or what it should be like or what sort of writer you are and i think for anyone listening who's writing their first book feel free to shake your fists in the air but also do try try to enjoy it uh that that moment before you were before your scene almost thanks yeah and how about you dina do you have a similar experience at that point yes and i i not only do i agree with that now you know and that you now and the person who spoke to you i would even go further and say to try to prolong it if you have a first novel you know that you're eager to get out i would stretch that time before it comes out as much as possible just because of the way the publishing industry is structured because of how much goes into debut novels how much attention goes into them and how important it is that your first novel be good you know um and and just this this the the the process i guess the learning curve of being a writer is um is a bit of a mystery i mean there are times i look back to all my old writing and i absolutely despise all of it but then again i hear from much more seasoned writers who also despise their work you know from 10 years ago that was glorious so you know one doesn't know if one will ever be able to judge one's own writing but um there everyone pretty much agrees that there's a really long period at the beginning when um you are vulnerable to being exploited by people who just want to put out a book that might sell because of a particular topic perfect a perfect case in point is american dirt right i mean this is a book that got all of this controversy um because the publishing industry allowed a bad book to be published it was the problem with that book isn't it isn't just that it made um i guess it showed a particular group of people badly as an outsider would look at them but all of those problems that it had are rooted in problems in writing you know this was someone who was a novice who didn't understand how like the point of view of the characters that she had um supposedly researched and and she had no way of seeing all of those things but the publishing industry did and instead they chose to go kind of the money route right and that's what this is just something that happens because they're businesses so how do you protect yourself you have to protect yourself by becoming as good a writer as you can before you put yourself out there because otherwise you're you're you're extremely vulnerable you know and i think my um i mean i didn't have an experience like that in my but i was very naive to all these things and i think that um you know i was extremely eager i wanted my first book to come out i blocked at edits i mean it was just the usual first novel stuff um and i think now 10 years down the road the um if i could go back i don't know i would probably make my second novel my first novel and i would probably edit the first novel completely differently and make it my second novel you know like so um it's no one has ever said they wish they had published earlier no successful writer i've ever talked to not one has said you know what i just got that debut book out ten years too late you know it just it's just not how hindsight works especially not in creative industries you know in creative work yeah no really interesting and and now talking about your second your second novels in the order they actually emerged as second novels i'd love to hear a bit more about them rowan could you tell us a bit about your latest novel starling days that you read from so beautifully there you know how did it come about and also what was it like writing a second novel after the success of homeless and about sort of having then become more savvy about the publishing industry and what it entailed okay so i had a two book deal which is when your publisher very kindly says we are going to publish one book and then we will go and have faith that you will write another book um which was on one of the tremendously reassuring and on the level it was terrifying and i actually wrote a different book that will never see the light of day in between the two books and threw it out which you know kind of ruined my schedule um but it was important to write that book and it was important to throw it away because it wasn't working for various reasons i won't go into but i remember sitting there making the decision that i wasn't just gonna leave it rather than try to edit it or fix it and i might you know written a full two drafts of it i think and it was the feeling of well if this book goes out in the world and it's a success i'll probably be happy everyone loves being successful but if it goes out into the world and isn't a success then part of me will know part of me will go yeah there was something at the core of that book that was written to please a voice in my head i'd made up a voice like the person you like you're the the amalgamation of everybody who would never read your book or your genre of book or any book by someone like you and you want and the desire to make that person happy to say i can write i can write your book i can write this book for you and i don't know i need to write a book that i believe in that is the book that i need or i think there is a need for and then i very much hope it will find its readers but even if it doesn't i will still think it was a book that needed to be written so that that hard sell is a book for styling days in some ways the book i wanted to write um and it's a novel that is about a couple it's a sort of story for marriage a fairly new marriage they've and they've been together for a while but they've just gotten married and the woman's mental health medication stops working very early on just just before the section that i read to you and she doesn't know who she is anymore and she decides to try to exist without and to find out who she is and she's a classicist so she looks to stories of myths and legends and women who transform and she also looks for medical explanations and she's trying to figure this out meanwhile her husband who is a bit of a not not controlling like uh controlling of her but just someone who needs their world to be aligned and in shape is trying very hard to fix it and to make everything okay and they move together for to london for part of his job and to give her like a clean break and it sort of unravels from there yeah it's it's um it's it's been so well received and it's been described as a must for anyone who's struggled with depression or love someone who does which is a lot of people and i wondered if you it backs that question of activism did you always hope the book would have a sort of function in that way of helping people understand mental health challenges and depression when writing or has that been a sort of unexpected outcome that these were the characters and stories that you felt drawn to and that became a secondary you know aspect of the response that's a really good question i think for me it was maybe somewhere in between the two i have a somewhat dysfunctional life choice of when i don't know what to think about something i go to fiction and i read stories about people who've been through something similar who've done something similar who've been in a particular place and many many years ago before i'd written either book someone i loved very much their mental health medication started working um and i'd never read a story about that i'd heard people i've read essays about people by people who are like mental health medication is bad you need to meditate or do yoga or do something else and find your level and i think that is right for some people and i've spoken to you in my essays by people who are like my mental health medication lets me be the person i want to be in the world i have more me on it and i respect that and i think that's great but i never read a story that was like yes i for many years was a particular person and then chemically i didn't get to be that person anymore because my medication start working and how do you recreate yourself from that point and in that case i was in the husband's role in some ways i wasn't i wasn't married to the person um but i i desperately wanted to help and i absolutely had no idea how and many many many many years before that when i was a teenager i had very bad depression so i felt like i'd been on both sides of it and i wanted not even to write about depression but to write about trying to hold together trying to choose to be with someone um in that time and how do you do it and how when you are depressed you let anyone else in and so that in some ways it became the book and i guess i hope that if there was a lack of that it may have addressed the lack of story that i felt um which i guess is a very soft activism but it was what i was trying to do thank you yeah and and dina how about your second level refuge you mentioned that you kind of wish it been your your first novel could you talk a bit about writing that and how you found writing you know fiction versus non-fiction as a way of addressing the refugee experience too yeah so um it's this is bizarre but i have the exact same story about first and second books i had a two book deal and it was um and in my with my first book you know it was finished and so the second book was based on just the promise of you know some something and i really respected my editor i mean she she was someone who's who had published some of my favorite writers and who i really i wanted to listen to her and um i wrote a whole other book that is now completely shelved but um for me you know that kind of realization that you came to on your own it was much much more directed by this editor you know she i went through like 12 drafts of this thing over three years and no matter what she just was not satisfied and at some point i just said okay enough enough i i told my agent you know get me out of this deal but um the the editor said you know just leave it this is not your second book you know i don't i think that the second book is actually blocked up in there somewhere and it's going to come pouring out as soon as you remove this obstruction right and i i thought oh well that's a nice disgusting analogy okay um so i kind of i put it aside i let it go and it had been years that i've been working on this and i i just really felt this urgency but i i you know over the next couple of months i this is actually when i i first started outlining this on my own in my little flat in new york and then i went to montana um with a writer friend and we did this little mini writing residency in which we just tried to frantically wrote things that we had in our minds and just let let go of any convention about what the story should look like we just let things come out and then i went to mcdowell where i i finished it so in the course of like six months i wrote a first draft of this thing that ended up being refuge and it was so um it was so natural and so freeing and so exactly the story i needed to tell at the time and i had waited so long that all of those experiences had layered upon each other just in my subconscious remember when i was in iowa there was this wonderful i had this teacher she's this wonderful writer marilyn robinson and she would tell us often that even when you're not actively working on something your subconscious is working on it and so you need to just trust that you have you know you have that mechanism that's what's happening you know we don't really understand the awesomeness of the human mind the creative mind um and so if you do have something bottled up that wants to come out you just let it come out and so that's what i did with my second novel and it was a story about this um uh a woman very much like me who had been raised in the west after escaping from iran as a refugee and who had had kind of all of the education etc and now lived in europe and all of the distance between her and her father who still remained in iran and who is very much kind of an iranian villager and it's about the four times that they see each other in the course of you know three decades that she is outside of iran and how each time there's more and more of a gulf between them and of course changes have happened they've grown older there's like a decade between each time or you know six or seven years so and it's all different places around europe and the middle east so it's it's not um so it's just nothing but struggle each of those reunions and and and so um because that was so uh based on my own story i think it just came out in this natural way so that became my second book and it's still my favorite you know it's my favorite novel that i've written it's not my favorite piece of fiction my favorite piece of fiction are always my short stories um but thank you that's so interesting to hear both of you um i'd love to open it up to the audience if anyone has any questions i haven't seen any in the chat but if anyone would like to ask something feel free to uh you could use the reactions button to to indicate with a clap or or something that you'd like to say something so please do go ahead if you've got anything at all you'd like to ask dina or rowan about their writing anybody you know it's funny in these kind of settings when everyone has their video off you think maybe everyone's getting t at the exact same moment exactly um well before we before we finish i was hoping i could just ask you a final question just we've touched on it already a bit about your your experience in the publishing industry you know at the moment as as writers of color and the dynamics as you see them going forwards um you know how how how do you think that the publishing industry is changing and perhaps what you have in mind for yourselves for the future within that um do you know how is the publishing industry changing well now now i have to put on like management consultant hat i um you know i i don't know because my place in the publishing industry is so from the creative point of view you know and i think this um i've had conversations about this with my agent who i'm very close to um but you know i think it is becoming from what i understand more and more of business you know and and editors are editing less and and um there's kind of a growing gulf between the world of serious craft-based creative writing that's nurtured in mfa programs and and you know um kind of held up i suppose by certain kind of book critics and the money-making industry right and so and i think it's really important to be careful about you know where you fall there and and and who you align yourself with and who you allow to represent you you know not everyone has the same values that you might have um just in terms of what you want from your work um literary values how you want the book to be in terms of a piece of art uh how good every sentence should be how much it should represent the characters but also what you wanted to do on in a political um level um so so i think um i think that's i guess all i can say about that just not being in in the industry or working in the companies um but what was the second part of your question um perhaps any any future projects that you have in mind you know within that industry yeah i have it's like for all i say against the industry i have a couple of books slotted to come out um i have a children's book coming out in the spring called the waiting place and it's a nonfiction book based on one of the refugee camps that i visited i took a photographer there i photographed the children and i wrote their stories and then i have um a my next non-fiction book is coming out um in 2022 i'm working on it now it's called who gets believed it's about who gets believed and then i have a novel coming out um in a year after that how exciting i look forward to reading honestly um and rowan how about you would you like to speak to that that question i have nowhere near as an impressive an answer i think i was talking to you earlier about what i was working on alan i'm like i have a document it's in my computer and it is slowly getting longer and then i cut it and it gets shorter again it gets longer and shorter and that is currently where i am um i think very familiar to me yeah i think one i see the name of one of my students from a class i teach in the zoom and so she will know that you know i there are strict deadlines in that class like you'll be writing this many thousand words every week and it makes me feel infinitely guilty because i look at my right hand shorter longer um but you know and i guess to go backwards into the first half of your question i think i feel frightened when i read stories about how much the publishing houses are eating each other and becoming more and more in the same beast but i also know that i'm published by in the uk by hachette which is one of the big beasts and actually that i'm my editor is very sensitive and thoughtful and that they took a risk on my literary book about a japanese artist and so i don't want to believe i don't want to believe it is impossible within those spaces for there to be people who are supporting different voices and who really care about language and craft so there is some hope and i also you know i because i live in the uk i know the british publishing industry better than the american um and although i worry when i see the book sellers statistics it isn't getting much better than those 50 writers the year i my first book came out but i also see individual editors who are really fighting for diverse because there's no better term voices and really wonderful initiatives to bring in otherwise unheard voices um that i think are incredibly valuable and provide a lot of hope so as always with history we're pushing in two directions yeah such such important points right um we're pretty much to the end of at the end of our time i have one little question from the audience but i think we could just squeeze in which pertains to that point about editors uh rowan and dina are your editors actually um good editors i'm sure you don't answer yes to that that question but or the age of the agents do more editing work for you and your on your novels than your editors um well i'll start by saying that the editors that i've had are very very good but i think it's because agents do they my agent does a really good job not just of doing the first round but of kind of finding the people who are as rowan was saying actually walk the walk and who really care about their writers and and so because the fact is that you know this conversation about diverse voices and about um you know good editing and all that stuff everyone parrots it you know people say all the same things so it's really important who you align yourself with because as rowan said there are good editors or really good ones you know you just have to make sure you find them while the other people are pretending to be them too you see and i think your agent can be a real ally in that and i think you can really look at their track record too at the editors i mean have they do they have authors who've stayed with them over time do they have authors of color who've stayed with them over time um you know these kind of things are known the publishing industry is small right so i think um there are there are good editors out there and and the agents are really the perfect people to find them for you because they have the relationships and so i wouldn't lose hope i wouldn't lose hope at all very wise words and encouraging words to fair for all you would be writers listening to this um i think we've we have come to the end of our time now thank you all very much for coming i encourage you both to approach you all to buy both of these uh writer's books from your local bookshops you can find them on bookshop.org do click on the websites and read more about the fascinating work um and i'd love it if you could join me by turning on your mics for a few seconds and giving dina and rowan a round of applause for their wonderful um they're wonderful writing and and discussion today thank you [Music] [Applause] and thanks everyone thank you thank you very much um and thanks everyone who's

for spending your lunches with us you", "N5tUhgZplJg": "thank you for joining me today it's Carolyn from the purple poncho today I'm going to be showing you how to add fur to your projects I'll be working with this red hard fun fur that's really soft and it's just a really fun element to add to your projects so to begin we're gonna use a larger hook either a P which is suggested it's a bulky yarn P hook I happen to be using an end ten millimeter or you could even use your fingers so today we're gonna begin by placing a slipknot on the fur and we're gonna be crocheting loosely you don't want to be pushing tightly so if you crocheting the tight side you're going to want to make it extra loose and I'm gonna be showing you how to put the fur on the Halle Berry stocking I have a sample here so to begin we're gonna be attaching it at the back scene and we're gonna not be in the V stitch here we're gonna go up to the first row of double crochet from the V stitch okay so insert your hook and put that loop on your hook and this is going from the inside of your work pull the loop through to the front flip it up a little bit and make sure that you're working with the working yarn and not your tail okay so I'm going to put that over to the side and put this one on my finger okay so to begin I'm going to skip two stitches and go in between the second and third stitch and then I'm going to grab that yarn and pull it through to the front make it a little loose it's pretty loose and then pull it through the loop on my hook and then what I like to do is pull it up and then go back down a little bit okay and so you might have to move the four out of the way to make sure you're working on the correct row you don't want to start working up here or down here make sure you're working on the same row so we're going to skip two stitches and throw your hook in the next stitch or excuse me in between the two stitches insert your hook yarn over pull through and then pull through the loop on your hook I like to pull it up and down and just repeat this process around the row and you can stop you fluff it up a little bit as you're working make sure it's even and that's how I put the fur on just keep making little slip stitches all the way around this robe fling it as you go you can see it's really really fluffy and it doesn't take a lot of fur to add to your projects because it is bulky and it is pretty wide so we're gonna keep going all the way around and when we get back over to here then I will show you how to go up to the next row in a continuous manner okay I'll see you there okay now I'm back at the last two stitches of this row and what I'm gonna do I have three rows here that I'm gonna be that it could be working in but I'm gonna skip this next row and I'm gonna work in this middle row and then I'm going to leave this row empty so I'm gonna go up to this row so I've got those two stitches here I got my next row here and then my third row here so I'm going to just insert my hook in that third row and bring it through insert my hook and pull up a loop and pull it through and I'm just going to bring it through the loop on my hook and that's gonna bring me up to that third row and I'm not gonna worry about those two stitches down here and then I'm going to skip two stitches and I'm gonna work in this row here so I'm going to insert my hook yarn over and pull it through and I'm gonna just do the same thing again all the way around skip into nobody okay so I have two stitches left so I think this is a good spot to cut my yarn [Music] all right so I'm going to cut my yarn and I'm going to end it off so I'll just pull there's a loop here I'll just pull it through pull it tail through and then what I do is I just weave the ends through a little bit and if you've missed any spots or it looks like there's a gap somewhere you can fill it in with the tail but I think it's pretty good so you can just weave it in and out a few times through some of the stitches just to get the tail movin in a little bit so I'm gonna get rid of some of this tail and then you have the tail on the inside so I'm gonna pull that through and weave it through on the bottom a little bit it's like so just randomly weaving it in and out so that's how it looks two rows of fur and you can add more for if you like or less for if you like it's up to you so I hope you've enjoyed this tutorial on how to add fur to your projects I have a couple other samples here the stocking have turquoise and hot pink the green and purple and of course the red and white another project that you can add fur to is a blanket here I have the moderate baby granny blanket that I made with the fur around the edge and you slip stitch leave for a Roman outer edge and it's really soft and cuddly I think it adds a fun dimension to it I also have a scarf that I put it on last year for the twelve weeks of Christmas cow and that's a fun one as well so you there's lots of ways you can use the fur these are just a couple examples I hope you've enjoyed this tutorial and if you like this video please subscribe to my channel and hit the like button please follow me at www.osho.com/copyright osho you", "n9UmN0u2cIY": "hi everybody welcome to vena the ants crap Friday and this week I'm going to be showing you how to make this spiral granny square [Music] these so for this spiral browning square we're going to be using four different colors and here I've chosen a white green a pink and a propyl and this is just a DK like wall stood weight yarn you can use any yarn that you like ready so let's bring in our green white purple and pink yarn that's a young weight of a three and with that we're going to be using a 3.5 millimeter efore crochet hook and you're also going to need a pair of scissors or when you're finished and you're also going to need a tapestry needle yarn needle as well that's one with a big eye at the end for sewing in any tail ends okay so let's begin okay so we're gonna get all four colors ready like this because we're pretty much gonna be working with them all at the same time but I'm going to start off with a color that is gonna be the most memorable so I'm gonna start off with the white and the reason for that is that I want to know where I've sort of beginning and ending but the first thing to do is also I'm going to take the color that I want to remember the easiest so the white and the first thing we're going to do is we are going to chain four so I'm just gonna do my little slip knot if you're new to cruising I highly recommend checking out my beginner tutorials and then coming back to check out some of these tutorials so we're gonna chain four to begin with our white so one two three just chain four we're basically going to create a four chain loop as per the beginning of many of my projects so find your first chain and put your hook into your first chain now I'm going to grab the white yarn bring that through the first chain and then I'm going to bring it straight through the loop on my hook that does a little slip stitch and that joins our four chain loop at the beginning in the end and in the middle obviously is going to be a hole don't confuse it with your first chain and you want to make sure that we're going to be working into that center hole that one there so I'm going to put my hook into that center hole I'm going to grab the white yarn and bring it through the center and I'm going to do a single crochets this pattern is in u.s. terminology as per all my patterns I do a single crochet the likes in that's just wrapping it around the chains it doesn't matter how many chains you got now it's one do a single crochet then we are going to do a half double crochet so I'm going to put my hook back into that center hole again back into the middle there bring the yarn through and then do a half double crochet pull through all three thanks thing then I'm going to do two double crochet in that sense a hole as well so going a yarn ava get back into that center hole sent a gap in the yarn through do a double crochet so pull through two pull through two okay we need two of those so I'm going to yarn over again and do another double crochet okay so we're now white so far we've got a single crochet half double crochet and two double crochet and this is the most fittest part two this is getting all your colors basically casted on as it were so what we're gonna do with our white is we're just going to pull up a long loop like that so we don't lose our lid and then just put that down and then we're going to pick our next color it's gonna put that down I'm gonna pick the green next doesn't matter what color just want to remember the white one so I know where I started and just moving your yarn able to the side what we're gonna do is I'm gonna put our hook into that center hold again and bacey we're going to join our green yarn so it's gonna put that over my hook I'm just gonna hold it with my fingers it wasn't full of bring that through the center and I'm just going to do a little chain one just to secure it we're not gonna count that as a stitch it's gonna do a little chain one just to secure it I can pull that down nice and tight and make sure it's up against your last double crochet okay you don't want it sort of over here you want to make sure it's next in line this green and then we're gonna do the same thing again we're gonna do a single crochet so you go back into the center and then just do a single crochet wrapping it around those those chains over 14 new then you might just want to move that over to make sure it's flush with your white double crochet okay so a single crochet then a half double crochet in your green half double crochet then we're gonna do our two double crochet so back it's that sensor before chain leap and do a double crochet one double crochet and then another double crochet you want to double crochet see it's done the same thing again you've got a single crochet half double crochet two double crochet in your green and just move them over so there's some next to your whites do the same thing again we're going to pull up the large loop so we don't lose our stitches and then just put that down and then we're going to pick up our next color no did purple this time okay do the same thing again to move those tannins out the way put your hook in there make sure your tailings are out the way don't want those to get tangled up then put your purple next color whatever your color you're using hold it the finger bring that through the center do your little chain one just to secure like so just pull that tail in nice and tight make sure it's flush against your green and do the same stitches again so single crochet make sure no other tail ends are getting in the way single crochet move it over half double crochet and then two double crochets and another one to two double crochet okay so single crochet half double crochet two double crochet you know purple to move it over and then put up a large loop so we don't lose our stitches and then put the purple down make sure the tail ends are out the way and then pick up your last color in this case is a pink a similar to white on camera but it is pink and do the same thing again but you hook through the center hole you don't either with the pink and just hold it with your finger bring the pink through the middle and we're gonna do a little chain one just to secure it same stitches again so single crochet again make sure no talons get in the way you want to make sure they're clear so single crochet one single crochet 1 half double crochet to get tangled up with your white one half double crochet and then your two double crochet one then another double crochet okay so you've done the same for stitches and again bring up a large loop so we don't lose our stitches so we've done the same for stitches in each of our four colors into that Center for chain of our four chain loop and we've got basically we're working with four colors at the same time and now what we're going to do is we're going to go back to our white so our beginning color it's always nice for me to remember that white Jesus remembers my beginning color so there we go rejoined my hook onto the white now our first color and then we're going to move on to round two and for round see what we're going to do is we need to find the first stitch of this green and you might just want to pull your tail end not back down into this tail end just to make sure that's down and you should have four stitches okay your two double crochet you have to aggression in your single crochet you should have four stitches in the green we need to find that first stitch that's single crochet okay and in that single crochet we're going to do two double crochet in our white okay so gonna yarn even with our white go into our sing the first single crochet in our green whoops in our green like say I'm going to do two double crochet in there two double crochet okay so one double crochet your neighbor I'm going to get back in the same stitch again and do another double crochet okay so we've got two double crochet in there then in the next stitch we're just going to do one double crochet just one double crochet in the next stitch okay then in the next stitch we're going to do two double crochet two double crochet so one and another one in the same stitch okay so you've done two double crochet in that single crochet then one double crochet in the half double crochet then two double crochet in that first double crochet and that leaves you with one stitch you just pull your tail ends over you should see that last stitch we're going to leave that and stop there and do the same thing and we're going to pull up the white strands we don't lose our stitches and then we're going to move on to our next color so we need to put our hook and our green this time just bring that down careful not pull of any other colors make sure the turnings are out the way just pull that little purple one down so we can see our full stitch is clearer and do the same thing again gonna find our first stitch one two three four so there's our single crochet in the purple and do the same thing again I'm gonna put a hook into there and do two double crochet in our green this time back into the same stitch two two double crochet in there then the next stitch we're going to do one double crochet just the one then the next stitch third stitch we're going to do two double crochet and I find it helps just hold onto the loop appropriate loop and just put it out of the way two double crochet in the next stitch so one and another one in the same stitch okay and there we finished with our green for now so again pull up a nice big loop so we don't lose our stitches always make sure your tension on your yarn is quite loose it's not getting stuck on the Youngs you don't want that to pull out as you're working around again say it would finish about green and now we need to find our purple or next color what color you are using let's put a hook can't see the purple I'm gonna do the same thing again I'm just gonna pull that little pink turn ends help us see our four pink stitch is nice and clear so one two three four it's tucked down there start off again with two double crochet in that first stitch single crochet one and see this does get easier once you get going it's always fiddly at the beginning to double crochet and then one double crochet in the next stitch and then two double crochet in the third stitch and another one in the same stitch okay and then we're going to leave that last one again put up nice big loop and then our last color is our pink so bring up our pink and do our pink so this end now we can see more nearly back at the beginning so we need to find that first stitch make sure you mainly to pull it over because this was the last color we worked with on our full chain loop you may need to put it over to make sure you find that first stitch okay so make sure you don't go into this one by accident so find that first stitch and do two double crochet then one double crochet in the next stitch just the one then two double crochet another third stitch you can make sure you've done that right by checking how many white stitches you've got left so we're gonna pull up our lips so we don't lose our stitches and you should have one two three four five six white stitches left so then if you've got six white stitches left and you've done your two double crochet one double crochet two double crochet you know you started in the right stitch the right white stitch okay so now we've done that we're going to move on to the next round we're going to go back to our white heart beginning color and how you see it almost starting to take shape so I'm gonna go back to the white so now what we're going to do with our white I'm gonna go into its next green stitch and do two double crochet again two double crochet we always start with two double crochet and end with two double crochet it's the same stitch so two double crochet in that first stitch then we're going to do one double crochet in the next three this time so one double crochet in the next stitch 1 double crochet in the next stitch 1 double crochet in the next stitch okay so one double crochet in the next one two three then two double crochet let's just hold onto your turns to double crochet so one and another one in the same stitch okay and then that should leave you with one stitch again in the green so we're finished with our whites bring up a nice big loop keep the tension loose on your yarn and do the same thing for your other three colors so we're gonna move you've always got one stitch left okay always remember that so we're gonna move on through our green and do the same thing for our green and so the purple so we do two double crochet in the next stitch one double crochet in the next three one next stitch two next stitch three so one double crochet and x3 just like before then we end up on two double crochet that's second to last stitch one another one in the same stitch okay so exactly the same do two double crochet then one double crochet in the next three one two three then two double crochet that leaves you with one stitch which we leave for now so then we put up our green and then this is where it all starts getting angry so be careful with all your tail ends now we're going to move on to do the purple to do exactly the same thing again but for your purple to double crochet in the next stitch and another one the same stitch to one double crochet in the next three to be really careful okay one next stitch two next stitch three and then we end on two double crochet in that second last stitch one and another one in the same stitch okay two double crochet so it's all purple done it's got one stitch left which we leave for now put up a nice big loop and then we do our last color that round which is the pink in this case and do the same in the pink so we do two double crochet in the next stitch one and two de Guiche me then one double crochet in the next three one next stitch to stitch three let me end on two double crochet and then again leave a nice big loop bring a nice bigger loop up and there we go that is the end of our next round now that don't see it starting to take shape and then we're back at the beginning again so now we go back to our whites this time we're going to be doing one double crochet in the next five so in the next stitch we did the same thing and we always start with two double crochet we always end with two double crochet so with our white go into the next stitch and do two double crochet one and another one the same stitch - okay it's got two double crochet and this time we're going to do one double crochet in the next five okay so it's going up by two each time we did one then we did one the next three now we're doing one the next five so one double crochet in the next five so next stitch one make stitch two next stitch three next stitch for and next stitch five one double crochet in the next five okay one two three four five and then we end on our two double crochet down two double crochet should be noticing a pattern hopefully two double crochet and again it just leaves us one stitch which we leave for now so that's all white just put up a big loop oops just dropping my yarn on the floor so it slightly a little bit tangle now we're gonna move on to our next color in this case the green you get all green can we do the same thing again we do two double crochet in the next stitch we always starts off with two double crochet one and two in the same stitch then one double crochet in the next five just like before next stitch three next stitch for next stitch five okay so one double crochet in the next five and then two double crochet and that's second to last stitch - okay so that's all green done put up a big loop and leave it then move on to your purple do the same thing again you're getting hang at this point now so two double crochet in the next stitch for your purple and two then one double crochet in the next five one next stitch two next stitch three next stitch for [Music] stitch by then we end on our to double crochet and I'll second to last stitch to double crochet two okay so that's our purple done put up a big leap leave that and then our last cut out which is the pink we do the same with the pink so two double crochet in the next stitch one and two and one double crochet in the next 5 1 to three hi then two double crochet ending on to depreciate one in the same stitch to end on to topic Russia okay and then up it's the end of that round bring up a big loop of our pink so there's the end of that round and you may just put in your tail ends in the middle a little bit we can say those in afters and tighten those up and now we're going to move on to the last round effectively you could just carry on with this pattern and take bigger and bigger and bigger but I'm going to do one more round and then I'm gonna stop so back at the beginning with our white and now I'm back at the beginning because I made a mental note of what color I started with and we're going to do now we do the same thing again we start with our two double crochet so we always start an end with two double crochet one and two we're going up by two so we're gonna do one double crochet in the next seven this time in the next seven so next stitch 1 double crochet in the next stitch 2 next stitch 3 next stitch for stitch 5 next stitch 6 next stitch seven then we end on two double crochet in that second to last stitch just hold on to my green loop two double crochet in that second to last stitch one and okay there's the white so put up a big loop of the white and do the Zaca the same thing for your other three colors and I'll move on to the green making sure my white tie lends out the way move on to the green do the same thing again to double crochet to begin with and one double crochet in the next seven [Music] to [Music] six and seven then in the second to last stitch we do our two double crochet two that lease is with the one stitch finished with our green for now bring up a bigger loop and move on to our next color purple do the same thing again two double crochet in the next stitch all purple and two so increase them one double crochet in the next seven [Music] Oh [Music] six 7 then the seconds of our stitch we do our two double crochet and it seems so there we have finished with we could bring up big loop top rope or and then our last color is our pink so we do the same for our pink I'm getting little bit of a tangled mess so two double crochet in the next stitch with the pink to always start with two double crochet in any put two double crochet then one double crochet in the next seven one two [Music] all right Thanks seven then two double crochet to finish one and another one the same stitch okay and then I know I'm back the beginnings I know I started with whites and it bring up a big loop for the pink and there is the end almost at the very ends and I want to stop there you could carry on and go back to your white and do the same thing again always starting and ending on two double crochet but for the next round we would do one double crochet in the next nine so going up by two got one then we did one double crochet in the next three then we did one double crochet in the next five then we did one double crochet on x7 it's a next row next round would be one double crochet in the next nine the next one would be eleven and so on and so forth but if you're happy with that size and no matter how big you want to make this we need to move on to a finishing around so we're going to go back to our white and what we do to finish just to square off the end is we start with two double crochet in the next stitch so one and another one in the same stitch so he starts off with two double crochet then we do one double crochet in the next stitch just the one then we do a half double crochet in the next stitch just basically work down the stitches single crochet one single crochet in the next stitch just a single crochet and then a slip stitch in the very last finish like so I'm gonna bring up a little bit of a loop there actually we can cut its cuts off white and just bring that through and we've finished with our white let me do the same with the other three colors so Green is next two double crochet in the next stitch it's likely the same suitable crochet in the next stitch okay then one double crochet in the next stitch then a half double crochet dangled half double crochet then one single crochet and a slip stitch a green out the way pull that up there we go it's any time we don't finish on two double crochet so again we do the same for the purple or whatever color you use same again two double crochet in the next stitch okay two double crochet then one double crochet in the next stitch just the one double crochet and a half double crochet then one single crochet then a slip stitch pull that up then we've got one color left of a pink do the same with the pink two double crochet in the next stitch hmm then one double crochet in the next stitch and a half double crochet three one single crochet in the next stitch and a slip stitch in the next stitch to finish cut popping there we go that is all finished swirly granny square like safe and all we need to do now is tie in our beginning and tail ends and to do that show you quickly ears we just take a tail end what I do for these ones is if I go back into that last stitch there's the last stitch you worked that slip stitch into it go back it into there so it's to the back and turn it over and you want to crochet through similar colors so that's going to crochet as I can in one direction putting too tightly then come back in the opposite direction and then just trim the excess like so I'm gonna do all the same for all my other tail ends and then I'll come back and show you the finish it's really granny square you okay and there we go I've tied in all my tail ends and there's all finished swirly granny screen it's quite cool on the back of it actually hmm I put it with the other one they look quite trivial and but I hope you enjoyed that tutorial how you managed to follow along hope it inspired you to try something a little bit different and I'll see you soon for some more crochet fun thanks for watching yet again and please subscribe if you haven't subscribed already and my play let me know what you think [Music] [Applause] [Music]"}
